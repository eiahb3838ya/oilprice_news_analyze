2019-01-22,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] said on Tuesday its debt fell 5 percent in 2018 from a year ago to $34.6 billion, though it remains in default on most of its bonds as crude output has slumped to 70-year lows in an economic crisis. PDVSA, which is short for Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., has not paid interest on most of its bonds since the end of 2017, and together with Venezuela’s government has accumulated nearly $8 billion in late interest payments. It has remained current on its 2020 bond, whose collateral is its U.S. oil refining subsidiary Citgo. Venezuela blames U.S. sanctions for the payment problems. But critics of the socialist government say President Nicolas Maduro’s mismanagement of the economy and the OPEC nation’s oil reserves are the root of the country’s financial crisis. PDVSA’s announcement, in the form of an advisory in a local newspaper, said it owed $24.7 billion to bondholders, down from $25.1 billion in 2017. Two subsidiaries accounted for most of the decline: PDV Holding, which owns Citgo; and the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation (CVP), which manages PDVSA’s joint ventures with foreign companies. While U.S. sanctions bar holders of PDVSA and Venezuela bonds from negotiating a possible debt restructuring, some investors are moving toward legal action to get the two parties to pay. Last month, a group of creditors demanded Venezuela make $1.5 billion in payments on its 2034 bond.

2019-01-22,"(Adds comment by CEO) By Luciano Costa SAO PAULO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Brazil’s new government will support state-run utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA raising capital but whether that is through privatization or another format has not yet been determined, Chief Executive Wilson Ferreira said on Tuesday. Ferreira told Reuters he has begun to discuss how to capitalize Eletrobras, as the company is known, with Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque, but not yet with Economy Minister Paulo Guedes or President Jair Bolsonaro. Ferreira said the capital increase could be done this year. Among the options are selling assets, outright privatization or issuing new shares that would dilute the stake of the state. The previous government tried that but was not able to get a bill authorizing the operation through Congress last year. After the new government took office on Jan. 1, Minister Albuquerque said that the capitalization process will go ahead, but he has not given details. “The decision on how to do this has not been taken yet. What is clear is that the capitalization is necessary, to increase the company’s capacity to invest,” Ferreira said. But he said nothing has been decided on whether to take up the proposal sent to Congress or some other alternative or how much money can be raised from the capitalization. The Economy Ministry will have to be brought into the discussion, he added. Reporting by Luciano Costa; Editing by Christian Plumb and

2019-01-22,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government and utility EDF (EDF.PA) will study the possibility of converting the 1.2 gigawatts (GW) Cordemais coal power generators to burn biomass due to its importance in guaranteeing security of supply, the energy ministry said on Tuesday. President Emmanuel Macron’s government plans to phase out electricity production from France’s remaining coal-fired power plants by 2022 as part of measures to curb carbon emissions and global warming. The government also plans to reduce France’s dependence on nuclear power which accounts for over 75 percent of French electricity needs, while boosting the development of greener energies. French power grid operator RTE, has warned that the plan to shut down some coal and nuclear generators, could leave France, a net exporter of electricity in Europe, largely dependent on neighbors during peak demand periods, particularly in winter. Anxious to guarantee French electricity supply, the ministry and state-controlled utility EDF are studying a project to convert the power station to biomass, the energy ministry said in a statement. It added that the Cordemais conversion project would only be considered under the strict condition that power production from the site would be necessary to guarantee French security of supply after 2022. The ministry said the study would look at the environmental impact and economic viability, while additional analysis would be carried out by grid operator RTE on the security of supply particularly in western France. Trade unions are against the closure of the plant and have been carrying out protests and production stoppages at the units since last year.  The current series of strikes forced RTE to call for the restart of the units when France faced a cold spell last week as power demand for heating rose sharply. Power output at the 580 megawatts (MW) each Cordemais 4 and 5 units was reduced by a nearly 400 MW due to another strike as of 2200 GMT on Tuesday, RTE data showed. As cold weather and snowfall hit France on Tuesday, the country was a net importer of electricity for most of the day, according to RTE data. It was importing around 6 GW of electricity from neighbors Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy and Belgium and exporting nothing at around midday.

2019-01-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is planning a new fund for investors looking to park their cash safely while helping the environment, expanding options for “socially responsible” investments, a filing with U.S. market regulators showed on Tuesday. The world’s largest fund manager told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it wants to launch a money-market fund that will invest primarily in debt from issuers who have better-than-average environmental practices. BlackRock, which oversees nearly $6 trillion in assets, also planned to commit 5 percent of the net revenue from its management fee on the BlackRock Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund, or LEAF, to purchase carbon offsets. Money from carbon offsets generally funds projects that reduce emissions, such as planting trees or trapping methane emissions from waste dumps in developing countries. Money-market funds invest in relatively safe short-term government or high-quality corporate-issued debt. Companies and investors treat the funds like cash and expect them to hold their value, earn income and be available at a moment’s notice. It is rare for environmental factors to be taken into account as part of the investment strategy. In a statement, BlackRock said it would also make an annual payment to help the World Wildlife Fund, a conservation group. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has been under increasing pressure by activist groups to address the perceived social and environmental shortcomings of companies held by his funds.  Because the company’s most popular products are index funds that hold broad swaths of the market, BlackRock has a significant stake in publicly traded companies worldwide that draw ire from investors, including alcohol, tobacco and weapons manufacturers as well as fossil-fuel companies. BlackRock also has a pivotal shareholder vote in corporate-governance matters involving those companies. Last week, a hoax letter purporting to be from Fink claimed the fund manager would require companies it owns to align their businesses with measures to counter climate change. An advocacy group took credit for the fake letter. BlackRock has not asked companies to meet specific environmental standards, saying its role is not to make political judgments on its clients’ behalf. But it has pressed oil-and-gas companies including Exxon Mobil Corp to provide more information about how environmental regulations and related issues could affect their bottom lines.

2019-01-22,"(Reuters) - EQT Corp’s production guidance for 2019 and a plan for increased focus on generating cash flow drew a rebuke from founders of the company it merged with 15 months ago, who said they would challenge the energy firm’s board in an upcoming shareholder ballot. Pittsburgh-based EQT became one of the largest gas-focused U.S. producers when it completed its tie-up with Rice Energy in November 2017. Despite its new scale, EQT’s share price has lagged since the merger - a situation which spurred in December two of Rice Energy’s founders, Toby and Derek Rice, to call for changes.  In response, EQT said it would focus on generating free cash flow that could be returned to shareholders, with EQT Chief Executive Robert McNally telling Reuters it was “highly likely” it would seek to buy back shares in the “near term.” Shareholder reaction to the plan was broadly negative, with EQT shares ending 5.5 percent lower. The sentiment was matched by the two Rice brothers, who said in a statement that EQT’s plan “does not address the fundamental concerns being raised”, and they will ask shareholders to replace board members and install Toby Rice as CEO. A spokeswoman for EQT did not respond to a request for comment on the Rice statement. However, according to a letter sent to the brothers, seen by Reuters, the EQT board said while it was “open-minded” to new ideas and adding management expertise, it questioned the “experience and suitability” of the brothers to be appointed CEO and to the board. The core schism is over how the company develops its assets: the Rice brothers insist EQT’s poor stock performance since the merger has been because the current management has not fulfilled the firm’s potential, while EQT insist the siblings’ projections are inflated and based on outdated market conditions. Under its plan, EQT expects to generate around $2.7 billion of accumulated adjusted free cash flow over the next five years. Adjusted free cash flow in 2019 was expected to be $350 million. Aiding cash flow generation would be $100 million of cost savings, an initiative to trim a further 10 percent of costs across its development program, as well as an up-to-21 percent decline in forecasted capital expenditure this year versus 2018.  The company also plans to sell its 19.9 percent stake in Equitrans Midstream Corp, the pipelines business that EQT spun out in November. The Rice brothers have insisted they can generate an additional $400 million to $600 million pre-tax free cash flow per year under their plan - which has attracted the support of top-ten shareholder D. E. Shaw Group. A spokesman for D. E. Shaw did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2019-01-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of world stock markets fell on Tuesday as concerns over global growth and trade gave investors incentive to look toward safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen and government bonds. Investors shunned risk assets like equities as the International Monetary Fund warned of a dimmer outlook on Monday, China confirmed its slowest growth rate in nearly 30 years, and as Brexit uncertainty continued to drag on sentiment. On Wall Street, stocks took another step lower in the wake of a report from the Financial Times that the United States had turned down an offer of preparatory trade talks from China. Major indexes sold off and both the Dow and the S&P 500 fell below technical support levels at their 50-day moving averages.  Still, trading was volatile in the last hour of trade as White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC the report was not true, causing a sharp move off the lows. “There’s so much in the background - trade, government shutdown, earnings season - you’re going to have these big swings in the markets based on the latest data,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “(Investors) are getting more bearish and less optimistic about the outlook,” Nolte added.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 301.87 points, or 1.22 percent, to 24,404.48, the S&P 500 lost 37.81 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,632.9 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 136.87 points, or 1.91 percent, to 7,020.36.  The benchmark S&P index suffered its biggest daily percentage fall since Jan. 3.  European shares fell for a second straight session, with Swiss bank UBS sinking over 3 percent on disappointing earnings, spelling continued trouble for European banks which lost nearly 30 percent last year. In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF predicted the global economy would grow at 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, down 0.2 and 0.1 percentage point respectively from estimates in October. The downgrade mainly reflected weakness in Europe, with Germany hurt by new car-emission rules, Italy under market pressure due to Rome’s recent budget standoff with the European Union, and Britain’s planned exit from the EU hanging over the bloc as well. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.36 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.08 percent. Bouncebackability  - tmsnrt.rs/2RYxKky The Japanese yen strengthened 0.24 percent versus the greenback to 109.42 per dollar.    The dollar index, which rose to its highest since Jan. 4 helped by safe-haven demand, erased gains after data showed U.S. home sales tumbled to their lowest in three years in December and house price increases slowed sharply, suggesting a further loss of momentum in the housing market. The index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, was flat, paring losses after the Kudlow statement. The slowdown concerns also pushed U.S. Treasury yields lower as investors shifted some cash back into the bond market. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.7463 percent, from 2.782 percent late on Friday. U.S. crude settled down 2.29 percent at $52.57 per barrel and Brent was last at $61.50, down 1.98 percent.

2019-01-22,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz Cars will start producing electric batteries in Jawor, Poland, the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday, as the company looks to ramp up its investments into electric batteries in the coming decade.  “We are very happy that an investor that has been with us for a few years has entrusted us again and in the same place in Jawor,” Morawiecki said at a press conference, according to public news channel TVP. Daimler is already building a plant to produce engines in Jawor.  Mercedes-Benz Cars board member Markus Schafer told the conference that the new investment would create 300 jobs and that investments would total over 200 million euros. Daimler will buy battery cells worth more than 20 billion euros ($23 billion) by 2030 as it readies mass production of hybrid and electric vehicles, the company said in December. The company is one of a number of German automakers expanding in electric vehicles as European regulators clamp down on toxic diesel emissions. The auto industry currently has a range of different battery recipes competing for use in battery cathodes. One is NCA, or lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide, produced by Panasonic and used by Tesla.

2019-01-22,"(Updates prices throughout, adds European shares, data) * European shares follow Asia lower, UBS results disappoint * U.S. futures down after Wall Street was closed on Monday * Brexit plans remain uncertain but UK employment data strong * IMF downgrades world growth forecasts again * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Marc Jones LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Pessimism about global growth drove down world shares and commodity markets on Tuesday and left investors seeking refuge in the dollar, government bonds and gold. The International Monetary Fund’s warning of a darkening outlook on Monday, after China’s confirmed its slowest growth rate in nearly 30 years, continued to weigh on the mood. European shares followed Asia into the red as disappointing earnings from Swiss bank UBS compounded what had been a catastrophic 2018 for Europe’s banking sector, which lost nearly 30 percent of its value over the year. In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF predicted the global economy would grow at 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, down 0.2 and 0.1 percentage point respectively from last October’s forecasts. The downgrades heavily reflected weakness in Europe though, with Germany hurt by new car emission rules, Italy under market pressure due to Rome’s recent budget standoff with the European Union and Brexit worries aplenty too. “We have seen a little bit of a pull back, but whether it’s the IMF growth downgrade or China related is neither here nor there,” said CMC Markets’ senior analyst Michael Hewson. He pointed to the strong rebound markets like Germany’s Dax has seen since the end of December as well as other major global stock markets. “We are at the top end of the range for this year and given the global uncertainty investors are probably taking the view that it is probably wise to take a bit of profit off the table.” Futures markets pointed to another weak start for the U.S. later although the mood had improved a touch since Asian trading with Wall Street futures   last off 0.5-0.7 percent. In Asia, losses had been led by Chinese shares, with the blue-chip index off 1.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei skidded 0.5 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed down 0.8 percent and Sydney faltered 0.5 percent. In another sign of risk aversion, the Australian dollar , often used as a liquid proxy for China investments, eased 0.3 percent to $0.7134, putting it on track for a third straight session of losses. The same worries had also sent copper, used in electrical wires and vehicles, drifting lower in the metals markets. In the currency markets, the dollar held at a near three-week high as investors sought the relative safety of the U.S. currency. That knocked the euro and most emerging market currencies, many of which have had a decent start to the year. Sterling was a shade firmer at $1.29 after data showed British workers’ pay growth hit a new 10-year high and employment had grown by much more than expected in the three months to the end of November. Otherwise traders were still waiting to see whether UK Prime Minister Theresa May can push her Brexit plans through the country’s bitterly divided parliament. May had offered tweaks on Monday by seeking further concessions from the European Union on a backup plan to avoid a hard border between the British-administered province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. But she had also refused to rule out leaving the EU at the end of March without any deal. “Any upside for sterling in the near term may be limited,” said Capital Economics analyst Liam Peach. “Uncertainty would continue during the extended negotiations and there is no guarantee that it would last for only a short period of time.” There was demand too for the safe-haven yen with the Japanese currency last buying at 109.41 per dollar. The euro was near the floor of its recent trading range at $1.1358. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely changed at 96.393. In commodities, the global growth worries pulled oil prices lower with Brent down 55 cents at $62.19 and U.S. crude futures off 39 cents at $53.41. Euro zone government bond yields also fell. Most 10-year yields were down two basis points on the day with Germany’s at 0.225 percent compared to Friday’s one-month high close to 0.28 percent.

2019-01-22,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s president said on Tuesday he was “truly ashamed” of his government’s inability to clear air pollution that has blanketed Seoul and parts of the country for weeks, and proposed an early warning system with China.  South Korea often accuses China of causing much of its air pollution, but China says it is not entirely to blame and South Korea should take more responsibility for its own air quality.         “The people had to suffer greatly last week due to an unprecedented number of days of dense fine dust,” President Moon Jae-in told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “I feel truly ashamed because we are unable to clearly address the issue.” South Korea, Asia’s fourth largest economy, has been grappling with worsening air quality. Last year the government shut down five aging coal-fired power plants from March to June in a bid to reduce air pollution. Moon called for further measures on Tuesday, including reducing the number of diesel cars on the roads, and modernizing household heaters. Moon said regional air pollution is a “disaster” that must be resolved through “creative” efforts and cooperation between governments. “We know that there is a great deal of public concern because of the fine dust coming from China, and because China is also suffering from fine dust, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation to drastically reduce fine dust,” Moon said. A senior Chinese official acknowledged on Monday pollution was a “regional problem” but that South Korea should do more to solve its own problems in large cities like Seoul. While air quality in key regions of China has improved by more than 40 percent since 2013, concentrations of tiny PM2.5 particles in Seoul were steady or rose slightly, said Liu Bingjiang of China’s atmospheric pollution department of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.  “The experiences of many countries shows that in the process of treating atmospheric pollution in a region, the local emissions treatment of large cities is more important,” Liu said at a monthly briefing. “If we blame transmission effects and do not face up to our own problems, we will not grasp those problems and miss the best chance to solve air pollution,” he added. Liu said China was in close cooperation with regional neighbors like South Korea and Japan, and more studies were needed to determine the interaction of pollution between cities. A joint study conducted by the U.S. space agency NASA and South Korea’s National Institute of Environmental Research in 2016 found that about 52 percent of South Korea’s pollutants  originated within the country, while 48 percent came from other countries, including 34 percent from China. Chinese and South Korean officials met Tuesday in Seoul as part of ongoing working-level talks on the pollution problem. An official from South Korea’s environment ministry said a joint study by South Korea, Japan and China will be released in November.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.9 percent on Tuesday, drifting away from a recent seven-week top. Japan’s Nikkei, which had opened firmer, skidded 0.7 percent. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for a holiday so trading was generally subdued overnight. However, equity prices in Europe and Latin America stumbled after the weak Chinese data. “Concerns over slowing global growth are starting to filter through to financial markets,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. Those worries sent prices for copper, used in electrical wires and vehicles, drifting lower. In another sign of risk aversion, the Australian dollar , often used as a liquid proxy for China investments, eased 0.3 percent to $0.7134, putting it on track for a third straight session of losses. “The focus will be firmly on the U.K. once the London market opens with Brexit news still front of mind for investors,” Twidale added. “Brexit remains a major concern for UK markets and progress appears to be limited. With deadlines fast approaching and what seems to be a real impasse between the various sides involved, the prospect of a hard ‘no deal’ Brexit appears to becoming more likely.” Sterling was a shade weaker at $1.2872 as British Prime Minister Theresa May refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. There are few signs she can break a deadlock with parliament after her Brexit deal was rejected last week. May offered to tweak her defeated deal by seeking further concessions from the European Union on a backup plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. “Any upside for sterling in the near term may be limited,” said Capital Economics analyst Liam Peach. “Uncertainty would continue during the extended negotiations and there is no guarantee that it would last for only a short period of time.” Analysts said investors were nervous about building positions in the pound, specially given the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. Demand for the safe-haven yen kept the greenback under pressure with the Japanese currency last buying at 109.41 per dollar. The euro was near the floor of its recent trading range at $1.1358. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely changed at 96.393. In commodities, global growth worries pulled oil prices lower with Brent down 55 cents at $62.19 and U.S. crude futures off 39 cents at $53.41.

2019-01-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Downward pressure on the economy will impact China’s job market, the state planner warned on Tuesday, a day after data showed gross domestic product grew at its slowest since 1990.  The overall job market is stable, although it faces “new changes”, said Meng Wei, spokeswoman at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).  Exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month, while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding.  China’s survey-based jobless rate rose to 4.9 percent at the end of December from 4.8 percent a month earlier, according to the official data released on Monday.  The data also showed China’s overall economy further cooled in the fourth quarter, dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades. Some factories in Guangdong province - China’s export hub - have shut earlier than usual ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday as new business ebbs. “From the viewpoint of ‘changes’, the external environment is complex and austere,” Meng said.  “Within the changes, there is something to worry about, and there is downward pressure on the economy. To a certain extent, the pressure will be passed onto jobs,” she said.  Coupled with the high supply of fresh labor, such as this year’s record batch of college graduates of 8.34 million, the pressure on employment will not diminish, Meng said. China will prioritize graduates and migrant workers in its efforts to stabilize the job market, Meng told reporters. In response to a question on jobs in the internet sector, Meng said new hires remained stable, and no massive layoffs were seen for now.  China’s technology sector is facing challenges on a number of fronts, including tightening government regulations and the country’s trade spat with the United States. China is capable of keep its economy growing within a reasonable range, Meng said.  The Chinese government has recently tweaked its priorities to focus more on infrastructure and exports, as well as attracting foreign investment. Support will also be given to cities that are encouraging industrial growth and upgrading their manufacturing sector. China will encourage foreign firms to invest in its manufacturing sector, she said.  Last year, China approved 189 fixed asset investment projects, including projects in the high-tech, energy, transportation and water conservation sectors, the state planner said on Tuesday.  China added 4,100 km (2,550 miles) of high-speed railway track and six civilian transport airports in 2018, Meng told reporters.  Meng also said China had completed its targeted overcapacity cuts for coal and steel under the government’s current five-year development plan, which ends in 2020.

Adding to the air of caution and uncertainty, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs as trade tensions loomed. The gloomy IMF forecasts, released on the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, highlighted the challenges facing policymakers as they tackle an array of current or potential crises, from the U.S.-China trade war to Brexit. “This is now the second IMF downgrade in a row,” ANZ analysts said in a note. “And while there have been some positive developments in recent weeks, risks remain skewed towards weaker growth, with a ‘no deal’ Brexit and sharper-than-expected slowdown in China getting special mentions.” “Between the ongoing US/China negotiations and the UK’s Brexit impasse, market sentiment will continue to be dominated by geopolitics in the near term,” ANZ added.

2019-01-22,"SYDNEY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Tuesday as concerns over global economic growth stoked fears over future demand. International Brent crude oil futures were down 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $62.64 by 0106 GMT. They closed down 0.1 percent on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.70 per barrel, down 0.1 percent, or 4 cents. “Trade war concerns have reduced global growth expectations and with it comes a lower demand for energy,” said Alfonso Esparza, senior analyst, OANDA. The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts on Monday and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs, highlighting the challenges facing policymakers as they tackle an array of actual or potential crises, from the U.S.-China trade war to Brexit. Also clouding the outlook was data showing a slowdown in growth in China, the world’s second biggest economy. However, oil prices were offered some support in the wake of recent data that indicated major exporters were beginning to curtail production. In the United States, energy services firm Baker Hughes said that energy companies cut the number of rigs drilling for oil by 21 last week, the biggest decline in three years and taking the count down to the lowest since May, 2018 at 852. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)on Friday published a list of oil output cuts by its members and other major producers for the six months to June, an effort to boost confidence in a move designed to avoid a supply glut in 2019.

2019-01-22,"* China involved in 102 GW out of total 399 GW under construction * Total investment amounts to $35.9 billion * China banks lags foreign counterparts in coal divestment By David Stanway SHANGHAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - China has become a key backer for coal-fired power globally, funding more than a quarter of all new plants being developed outside its borders even as it clamps down on the polluting fuel at home, a study published on Tuesday said. The top destinations are Bangladesh, Vietnam, South Africa and Pakistan, and about a quarter of the proposed capacity would use technology no longer allowed in China, the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a U.S.-based think-tank, said. “China is taking very forceful steps to slow down the increase in coal-fired power facilities in China, but is looking to take that capacity and sell it overseas,” said Melissa Brown, IEEFA’s energy finance consultant and an author of the report. China, the world’s biggest energy consumer, has been investing heavily in alternative fuels in order to cut its dependence on coal, a major source of smog as well as climate-warming carbon emissions. It has closed down ageing mines and power plants, with the aim of cutting the fuel’s share of total energy consumption from 69 percent in 2011 to 58 percent by next year. But even as it slashes coal use within its borders, its financial institutions have committed or offered funding of $35.9 billion for 102 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power now being developed outside the country, the report said. While overseas financial institutions like the World Bank aim to restrict new coal investments, Chinese state-owned enterprises and policy banks are becoming “lenders of last resort” for coal-fired power, it said. State firms facing caps on coal production and targets to reduce consumption in smog-prone regions have responded by heading overseas. The Xuzhou Mining Group is now running projects in Pakistan and Bangladesh after closing collieries in eastern China’s Jiangsu province. China is involved in nearly 14 GW of planned coal-fired capacity in Bangladesh and 13 GW in Vietnam, the report said, adding that 23 percent of the 102 GW of China-invested capacity was classified as high-emission “subcritical” technology no longer in use at home. “Ironically, many of the equipment types would no longer be suitable for use in China,” said Brown, noting that many recipient countries “have lower environmental standards and are highly motivated to take investment in any form.” China brought its total renewable and nuclear generation capacity up to 749 gigawatts last year, raising its share of total power capacity from 34 percent to 40 percent in just three years, but Brown said China’s role in financing coal-fired power could overshadow its clean energy contributions. “There are a number of countries that would welcome China as a leading global developer of industrial-scale renewables, but what we’ve seen is that many Chinese companies have essentially exported technology for which there is increasingly no demand in China,” she said.

2019-01-22,"ROME (Reuters) - Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, stoking a war of words between Rome and Paris, said on Tuesday that France did not want to bring calm to Libya because its energy interests there clashed with those of Italy. Relations between Italy and France, traditionally close allies, have grown frosty since the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement formed a coalition last year and took aim at pro-EU French President Emmanuel Macron. A source in Macron’s office dismissed the latest attack as “ludicrous”, while Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte sought to ease the escalating tensions, saying relations between the two countries  remained strong despite a string of recent rows. On Monday France summoned Italy’s ambassador after Salvini’s fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, accused Paris of creating poverty in Africa and generating mass migration to Europe. Salvini backed up Di Maio, saying France was looking to extract wealth from Africa rather than helping countries develop their own economies, and pointed particularly to Libya, which has been in turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that overthrew strongman Muammar Gaddafi. “In Libya, France has no interest in stabilising the situation, probably because it has oil interests that are opposed to those of Italy,” Salvini told Canale 5 TV station. A French diplomatic source said it was not the first time that Salvini had made such comments and that it was probably because he felt he had been upstaged by Di Maio.  The source added that the accusation was baseless and reiterated that French efforts in Libya were aimed at stabilising the country, preventing the spread of terrorism and curbing the migration flows. Italy’s Eni and France’s Total have separate joint ventures in Libya, but Eni’s CEO Claudio Descalzi denied in a newspaper interview last year that there was any conflict between the two firms in the north African state. Salvini is head of the League, while Di Maio leads 5-Star. Both are campaigning hard for European parliamentary elections in May and are eager to show they have broken with the consensual politics of centre-left and centre-right parties. The two men have repeatedly targeted neighbouring France and accused Macron of doing nothing to help handle the hundreds of thousands of mainly African migrants who have reached Italy from Libya in recent years. Asked about the latest diplomatic spat, Salvini said on Tuesday: “France has no reason to get upset because it pushed away tens of thousands of migrants (at the French border), abandoning them there as though they were beasts. We won’t take any lessons on humanity from Macron.” A French presidential source said populist forces in Italy and elsewhere were looking to undermine countries like France and Germany which wanted to strengthen the European Union. “The European elections will be the place where we confront those — as you can see again today with the ludicrous comments from the Italian government — who seek to destroy the European project and the Franco-German partnership,” the source said. Looking to prevent a diplomatic rupture, the Italian prime minister issued a statement praising relations with Paris, saying that Rome merely wanted a debate within Europe on difficult issues such as immigration. “This (row) does not call into question our historic friendship with France, nor with the French people. This relationship remains strong and steady in spite of any political disputes,” Conte said in a statement.

2019-01-22,"(Reuters) - Shares of oilfield firm Halliburton Co (HAL.N) fell sharply on Tuesday after the company forecast lower revenues in key business areas in the first quarter, overshadowing a quarterly profit beat and a pledge to reduce 2019 spending.  Clients in North America, Halliburton’s biggest market by revenue, began pulling back on some drilling services last year amid transportation bottlenecks in the largest U.S. production region and after oil prices slid sharply in the fourth quarter.  An oil glut and concerns about a global economic slowdown have pushed U.S. crude futures CLc1 down about 30 percent since October to around $53 a barrel. The company anticipates mid- to high-single-digit revenue declines in its Completion and Production and its Drilling and Evaluation divisions next quarter.   Halliburton said it will reduce its 2019 capital spending budget by nearly 20 percent to $1.6 billion. Further reductions could be made if market conditions erode, executives said on the company’s fourth quarter earnings call.  Last week, rival Schlumberger (SLB.N) also said it would spend less in 2019, a move that helped bump its shares more than 6 percent. Shares of Halliburton were down 6.4 percent at $30.15 on Tuesday.  Investors were surprised by the extent to which the North American market was continuing to face downward pressure in the first quarter, Edward Muztafago, director of equity research for Societe Generale, said of the share decline.  Although Halliburton beat profit expectations, Wall Street analysts questioned Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller during the call on the lack of investor returns from the oilfield service sector, which has struggled to recover from the 2014 downturn in oil prices. Halliburton’s share price in December fell to its lowest level since 2010. Houston-based Halliburton said revenue from North America fell about 2 percent to $3.3 billion from a year earlier and dropped 11 percent from the third quarter. International revenue rose to $2.6 billion from $2.5 billion a year earlier. It rose 7 percent from the third quarter.   “In North America, the demand for completions services decreased during the fourth quarter, leading to lower pricing for hydraulic fracturing services,” Miller said in a statement. The number of active hydraulic fracturing fleets in the Permian basin fell to 140 in January, versus 192 in June of 2018, a 27 percent decline, according to data from consultancy Primary Vision. Halliburton’s international business “continues to show signs of a steady recovery,” Miller added. The company saw an increase in demand for services in Argentina, which help offset some lower activity in North America.   Halliburton said net income attributable to the company was $664 million, or 76 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $824 million or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 41 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of 37 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Fourth-quarter revenue was largely flat at $5.94 billion.

2019-01-22,"LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates has decided to ban the use of a type of ship exhaust cleaner, becoming the latest location to impose restrictions on so-called open-loop scrubbers, a port document showed. In recent months, many shipping companies have opted to fit scrubbers onboard their ships, ahead of major changes in the use of marine fuel across the world. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) will prohibit ships from using fuels with sulphur content above 0.5 percent from Jan. 1, 2020, compared with 3.5 percent today, unless they are equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems, known as scrubbers, to clean up sulphur emissions. Since the IMO’s rules were adopted, there have been moves to restrict the use of open-loop scrubbers in various jurisdictions. The other types of scrubber - closed-loop and hybrid - are still accepted for use in many locations. Although open-loop scrubbers prevent sulphur emissions from ships escaping into the atmosphere, heavy metals and sulphur end up being discharged into seas with washing water. In a faxed document seen by Reuters, Fujairah’s harbour master said: “Please be advised that Port of Fujairah has decided to ban the use of open-loop scrubbers in its waters. Ships will have to use compliant fuel once the IMO 2020 sulphur cap comes into force.” The document was sent to agents, bunkering companies and oil terminal users on Tuesday. Fujairah is one of the world’s busiest terminals, especially for shipments of oil from the Middle East Gulf. Many shipping companies have invested in open-loop scrubbers as they are cheaper and the decision by Fujairah’s port adds to complications for vessel owners. Acting on environmental concerns, Singapore announced in November a ban on the discharge of “wash water” used in ships to scrub engine exhaust from 2020. China last month banned discharges from open-loop scrubbers across all rivers and ports along its coastline from Jan. 1, 2019.

2019-01-22,"LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire Brexit supporter who revolutionised vacuum cleaners with his bagless technology, is moving his corporate office and tax registration to Singapore from Britain to be closer to his fastest growing markets. The company said the move from Britain was not driven by the looming departure from the European Union or any tax implications. It already manufacturers products in Asia and will build its new electric car in Singapore. Much of its product development will remain in south west England. Chief Executive Jim Rowan said the group was seeing the biggest demand for its products like air purifiers and hairdryers as well as cleaners in Asia. “It allows us to make sure we will be putting our best efforts to secure those opportunities, as well as keeping an eye on those investments, especially EV (electric vehicles) and batteries,” he said. Rowan, who is already based in Singapore, will be joined by other senior executives. He said the change in the company’s overall tax bill would be negligible as a result of the move, and the company was still expanding its research and engineering operation in Britain. The move comes as Dyson said its annual profit had broken through the 1 billion pound barrier for the first time, driven by strong demand in China and other Asian countries. $1 = 0.7741 pounds

2019-01-22,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two ships ablaze in the Black Sea region, leaving at least 10 crew dead, caught fire while transferring fuel mid-sea after one vessel was barred from using its usual port in southern Russia due to U.S. sanctions risk, two sources told Reuters. The vessels, which caught fire on Monday, have the same names as two gas-transporting tankers, the Maestro and Venice, which were included on a U.S. sanctions advisory note last year for delivering fuel to Syria. The U.S. Treasury note, published in November, advised that any dealings with these or other vessels involved in transporting fuel to Syria could result in sanctions. The Maestro was subsequently barred from using Temryuk port in southern Russia by the owners of its only gas terminal, Maktren-Nafta, two industry sources said, where it had previously loaded liquefied petroleum gas of Russian and Kazakh origin for export to the Middle East. The Russian company Maktren-Nafta could not be reached for comment. Vessels can resort to ship-to-ship transfers of fuel — a risky manoeuvre especially if they are transferring flammable fuel — if they do not have access to a port for loading. Temryuk port did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to reach the owners of the vessels.      Russia’s Transport Ministry said the two ships caught fire on Monday while loading gas ship-to-ship mid-sea, during stormy conditions.  Russia permits loading of gas at just three locations in the region - all on-land ports - a source in the ministry said. “All ship-to-ship transfers, especially of such dangerous cargo, moreover during stormy weather and in the winter, raises big questions,” the source said.  The ministry source said they did not know whether the tanker had been barred from the port, but added that doing so was within the rights of the owners of the gas loading terminal. Ten sailors out of a combined crew of 32 were confirmed dead by the ministry’s maritime unit on Tuesday. A further 10 remain missing, presumed dead, while 12 were rescued, it added.  The crew was made up of 16 Turkish citizens and 15 from India, the ministry said. The ships are still on fire and no attempts are being made to put out the blaze due to rough sea conditions, a ministry spokesman said.  Refinitiv data showed Milano Shipping as the owner of the Venice, and Maestro Shipping of the Maestro. The Venice was recently renamed as the Candy, one industry source said. But two traders, separate to the industry sources, told Reuters that both vessels were ultimately owned by one Turkish company, Milenyum Denizcilik Gemi. Milenyum was placed on the U.S. sanctions list in 2015 for arranging the shipment of liquefied petroleum gas and gasoil to Syrian government controlled areas. Phone numbers for Milenyum and Milano Shipping, listed online, were not answered.  On Nov. 20 last year, the U.S. Treasury Department added nine Russian and Iranian individuals and companies on its sanctions list for participating in the shipment of petroleum to Syria. It also issued an advisory note warning of the potential sanctions risk for any entities involved in such shipments which listed 35 ships, including the Maestro and Venice, as having delivered oil to Syria between 2016 and 2018. Reuters reported in December that both the Maestro and Venice continued operations after the U.S. announcement, and regularly entered Temryuk port, according to Refinitiv data.  After the Reuters report, the Maestro was barred from using the port’s gas terminal by its owners, and thereby denied access to the port, the two industry sources said.  But the Venice - now known as Candy - continued to dock at Temryuk, Refinitiv data showed. “There’s every indication that some black scheme was going on,” one of the industry sources said.  “Why else would (the Venice) load up with gas and then immediately transfer it onto another tanker?” the source said, adding that the Venice was likely to have been permitted access to the port as it had changed its name to Candy since the U.S. sanctions note. Since the U.S. announcement, the Venice/Candy has travelled to near the Lebanese and Syrian coastline on three occasions, Refinitiv data showed on Tuesday, while the Maestro has made the same journey once.  The data does not show at which port the vessels finally docked. They appear to turn around before reaching the coast.  Vessels wishing to conceal their location have been known to switch off their transponders and “go dark”.  Though ships are allowed to switch off their signalling systems in certain circumstances, for example for reasons of security, such instances are relatively limited and rare, Richard Meade, managing editor of Lloyd’s List Intelligence in London said. “Both vessels weren’t showing up as live... despite being fairly close to land-based receivers,” Meade said. “This certainly would raise red flags in terms of anybody looking at the accident or criminal investigation.” The Maestro’s signalling system last reported its location on Saturday, when it was located off the coast of Turkey in the Black Sea, according to Refinitiv data. But on Monday, it was near the Kerch Strait, a body of water between Russian-annexed Crimea and southern Russia, which connects the Azov Sea to the Black Sea.

2019-01-22,"CREWE, England (Reuters) - Loss-making carmaker Bentley is on track to be profitable this year but a no-deal Brexit puts that at “fundamental risk”, its boss told Reuters, adding that the chance of Britain leaving the EU on March 29 with a deal now seemed “fairly low.” Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union, the globe’s biggest trading bloc, in 66 days but the government’s negotiated deal was rejected by lawmakers, leaving open the possibility of a disorderly Brexit. The car industry, which employs over 850,000 people in the country, has warned that any tariffs and customs checks would hit firms such as Bentley’s parent company Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) as it both exports from Britain and imports vehicles and components. Bentley, which made a 137 million-euro ($156 million) loss in the first nine months of last year, is undergoing a turnaround under new boss Adrian Hallmark, who said the group is on course to return to the black, but that plan could be undone depending on the form Brexit takes.  “It’s Brexit that’s the killer,” he told Reuters.  “If we ended up with a hard Brexit... that would hit us this year because we do have a potential to get beyond break-even to do the turnaround.” “It would put at fundamental risk our chance of becoming profitable.”  Like other carmakers, the high-end brand is taking steps to prepare, including building up stocks of imported parts from two days to 10 days and building a higher proportion of cars for some non-European markets in the next few months. “We will build more cars for China or the U.S. than we would normally do in the six-month period,” Hallmark said.  Hallmark said he believed the company was prepared and did not plan to temporarily halt output after Britain leaves the bloc on March 29, as planned by fellow automakers Mini and Honda.  “Carry more stock, and it’s a few million (pounds) per year ... If we had to stop production, then that would be a similar value per day,” he said. Hallmark said were three possible outcomes on Brexit: a deal by March 29 which has a “fairly low” probability, no deal with “a degree of unrest and chaos” or an extension to Britain’s EU membership.  German automakers BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen made around 40 percent of the 2.37 million cars sold in Britain last year, with less than 10 percent of the total built in the country. In 2016, Britain was the largest single export market for German automakers, which sold 800,000 new cars there, or 20 percent of their overall global exports.  Of the top 10 automotive plants which export the highest proportions of their output to Britain, seven are in Germany, including Ford (F.N) in Cologne, PSA (PEUP.PA) in Eisenach, Volkswagen in Ingolstadt and Mercedes in Bremen, according to data compiled by LMC Automotive.  Britain’s Brexit negotiators have pointed to the car industry as an example of where the EU would lose out if there were new trade barriers, a source close to the matter told Reuters last year.  VW-owned Bentley, based in the northern English town of Crewe, recorded a 5 percent decline in 2018 sales to 10,494 vehicles, hit by a delay in the arrival of its Continental GT model. In China, sales rose 19 percent. Asked whether the company might move some Bentley production out of Britain to overcome any Brexit hit, Hallmark said he did not see that happening in the medium term.  “You can never say never but there’s no intention of moving what we have to other facilities because of Brexit,” he said. “When we look at new products, are they under question? Of course they are like every product that is in there was under question ... We have to be competitive and we are.”  Reporting by Costas Pitas; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Jane Merriman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-bentley/exclusive-worst-case-no-deal-brexit-puts-bentleys-return-to-profit-at-fundamental-risk-idUKL8N1ZM54P,22 Jan 2019,"Loss-making carmaker

2019-01-22,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco, the world’s top oil producer, is looking to acquire natural gas assets in the United States and is willing to spend “billions of dollars” there as it aims to become a global gas player, the company’s CEO said on Tuesday. Amin Nasser told Reuters in an interview that his company wants to increase its U.S. investments. It already owns Motiva, the biggest U.S. oil refinery. “We have agreed to bring an additional $10 billion in the Motiva refining complex,” said the chief executive, attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  “We do have appetite for additional investments in the United States. Aramco’s international gas team has been given an open platform to look at gas acquisitions along the whole supply chain. They have been given significant financial firepower – in the billions of dollars.” Aramco’s gas expansion strategy needs $150 billion of investment over the next decade as the company plans to increase output and later become a gas exporter, Nasser said in November. [nL8N1Y21S7] Aramco is pushing ahead with its conventional and unconventional gas exploration and production program to feed its fast-growing industries, freeing up more crude oil to export or turn into chemicals. Investing in the U.S. gas and petrochemical sector has become “very lucrative” due to the large availability of ethane resources, Nasser said. “In gas we will be one of the main global players,” he added. Aramco is a major gas player but much of its production is used domestically. The firm plans to boost its gas production to 23 billion standard cubic feet (scf) per day over the next decade, from 14 billion scf now.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude oil exporter, wants to diversify its energy mix and increase the share of its gas capacity to 70 percent in the coming decade from around 50 percent now. Aramco also aims to become a global leader in chemicals with plans to expand its refining operations and petrochemical output. The company is considering acquiring a strategic stake - up to 70 percent - in Saudi Arabia’s SABIC 2010.SE, the world’s fourth-largest petrochemicals maker. Aramco plans to issue bonds in the second quarter of 2019, likely worth about $10 billion, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said this month. The bond issuance could help finance the SABIC acquisition. [nL8N1Z95E6] Nasser said banks were being considered for the bond issuance but declined to identify them.  “Since 2018, we have been preparing quarterly results. We will publish our financial results as part of the bond issuance process,” he said.  “I can tell you that investors will like our results; 2017 was a good year and 2018 was even better. We are trying to close the transaction with SABIC soon.”  Aramco is working with JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on the SABIC acquisition, sources previously told Reuters. The two banks, along with others, were working on the planned stock market listing of Aramco before the move was put on hold. Aramco’s new planned listing date is 2021, Saudi officials have said.

2019-01-22,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - As the rubbish built up on the rubble of Mogadishu’s wrecked streets, Ahmed Abdullah saw a business opportunity. He recruited a team of workers - many of them refugees from Somalia’s long conflict - and sent them out to collect plastic bags, bottles and wrappers to turn into roof tiles and other recycled goods. “They cannot break, you see,” Abdullah said has he threw some of his tiles onto the floor to show their strength. “They are made of the recycled plastics and soil.” Years of fierce fighting in the coastal city have destroyed its infrastructure and left the surviving buildings pocked with bullet holes.  The cash-strapped government is struggling to control a vast, divided country where Islamist militants from the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group still launch regular attacks on the capital. Regular rubbish collection is way down the state’s list of priorities. “A lot of rubbish like plastics, paper bags ... are thrown outside the city,” said Abdullah. When the piles get too big, he added, people start dumping it in the ocean. So, in June 2018, he and others founded their company, Green Plastic. Muslimo Aden Ali said he gets paid 3,000 Somali shillings (4 pounds) for every kg of waste he brings in. “We carry the rubbish on our heads and backs. It is a nice job. We survive on this,” he said.

2019-01-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could safely raise the limit for tremors at gas fracking sites, two seismologists said on Tuesday. Fracking at Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road site in Lancashire, northwest England was halted several times last year after seismic activity exceeded limits put in place under Britain’s traffic light regulation system. Under the system work at fracking sites must be halted for 18 hours if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected. Cuadrilla, the only company to have fracked for gas so far in Britain, has said the current seismic regulations are too stringent and could thwart the industry. “Existing regulations are quite conservative and are set at a level that is unlikely to be felt,” Brian Baptie, head of Seismology at the British Geological Survey, said at a briefing with journalists. He said the limit could safely be raised to magnitude 1.5 since this is a level similar to vibrations caused by a heavy bin lorry going past, and would not pose a risk to buildings or people. “(Magnitude) 1.5 would still be a conservative level,” Ben Edwards, specialist in engineering seismology at the University of Liverpool said at the same briefing. The seismologists warned that raising the limit could lead to higher magnitude so called trailing events, which can occur after fracking has stopped, but said these would still likely be too small to cause any damage. The government has said there are no plans to change the traffic light system. “If we are to take forward what could be a very valuable industry, it is only right that we do so with the toughest environmental regulations in the world,” Britain’s energy minister told parliament earlier this month. Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. It is fiercely opposed by environmentalists who say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They have also raised concerns about potential groundwater contamination. The process also uses huge amounts of water, which must be transported to the site and local residents have complained about disruption from traffic and noise and a potential drop in the value of their homes. The government, however, is keen to cut the country’s reliance on imports of natural gas, which is used to heat around 80 percent of Britain’s homes. Both of the seismologists have advised Britain’s industry regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority.

2019-01-22,"(Adds details on Huawei extradition, graphic, U.S. futures) * European shares follow Asia lower, UBS results disappoint * U.S. futures down after Wall Street was closed on Monday * Brexit plans remain uncertain but UK employment data strong * IMF downgrades world growth forecasts again * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Marc Jones LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Pessimism about global growth drove down world shares and commodity markets on Tuesday and left investors seeking refuge in the dollar, government bonds and gold. The International Monetary Fund’s warning of a darkening outlook on Monday after China’s confirmation of its slowest growth rate in nearly 30 years and amid more head-scratching over Brexit continued to weigh on the mood. European shares had followed Asia into the red with disappointing earnings from Swiss bank UBS also adding extra gloom after Europe’s banking sector saw nearly 30 percent wiped off its value last year. In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF predicted the global economy would grow at 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, down 0.2 and 0.1 percentage point respectively from last October’s forecasts. The downgrade mainly reflected signs of weakness in Europe, with Germany hurt by new car emission rules, Italy under market pressure due to Rome’s recent budget standoff with the European Union and Brexit hanging over the bloc as well. “We have seen a little bit of a pull back, but whether it’s the IMF growth downgrade or China related is neither here nor there,” said CMC Markets’ senior analyst Michael Hewson. He pointed to the strong and sudden rebound that markets like Germany’s Dax have seen since the end of December as well as other major global indexes. “We are at the top end of the range for this year and given the global uncertainty, investors are probably taking the view that it is probably wise to take a bit of profit off the table.” Futures markets were pointing to a weak start for the United States later with falls of 0.8 percent for the S&P 500 and nearly 1 percent for the Nasdaq seen  . Another development nibbling at sentiment was news that the United States plans to proceed with the formal extradition from Canada of Chinese tech giant Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meng, who is also the daughter of Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in early December at the request of the United States over alleged violations of sanctions on Iran. She was released on bail and is due in court in Vancouver on Feb. 6. Asia’s overnight losses had been led by Chinese shares, with the blue-chip index off 1.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei skidded 0.5 percent too, while Hong Kong and Sydney closed down 0.8 and 0.5 percent. In another sign of risk aversion, the Australian dollar , often used as a liquid proxy for China investments, eased 0.4 percent to $0.7123, putting it on track for a third straight session of losses. The same worries had also pushed the New Zealand dollar down for a seventh session and copper, which is used in everything from electrical wiring and water pipes to cars, drifting lower in the metals markets. The dollar held at a near three-week high as investors sought the relative safety of the U.S. currency. That kept the euro pegged back at 1.1360 and reapplied pressure on the main emerging market currencies following a decent start to the year for most of them. Sterling was a shade firmer at $1.2910 after data showed British workers’ pay growth hit a new 10-year high and employment had grown by much more than expected in the three months to the end of November. Otherwise traders were still waiting to see whether UK Prime Minister Theresa May can push her Brexit plans through the country’s bitterly divided parliament. May had offered tweaks on Monday by seeking further concessions from the European Union on a backup plan to avoid a hard border between the British-administered province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. But she had also refused to rule out leaving the EU at the end of March without any deal. “Any upside for sterling in the near term may be limited,” said Capital Economics analyst Liam Peach. “Uncertainty would continue during the extended negotiations and there is no guarantee that it would last for only a short period of time.” There was demand too for the safe-haven yen with the Japanese currency last at 109.40 per dollar. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely changed at 96.393. In commodities, the global growth worries pulled oil prices lower with Brent down 55 cents at $62.19 and U.S. crude futures off 39 cents at $53.41. Euro zone government bond yields also fell, with Germany’s 10-year yields down at 0.22 percent from Friday’s one-month high of 0.28 percent, and Spain’s helped to a near six-month low by record demand at a new bond sale.

2019-01-22,"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (Reuters) - When Wardell Davis landed work with a Norfolk, Virginia, shipbuilding contractor in the fall of 2007, he felt lucky. Then 24 years old, with no high school diploma, Davis had for years bounced between part-time jobs. The contractor, he says, promised better pay for grueling labor: blasting the hulls of U.S. Navy ships with coarsely ground coal particles to remove rust and paint. He recalls the fog of dust created as workers fired the crushed coal – a residue from coal-fired power plants – against the ship bottoms from high-powered hoses, moving through the tented blasting area in respirators and protective suits. A year later, Davis found a better job with a plumbing and heating company. He became a father, but still found time to hit the YMCA most days for a swim, a lifelong passion. Then, in 2011, he began struggling to hold his breath under water; soon, he couldn’t hold it at all. He was dogged by a persistent cough, sweats and nausea. In 2014, doctors at Norfolk’s Sentara Hospital found a “black foreign material” in his lungs. Davis successfully filed a disability claim for “pneumoconiosis/silicosis and/or interstitial fibrotic disease caused by exposure to abrasive blasting dust.” Four years and three biopsies later, Davis survives on a single lung. Unable to work, he lives on disability payments, and has brought suit against abrasives manufacturers and safety equipment providers he alleges failed to protect him. They deny responsibility for his failing health. “If I ever would have thought that this would have happened to me, I would’ve never ever worked there,” he told Reuters, his words punctuated by coughs. “Ever.” Davis was one of an estimated 11,500 shipyard and construction workers who U.S. regulators say are exposed each year to beryllium: a toxic, carcinogenic element laced through the coal waste often used in abrasive blasting grits. These workers lie at the heart of a little-known regulatory drama unfolding behind the Trump administration’s push to relax safety rules it deems burdensome to U.S. businesses. Just after the election, the Trump administration and its congressional allies began moving to unravel key provisions of a federal rule, issued in the last days of the Obama presidency, that sharply limited workplace exposure to beryllium and required certain industries to carefully monitor health risks. Beryllium inhalation has long been known to cause lung cancer and berylliosis, a debilitating, potentially fatal respiratory illness. Yet efforts to set an updated workplace exposure standard had been stymied for decades by debates over what the new exposure limit should be. The Obama rule was based on a compromise developed by labor and industry stakeholders. The Trump administration has left the new beryllium exposure limits intact. But in June 2017, it announced plans to exempt shipbuilding and construction operations from the rule’s “ancillary provisions,” which require air quality testing, new workplace hygiene measures and employee health monitoring for beryllium-related illnesses. That decision, scheduled to take effect in June 2019, would remove the estimated 11,500 workers from the protections, a government analysis shows. A 2016 U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration analysis found that the measures now being supplanted could have saved lives, estimating they would avert four deaths a year in the shipbuilding and construction sectors. The protections would cost affected industries nearly $12 million a year, or about $1,000 per worker, according to the 2016 cost-benefit assessment. That analysis, a mandated component of the rule-making process, put the savings to society from averted deaths and illnesses at nearly $28 million, yielding a net economic benefit of about $16 million a year. Without the benefits of the air testing and health monitoring requirements, the exposure limits for beryllium “are meaningless,” said David Michaels, who headed OSHA for seven years under Obama. “If there’s no air testing or disease surveillance, there’s no way to know how much exposure workers are getting or who may be getting sick,” said Michaels, who now teaches at the George Washington University School of Public Health. At the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees OSHA, spokeswoman Amy Louviere said it would be “inappropriate” to comment for this article because the rule-making process is ongoing. The White House did not respond to interview requests. The Trump administration’s plan to weaken the beryllium rule offers a case study in the renewed power businesses can wield in the regulatory process. In this case, emails and government documents reviewed by Reuters show, a small industry – the manufacturers of coal-based abrasive blasting grit – used a modest $270,000 lobbying campaign and well-placed congressional allies to unwind a rule a decade in the making. “Never in OSHA’s history has the agency decided to roll back worker protections for a carcinogen,” Deborah Berkowitz, OSHA’s former chief of staff, wrote the agency on behalf of the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit workers rights group. The rule’s critics say its provisions for construction and shipyard operations are unnecessary because workers in those environments are already protected by other OSHA safety requirements. Extra costs unfairly fall on businesses, they say. OSHA officials “have a mentality that there’s no such thing as too much safety,” said Ike Brannon, president of Capital Policy Analytics, a consulting firm that advises businesses on regulatory issues. Previously a chief economist for several Republican congressional offices, Brannon says the beryllium rule’s construction and shipyard provisions reflect a broken regulatory system that tends to “discount” business impacts, “like lost jobs or greater compliance costs.” U.S. Representative Bobby Scott, the new chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said in response to Reuters’ questions that the panel will investigate whether OSHA has “valid economic or scientific rationale” to eliminate the beryllium rule’s shipyard and construction provisions. The Virginia Democrat noted that OSHA has routinely included such provisions in other health standards, including a rule on toxic silica dust. By killing those provisions for beryllium, he said, “the Trump administration has created a double standard.” Political push More than a dozen lawmakers ultimately took up the fight to get the ancillary provisions stripped from the rule. All are Republicans, mostly from districts with shipbuilding or abrasives manufacturing operations. Leading the charge: U.S. Representative Bradley Byrne of Alabama, a member of the education and workforce committee who chaired its Subcommittee on Workforce Protections until the Democrats took over the House of Representatives this month. Byrne opposed the provisions out of concern they would kill jobs at Gulf Coast abrasives manufacturing companies, spokesman Seth Morrow said. “Any additional costs could result in layoffs,” he said. In a March letter to administration officials, Byrne noted that the abrasive blasting industry employs more than 400,000 people. The beryllium rule was the last major action OSHA took as the Obama administration wound to a close: It was published January 9, 2017, just 11 days before Trump was sworn in. Lobbying for its repeal began almost immediately. On March 21, 2017, the new administration announced it would delay implementing the beryllium rule in light of “substantive concerns” raised about its effect on the shipyard and construction industries, said a notice published in the Federal Register and signed by then-acting OSHA Administrator Dorothy Dougherty. Dougherty, who retired from the agency in June 2017, declined to comment. OSHA provided heavily redacted versions of her emails to Reuters, which sought them under the Freedom of Information Act. The agency has failed to respond to Reuters’ FOIA requests, filed more than nine months ago, for emails from other senior officials involved in the decision. Dougherty’s notice referenced just one name as the source of OSHA’s concerns about the ancillary provisions: Alabama’s Byrne. On March 13, Byrne had sent a three-page letter to the Labor Department and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, whose agency oversees all regulatory proposals by federal agencies, urging them to scrap the beryllium rule’s ancillary provisions for shipyard and construction operations. The letter sprang from meetings with two abrasive manufacturers in his district, spokesman Morrow said. Both of the manufacturers – the 11-employee Mobile Abrasives Inc and 12,000-employee Harsco Minerals – were members of an industry group, the Abrasive Blasting Manufacturers Alliance, that paid lobbying firms Nixon Peabody and Squire Patton Boggs $270,000 to try to block the safety requirements. The ABMA’s opposition centered on how the rule would affect the market for the coal-based abrasives its members produce. In comments submitted to the Federal Register by Squire Patton Boggs, the alliance said the rule would incentivize employers to switch from coal-based abrasives to alternative blasting materials, without any safety benefit. Harsco referred questions to the ABMA, which declined comment. Byrne’s letter was submitted the same day as those comments. It included passages that were nearly identical to what the Alliance said, in some cases word for word. Other language in Byrne’s letter was nearly verbatim to an article published by a scientist employed by Harsco in an industry news publication five days earlier. Former Patton Boggs senior partner Mark Cowan, a lobbyist who served on Trump’s Labor Department transition team, also became involved. On March 7, Cowan, who served as deputy head of OSHA under President Reagan, attended a meeting at the Labor Department, where Squire Patton Boggs lobbyists asked agency lawyers about OSHA’s plans for the beryllium rule. Cowan later wrote an essay arguing that, thanks to existing safety rules, the workers “were never threatened by beryllium exposure to begin with.” Neither Cowan nor Squire Patton Boggs replied to interview requests. GOP opposition mobilizes Hours after OSHA announced the beryllium rule delay on March 21, 2017, Byrne sent another letter to the agency. This one was organized with Virginia Republican Rep. Robert Wittman, then-chairman of a House subcommittee overseeing Naval programs and infrastructure, and co-signed by 14 other congressional Republicans from the House and Senate. The letter thanked OSHA for the delay but urged it to issue a new beryllium rule that did not include the ancillary safety provisions for the shipyard and construction industries. That same day, Byrne’s re-election campaign received $5,000 in contributions from the Associated Builders & Contractors, an industry group that supports scrapping the ancillary provisions. Byrne, Wittman and others who signed the letter have drawn financial support for years from the contractors and other industry groups with a stake in the rule, including the Shipbuilders Council of America, which donated $5,000 to each lawmaker in the 2017-18 election cycle. Morrow said the two groups had made other donations to Byrne, and that there was no correlation between the donations and beryllium rule. Asked about the donations, Shipbuilders Council of America President Matthew Paxton said worker safety is “the top priority of our industry” and that the council is part of a safety alliance with OSHA. The Associated Builders & Contractors did not respond to interview requests. On May 15, Harsco employees and Cowan attended another meeting at the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Seventeen days later, OSHA announced a second delay in the rule’s implementation. And on June 27, OSHA announced its proposal to revoke the safety requirements entirely. Virginia’s Wittman joined Byrne in raising concerns because he “believed the initial rule could cause potential job loss,” his office told Reuters. OSHA, his office said, needed to reassess “the over-reaching rule.” Mobile Abrasives Chief Financial Officer Matthew Serda told Reuters he did not fear losing jobs. Instead, he said, he sought Byrne’s help to lift the “frivolous” requirements for the shipyard and construction industries because they would disincentivize those companies from buying coal slag. That could compel manufacturers to switch to costlier abrasives such as glass and garnet. The abrasive blasting industries are already heavily regulated, Serda said. “Twenty years ago, when workers were wearing bandanas, yes, it may have been necessary. Nowadays they’re wearing all kinds of protective equipment,” he said. “I just have not seen anyone contracting beryllium disease from coal slag in the 20 years I’ve been working around it.” When OSHA initially announced plans to revise the beryllium rule, it said its previous analyses had not accounted for “compliance with [personal protective equipment] and housekeeping provisions” already required at shipyards and construction sites. That argument ran against decades of OSHA protocol, which held that if significant risk of exposure to a hazardous substance cannot be completely eliminated, “ancillary provisions” are necessary beyond existing protective equipment, said Jordan Barab, former deputy assistant secretary of OSHA under Obama. Morrow, the spokesman for Byrne, said there are no known instances of beryllium-related illness in the shipbuilding and construction industries. That point comes with an asterisk: No one is officially checking for such illnesses, say dozens of occupational health specialists and worker safety advocates interviewed by Reuters. The symptoms of berylliosis – shortness of breath, a persistent cough, fatigue – are similar to those of some other diseases. As a result, diagnosing the malady requires a specific blood test that just a few laboratories in the country perform, said one of the labs, the National Jewish Health Advanced Diagnostics Laboratories. They cost about $300 per person, the lab says. The nonprofit Center for Construction Research and Training, a research arm of North America’s Building Trade Unions that has partnered with OSHA to educate construction workers about health hazards, has researched beryllium exposure. In a series of studies, it found airborne beryllium concentrations of more than 40 times the new permissible exposure limit during coal slag abrasive blasting operations. Other studies by groups including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found beryllium-related health problems in various construction trades. Lee Newman, a beryllium researcher at the University of Colorado, Denver, said he has treated construction trades workers who did demolition work and went on to develop berylliosis. Berylliosis “definitely” afflicts such workers, he said. “To say otherwise is to ignore the published science on the subject,” Newman said. Confounding illness Shipyard and construction workers have sought treatment for lung ailments through the Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics, a network of some 60 clinics specializing in laborer illnesses and injuries. “So many of these cases probably were beryllium disease, but nobody’s ever going to know,” said association Executive Director Kathy Kirkland. Since occupational clinics are equipped to treat common worker ailments, but not to test workers’ blood for beryllium specifically, it is impossible to know how many cases were misdiagnosed as sarcoidosis or other pulmonary diseases. At the Newport News shipyard, a beryllium education campaign is underway, driven by local union leaders such as Allen Harville, former safety chairman of United Steelworkers Local 8888. At a recent town hall, Harville explained the berylliosis symptoms to a hall of shipyard workers. Wardell Davis said he wishes his employer had told him about the health risks posed by coal slag and given him a chance to get his blood tested for beryllium 10 years ago. He now prepares for more tests while pushing ahead on the 2016 lawsuit he filed alleging abrasives manufacturers and safety equipment providers failed to protect him. His suit, pending in Newport News Circuit Court, seeks damages from more than a dozen companies. Temporary laborers like Davis, who don’t belong to a union, are most likely to encounter beryllium exposure, said Chris Trahan Cain, director of safety and health at North America’s Building Trades Unions. Large, unionized construction companies are shifting away from coal slag-based abrasives in favor of alternatives, Cain said. Smaller companies that often employ immigrant workers remain likelier to use them. “My concern is that it’s the most vulnerable workers,” she said.

2019-01-22,"(Repeats story with no changes to text) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Canada’s two major railways are rationing space on trains traveling to the country’s biggest port and recently prioritized some commodities over others to deal with congestion, the latest indication of their struggle to meet demand from new trade deals. That move prompted Canada’s transport regulator last week to start an investigation into rail services around Port Metro Vancouver, after shippers complained of “discriminatory treatment of certain commodities” by Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). Canada is a top shipper of crops, fertilizer, oil and pulp, but has in recent years needed government intervention to keep commodities moving, from ordering railways to clear grain backlogs to Alberta’s crude oil curtailments this month due to full pipelines. Free-trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Nations are boosting demand for commodities, adding further strain to Canada’s transportation infrastructure. Currently, the United States and Mexico account for at least 75 percent of Canadian exports. Both railways last month rationed the volume of traffic around Vancouver by restricting movement of some commodities, such as peas, lentils, pulp and paper, according to shipper notices seen by Reuters. The restrictions, called embargoes, are usually a tool of last resort for railways to ease congestion by temporarily limiting traffic. But in December, shippers allege that CN and CP used them more often than normal, harming some commodity sellers more than others in an effort to push through the maximum overall volume. CP imposed embargoes on three specific transloaders - facilities that empty rail cars into containers for loading onto vessels. These transloaders handle peas and lentils, but were prevented from doing so in December for days at a time, said Greg Northey, director of industry relations at Pulse Canada. The delays caused some containers to miss their vessels, triggering contract breach penalties, Northey said. “It was a total mess,” he said. Embargoes also added costs for pulp and paper producers, who are trying to bolster ties with Asian buyers amid ongoing tariff disputes with the United States. For a second consecutive year, the railways imposed more embargo restrictions on pulp and paper than usual in December, leading to shipping delays, according to the Forest Products Association of Canada, whose members include Canfor Corp and West Fraser Timber. “We can’t do business like this if we want to diversify markets,” said association Chief Executive Derek Nighbor. “It’s just a missed opportunity.” Poor rail service costs the forest products industry C$500 million ($376 million) annually, the association said. December’s problems cost mills as much as a further C$1 million each, it said. Several shippers said the transportation agency will be asked at a hearing in late January to consider whether the railways discriminated against shippers that fill manifest trains - those carrying a variety of products. The investigation could also consider whether the railways violated their common carrier obligations to haul a full range of freight. For CN and CP, the investigation raises the risk of further regulation in an industry where they already complain of too much government control. In a statement, CN said the transportation agency’s investigation should examine the full supply chain and take into account the impact that rain and wind had on operations late last year. CN said freight shipments are up 10 percent from November to mid-January year-over-year. CP Chief Executive Keith Creel said he takes “great exception” to CP being included in the agency’s investigation, adding in a statement that he is not aware of formal complaints. Since the railways’ embargo and permit system was implemented in December to clear backed-up freight, the flow of cars to grain terminals has improved. But it is unclear how the backlog happened in the first place, said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of Western Grain Elevator Association. It indicates that railways have failed to invest in adequate capacity to move goods at peak times, he said. Canpotex Ltd, the offshore sales arm of potash producers Nutrien Ltd and Mosaic Co has also been affected by congestion and delays around Vancouver, spokeswoman Natashia Stinka said.

2019-01-22,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will protect its manufacturing industry from the impact of abandoning cheap coal-fired power, which Berlin is looking to ditch for environmental reasons, its economy minister said. German companies want some protection from the rise they fear they will see in electricity prices when coal-fired and nuclear power plants are taken off grid in coming years, warning that they could see increased costs totaling billions of euros. “We will take clear and responsible steps to compensate energy-intensive companies,” German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told an energy industry conference on Tuesday as a government-appointed “coal commission” gets close to publishing a timeline for phasing out the fossil fuel. The commission plans to publish its findings on Jan. 25 and no later than Feb. 1, including a timeline for when Germany’s last coal-fired power station will go offline. Experts expect that date to be between 2035 and 2040. If Germany speeds up its exit from coal, the extra power costs could hit 54 billion euros ($61 billion) by 2030, a study conducted for the BDI industry association and DIHK Chambers of Commerce said on Tuesday. Germany’s manufacturing industry is crucial to Europe’s economic powerhouse and holds considerable political sway and the BDI, DIHK and BDA urged Berlin to provide a subsidy of at least 2 billion euros a year towards network charges. “Germany’s prosperity largely depends on the competitiveness of energy-intensive companies,” BDA employers’ association Managing Director Steffen Kampeter said, adding that jobs would be at risk from an “overhasty exit” from coal. “We are in our 10th year of an economic uptrend but if power becomes unaffordable, we cannot retain a functioning industrial basis,” Altmaier said at the event, which was organized by business daily Handelsblatt. Altmaier laid out several ways in which Berlin could insulate manufacturers from the increased costs associated with its commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This included extending refunds for surcharges on green electricity to companies, something Altmaier said he expected to be looked upon favorably at a European Commission level as Germany, unlike its European Union neighbors plans to exit all of its nuclear power and much of its coal simultaneously. Prices for consumers would also be protected if Germany allowed more power imports, including from the Nordic countries, installed mechanisms to reduce power demand at times of low supply, and enabled more digital network technologies, he added. Flexible gas turbines could also play a bigger role in power generation in former coal mining regions, Altmaier said, adding that the extra demand for gas could be supplied from Russia via the politically sensitive Nord Stream 2 pipeline or met through new liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals. Altmaier has invited potential suppliers including from the United Stated to a summit in February to discuss the LNG option. But he stressed that Berlin would not be pressured to give up the Nord Stream project, which Washington opposes.

2019-01-22,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Finance Minister Asad Umar is due to announce a package of measures to shore up strained public finances in a “mini budget” on Wednesday that comes only months after the government presented its last finance plan in September. Measures are expected to include higher taxes on luxury items, mobile phones and large cars as well as cuts in import duty for some machinery and raw materials imports to try to boost local industry and help exporters. But the main thrust of the package will be on creating better conditions for investment in an economy struggling from severe pressure on its public finances and facing a balance of payments crisis with foreign exchange reserves sufficient to cover less than two months of imports. “This is not just about taxation measures, it is about encouraging investment, whether in the stock exchange, industry, financial sector or other,” said Khaqan Hassan Najeeb, a senior adviser at the finance ministry. With economic growth expected to slow this year to 4 percent, from 5.8 percent in 2018, a yawning current account deficit and a fiscal deficit set to hit 6.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2019, according to IMF estimates, Pakistan needs to get control of its public finances. “On the fiscal side, there’s more to be done. They really need to find ways to bring the fiscal deficit down,” said Raza Jafri, executive director of research at Intermarket Securities.  Since coming to power in August, much of the government’s focus has been in staving off a balance of payments crisis and it has opened talks with the International Monetary Fund, although there has been no agreement so far on the terms of what would be Pakistan’s 13th IMF bailout since the 1980s. Umar, who was quoted earlier this month as saying there was no immediate need for an IMF package, is due to arrive back in Pakistan on Tuesday from a visit to Qatar with Prime Minister Imran Khan. The visit was aimed at securing agreement to cut the price of liquefied natural gas from Qatar and secure a credit facility to defer payments on gas imports, part of a broader drive to secure financing from sources other than the IMF. An accord with Qatar would follow similar arrangements with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have offered deals to defer payment for oil imports in addition to billions of dollars in loans. High imports of capital goods, many related to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor development project, part of China’s mammoth Belt and Road Initiative, as well as strong demand for consumer goods and energy costs have driven a wider current account deficit. But despite a sharp devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, which has lost about 25 percent of its value over the past year, and a steep drop in oil prices over the past three months, exports have been slow to pick up.

2019-01-22,"(Adds quotes, details) JOHANNESBURG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The World bank forecast higher South African economic growth this year compared with the previous year, but warned of risks such as global trade tensions and poor balance sheets of state-owned companies. The World Bank sees South Africa’s gross domestic product growing by 1.3 percent this year, an improvement from a forecast of 0.9 percent for 2018. Economic growth would be supported by the implementation of structural reforms under President Cyril Ramaphosa such as relaxed visa regulations, the establishment of an infrastructure fund and progress on the Mining Charter, the bank said. In its latest economic update report, the bank projected South Africa’s economic growth at 1.7 pct in 2020. “We believe the reforms are going into the right direction but first they have to be implemented. Implementation is key,” Sebastien Dessus, the World Bank’s programme leader for South Africa told a news conference in Johannesburg. The Bank, however, said South Africa faced risks such as El Nino weather conditions that could impact crop production, global trade tensions and the impact of cash-strapped state-owned enterprises like power utility Eskom on the national budget. “An economy like the one in South Africa cannot afford to have Eskom as a failed entity. What government has to do is to work with the management and leadership of Eskom to figure out the way forward,” said Paul Noumba Um, the World Bank’s country director for South Africa. “The way forward entails different kind of interventions. There is a debt restructuring dimension and at the same time the company itself has to become more efficient.” Eskom is facing a severe financial crisis and Ramaphosa has appointed a team to, among other things, look into Eskom’s business and funding model and how the power utility should be structured.

The International Monetary Fund’s warning of a darkening outlook on Monday, after China’s confirmed its slowest growth rate in nearly 30 years, continued to weigh on the mood. European shares followed Asia into the red as disappointing earnings from Swiss bank UBS compounded what had been a catastrophic 2018 for Europe’s banking sector, which lost nearly 30 percent of its value over the year. In its World Economic Outlook report, the IMF predicted the global economy would grow at 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, down 0.2 and 0.1 percentage point respectively from last October’s forecasts. The downgrades heavily reflected weakness in Europe though, with Germany hurt by new car emission rules, Italy under market pressure due to Rome’s recent budget standoff with the European Union and Brexit worries aplenty too. “We have seen a little bit of a pull back, but whether it’s the IMF growth downgrade or China related is neither here nor there,” said CMC Markets’ senior analyst Michael Hewson. He pointed to the strong rebound markets like Germany’s Dax has seen since the end of December as well as other major global stock markets. “We are at the top end of the range for this year and given the global uncertainty investors are probably taking the view that it is probably wise to take a bit of profit off the table.” Futures markets pointed to another weak start for the U.S. later although the mood had improved a touch since Asian trading with Wall Street futures   last off 0.5-0.7 percent. In Asia, losses had been led by Chinese shares, with the blue-chip index off 1.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei skidded 0.5 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed down 0.8 percent and Sydney faltered 0.5 percent. In another sign of risk aversion, the Australian dollar , often used as a liquid proxy for China investments, eased 0.3 percent to $0.7134, putting it on track for a third straight session of losses. The same worries had also sent copper, used in electrical wires and vehicles, drifting lower in the metals markets. In the currency markets, the dollar held at a near three-week high as investors sought the relative safety of the U.S. currency. That knocked the euro and most emerging market currencies, many of which have had a decent start to the year. Sterling was a shade firmer at $1.29 after data showed British workers’ pay growth hit a new 10-year high and employment had grown by much more than expected in the three months to the end of November. Otherwise traders were still waiting to see whether UK Prime Minister Theresa May can push her Brexit plans through the country’s bitterly divided parliament. May had offered tweaks on Monday by seeking further concessions from the European Union on a backup plan to avoid a hard border between the British-administered province of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. But she had also refused to rule out leaving the EU at the end of March without any deal. “Any upside for sterling in the near term may be limited,” said Capital Economics analyst Liam Peach. “Uncertainty would continue during the extended negotiations and there is no guarantee that it would last for only a short period of time.” There was demand too for the safe-haven yen with the Japanese currency last buying at 109.41 per dollar. The euro was near the floor of its recent trading range at $1.1358. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely changed at 96.393. In commodities, the global growth worries pulled oil prices lower with Brent down 55 cents at $62.19 and U.S. crude futures off 39 cents at $53.41. Euro zone government bond yields also fell. Most 10-year yields were down two basis points on the day with Germany’s at 0.225 percent compared to Friday’s one-month high close to 0.28 percent.

2019-01-22,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s president said on Tuesday he was “truly ashamed” of his government’s inability to clear air pollution that has blanketed Seoul and parts of the country for weeks, and proposed an early warning system with China.  South Korea often accuses China of causing much of its air pollution, but China says it is not entirely to blame and South Korea should take more responsibility for its own air quality.         “The people had to suffer greatly last week due to an unprecedented number of days of dense fine dust,” President Moon Jae-in told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “I feel truly ashamed because we are unable to clearly address the issue.” South Korea, Asia’s fourth largest economy, has been grappling with worsening air quality. Last year the government shut down five aging coal-fired power plants from March to June in a bid to reduce air pollution. Moon called for further measures on Tuesday, including reducing the number of diesel cars on the roads, and modernizing household heaters. Moon said regional air pollution is a “disaster” that must be resolved through “creative” efforts and cooperation between governments. “We know that there is a great deal of public concern because of the fine dust coming from China, and because China is also suffering from fine dust, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation to drastically reduce fine dust,” Moon said. A senior Chinese official acknowledged on Monday pollution was a “regional problem” but that South Korea should do more to solve its own problems in large cities like Seoul. While air quality in key regions of China has improved by more than 40 percent since 2013, concentrations of tiny PM2.5 particles in Seoul were steady or rose slightly, said Liu Bingjiang of China’s atmospheric pollution department of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.  “The experiences of many countries shows that in the process of treating atmospheric pollution in a region, the local emissions treatment of large cities is more important,” Liu said at a monthly briefing. “If we blame transmission effects and do not face up to our own problems, we will not grasp those problems and miss the best chance to solve air pollution,” he added. Liu said China was in close cooperation with regional neighbors like South Korea and Japan, and more studies were needed to determine the interaction of pollution between cities. A joint study conducted by the U.S. space agency NASA and South Korea’s National Institute of Environmental Research in 2016 found that about 52 percent of South Korea’s pollutants  originated within the country, while 48 percent came from other countries, including 34 percent from China. Chinese and South Korean officials met Tuesday in Seoul as part of ongoing working-level talks on the pollution problem. An official from South Korea’s environment ministry said a joint study by South Korea, Japan and China will be released in November.

However, equity prices in Europe and Latin America stumbled after the weak Chinese data. “Concerns over slowing global growth are starting to filter through to financial markets,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. Those worries sent prices for copper, used in electrical wires and vehicles, drifting lower. In another sign of risk aversion, the Australian dollar , often used as a liquid proxy for China investments, eased 0.3 percent to $0.7134, putting it on track for a third straight session of losses. “The focus will be firmly on the U.K. once the London market opens with Brexit news still front of mind for investors,” Twidale added. “Brexit remains a major concern for UK markets and progress appears to be limited. With deadlines fast approaching and what seems to be a real impasse between the various sides involved, the prospect of a hard ‘no deal’ Brexit appears to becoming more likely.” Sterling was a shade weaker at $1.2872 as British Prime Minister Theresa May refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. There are few signs she can break a deadlock with parliament after her Brexit deal was rejected last week. May offered to tweak her defeated deal by seeking further concessions from the European Union on a backup plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. “Any upside for sterling in the near term may be limited,” said Capital Economics analyst Liam Peach. “Uncertainty would continue during the extended negotiations and there is no guarantee that it would last for only a short period of time.” Analysts said investors were nervous about building positions in the pound, specially given the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. Demand for the safe-haven yen kept the greenback under pressure with the Japanese currency last buying at 109.41 per dollar. The euro was near the floor of its recent trading range at $1.1358. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely changed at 96.393.

2019-01-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Downward pressure on the economy will impact China’s job market, the state planner warned on Tuesday, a day after data showed gross domestic product grew at its slowest since 1990.  The overall job market is stable, although it faces “new changes”, said Meng Wei, spokeswoman at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).  Exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month, while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding.  China’s survey-based jobless rate rose to 4.9 percent at the end of December from 4.8 percent a month earlier, according to the official data released on Monday.  The data also showed China’s overall economy further cooled in the fourth quarter, dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades. Some factories in Guangdong province - China’s export hub - have shut earlier than usual ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday as new business ebbs. “From the viewpoint of ‘changes’, the external environment is complex and austere,” Meng said.  “Within the changes, there is something to worry about, and there is downward pressure on the economy. To a certain extent, the pressure will be passed onto jobs,” she said.  Coupled with the high supply of fresh labor, such as this year’s record batch of college graduates of 8.34 million, the pressure on employment will not diminish, Meng said. China will prioritize graduates and migrant workers in its efforts to stabilize the job market, Meng told reporters. In response to a question on jobs in the internet sector, Meng said new hires remained stable, and no massive layoffs were seen for now.  China’s technology sector is facing challenges on a number of fronts, including tightening government regulations and the country’s trade spat with the United States. China is capable of keep its economy growing within a reasonable range, Meng said.  The Chinese government has recently tweaked its priorities to focus more on infrastructure and exports, as well as attracting foreign investment. Support will also be given to cities that are encouraging industrial growth and upgrading their manufacturing sector. China will encourage foreign firms to invest in its manufacturing sector, she said.  Last year, China approved 189 fixed asset investment projects, including projects in the high-tech, energy, transportation and water conservation sectors, the state planner said on Tuesday.  China added 4,100 km (2,550 miles) of high-speed railway track and six civilian transport airports in 2018, Meng told reporters.  Meng also said China had completed its targeted overcapacity cuts for coal and steel under the government’s current five-year development plan, which ends in 2020.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, drifting away from a recent seven-week top. Losses were led by Chinese shares, with the blue-chip index off 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.4 percent and Australia’s main share index faltered 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei, which had opened firmer, was flat. U.S. stock futures, which offer an indication of how Wall Street will open, were down about 0.5 percent. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for a holiday so trading was generally subdued overnight. However, equity prices in Europe and Latin America were hit after data showed a slowdown in growth in China, the world’s second biggest economy. Adding to the air of caution and uncertainty, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs as trade tensions loomed. The gloomy IMF forecasts, released on the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, highlighted the challenges facing policymakers as they tackle an array of current or potential crises, from the U.S.-China trade war to Brexit. “This is now the second IMF downgrade in a row,” ANZ analysts said in a note. “And while there have been some positive developments in recent weeks, risks remain skewed towards weaker growth, with a ‘no deal’ Brexit and sharper-than-expected slowdown in China getting special mentions.” “Between the ongoing US/China negotiations and the UK’s Brexit impasse, market sentiment will continue to be dominated by geopolitics in the near term,” ANZ added. In a sign of risk aversion, the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China investments, nudged down to $0.7155, putting it on track for a third straight session of losses.

2019-01-22,"SYDNEY, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Tuesday as concerns over global economic growth stoked fears over future demand. International Brent crude oil futures were down 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $62.64 by 0106 GMT. They closed down 0.1 percent on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.70 per barrel, down 0.1 percent, or 4 cents. “Trade war concerns have reduced global growth expectations and with it comes a lower demand for energy,” said Alfonso Esparza, senior analyst, OANDA. The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts on Monday and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs, highlighting the challenges facing policymakers as they tackle an array of actual or potential crises, from the U.S.-China trade war to Brexit. Also clouding the outlook was data showing a slowdown in growth in China, the world’s second biggest economy. However, oil prices were offered some support in the wake of recent data that indicated major exporters were beginning to curtail production. In the United States, energy services firm Baker Hughes said that energy companies cut the number of rigs drilling for oil by 21 last week, the biggest decline in three years and taking the count down to the lowest since May, 2018 at 852. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)on Friday published a list of oil output cuts by its members and other major producers for the six months to June, an effort to boost confidence in a move designed to avoid a supply glut in 2019.

2019-01-22,"* China involved in 102 GW out of total 399 GW under construction * Total investment amounts to $35.9 billion * China banks lags foreign counterparts in coal divestment By David Stanway SHANGHAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - China has become a key backer for coal-fired power globally, funding more than a quarter of all new plants being developed outside its borders even as it clamps down on the polluting fuel at home, a study published on Tuesday said. The top destinations are Bangladesh, Vietnam, South Africa and Pakistan, and about a quarter of the proposed capacity would use technology no longer allowed in China, the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a U.S.-based think-tank, said. “China is taking very forceful steps to slow down the increase in coal-fired power facilities in China, but is looking to take that capacity and sell it overseas,” said Melissa Brown, IEEFA’s energy finance consultant and an author of the report. China, the world’s biggest energy consumer, has been investing heavily in alternative fuels in order to cut its dependence on coal, a major source of smog as well as climate-warming carbon emissions. It has closed down ageing mines and power plants, with the aim of cutting the fuel’s share of total energy consumption from 69 percent in 2011 to 58 percent by next year. But even as it slashes coal use within its borders, its financial institutions have committed or offered funding of $35.9 billion for 102 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power now being developed outside the country, the report said. While overseas financial institutions like the World Bank aim to restrict new coal investments, Chinese state-owned enterprises and policy banks are becoming “lenders of last resort” for coal-fired power, it said. State firms facing caps on coal production and targets to reduce consumption in smog-prone regions have responded by heading overseas. The Xuzhou Mining Group is now running projects in Pakistan and Bangladesh after closing collieries in eastern China’s Jiangsu province. China is involved in nearly 14 GW of planned coal-fired capacity in Bangladesh and 13 GW in Vietnam, the report said, adding that 23 percent of the 102 GW of China-invested capacity was classified as high-emission “subcritical” technology no longer in use at home. “Ironically, many of the equipment types would no longer be suitable for use in China,” said Brown, noting that many recipient countries “have lower environmental standards and are highly motivated to take investment in any form.” China brought its total renewable and nuclear generation capacity up to 749 gigawatts last year, raising its share of total power capacity from 34 percent to 40 percent in just three years, but Brown said China’s role in financing coal-fired power could overshadow its clean energy contributions. “There are a number of countries that would welcome China as a leading global developer of industrial-scale renewables, but what we’ve seen is that many Chinese companies have essentially exported technology for which there is increasingly no demand in China,” she said.

2019-01-22,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The death toll from a fuel pipeline explosion in central Mexico last week rose to 91 on Monday as Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) defended its response to one of the deadliest incidents to hit the state-run oil company in years. Hundreds of people near the small town of Tlahuelilpan in Hidalgo state rushed to collect fuel from a gushing duct which authorities said was punctured by suspected thieves, and dozens were caught in the explosion that followed. The blast followed severe shortages of gasoline in central Mexico after President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in late December launched a major crackdown on fuel theft, ordering pipelines closed in a bid to thwart the criminal activity. Some people at the blast site said those shortages had encouraged local residents to try to make up the deficit by collecting fuel from the ruptured pipeline - a version of events that was backed up by officials in the state government. “In part, it was the shortage; people said: ‘there’s gasoline here, it’s free’,” Hidalgo Governor Omar Fayad told Reuters. “‘It’s spilling onto the ground, let’s get it.’” On Monday, a pipeline was breached by suspected thieves a few miles (km) southwest of Tlahuelilpan at the village of Teocalco, but was quickly cordoned off by soldiers, Fayad said. Fayad added that 91 deaths had so far been confirmed from Friday’s blast and that the final toll was likely to exceed 100. Lopez Obrador’s government has come under close scrutiny for its handling of the incident, and questions were raised about why Pemex took so long to shut off the pipeline, having known about the rupture for hours before the blast. A Pemex engineer told a news conference on Monday that at first the leak was just a “small puddle” but later grew into a “fountain.” Within 20 minutes of that assessment, the engineer said, the company was able to “take actions.” It was not clear if those actions included shutting off the flow of fuel in the pipeline. Pemex Chief Executive Octavio Romero said his team followed protocol, though he would not confirm or deny whether there was negligence or corruption related to the delay in closing the pipeline. “Everything will be looked at,” he said. Mexican Attorney General Alejandro Gertz said any negligence by authorities is being investigated and that officials involved would be called in to answer questions this week.

2019-01-22,"HOUSTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union (USW) has made progress on some issues in contract talks with Shell Oil Co, which is the lead negotiator for U.S. refinery and chemical plant owners, sources familiar with the negotiations said on Monday. Many tough issues remain to be resolved at the bargaining table, the sources said. The sources declined to identify on which issues progress has been made or which remain to be resolved between the union negotiating on behalf of 30,000 refinery, chemical plant and pipeline workers and Shell Oil, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc The union is seeking a pay increase of 8 percent a year for each year of a three-year agreement that would take effect when the current contract expires on Feb. 1. Shell has not identified any of its proposals in the first negotiations since a strike in 2015 when more than 7,000 workers walked off their jobs for several weeks. Monday’s message comes after the United Steelworkers said on Friday it had rejected a proposal from Shell for an automatic extension of negotiations when the contract expires. In addition to the pay increase for workers, who on average earn $40 an hour after four years on the job, the USW has said it is seeking improved standards to prevent fatigue as well as additional health and safety representatives, including at small plants. The union also hopes to gain greater protection for pipeline workers traveling to remote locations and performing high-risk work.

2019-01-22,"OSLO (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O), L’Oreal (OREP.PA) and Mitsubishi Electric (6503.T) are among more than 120 global firms which scored top marks in a ranking of corporate efforts to slow climate change. Many companies say they are stepping up action on climate change since almost 200 governments struck the 2015 Paris climate agreement to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting from fossil fuels. But only two percent of 6,800 firms that submitted data made the “A List” of CDP’s index, including Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), Nestle (NESN.S), China Mobile [CHNMC.UL] and Microsoft (MSFT.O). London-based CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, said its data showed the shares of its index leaders tend to outperform on stock markets. Companies are coming under increasing pressure from shareholders to address climate change. CDP said the STOXX Global Climate Leaders index, based on the CDP A List, outperformed the STOXX Global 1800 of major firms by 5.4 percent a year from December 2011 to July 2018. “We think (climate action) is a lead indicator of quality in other areas, especially sustainability and management,” Dexter Galvin, global director of corporates and supply chains at CDP, told Reuters ahead of the index publication on Tuesday. Galvin said it was hard to compare the 2018 results with previous years due to changes in the questions posed. As a result, a company that dropped off the list was not necessarily performing worse, he added.     CDP asks companies to disclose their performance on climate change and separately surveys their efforts to limit water use and to protect forests in its study, which is backed by more than 650 investors with assets of $87 trillion and is meant to spur efforts to protect the planet. Galvin said CDP would in future be bolder in naming and shaming in the report, which was issued to coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Among examples of efforts made by its A List companies, CDP said Danish toy-maker LEGO launched the first LEGO elements made from plant-based plastic sourced from sugar cane. And Korean electronics company LG Display had developed and invested in more than 150 water-related reduction technologies between 2013 and 2017, it added.
