2019-01-29,"SAO JOAQUIM DE BICAS, Brazil (Reuters) - Miles (km) downstream from where a dam owned by miner Vale SA burst on Friday, killing hundreds, a small indigenous village in Brazil faces doubts about its very existence as the river at the center of life here runs dark with mining waste. For members of the Pataxo-Hahahae tribe living at the end of a sinuous dirt road, fish from the Paraopeba River are the principal source of food. Villagers bathe and wash their clothes in its waters.  But after a tailings dam at Vale’s Corrego do Feijao mine burst upstream, burying communities and turning the river’s once-clear waters a muddy brown, the 80 or so residents of the Pataxo-Hahahae village of Nao Xoha say they are unsure if they will be forced to uproot their families. While there were no Pataxo-Hahahae among the 65 confirmed dead or 279 disappeared, the disaster, they fear, could be the end of their way of life. “On Thursday, I was here washing my clothes, bathing with my children, and now I can’t even touch the river,” said Sot de Ionara Pataxo Hahahae, holding back tears. “Our hearts are so sad knowing that nothing can be done.” The Pataxo-Hahahae’s plight comes as Brazil’s current government, which took office earlier in January, has signaled it wants to cut mining regulations and shrink protections currently afforded to indigenous communities. For critics, the  dam burst reveals the danger of both policies. Brazil’s indigenous affairs agency Funai said it is committed to helping Nao Xoha, by ensuring potable water among other measures. But in the wake of the disaster, trust in the authorities here is low. “You think some mining company is worried about this? Do you think some mayor is worried about this area?” asked Sot de Aigoho Pataxo Hahahae. “They only love money - and mining.” Reporting by Leonardo Benassatto and Adriano Machado; Writing by Gram Slattery; Editing by Sandra Maler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/vale-sa-disaster-indigenous/indigenous-village-faces-existential-threat-from-brazil-dam-burst-idUKL1N1ZT0WI,29 Jan 2019,"Miles (km)

2019-01-29,"(Reuters) - New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday ordered state officials to develop regulations to reduce methane emissions from its oil and gas industry and separately rollback statewide greenhouse gas output over the next decade.  The New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department and Environment Department were directed to enact methane emission reduction “rules as soon as practicable,” the executive order said. Lujan Grisham, a recently-elected Democrat, campaigned on the promise of tightening environmental guidelines for the southwestern state’s fossil fuels sector.  As home to part of the booming Permian Basin oil hub, New Mexico has doubled its oil output in recent years to become one of the top crude-producing states. In her executive order, the governor also formed a task force to develop a plan to curb the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent from 2005 levels by the year 2030. The group is set to release its initial recommendations by Sept. 15.  Additionally, Lujan Grisham announced New Mexico has joined a group of governors, known as the U.S. Climate Alliance, electing to uphold the Paris climate agreement despite President Donald Trump’s decision to remove the United States from the pact. Also on Tuesday, a New Mexico lawmaker filed legislation, backed by Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard, to increase the royalty rate on 9 million acres of state land.  The bill would increase the state’s typical 12.5 to 20 percent royalty to match Texas’ 25 percent royalty, though it would target only the top performing wells. The higher royalty rate would kick in for oil wells when production reaches 20,000 barrels per month. The bill would also require companies to pay royalties when natural gas is flared or vented - something that is common when new oil wells come online but gas pipelines are not in place. Garcia Richard’s office noted in a news release that the state loses around $1 million per month on unpaid royalties due to venting and flaring. The bill would only impact new oil and gas leases that the state negotiates.

2019-01-29,"Jan 29 (Reuters) - The United States imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry on Monday, looking to cut off President Nicolas Maduro’s primary source of revenue. The sanctions limit transactions between U.S. companies that do business with Venezuela through purchases of crude oil and sales of refined products. However, there are currently numerous unanswered questions about the sanctions. The United States is aiming to freeze sale proceeds from Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA’s exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to the United States. There is also a prohibition on U.S firms exporting diluents - unfinished oils used for blending extra heavy crude - to Venezuela. Venezuela exports oil primarily to the United States, India, and China, as well as some other nations. Only the United States and India are notable sources of cash, as Russian and Chinese firms currently get shipments of crude through complicated oil-for-loan agreements due to Venezuela’s heavy liabilities with those countries. The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions do not entirely cut off purchases of Venezuelan oil by U.S. refineries. However, they stipulate that refiners cannot make payments directly to PDVSA, but into escrow accounts that PDVSA will not be able to access until the company is controlled by a new government. Maduro and Manuel Quevedo, who is both oil minister and head of PDVSA, have said that they will not allow vessels loaded with crude oil for the United States to leave the country’s ports without being prepaid. PDVSA on Tuesday said it was considering declaring force majeure on cargoes bound for the United States. For now, companies can do business but with restrictions. Refineries that import from Venezuela can continue to receive shipments for the next few months before they are forced to shift their supply sources elsewhere. However, since payments cannot be made to PDVSA, this is expected to restrict the flow of crude oil from Venezuela to the United States. The sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with PDVSA that began in recent years with customers including PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum, India’s Reliance and Russia’s Rosneft. Chevron Corp, Halliburton, Schlumberger , Baker Hughes and Weatherford International all have operations in Venezuela, and are allowed to continue to engage in transactions and activities with PDVSA and its joint ventures through July 27. This could cause Venezuela’s production to fall further later this year if service companies, which have already reduced operations, finally leave the country. Citgo Petroleum is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA and operates refining capacity to process about 750,000 bpd. It also distributes fuel to gasoline stations throughout the United States, accounting for about 4 percent of the nation’s retail fuel market. The United States has exempted Citgo from its sanctions until July 27. However, previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits, which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends. As of September, the company had about $500 million in cash and a credit line of approximately $900 million, according to a creditor familiar with the company’s financial statements. Citgo is able to keep importing crude oil from PDVSA for three more months, according to the sanctions. The sanctions expressly prohibit sales of diluents (heavy naphtha) to PDVSA, which are used for making the country’s extra heavy crude oil ready for export. The OPEC member’s oil production has dwindled in the last two decades, from more than 3 million bpd at the beginning of the century to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million bpd by late 2018. Most of the crude it produces now is heavy or extra heavy. Venezuela and PDVSA are estimated to owe more than $100 billion to bondholders, suppliers, allied governments, lenders and creditors holding judgments. Some creditors have gone to U.S. courts to try to seize Citgo to satisfy their legal claims. Reporting By David Gaffen, Luc Cohen, Marianna Parraga,

2019-01-29,"SEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - South Korea’s purchases of U.S. oil and gas this year will hold to the rapid pace set in 2018, likely narrowing its trade surplus with the world’s top economy further and bolstering its ties to Washington.  South Korea is expected in January and February to import at least 18 million barrels of crude oil and 900,000 tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, according to trade flow data from Refinitiv Eikon.  That’s a four-fold increase on oil from a year earlier and a slight drop on LNG, indicating the record U.S. crude and LNG volumes heading into South Korea in 2018 are set to continue, supported by favorable market conditions brought about by increasing oil and gas output in the United States.  The jump in South Korea’s U.S. oil and gas imports comes as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push to reduce trade deficits with the United States’ major trading partners by selling more to them than it buys. U.S. oil and LNG exports are a key part of this strategy.  “At the moment, the trend (of importing U.S. crude) will stay ... The economics for U.S. crude is a little bit better than Middle East and North Sea oil,” said a South Korean refining source who declined to be named due to company policy.  Record U.S. crude oil and LNG volumes flowed into South Korea in 2018, while supplies from the Middle East were tightened amid OPEC-led output cuts and a re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude, LNG shipments to South Korea - tmsnrt.rs/2TinYHp) The United States was South Korea’s sixth-biggest crude supplier last year, its highest ranking ever as it overtook Iran and Russia. It also became South Korea’s third-largest LNG supplier, while South Korea was the top importer of U.S. LNG.  South Korea’s U.S. oil and gas imports more than quadrupled in value to $6.75 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017, according to the country’s customs data.   The U.S. oil import value of $4.5 billion alone was more than six times the $725 million taken in U.S. oil in 2017.  “Buying more U.S. oil and gas was part of (Seoul’s) strategy as our wide trade surplus against the United States was grounds for revising the Korea-U.S. free trade deal,” said Je Hyun-jung, director at the Korea International Trade Association.  South Korea’s 2018 trade surplus with the United States at $13.86 billion was the lowest since 2011, down 22.4 percent from $17.86 billion a year earlier, the customs data showed.  In 2017, Trump threatened to renegotiate or scrap what he called a “horrible” bilateral trade deal that had doubled the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea since 2012.  The two countries agreed to revise the deal last year, with Seoul capping its steel exports to the United States to avoid hefty tariffs and giving greater market access to U.S. carmakers. The revision took effect on Jan. 1.  Tilak Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co, said improving trade ties between South Korea and the United States will also support their shared goal of North Korea’s denuclearisation. “Any help from the United States regarding North Korea is critical, so good trade relations will help. It also helps South  Koreans to protect their exports to the United States by pointing to their (U.S.) energy imports,” Doshi said.  (GRAPHIC: South Korea's trade surplus with the United States - tmsnrt.rs/2SewTw3) South Korea imports nearly all of its energy. It is the world’s fifth-largest crude and third-largest LNG importer, typically taking 80 percent of its oil and more than 40 percent of its LNG from the Middle East.  In 2018, as U.S. oil flows grew, though, the Middle East’s share of South Korean crude imports dropped to 73.5 percent, the lowest since 2002.  While it’s not certain freight rebates for non-Middle East crude imports - part of South Korea’s diversification push - will continue, higher U.S. crude output and wider discounts for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) will make U.S. oil attractive to South Korean buyers looking for cheaper sources outside their traditional suppliers.  GS Caltex, South Korea’s No.2 refiner, bought 10 million barrels of U.S. crude, mainly WTI Midland and Mars, for arrival over January-February, said a company spokesman, as U.S. oil has became more price competitive.  South Korea’s hunt for condensate to replace Iranian supplies is also expected to intensify later this year as waivers from U.S. sanctions start to expire in May.  South Korea buys U.S. oil mostly on a spot basis. It buys U.S. LNG primarily on a long-term basis via a 20-year term contract that state-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) has with Cheniere.  Two South Korean private power companies - GS EPS and SK E&S - are also set to take U.S. LNG from 2019 and 2020, respectively, under their own 20-year contracts with Cameron LNG and Freeport LNG.  U.S. LNG’s share of South Korea’s energy mix will grow as the Asian importer switches away from nuclear and coal to renewables and LNG for power, said Tim Boersma, director of Global Natural Gas Markets at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.  “The Korean decision to put more emphasis on LNG as a fuel of its future may well continue, given the growing role of U.S. companies in this market,” Boersma said.

2019-01-29,"(Adds Shell comment, details, background) HOUSTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union (USW) warned on Tuesday that time was running out to reach a new national agreement for U.S. refinery and chemical plant workers before the current pact expires on Friday, sources familiar with the talks said. The USW and Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, have been in talks since Jan. 16 for an accord on wages, benefits and safety covering 30,000 refinery, chemical plant and pipeline workers. A message sent to union members noted that less than 60 hours remain to reach a new agreement. The current contract expires shortly after 12 a.m. on Friday, the sources said. The message also said Shell needed to “get serious about economics and our other issues,” the sources said. Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said the company was working for an agreement with the union. “We continue actively working through numerous topics to reach an agreement with the USW International Union that best ensures opportunity for our workers to continue to grow, develop and enjoy earnings that are among the most competitive in the manufacturing industry,” Fisher said. The USW has said the talks will not be automatically extended past the contract’s expiration. These are first talks since a breakdown in negotiations in 2015 led to a series of rolling strikes in which more than 7,000 workers walked off their jobs at 12 refineries and three chemical plants. Most strikes ended within two months. The sources said the chances for a national strike had increased slightly because of slow paced negotiations. Going into talks, both sides said they wanted to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This year’s negotiations made progress early on union proposals to increase health and safety representation at plants, according to the sources, but have bogged down over a USW proposal to begin replacing non-union workers who perform maintenance work with union members by 10 percent a year. The union is seeking an 8-percent-a-year pay increase for hourly workers under a new three-year contract. U.S. refinery workers make about $40 an hour after four years on the job.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to fast-track the construction of the new refinery in Dos Bocas, Tabasco, to boost lagging domestic production of gasoline and diesel, and wean the country from a growing dependence on imported fuels. “It will be a restricted auction because we’re going to invite serious, specialized companies,” Nahle said at an energy conference in Mexico City. The minister, who also serves as president of the Pemex board of directors, added that the invitation-only process will allow the government to prohibit the participation of international firms that have “histories of corruption.” Nahle did not say when the Pemex auction would be conducted, or which firms were being considered. Pemex’s recently approved 2019 budget allocates almost $2.5 billion for the refinery, which aims to be able to process 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude. Lopez Obrador has said that the total price tag for the facility will be approximately $8 billion, and would mark Pemex’s seventh domestic oil refinery. The company also has a 50 percent stake in the Deer Park refinery in Texas operated by partner Royal Dutch Shell.

2019-01-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices gained more than 2 percent on Tuesday after the United States imposed sanctions on state-owned Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, a move likely to reduce the OPEC member’s crude exports and relieve some global oversupply worries.  International Brent crude oil futures were up $1.39 to settle at $61.32 a barrel, a 2.32 percent rise, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased $1.32, or 2.54 percent, to settle at $53.31 a barrel. Venezuela is among the world’s largest heavy crude oil producers, and the United States has been its biggest client, taking about half the country’s export volumes..  The Trump administration’s restrictions on Venezuelan crude, aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro from power, stop short of banning U.S. companies from buying oil from the Latin American country. However, proceeds from such sales will be put in a “blocked account” that should deter PDVSA from shipping crude to the United States. “Today’s price advance looked like a delayed reaction to yesterday’s Venezuelan headlines as traders may have had second thoughts about the impact on domestic oil supplies,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.  Additionally, “possibilities that some Gulf Coast refiners may need to pay up for alternative stocks from such places such as Saudi Arabia that has already suggested that they will be steering cargoes away from the U.S.,” he wrote. Venezuela’s exports fell to little more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 from 1.6 million bpd in 2017, according to Refinitiv ship-tracking data and trade sources. Petromatrix estimated that Venezuelan exports will drop by about 500,000 barrels per day under current conditions.  Venezuela is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is implementing a supply cut deal to support prices. Russia, OPEC’s biggest non-member ally, and China have both publicly denounced the U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, Libya’s biggest oilfield, El Sharara, will remain shut until departure of an armed group occupying the site, the head of National Oil Corp said. Despite some tightening, global oil supply remains high, largely because of a more than 2 million bpd increase in U.S. crude oil production last year to a record 11.9 million bpd. U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels last week compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday after prices settled. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s crude and gasoline inventory data will be released on Wednesday.  Some in the oil industry also worry that crude demand could stutter if the trade war between Washington and Beijing slows global economic growth. In China, a top oil importer, signs of a slowdown have emerged. Activity in its vast manufacturing sector is expected to shrink for the second straight month in January, a Reuters poll showed.

2019-01-29,"(Adds oil market comment from Energy Department) WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering tapping the U.S. emergency reserve of crude as it imposes new sanctions on Venezuela’s oil business, but no decision has been made, a U.S. government source said on Tuesday. The administration on Monday imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA, aimed at pressuring socialist President Nicholas Maduro to step down. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a series of underground caverns on the coasts of Louisiana and Texas, currently holds 649.1 million barrels of crude, about 396 million of which is classified as sour oil, the rest being sweet. Sour has more sulfur in it and requires more processing. A release is likely not imminent, but the reserve’s role is often a consideration when the administration looks at the global oil market balance, as it holds more oil than required under international agreements, said the government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under law, the Department of Energy can do a test sale of up to 5 million barrels, or larger releases to loan oil to refiners, while the president can order drawdowns to counter severe supply interruptions. But the reserve mostly lacks the kind of heavy oil supplied by OPEC member Venezuela and used by PDVSA’s U.S. refining arm Citgo, Valero Energy Corp and Chevron . In coming months the Energy Department could announce a sale of oil from the reserve, mandated by laws signed by former President Barack Obama to fund the federal government and a medical program. Last year the department held two such sales, releasing about 18 million barrels. An energy analyst discounted the effectiveness of using the reserve as a way to protect against any price spikes. “I’m not sure a mandated sale or even a new auction really helps the refiners affected, an auction would just price up the oil,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in late September ahead of congressional elections and the reimposition of sanctions on Iran that the administration was not considering a release from the reserve, and that a release would have a “fairly minor and short-term impact.” Dan Brouillette, the Energy Department’s deputy secretary, said on Twitter his agency was confident energy markets will remain supplied despite reduced imports of Venezuelan oil. “Over the next few years, global oil supply is expected to exceed demand & U.S. production is forecasted to increase an all-time high of 12M barrels per day,” he said. Analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners said if the sanctions forced U.S. refiners to look for other sources they could likely get some of the oil from Canada. A spokesman for the National Security Council said the administration would not comment on deliberations about Venezuela. The Department of Energy did not comment.

2019-01-29,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s revenues from oil sales to the United States have come under severe threat as sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm has sent U.S. buyers scrambling for replacements.  The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, to cripple the OPEC member’s oil shipments, which account for nearly all of Venezuela’s exports, in response to the reelection of socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a vote widely viewed as fraudulent.      Washington has recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s head of state.      U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela’s heavy crude are turning to domestic sour crude grades to offset the impact, sending prices to the strongest in about five years, traders said. Other potential alternatives from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America are hard to secure amid slowing production, limited spare capacity and transportation bottlenecks, traders said. Broader oil futures prices found some support on news of sanctions but the market reaction was largely muted as a lack of investment, mismanagement and fleeing workers have already driven the OPEC-member’s oil production to the lowest in almost seven decades. [O/R] PDVSA is seeking to sidestep Trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, four sources involved in the talks said. The United States is Venezuela’s biggest oil customer, importing, on average, about 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  “The region with the biggest shortfall of Venezuelan crudes, either through sanctions or inadvertently through further production declines is the U.S.,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a note.    For an interactive graphic on top importers of Venezuelan crude, see: tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E.    The Trump administration sanctions allow U.S. companies to buy Venezuelan oil, but the proceeds of such sales will be put in a “blocked account.”  Because of this, PDVSA is likely to quickly stop shipping much crude to the United States, its top client. Overnight, Maduro said cargoes loaded for the United States that had not already been paid for could not depart. “There’s going to be appetite around the world to take Venezuelan oil,” Zachary Rogers, an oil markets analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie said. Venezuela will likely be forced to offer steep discounts and increase shipments to Russia, China and India to try and make up for lost revenues from its top market, traders and analysts said. Its output has been cut in half since 2016 to near 70-year lows to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources, due to a major cash crunch. As a result, the U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years, with more shipments going to Russia and China made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures. Venezuela can prioritise exports to Asia, but it is the most competitive battleground on the planet, RBC Capital’s Tran said, adding that while they remain the second largest market for Venezuelan crudes, the Chinese have also tapered its buying from Caracas over the past two years. For an interactive graphic on Venezuelan crude exports to the United States, see: tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB.   Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments, according to a Barclays research note published earlier this month.  Citgo Petroleum, the U.S. refining arm of PDVSA and the biggest importer of Venezuelan crude, did not reply to a request for comment. The other primary importers Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp said they will comply with U.S. laws. Though the United States is the top oil producer with output of nearly 12 million bpd, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply substitute it with light crude. The easiest substitute for now is domestic sour grades. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and West Texas Sour crude WTC-WTS have risen as buyers scramble for supply.  On Tuesday, Mars crude traded at about $6 a barrel premium to the U.S. crude futures benchmark, up from a $5.20 a barrel premium on Monday and remained near a five-year high, traders said, while West Texas Sour was near the strongest level in a year. “It’s nuts. Everything with sulphur in it is getting bid,” said one U.S. crude trader said, referring to crude’s sulphur content that is known in the market as “sour grades.” Some traders said much of the impact had already been priced in. “I actually think it may end up being bearish medium to longer term ... If Guaido takes power and foreign investment flows into Venezuela, then their production has a lot of room to go back up over time,” a trader at a merchant said. Currently, alternatives to Venezuela’s heavy sour crudes are becoming increasingly scarce in the Americas, due to challenges facing heavy crude producers Canada and Mexico.  Canada produces more than 4 million bpd, much of it heavy crude that could replace Venezuelan grades, but pipeline bottlenecks are hampering its exports.  “Until the ongoing (Canadian) pipeline issues are addressed, crude by rail is simply not as scalable as increased shipments from Mexico or Iraq,” said Tran. However, Mexico’s crude output levels are among the lowest on record dating back several decades as its top-producing fields have aged, and new ones to replace them have not been developed. The Trump administration is considering tapping the country’s emergency reserve of crude as it imposed sanctions on PDVSA, but no decision has been made, a U.S. government source said. The reserve currently holds 649.1 million barrels of crude, about 396 million of which is classified as sour oil.

2019-01-29,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA is seeking to sidestep Trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, four sources involved in the talks said. The U.S. government issued an executive order on Monday freezing PDVSA assets and requiring U.S. firms to pay for PDVSA oil using accounts controlled by the country’s congress head and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido. The sanctions were aimed at pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro into stepping down.  PDVSA began calling customers ahead of the sanctions, urging them to swap foreign fuel and other products for its Venezuelan crude cargoes, the sources said. It is also considering asking trading houses to act as intermediaries for a portion of its oil sales to indirectly supply customers in the United States and elsewhere.  “We are trying to redo the contracts. It is not yet entirely clear how because customers are being individually called, but we are studying alternatives,” said a PDVSA source familiar with the efforts.  It was unclear on Tuesday whether the approach of using intermediaries or swaps would avoid violating U.S. sanctions, the sources said.  Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of Venezuela’s export revenue. Falling output, corruption and mismanagement have battered the nation’s economy, leading to hyperinflation and malnutrition that have prompted some 3 million people to leave the country.  The South American country exports 1.25 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, including 500,000 bpd to the United States, and imports over 200,000 bpd of refined products, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The imports from the United States are crucial for Venezuela’s production of diluted crude oil (DCO), as they use heavy naphtha to dilute Venezuela’s extra heavy crude and produce oil ready for export. Industry traders on Tuesday said that U.S. refineries were making inquiries to replace those shipments from other countries. World oil futures rose by more than 2 percent on Tuesday, but the market has not seen panicked buying as a result of the U.S. decision to target Venezuela’s oil output, particularly as the country’s production was already near seven-decade lows.  Washington said on Monday proceeds from PDVSA’s sales to companies in the United States will be frozen until a new government can take control of the accounts.  The sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with PDVSA that began in recent years with customers including PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum, India’s Reliance and Russia’s Rosneft. Oil firms that had sent tankers to Venezuela to lift crude bound for the United States were ordered by PDVSA on Monday to pay for cargoes before departure, sources told Reuters. But such prepayment could violate the sanctions, setting the stage for a standoff at Venezuelan ports. Regular buyers of Venezuelan crude, especially in the United States, have started hunting for alternative supplies of heavy oil, a difficult task as other Latin American exporters from Mexico to Colombia do not have surplus capacity.    PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Several U.S. refiners, including Chevron Corp, Phillips 66 and Valero Energy said they were studying the sanctions and would comply with U.S. laws. Valero, the second-largest buyer of Venezuelan crude after Citgo, said it will “re-optimize” its crude supply.  Washington’s fast action on Venezuela and efforts by Maduro’s government to defend its grip on PDVSA have sent shockwaves around the world, triggering angry responses from China and Russia. Swaps and three-way trades have become routine due to PDVSA’s oil-for-loan pacts and U.S. sanctions first imposed in 2017, according to internal PDVSA documents and trading sources. The Caracas-based company’s barrels typically go through several hands before reaching a refinery. Its fuel imports mostly come from swaps, according to PDVSA’s internal documents and Refinitiv Eikon data. PDVSA approached an Indian refiner seeking to modify terms of its contracts, including adding partial payment in the form of refined products through swaps, a source from the refining company said. With other customers, payments in medicines or food for settling outstanding balances also are on the table, one of the PDVSA sources said. India’s Reliance and Nayara Energy, partially owned by Rosneft, did not respond to emails requesting comment. Swaps are one response to U.S. sanctions, but dealing with traders for triangulating Venezuelan oil sales could be PDVSA’s last resort as intermediaries make a profit from buying cheap barrels, storing them and then offering them to refiners. “Traders buy our oil at obscene prices,” the PDVSA source said.

The U.S. dollar was little changed and oil prices rose after Washington slapped sanctions on Venezuela’ state-owned oil firm in a bid to curb its crude exports as traders prepared for major events such as a key Brexit vote later in the day. Investors expect the U.S. central bank to show a more cautious stance when policymakers release a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting. U.S. economic data in December that was softer than expected and a sharp downturn in financial markets are likely to keep the Fed from raising rates. Equity markets in Europe rose as investors bid up stocks considered safer during times of economic uncertainty, such as utilities. However, a gauge of global stock performance edged lower as stocks on Wall Street fell amid a ream of mixed earnings reports and caution due to the U.S.-China trade spat. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.06 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed 0.8 percent higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 50.47 points, or 0.21 percent, to 24,578.69. The S&P 500 lost 4.28 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,639.57 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 51.83 points, or 0.73 percent, to 7,033.85. The information glut this week will make it hard for people to reach a conclusion but the trade talks with China, which begin Wednesday, are the overriding issue for the world economy, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. What Washington, and possibly Beijing, fail to understand is that the uncertainty about trade is slowing the global economy, which will show up in East Asian PMI manufacturing data for January to be released on Thursday, Kelly said. “The biggest tax levy by Washington is an uncertainty tax, and it’s the biggest threat to the markets and the economy this year,” Kelly said. Tensions were high after U.S. officials announced criminal charges against China’s telecom giant Huawei for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. For Asia, the blow was cushioned by promises of more Chinese stimulus but Beijing had berated Washington for blocking tactics in its World Trade Organization appeal against U.S. tariffs. Amid the uncertainty, safe-haven gold broke through $1,310 an ounce in spot prices to reach its highest since last May. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4 percent at $1,308.90 per ounce. Oil price gains were capped by abundant supply and signs of a slowing Chinese economy. Brent crude oil futures rose $1.39 to settle at $61.32 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained $1.32 to settle at $53.31. Market participants will have catalysts for trading all week, with more than one-fifth of companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index reporting results, including Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. Apple, which issued a profit warning this month due to weak demand from China, is due to report after the market closes. U.S. Treasury yields fell across maturities as investors anticipated strong demand for $78 billion of new issues on sale later in the day and on data showing U.S. consumer confidence at its lowest since July 2017. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 8/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.717 percent. The dollar index rose 0.02 percent, while the euro fell 0.05 percent to $1.1427.

2019-01-29,"SAO JOAQUIM DE BICAS, Brazil (Reuters) - Miles (km) downstream from where a dam owned by miner Vale SA burst on Friday, killing hundreds, a small indigenous village in Brazil faces doubts about its very existence as the river at the center of life here runs dark with mining waste. For members of the Pataxo-Hahahae tribe living at the end of a sinuous dirt road, fish from the Paraopeba River are the principal source of food. Villagers bathe and wash their clothes in its waters.  But after a tailings dam at Vale’s Corrego do Feijao mine burst upstream, burying communities and turning the river’s once-clear waters a muddy brown, the 80 or so residents of the Pataxo-Hahahae village of Nao Xoha say they are unsure if they will be forced to uproot their families. While there were no Pataxo-Hahahae among the 65 confirmed dead or 279 disappeared, the disaster, they fear, could be the end of their way of life. “On Thursday, I was here washing my clothes, bathing with my children, and now I can’t even touch the river,” said Sot de Ionara Pataxo Hahahae, holding back tears. “Our hearts are so sad knowing that nothing can be done.” The Pataxo-Hahahae’s plight comes as Brazil’s current government, which took office earlier in January, has signaled it wants to cut mining regulations and shrink protections currently afforded to indigenous communities. For critics, the  dam burst reveals the danger of both policies. Brazil’s indigenous affairs agency Funai said it is committed to helping Nao Xoha, by ensuring potable water among other measures. But in the wake of the disaster, trust in the authorities here is low. “You think some mining company is worried about this? Do you think some mayor is worried about this area?” asked Sot de Aigoho Pataxo Hahahae. “They only love money - and mining.” Reporting by Leonardo Benassatto and Adriano Machado; Writing by Gram Slattery; Editing by Sandra Maler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/vale-sa-disaster-indigenous/indigenous-village-faces-existential-threat-from-brazil-dam-burst-idUKL1N1ZT0WI,29 Jan 2019,"Miles (km)

2019-01-29,"(Reuters) - New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday ordered state officials to develop regulations to reduce methane emissions from its oil and gas industry and separately rollback statewide greenhouse gas output over the next decade.  The New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department and Environment Department were directed to enact methane emission reduction “rules as soon as practicable,” the executive order said. Lujan Grisham, a recently-elected Democrat, campaigned on the promise of tightening environmental guidelines for the southwestern state’s fossil fuels sector.  As home to part of the booming Permian Basin oil hub, New Mexico has doubled its oil output in recent years to become one of the top crude-producing states. In her executive order, the governor also formed a task force to develop a plan to curb the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent from 2005 levels by the year 2030. The group is set to release its initial recommendations by Sept. 15.  Additionally, Lujan Grisham announced New Mexico has joined a group of governors, known as the U.S. Climate Alliance, electing to uphold the Paris climate agreement despite President Donald Trump’s decision to remove the United States from the pact. Also on Tuesday, a New Mexico lawmaker filed legislation, backed by Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard, to increase the royalty rate on 9 million acres of state land.  The bill would increase the state’s typical 12.5 to 20 percent royalty to match Texas’ 25 percent royalty, though it would target only the top performing wells. The higher royalty rate would kick in for oil wells when production reaches 20,000 barrels per month. The bill would also require companies to pay royalties when natural gas is flared or vented - something that is common when new oil wells come online but gas pipelines are not in place. Garcia Richard’s office noted in a news release that the state loses around $1 million per month on unpaid royalties due to venting and flaring. The bill would only impact new oil and gas leases that the state negotiates.

2019-01-29,"Jan 29 (Reuters) - The United States imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry on Monday, looking to cut off President Nicolas Maduro’s primary source of revenue. The sanctions limit transactions between U.S. companies that do business with Venezuela through purchases of crude oil and sales of refined products. However, there are currently numerous unanswered questions about the sanctions. The United States is aiming to freeze sale proceeds from Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA’s exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to the United States. There is also a prohibition on U.S firms exporting diluents - unfinished oils used for blending extra heavy crude - to Venezuela. Venezuela exports oil primarily to the United States, India, and China, as well as some other nations. Only the United States and India are notable sources of cash, as Russian and Chinese firms currently get shipments of crude through complicated oil-for-loan agreements due to Venezuela’s heavy liabilities with those countries. The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions do not entirely cut off purchases of Venezuelan oil by U.S. refineries. However, they stipulate that refiners cannot make payments directly to PDVSA, but into escrow accounts that PDVSA will not be able to access until the company is controlled by a new government. Maduro and Manuel Quevedo, who is both oil minister and head of PDVSA, have said that they will not allow vessels loaded with crude oil for the United States to leave the country’s ports without being prepaid. PDVSA on Tuesday said it was considering declaring force majeure on cargoes bound for the United States. For now, companies can do business but with restrictions. Refineries that import from Venezuela can continue to receive shipments for the next few months before they are forced to shift their supply sources elsewhere. However, since payments cannot be made to PDVSA, this is expected to restrict the flow of crude oil from Venezuela to the United States. The sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with PDVSA that began in recent years with customers including PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum, India’s Reliance and Russia’s Rosneft. Chevron Corp, Halliburton, Schlumberger , Baker Hughes and Weatherford International all have operations in Venezuela, and are allowed to continue to engage in transactions and activities with PDVSA and its joint ventures through July 27. This could cause Venezuela’s production to fall further later this year if service companies, which have already reduced operations, finally leave the country. Citgo Petroleum is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA and operates refining capacity to process about 750,000 bpd. It also distributes fuel to gasoline stations throughout the United States, accounting for about 4 percent of the nation’s retail fuel market. The United States has exempted Citgo from its sanctions until July 27. However, previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits, which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends. As of September, the company had about $500 million in cash and a credit line of approximately $900 million, according to a creditor familiar with the company’s financial statements. Citgo is able to keep importing crude oil from PDVSA for three more months, according to the sanctions. The sanctions expressly prohibit sales of diluents (heavy naphtha) to PDVSA, which are used for making the country’s extra heavy crude oil ready for export. The OPEC member’s oil production has dwindled in the last two decades, from more than 3 million bpd at the beginning of the century to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million bpd by late 2018. Most of the crude it produces now is heavy or extra heavy. Venezuela and PDVSA are estimated to owe more than $100 billion to bondholders, suppliers, allied governments, lenders and creditors holding judgments. Some creditors have gone to U.S. courts to try to seize Citgo to satisfy their legal claims. Reporting By David Gaffen, Luc Cohen, Marianna Parraga,

2019-01-29,"SEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - South Korea’s purchases of U.S. oil and gas this year will hold to the rapid pace set in 2018, likely narrowing its trade surplus with the world’s top economy further and bolstering its ties to Washington.  South Korea is expected in January and February to import at least 18 million barrels of crude oil and 900,000 tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, according to trade flow data from Refinitiv Eikon.  That’s a four-fold increase on oil from a year earlier and a slight drop on LNG, indicating the record U.S. crude and LNG volumes heading into South Korea in 2018 are set to continue, supported by favorable market conditions brought about by increasing oil and gas output in the United States.  The jump in South Korea’s U.S. oil and gas imports comes as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to push to reduce trade deficits with the United States’ major trading partners by selling more to them than it buys. U.S. oil and LNG exports are a key part of this strategy.  “At the moment, the trend (of importing U.S. crude) will stay ... The economics for U.S. crude is a little bit better than Middle East and North Sea oil,” said a South Korean refining source who declined to be named due to company policy.  Record U.S. crude oil and LNG volumes flowed into South Korea in 2018, while supplies from the Middle East were tightened amid OPEC-led output cuts and a re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude, LNG shipments to South Korea - tmsnrt.rs/2TinYHp) The United States was South Korea’s sixth-biggest crude supplier last year, its highest ranking ever as it overtook Iran and Russia. It also became South Korea’s third-largest LNG supplier, while South Korea was the top importer of U.S. LNG.  South Korea’s U.S. oil and gas imports more than quadrupled in value to $6.75 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017, according to the country’s customs data.   The U.S. oil import value of $4.5 billion alone was more than six times the $725 million taken in U.S. oil in 2017.  “Buying more U.S. oil and gas was part of (Seoul’s) strategy as our wide trade surplus against the United States was grounds for revising the Korea-U.S. free trade deal,” said Je Hyun-jung, director at the Korea International Trade Association.  South Korea’s 2018 trade surplus with the United States at $13.86 billion was the lowest since 2011, down 22.4 percent from $17.86 billion a year earlier, the customs data showed.  In 2017, Trump threatened to renegotiate or scrap what he called a “horrible” bilateral trade deal that had doubled the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea since 2012.  The two countries agreed to revise the deal last year, with Seoul capping its steel exports to the United States to avoid hefty tariffs and giving greater market access to U.S. carmakers. The revision took effect on Jan. 1.  Tilak Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co, said improving trade ties between South Korea and the United States will also support their shared goal of North Korea’s denuclearisation. “Any help from the United States regarding North Korea is critical, so good trade relations will help. It also helps South  Koreans to protect their exports to the United States by pointing to their (U.S.) energy imports,” Doshi said.  (GRAPHIC: South Korea's trade surplus with the United States - tmsnrt.rs/2SewTw3) South Korea imports nearly all of its energy. It is the world’s fifth-largest crude and third-largest LNG importer, typically taking 80 percent of its oil and more than 40 percent of its LNG from the Middle East.  In 2018, as U.S. oil flows grew, though, the Middle East’s share of South Korean crude imports dropped to 73.5 percent, the lowest since 2002.  While it’s not certain freight rebates for non-Middle East crude imports - part of South Korea’s diversification push - will continue, higher U.S. crude output and wider discounts for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) will make U.S. oil attractive to South Korean buyers looking for cheaper sources outside their traditional suppliers.  GS Caltex, South Korea’s No.2 refiner, bought 10 million barrels of U.S. crude, mainly WTI Midland and Mars, for arrival over January-February, said a company spokesman, as U.S. oil has became more price competitive.  South Korea’s hunt for condensate to replace Iranian supplies is also expected to intensify later this year as waivers from U.S. sanctions start to expire in May.  South Korea buys U.S. oil mostly on a spot basis. It buys U.S. LNG primarily on a long-term basis via a 20-year term contract that state-run Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) has with Cheniere.  Two South Korean private power companies - GS EPS and SK E&S - are also set to take U.S. LNG from 2019 and 2020, respectively, under their own 20-year contracts with Cameron LNG and Freeport LNG.  U.S. LNG’s share of South Korea’s energy mix will grow as the Asian importer switches away from nuclear and coal to renewables and LNG for power, said Tim Boersma, director of Global Natural Gas Markets at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.  “The Korean decision to put more emphasis on LNG as a fuel of its future may well continue, given the growing role of U.S. companies in this market,” Boersma said.

2019-01-29,"(Adds Shell comment, details, background) HOUSTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union (USW) warned on Tuesday that time was running out to reach a new national agreement for U.S. refinery and chemical plant workers before the current pact expires on Friday, sources familiar with the talks said. The USW and Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, have been in talks since Jan. 16 for an accord on wages, benefits and safety covering 30,000 refinery, chemical plant and pipeline workers. A message sent to union members noted that less than 60 hours remain to reach a new agreement. The current contract expires shortly after 12 a.m. on Friday, the sources said. The message also said Shell needed to “get serious about economics and our other issues,” the sources said. Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said the company was working for an agreement with the union. “We continue actively working through numerous topics to reach an agreement with the USW International Union that best ensures opportunity for our workers to continue to grow, develop and enjoy earnings that are among the most competitive in the manufacturing industry,” Fisher said. The USW has said the talks will not be automatically extended past the contract’s expiration. These are first talks since a breakdown in negotiations in 2015 led to a series of rolling strikes in which more than 7,000 workers walked off their jobs at 12 refineries and three chemical plants. Most strikes ended within two months. The sources said the chances for a national strike had increased slightly because of slow paced negotiations. Going into talks, both sides said they wanted to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This year’s negotiations made progress early on union proposals to increase health and safety representation at plants, according to the sources, but have bogged down over a USW proposal to begin replacing non-union workers who perform maintenance work with union members by 10 percent a year. The union is seeking an 8-percent-a-year pay increase for hourly workers under a new three-year contract. U.S. refinery workers make about $40 an hour after four years on the job.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to fast-track the construction of the new refinery in Dos Bocas, Tabasco, to boost lagging domestic production of gasoline and diesel, and wean the country from a growing dependence on imported fuels. “It will be a restricted auction because we’re going to invite serious, specialized companies,” Nahle said at an energy conference in Mexico City. The minister, who also serves as president of the Pemex board of directors, added that the invitation-only process will allow the government to prohibit the participation of international firms that have “histories of corruption.” Nahle did not say when the Pemex auction would be conducted, or which firms were being considered. Pemex’s recently approved 2019 budget allocates almost $2.5 billion for the refinery, which aims to be able to process 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude. Lopez Obrador has said that the total price tag for the facility will be approximately $8 billion, and would mark Pemex’s seventh domestic oil refinery. The company also has a 50 percent stake in the Deer Park refinery in Texas operated by partner Royal Dutch Shell.

2019-01-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices gained more than 2 percent on Tuesday after the United States imposed sanctions on state-owned Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, a move likely to reduce the OPEC member’s crude exports and relieve some global oversupply worries.  International Brent crude oil futures were up $1.39 to settle at $61.32 a barrel, a 2.32 percent rise, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased $1.32, or 2.54 percent, to settle at $53.31 a barrel. Venezuela is among the world’s largest heavy crude oil producers, and the United States has been its biggest client, taking about half the country’s export volumes..  The Trump administration’s restrictions on Venezuelan crude, aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro from power, stop short of banning U.S. companies from buying oil from the Latin American country. However, proceeds from such sales will be put in a “blocked account” that should deter PDVSA from shipping crude to the United States. “Today’s price advance looked like a delayed reaction to yesterday’s Venezuelan headlines as traders may have had second thoughts about the impact on domestic oil supplies,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.  Additionally, “possibilities that some Gulf Coast refiners may need to pay up for alternative stocks from such places such as Saudi Arabia that has already suggested that they will be steering cargoes away from the U.S.,” he wrote. Venezuela’s exports fell to little more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 from 1.6 million bpd in 2017, according to Refinitiv ship-tracking data and trade sources. Petromatrix estimated that Venezuelan exports will drop by about 500,000 barrels per day under current conditions.  Venezuela is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is implementing a supply cut deal to support prices. Russia, OPEC’s biggest non-member ally, and China have both publicly denounced the U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, Libya’s biggest oilfield, El Sharara, will remain shut until departure of an armed group occupying the site, the head of National Oil Corp said. Despite some tightening, global oil supply remains high, largely because of a more than 2 million bpd increase in U.S. crude oil production last year to a record 11.9 million bpd. U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels last week compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday after prices settled. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s crude and gasoline inventory data will be released on Wednesday.  Some in the oil industry also worry that crude demand could stutter if the trade war between Washington and Beijing slows global economic growth. In China, a top oil importer, signs of a slowdown have emerged. Activity in its vast manufacturing sector is expected to shrink for the second straight month in January, a Reuters poll showed.

2019-01-29,"(Adds oil market comment from Energy Department) WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering tapping the U.S. emergency reserve of crude as it imposes new sanctions on Venezuela’s oil business, but no decision has been made, a U.S. government source said on Tuesday. The administration on Monday imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA, aimed at pressuring socialist President Nicholas Maduro to step down. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a series of underground caverns on the coasts of Louisiana and Texas, currently holds 649.1 million barrels of crude, about 396 million of which is classified as sour oil, the rest being sweet. Sour has more sulfur in it and requires more processing. A release is likely not imminent, but the reserve’s role is often a consideration when the administration looks at the global oil market balance, as it holds more oil than required under international agreements, said the government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under law, the Department of Energy can do a test sale of up to 5 million barrels, or larger releases to loan oil to refiners, while the president can order drawdowns to counter severe supply interruptions. But the reserve mostly lacks the kind of heavy oil supplied by OPEC member Venezuela and used by PDVSA’s U.S. refining arm Citgo, Valero Energy Corp and Chevron . In coming months the Energy Department could announce a sale of oil from the reserve, mandated by laws signed by former President Barack Obama to fund the federal government and a medical program. Last year the department held two such sales, releasing about 18 million barrels. An energy analyst discounted the effectiveness of using the reserve as a way to protect against any price spikes. “I’m not sure a mandated sale or even a new auction really helps the refiners affected, an auction would just price up the oil,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in late September ahead of congressional elections and the reimposition of sanctions on Iran that the administration was not considering a release from the reserve, and that a release would have a “fairly minor and short-term impact.” Dan Brouillette, the Energy Department’s deputy secretary, said on Twitter his agency was confident energy markets will remain supplied despite reduced imports of Venezuelan oil. “Over the next few years, global oil supply is expected to exceed demand & U.S. production is forecasted to increase an all-time high of 12M barrels per day,” he said. Analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners said if the sanctions forced U.S. refiners to look for other sources they could likely get some of the oil from Canada. A spokesman for the National Security Council said the administration would not comment on deliberations about Venezuela. The Department of Energy did not comment.

2019-01-29,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s revenues from oil sales to the United States have come under severe threat as sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm has sent U.S. buyers scrambling for replacements.  The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, to cripple the OPEC member’s oil shipments, which account for nearly all of Venezuela’s exports, in response to the reelection of socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a vote widely viewed as fraudulent.      Washington has recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s head of state.      U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela’s heavy crude are turning to domestic sour crude grades to offset the impact, sending prices to the strongest in about five years, traders said. Other potential alternatives from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America are hard to secure amid slowing production, limited spare capacity and transportation bottlenecks, traders said. Broader oil futures prices found some support on news of sanctions but the market reaction was largely muted as a lack of investment, mismanagement and fleeing workers have already driven the OPEC-member’s oil production to the lowest in almost seven decades. [O/R] PDVSA is seeking to sidestep Trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, four sources involved in the talks said. The United States is Venezuela’s biggest oil customer, importing, on average, about 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  “The region with the biggest shortfall of Venezuelan crudes, either through sanctions or inadvertently through further production declines is the U.S.,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a note.    For an interactive graphic on top importers of Venezuelan crude, see: tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E.    The Trump administration sanctions allow U.S. companies to buy Venezuelan oil, but the proceeds of such sales will be put in a “blocked account.”  Because of this, PDVSA is likely to quickly stop shipping much crude to the United States, its top client. Overnight, Maduro said cargoes loaded for the United States that had not already been paid for could not depart. “There’s going to be appetite around the world to take Venezuelan oil,” Zachary Rogers, an oil markets analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie said. Venezuela will likely be forced to offer steep discounts and increase shipments to Russia, China and India to try and make up for lost revenues from its top market, traders and analysts said. Its output has been cut in half since 2016 to near 70-year lows to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources, due to a major cash crunch. As a result, the U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years, with more shipments going to Russia and China made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures. Venezuela can prioritise exports to Asia, but it is the most competitive battleground on the planet, RBC Capital’s Tran said, adding that while they remain the second largest market for Venezuelan crudes, the Chinese have also tapered its buying from Caracas over the past two years. For an interactive graphic on Venezuelan crude exports to the United States, see: tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB.   Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments, according to a Barclays research note published earlier this month.  Citgo Petroleum, the U.S. refining arm of PDVSA and the biggest importer of Venezuelan crude, did not reply to a request for comment. The other primary importers Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp said they will comply with U.S. laws. Though the United States is the top oil producer with output of nearly 12 million bpd, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply substitute it with light crude. The easiest substitute for now is domestic sour grades. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and West Texas Sour crude WTC-WTS have risen as buyers scramble for supply.  On Tuesday, Mars crude traded at about $6 a barrel premium to the U.S. crude futures benchmark, up from a $5.20 a barrel premium on Monday and remained near a five-year high, traders said, while West Texas Sour was near the strongest level in a year. “It’s nuts. Everything with sulphur in it is getting bid,” said one U.S. crude trader said, referring to crude’s sulphur content that is known in the market as “sour grades.” Some traders said much of the impact had already been priced in. “I actually think it may end up being bearish medium to longer term ... If Guaido takes power and foreign investment flows into Venezuela, then their production has a lot of room to go back up over time,” a trader at a merchant said. Currently, alternatives to Venezuela’s heavy sour crudes are becoming increasingly scarce in the Americas, due to challenges facing heavy crude producers Canada and Mexico.  Canada produces more than 4 million bpd, much of it heavy crude that could replace Venezuelan grades, but pipeline bottlenecks are hampering its exports.  “Until the ongoing (Canadian) pipeline issues are addressed, crude by rail is simply not as scalable as increased shipments from Mexico or Iraq,” said Tran. However, Mexico’s crude output levels are among the lowest on record dating back several decades as its top-producing fields have aged, and new ones to replace them have not been developed. The Trump administration is considering tapping the country’s emergency reserve of crude as it imposed sanctions on PDVSA, but no decision has been made, a U.S. government source said. The reserve currently holds 649.1 million barrels of crude, about 396 million of which is classified as sour oil.

2019-01-29,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA is seeking to sidestep Trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, four sources involved in the talks said. The U.S. government issued an executive order on Monday freezing PDVSA assets and requiring U.S. firms to pay for PDVSA oil using accounts controlled by the country’s congress head and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido. The sanctions were aimed at pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro into stepping down.  PDVSA began calling customers ahead of the sanctions, urging them to swap foreign fuel and other products for its Venezuelan crude cargoes, the sources said. It is also considering asking trading houses to act as intermediaries for a portion of its oil sales to indirectly supply customers in the United States and elsewhere.  “We are trying to redo the contracts. It is not yet entirely clear how because customers are being individually called, but we are studying alternatives,” said a PDVSA source familiar with the efforts.  It was unclear on Tuesday whether the approach of using intermediaries or swaps would avoid violating U.S. sanctions, the sources said.  Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of Venezuela’s export revenue. Falling output, corruption and mismanagement have battered the nation’s economy, leading to hyperinflation and malnutrition that have prompted some 3 million people to leave the country.  The South American country exports 1.25 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, including 500,000 bpd to the United States, and imports over 200,000 bpd of refined products, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The imports from the United States are crucial for Venezuela’s production of diluted crude oil (DCO), as they use heavy naphtha to dilute Venezuela’s extra heavy crude and produce oil ready for export. Industry traders on Tuesday said that U.S. refineries were making inquiries to replace those shipments from other countries. World oil futures rose by more than 2 percent on Tuesday, but the market has not seen panicked buying as a result of the U.S. decision to target Venezuela’s oil output, particularly as the country’s production was already near seven-decade lows.  Washington said on Monday proceeds from PDVSA’s sales to companies in the United States will be frozen until a new government can take control of the accounts.  The sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with PDVSA that began in recent years with customers including PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum, India’s Reliance and Russia’s Rosneft. Oil firms that had sent tankers to Venezuela to lift crude bound for the United States were ordered by PDVSA on Monday to pay for cargoes before departure, sources told Reuters. But such prepayment could violate the sanctions, setting the stage for a standoff at Venezuelan ports. Regular buyers of Venezuelan crude, especially in the United States, have started hunting for alternative supplies of heavy oil, a difficult task as other Latin American exporters from Mexico to Colombia do not have surplus capacity.    PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Several U.S. refiners, including Chevron Corp, Phillips 66 and Valero Energy said they were studying the sanctions and would comply with U.S. laws. Valero, the second-largest buyer of Venezuelan crude after Citgo, said it will “re-optimize” its crude supply.  Washington’s fast action on Venezuela and efforts by Maduro’s government to defend its grip on PDVSA have sent shockwaves around the world, triggering angry responses from China and Russia. Swaps and three-way trades have become routine due to PDVSA’s oil-for-loan pacts and U.S. sanctions first imposed in 2017, according to internal PDVSA documents and trading sources. The Caracas-based company’s barrels typically go through several hands before reaching a refinery. Its fuel imports mostly come from swaps, according to PDVSA’s internal documents and Refinitiv Eikon data. PDVSA approached an Indian refiner seeking to modify terms of its contracts, including adding partial payment in the form of refined products through swaps, a source from the refining company said. With other customers, payments in medicines or food for settling outstanding balances also are on the table, one of the PDVSA sources said. India’s Reliance and Nayara Energy, partially owned by Rosneft, did not respond to emails requesting comment. Swaps are one response to U.S. sanctions, but dealing with traders for triangulating Venezuelan oil sales could be PDVSA’s last resort as intermediaries make a profit from buying cheap barrels, storing them and then offering them to refiners. “Traders buy our oil at obscene prices,” the PDVSA source said.

The U.S. dollar was little changed and oil prices rose after Washington slapped sanctions on Venezuela’ state-owned oil firm in a bid to curb its crude exports as traders prepared for major events such as a key Brexit vote later in the day. Investors expect the U.S. central bank to show a more cautious stance when policymakers release a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting. U.S. economic data in December that was softer than expected and a sharp downturn in financial markets are likely to keep the Fed from raising rates. Equity markets in Europe rose as investors bid up stocks considered safer during times of economic uncertainty, such as utilities. However, a gauge of global stock performance edged lower as stocks on Wall Street fell amid a ream of mixed earnings reports and caution due to the U.S.-China trade spat. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.06 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed 0.8 percent higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 50.47 points, or 0.21 percent, to 24,578.69. The S&P 500 lost 4.28 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,639.57 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 51.83 points, or 0.73 percent, to 7,033.85. The information glut this week will make it hard for people to reach a conclusion but the trade talks with China, which begin Wednesday, are the overriding issue for the world economy, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. What Washington, and possibly Beijing, fail to understand is that the uncertainty about trade is slowing the global economy, which will show up in East Asian PMI manufacturing data for January to be released on Thursday, Kelly said. “The biggest tax levy by Washington is an uncertainty tax, and it’s the biggest threat to the markets and the economy this year,” Kelly said. Tensions were high after U.S. officials announced criminal charges against China’s telecom giant Huawei for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. For Asia, the blow was cushioned by promises of more Chinese stimulus but Beijing had berated Washington for blocking tactics in its World Trade Organization appeal against U.S. tariffs. Amid the uncertainty, safe-haven gold broke through $1,310 an ounce in spot prices to reach its highest since last May. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4 percent at $1,308.90 per ounce. Oil price gains were capped by abundant supply and signs of a slowing Chinese economy. Brent crude oil futures rose $1.39 to settle at $61.32 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained $1.32 to settle at $53.31. Market participants will have catalysts for trading all week, with more than one-fifth of companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index reporting results, including Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. Apple, which issued a profit warning this month due to weak demand from China, is due to report after the market closes. U.S. Treasury yields fell across maturities as investors anticipated strong demand for $78 billion of new issues on sale later in the day and on data showing U.S. consumer confidence at its lowest since July 2017. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 8/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.717 percent. The dollar index rose 0.02 percent, while the euro fell 0.05 percent to $1.1427.

2019-01-29,"BOGOTA, Jan 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of coffee farmers in Peru hope to produce higher and more profitable crop yields to better cope with the impact of climate change under a landmark United Nations-backed project. More than 1.3 billion people live on farmland that is deteriorating and producing less, putting them at risk of worsening hunger, water shortages and poverty, the U.N. says. Land degradation could displace 135 million people by 2030 unless action is taken to restore their land, says the U.N. The $12 million Peru project involves 2,400 small coffee farmers and is the first by a public-private investment set up with the U.N., called the Land Degradation Neutrality Fund. “What we’re trying to do with this fund is to finance the transition to a more sustainable use of land,” said Gautier Queru, head of the Paris-based fund, which is run by investment manager Mirova. “This translates in producing more and better with less,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The project, set to start within weeks, runs for 15 years. Four coffee co-operatives in northern Peru will be trained in sustainable farming, learning about the best use of organic fertiliser and robust seeds. “It’s a matter of selecting the seeds that are well adapted to the local conditions, and future conditions, taking into account climate change to make the coffee plantations more resilient and also to ensure good quality coffee is produced to drive prices up for farmers,” Queru said. The project also focuses on reforestation. Covering nearly 9,000 hectares of degraded land, trees will be planted in and around plantations, providing shade. It is hoped this may cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1.3 metric tons. Land degradation drives climate change, with deforestation - which contributes 10 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions - worsening the problem, the U.N. says. The fund aims to invest $300 million in land management and restoration projects worldwide to meet global goals - known as the Sustainable Development Goals - on land degradation by 2030. “If you want to meet the sustainable development goals, we can’t only rely on small pilot projects,” Queru said. “We need this program to scale up.” Queru said the aim is to expand the pilot project to other coffee cooperatives in Peru and other coffee-producing nations in Latin America, as well as to cocoa and tree nut farmers.

2019-01-29,"Jan 29 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s revenues from oil sales to the United States have come under severe threat as sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm has sent U.S. buyers scrambling for replacements. The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, to cripple the OPEC member’s oil shipments, which account for nearly all of Venezuela’s exports, in response to the reelection of socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a vote widely viewed as fraudulent. Washington has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s head of state. U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela’s heavy crude are turning to domestic sour crude grades to offset the impact, sending prices to the strongest in about five years WTC-MRS, traders said. The United States is Venezuela’s biggest oil customer, importing, on average, about 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. “The region with the biggest shortfall of Venezuelan crudes, either through sanctions or inadvertently through further production declines is the U.S.,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a note. For an interactive graphic on top importers of Venezuelan crude, see: tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E. The Trump administration sanctions allow U.S. companies to buy Venezuelan oil, but the proceeds of such sales will be put in a “blocked account.” Because of this, PDVSA is likely to quickly stop shipping much crude to the United States, its top client. Overnight, Maduro said cargoes loaded for the United States that had not already been paid for could not depart. “There’s going to be appetite around the world to take Venezuelan oil,” Zachary Rogers, an oil markets analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie said. Venezuela will likely be forced to offer steep discounts and increase shipments to Russia, China and India to try and make up for lost revenues from its top market, traders and analysts said. Venezuela’s output has been cut in half since 2016 to near 70-year lows to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources, due to major cash crunch that has stymied investments, a brain drain that is depriving it of engineers, and a new military management that has clashed with workers. As a result, the U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years, with more shipments going to Russia and China made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures. It can prioritize exports to Asia, but it is the most competitive battleground on the planet, RBC Capital’s Tran said, adding that while they remain the second largest market for Venezuelan crudes, the Chinese have also tapered its buying from Caracas over the past two years. For an interactive graphic on Venezuelan crude exports to the United States, see: tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB. Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments, according to a Barclays research note published earlier this month. Citgo Petroleum, the U.S. refining arm of PDVSA and the biggest importer of Venezuelan crude, did not reply to a request for comment. The other primary importers Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp said they will comply with U.S. laws. Though the United States is the top oil producer with output of nearly 12 million bpd, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply substitute it with light crude. The easiest substitute for now is domestic sour grades. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour WTC-MRS, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and West Texas Sour crude WTC-HLS have risen as buyers scramble for supply. On Tuesday, Mars crude traded at about a $6 premium to the U.S. crude futures benchmark, near a five-year high, traders said. “It’s nuts. Everything with sulfur in it is getting bid,” said one U.S. crude trader said, referring to crude’s sulfur content that is known in the market as “sour grades.” The alternatives to Venezuela’s heavy sour crudes have become increasingly scarce in the Americas, due to challenges facing heavy crude producers Canada and Mexico. Canada produces more than 4 million bpd, much of it heavy crude that could replace Venezuelan grades, but pipeline bottlenecks are hampering its exports. “Until the ongoing (Canadian) pipeline issues are addressed, crude by rail is simply not as scalable as increased shipments from Mexico or Iraq,” said Tran. However, Mexico’s crude output levels are among the lowest on record dating back several decades as its top-producing fields have aged, and new ones to replace them have not been developed. Traders said the United States may need to sell oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cover supply shortfalls. The Trump administration was considering a release from the SPR, S&P Global Platts reported ahead of sanctions being imposed. The crude quality in the SPR differs from Venezuelan crude, however.

2019-01-29,"BRUSSELS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it had concluded that U.S. soybeans can be used in biofuels in the European Union, part of the bloc’s push to improve strained trade relations with the United States. However, industry sources said it was unlikely to lead to a flood of additional U.S. soybean imports into Europe.  U.S. President Donald Trump agreed in July not to impose tariffs on EU car imports while the two sides explored ways to boost trade including a possible deal to remove tariffs on non-auto industrial goods and to boost EU imports of U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas. The Commission said in a statement the recognition of U.S. soybeans for use in biofuels was valid until July 1, 2021, but could extend beyond that date as long as they met sustainability criteria set in new EU rules in the 2021-2030 period. “Today’s decision is new proof that the European Union is delivering on our commitments,” a Commission spokesman said. Currently, the United States exports soybeans to the EU for animal feed but the soybean oil byproduct has to be shipped back  because Europe does not allow it to be used for fuel. The new rule would change that. “So, on its face, it does nothing to increase soybean exports in the EU,” a U.S.-based lobbyist for the biodiesel industry said. “It just helps European farmers capture the full value and saves U.S. farmers shipping costs.” One U.S. Congressional staffer described the move as more the removal of a trade barrier. EU biofuel producers used an estimated 400,000 tonnes of soybean oil for biofuel production in 2018 against some 5.9 million tonnes of rapeseed oil, the main feedstock, according to  Claus Keller of German commodity analysts FO Licht. “I think the EU move will be positive for U.S. soybean sales prospects to the EU but it will not open a floodgate,” he said, adding that sales would be influenced by U.S.-China trade talks and on the future for Argentine biodiesel, which faces duties in the United States and could face measures in Europe. The Commission, which negotiates trade deals for the 28-nation EU, has said the July agreement led to a 112 percent rise in U.S. soybean imports in the second half of 2018.  The United States is Europe’s main supplier, with a 75 percent share of EU soybean imports. The increase has been driven by a slide in the U.S. soybean price, which slid after China imposed higher tariffs on U.S. beans in its trade row with Washington, rather than because of any concerted action by the EU, analysts said. The EU imports about 14 million tonnes of soybeans per year as feed for animals.

2019-01-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Major banks have stopped trading the bonds of Venezuela’s state- owned oil firm PDVSA for clients after the United States imposed sweeping sanctions on the firm, according to fund managers. The move by Washington are set to ratchet up the pressure on Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro and will effectively prevent investors who operate in the United States from buying PDVSA bonds. “Most dealers are restricted from trading PDVSA now,” said Pala Asset Management’s David Nietlispach, adding that bond trading systems were now showing virtually no pricing for PDVSA debt, compared to at least 20 being available normally. A spokeswoman for Barclays, one of the big European banks said to have halted its PDVSA dealing, would not comment on messages from its fixed income desk informing clients of its decision.  Peter Kisler, an emerging market portfolio manager at North Asset Manager, said most of the banks had stopped market-making to give compliance departments time to go through the details of the U.S. sanctions. A fund manager at one major bank who requested anonymity added: “We have asked for runs (quotes) to see where the market is opening and all we are hearing in unison from the street is that ‘we are not allowed to trade them until further notice’”. “We heard this from all the major counter parties that have a Venezuela trading desk – JP Morgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley.” Washington officials had said on Monday that the sanctions were intended to prevent Maduro’s government from siphoning off funds from the oil company to maintain his grip on power. There were some nuances in terms of timing of sanctions and how PDVSA’s U.S. refining offshoot CITGO would be impacted, but investors were gradually digesting the various permutations. Torino Economics said in a note that one of the reasons for banning the buying and selling of PDVSA’s bonds on the secondary market was to “strengthen the hand” of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido in any future debt restructuring.  “The logic of this reasoning is that the larger the haircuts for bondholders, the less funds will the U.S. (either directly or through international financial institutions) have to provide for Venezuela’s reconstruction,” Torino’s chief economist Francisco Rodriguez said. Bond markets were also on alert for any sign that JP Morgan might review Venezuela’s and PDVSA’s place in the bank’s ‘Emerging Markets Bond Index Global Diversified’, which fund managers track and use as the main benchmark for performance. The surge in Venezuela’s bonds this year, as the U.S. pressure has mounted on Maduro, has been a boon for those holding the paper. However, those who don’t have missed out on one of the top gainers in the EMBI global diversified. A JP Morgan index spokesman declined to comment on any possible changes in terms of Venezuela.

2019-01-29,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese gas distributor Tokyo Gas will target investment in overseas infrastructure projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable energy to boost its offshore earnings, its chief executive said. The country’s biggest city gas seller and major buyer of LNG plans to leverage its links with foreign partners or team up with other Japanese companies to chase deals, President & CEO Takashi Uchida said. “We want to make an aggressive investment in Southeast Asia and North America this year to expand our LNG value chain,” Uchida told Reuters in an interview this week. Under a three-year business plan that kicked off last April, Tokyo Gas plans to spend 260 billion yen (2 billion pounds) to  boost its earnings from abroad to 20 percent of its targeted operating profit of 130 billion yen in the year to March 2021. In the year to March 2018, earnings outside of Japan accounted for about 5.8 percent of its group operating profit of 116.3 billion yen. “Since we have struggled to win any major overseas deals through auctions last year, we plan to seek one-on-one deals through our foreign partners or join forces with other Japanese companies,” he said. Tokyo Gas is eyeing LNG import terminal projects in the Philippines and Vietnam.  The company also wants to proactively seek new deals in renewable energy, such as offshore wind power, Uchida said, as it aims to raise its equity interests in renewable energy to 600,000 kilowatts abroad by the mid-2020s from zero now. In an effort to diversify procurement sources and reduce costs, Tokyo Gas last year signed non-binding contracts to buy LNG from Anadarko Petroleum’s Mozambique project, Royal Dutch Shell’s LNG Canada project and Sempra Energy’s Energia Costa Azul LNG project in Mexico. “Given the soft LNG market, we were able to win those new deals that were more beneficial to us than the existing contracts,” Uchida said. “We have not abandoned our goal to raise short-term and spot LNG purchases, but we can derive good terms for long-term contracts under the current market circumstances.” Uchida said Tokyo Gas’ tie-up with Britain’s Centrica in LNG procurement from Mozambique was an example of winning more flexibility from sellers. Japan’s Fair Trade Commission in 2017 ruled that destination restrictions that prevent the reselling of contracted LNG cargoes breach competition rules.  “Some suppliers have relaxed destination restrictions over the existing contracts,” he said. Asked whether Tokyo Gas may scrap a new 2 gigawatt coal-fired power station project in Chiba, near Tokyo, Uchida said: “We are still assessing with Kyushu Electric Power and Idemitsu Kosan whether it is economically feasible.” “We will make a decision by the end of March,” he said, adding that the partners may consider an LNG-fired plant if the coal-fired power plan is scrapped.

The U.S. dollar was little changed and oil prices rose after Washington slapped sanctions on Venezuela’ state-owned oil firm in a bid to curb its crude exports as traders prepared for major events such as a key Brexit vote later in the day. Investors expect the U.S. Fed to adopt a more cautious stance when policymakers release a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting. U.S. economic data that came in softer than expected in December and a sharp downturn in financial markets are expected to keep the Fed from raising rates. Equity markets in Europe rose as investors bid up stocks considered safer during times of economic uncertainty, such as utilities. However, a gauge of global stock performance edged lower as stocks on Wall Street fell amid a ream of mixed earnings reports and caution due to the U.S.-China trade spat. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.04 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 24,540.33. The S&P 500 lost 8.26 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,635.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.69 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,026.00. The information glut this week will make it hard for people to come to a conclusion but the trade talks with China, which begin on Wednesday, are the overriding issue for the world economy, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. What Washington, and possibly Beijing, fail to understand is that the uncertainty about trade is slowing the global economy, which will show up in East Asian PMI manufacturing data for January to be released on Thursday, Kelly said. “The biggest tax levy by Washington is an uncertainty tax, and it’s the biggest threat to the markets and the economy this year,” Kelly said. Tensions were high after U.S. officials announced criminal charges against China’s telecom giant Huawei for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. For Asia, the blow was cushioned by promises of more Chinese stimulus but Beijing had berated Washington for blocking tactics in its World Trade Organization appeal against U.S. tariffs. Amid the uncertainty, safe-haven gold broke through $1,310 an ounce to reach its highest since May last year. Oil price gains were capped by abundant supply and signs of a slowing Chinese economy. Brent crude oil futures surged 1.94 percent to $61.09 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 2.44 percent to $53.26. Market participants will have catalysts for trading all week, with more than one-fifth of companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index reporting results, including Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. Apple, which issued a profit warning this month due to weak demand from China, is due to report after the market closes. U.S. Treasury yields fell across maturities as investors anticipated strong demand for $78 billion of new issues on sale later in the day and on data showing U.S. consumer confidence at its lowest since July 2017. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 6/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.7241 percent. The dollar index rose 0.07 percent, with the euro down 0.12 percent to $1.1419.

2019-01-29,"PARIS (Reuters) - French state-controlled utility EDF’s nuclear reactor under construction in Flamanville, northern France, could suffer further delays if certain weldings need to be redone, the country’s nuclear regulator ASN said on Tuesday.  At ASN’s annual nuclear safety review, its chief regulator said there were questions about the quality of eight weldings on pipes between the Flamanville 3 reactor and the turbine building, and that there was a problem with one of the weldings.  “If the ASN were to rule that those ... weldings need to be redone, it is possible that EDF’s start-up calendar may not be respected,” Bernard Doroszczuk, who took up his post two months ago, told reporters. EDF said last week it would make further tests next month on faulty weldings at Flamanville 3 but added it still targeted loading nuclear fuel at the plant in the fourth quarter of 2019. EDF first reported problems with Flamanville 3 weldings in February 2018, when it said that more than half of the 66 weldings on the reactor’s secondary circuit were not in line with standards aimed at making them rupture-proof.  In April, EDF said additional controls on 150 weldings had shown that some were not in line with ASN requirements.  At the end of July, it said the welding problems had forced it to delay start-up of the reactor to the second quarter of 2020, with first fuel loading set for the end of 2019. It then said 53 weldings would have to be redone, while for another 10 it was confident that it could convince the ASN they were fit for service.  Doroszczuk - a welding engineer by training (“a happy coincidence”, he said) - raised doubts about that on Tuesday. “The flaws in the weldings are a serious issue,” he said.  He said there were questions about the quality of eight weldings, which are in places hard to access.  He added that EDF’s strategy was not to repair these eight weldings, but to prove to the regulator with technical calculations that the weldings are safe.  “We are awaiting these calculations and will rule on the weldings early May. We may ask EDF to redo them,” he said. Doroszczuk said the overall safety of EDF’s reactors was satisfactory but urged the industry to maintain appropriate safety margins and not cut corners for financial reasons. He said the nuclear industry needed to improve its skills base to prevent technical problems.

2019-01-29,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2S6klHd By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline consumption was flat in the first 10 months of 2018 as escalating motor fuel prices offset the impact of a strong economy and big employment gains. Flat-lining U.S. gasoline consumption combined with surging U.S. shale production and a slowing global economy to push the oil market towards surplus and explains the plunge in prices late last year. Gasoline consumption averaged 9.34 million barrels per day (bpd) between January and October 2018, which was slightly down from 9.36 million bpd in the same period in 2017. Full-year consumption is forecast to have declined by around 40,000 bpd, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, December 2018). Consumption has shown little or no growth since 2017 after four years of variable but strong gains between 2013 and 2016 (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, Energy Information Administration, December 2018). Fuel use has flattened off even as the rate of economic growth has accelerated to an annual rate of more than 3 percent and almost 5 million non-farm jobs have been created since the end of 2016. But stagnating gasoline consumption has been consistent with a sharp slowdown in the growth of traffic on the nation's roads in the last two years (tmsnrt.rs/2S6klHd). Traffic volumes surged between 2014 and 2016, with vehicle-miles travelled often rising at year-on-year rates of 2-3 percent or more, but slowed sharply in 2017 and 2018, with gains slowing to 1 percent or less. Traffic volume in the three months from September to November 2018 was just 0.3 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier (“Traffic Volume Trends” Federal Highway Administration, December 2018). In the last quarter of a century, traffic growth has been closely correlated with both the state of the economy and changes in the cost of fuel. While the economy has remained supportive, higher oil prices have been strongly negative for gasoline consumption. Falling prices between 2014 and 2016 provided a stimulus to consumption but subsequent rises have caused that effect to unwind. The deceleration in U.S. gasoline consumption is one reason climbing oil prices helped push the global oil market towards a surplus in 2018 and why prices needed to fall to rebalance production and consumption. The impact of rising prices on U.S. motorists also explains why they are so sensitive for U.S. politicians and why President Donald Trump aggressively pressed OPEC to bring prices down last year. Finally, stagnating U.S. gasoline consumption explains why the oil market has become ever-more reliant on emerging markets and freight transport to absorb output growth from U.S. shale and other sources. Global oil consumption growth and prices have become increasingly sensitive to changes in economic growth outside the United States and the other advanced economies. As signs of a global slowdown in trade became evident in the second and third quarters of 2018, it became increasingly clear consumption growth would decelerate and prices would have to decline. Once the United States decided to grant generous sanctions waivers to Iran’s most important customers, allowing them to continue buying the country’s crude, the last remaining support was removed and prices fell. Lower prices are a necessary part of the market’s rebalancing process and, over time, should help restore some consumption growth in the United States and more importantly in emerging markets. But with so much consumption growth now geared towards China and other emerging markets, the outlook for market balance and prices in 2019/2020 will remain dominated by concerns about a possible global slowdown. Until the threat of a global slowdown is lifted, oil prices will struggle to recover, despite the efforts of OPEC and its allies to reduce production. Related columns: - Oil prices in 2019?

2019-01-29,"LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Major banks have stopped trading the bonds of Venezuela’s state owned oil firm PDVSA for clients after the United States imposed sweeping sanctions on the firm according to fund managers. The moves by Washington are set to ratchet up the pressure on Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro and will effectively prevent investors who operate in the United States from buying PDVSA bonds. “Most dealers are restricted from trading PDVSA now,” said Pala Asset Management’s David Nietlispach, adding that bond trading systems were now showing virtually no pricing for PDVSA debt, compared to at least 20 being available normally. A spokesman for Barclays, one of the big European banks said to have halted its PDVSA dealing, could not immediately confirm that its fixed income desk had told clients of its decision. Peter Kisler an emerging market portfolio manager at North Asset Manager added that most of the banks had stopped market making to give compliance departments time to go through the details of the U.S. sanctions. A fund manager at one major bank who requested anonymity added: “We have asked for runs (quotes) to see where the market is opening and all we are hearing in unison from the street is that ‘we are not allowed to trade them until further notice’”. “We heard this from all the major counter parties that have a Venezuela trading desk – JPMorgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley.” (Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker, Editing by William Maclean)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-bonds-sanctions-trading/investors-say-banks-have-halted-pdvsa-trading-after-us-sanctions-idUKL5N1ZT5NH,29 Jan 2019,"Major banks have stopped trading

2019-01-29,"PARIS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Public anger in France over increasing fuel prices, which gave rise to the anti-government “yellow vest” movement, has further boosted demand for crop-based ethanol fuel from motorists seeking cheaper deals, industry representatives said on Tuesday. Ethanol, which is blended with gasoline as part of renewable energy policy targets, had already benefited from a favourable environment in France in the past two years. A decline in diesel demand and the licensing of so-called “flex-fuel” kits to allow cars to run on high-ethanol fuel have contributed to an increase in its use. Ethanol in France is made using sugar beet or cereal. Fuel containing up to 10 percent ethanol, known as SP95-E10, reinforced its position last year as the best-selling gasoline type in France, claiming an average 43 percent market share compared with about 39 percent in 2017, ethanol producer group SNPAA said. The E85 mix, containing up to 85 percent ethanol, saw consumption jump by 55 percent, although it remained a small part of the gasoline market with a share of about 2 percent. Ethanol fuel has also benefited from French tax breaks that increase with higher blending levels, making E10 and E85 cheaper than other blends, even when factoring in ethanol’s lower fuel efficiency compared with traditional petrol. Selling at about half the price of E10, the E85 blend has attracted growing attention as rising fuel costs coincided with the spread of flex-fuel kits, SNPAA said. “Demand picked up from October 2017 when people heard about the authorisation for flex-fuel kits,” SNPAA secretary-general Sylvain Demoures told a news conference. “With the increase in fuel prices last summer, more people became interested ... and the trend was reinforced by the current (yellow vest) debate,” Demoures added. Higher fuel costs brought “yellow vest” protesters - who wear the fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to carry in their cars - onto the streets in November, before their movement then developed into a broader revolt against President Emmanuel Macron. Buying and installing a flex-fuel kit typically costs around 1,000 euros ($1,140), with payback in two years for an average French driver or in a year or less for heavy road users, kit suppliers said at the conference. Sales at kit supplier Biomotors climbed to more than 2,300 units in January, compared with about 1,200 per month on average last year, its managing director Alexis Landrieu said. Several French regions have offered aid to motorists to acquire flex-fuel kits, amid criticism that a government subsidy to trade in older cars for new models was inadequate for low-income households. $1 = 0.8757 euros

The main European and Asian markets held up well ahead of potentially galvanising events including a key Brexit vote on Tuesday, Wednesday’s U.S. Federal Reserve decision and Thursday’s conclusion of the latest Sino-U.S. trade talks. [.EU London’s FTSE rose 1.3 percent and Frankfurt and Paris both made ground, driven by utilities, healthcare, miners and other defensive stocks. Wall Street futures were also higher after series of profit alerts, including from digger maker Caterpillar, and U.S. charges against China’s telecom giant Huawei, sparked one of the S&P 500’s worst days of the year on Monday. For Asia, the blow had been cushioned by promises of more Chinese stimulus but Beijing had also berated Washington for blocking tactics in its World Trade Organisation appeal against U.S. tariffs. Amid the turmoil, safe-haven gold broke through $1,310 an ounce to reach its highest since May last year. “Investors are very cautious, with many uncertainties on U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit. Huawei is at the centre of the dispute, creating a very noisy background for the trade talks,” said Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets. “All these are making it more difficult for investors to judge the market’s direction. Money is fleeing into assets such as gold, seeking safety.” The Sino-U.S. moves, as well as bets that the Fed will sound more cautious on Wednesday, saw the dollar set a new two-week low and heightened the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. It lifted the euro too, while sterling held steady at $1.3166 and 86.88 pence to the euro before crucial parliamentary votes later aimed at breaking a deadlock over the manner of Britain’s exit from the European Union on March 29. ] There were plenty of pre-vote twists. Prime Minister Theresa May told her senior ministers that in order to win parliament’s support for her Brexit deal, the agreement she negotiated with Brussels would have to be reopened. “The prime minister said that in order to win the support of the House of Commons legal changes to the backstop will be required, that would mean reopening the Withdrawal Agreement (with the EU),” May’s spokesman told reporters. The main opposition Labour Party meanwhile said it was telling its lawmakers to vote for a plan that could give parliament the power to delay Brexit. Initial U.S. calls in a bumper day of results showed Xerox rising 5.8 percent in premarket trading after beating profit estimates, while Pfizer fell 1.7 percent and Harley-Davidson Inc plunged about 8 percent. Apple, which has already issued a profit warning this month due to weak demand from China, is due to report after the bell too. Most European government bond yields were little changed. Weaker economic data and unknowns like the trade feuds and Brexit have all boosted expectations that interest rates will stay low. New debt deals from Greece, Belgium and Austria were also coming through. The slide in rates has also encouraged governments to launch new bond deals. Even Angola, which has just taken IMF aid, said it was eyeing a bond sale. Asia had been more mixed, with losses for Australia and New Zealand stocks but Japanese and Chinese stocks both turned around early falls to finish higher. Markets will have plenty more catalysts this week with over 100 of the S&P500 companies reporting results, including other top tech firms such as Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow and S&P 500 each closed down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq was off more than 1 percent. The losses came after Caterpillar and Nvidia Corp joined a growing list of companies cautioning about the crippling effects of softening Chinese demand. “Both companies are seen as industry bellwethers, and their disappointing results provide further evidence that this time China’s slowdown is for real,” said Rodrigo Catril, Sydney-based strategist at National Australia Bank. Worryingly, earnings at China’s industrial firms too shrank in December, pointing to more troubles for the country’s vast manufacturing sector, already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures. Oil recovered after overnight losses. U.S. crude was last up 45 cents at $52.44 a barrel, while Brent gained 68 cents to $60.61. Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA on Monday, a step that is likely to curb its crude exports to the U.S. and ratchet up the pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.

2019-01-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Libya’s biggest oilfield, El Sharara, will remain shut until an armed group occupying the site leaves, the head of National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Tuesday, more than a month after the field closed because of a protest. “The armed group attempting to hold NOC and Libya’s economic recovery to ransom must leave the field before NOC will consider restarting production,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told a Chatham House conference in London. The field was producing as much as 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) ahead of its closure, but it has lost 13,000 bpd of capacity since last month due to security breaches, Sanalla told reporters on the sidelines of the event.  The oilfield has been under force majeure since December. Before the nation plunged into conflict in 2011, the site had the capacity to produce 340,000 bpd.  OPEC member Libya is now producing just below 1 million bpd, Sanalla said, below average production in 2018 of 1.1 million bpd. NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor. Libya’s oil industry has faced disruption since unrest began, with rival power centres in the west and east. Protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure. General Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), which is based in the east, launched a campaign this month in southwest Libya that it says aimed to combat militant groups and secure oil facilities in the area, including El Sharara. NOC is based in the capital Tripoli, in the country’s west, home to the internationally recognised government. Referring to the LNA initiative, Sanalla said the effort to restart the field “has been complicated further by the launch of an international counter-terrorism mission which has expanded into an attempt to seize control of territory, including potentially, national oil infrastructure”. “It is my concern that a sequence of events has been set in motion with unknowable consequences for Libya, and NOC,” he said. He said the preferred solution for securing the field involved deploying a Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG) force, managed by NOC, adding that NOC would adopt this option with “some reluctance”. Different factions of the PFG have previously been responsible for shutdowns at oil facilities.  He said NOC had suggested that, as an immediate measure, “a mixed force might provide a solution within a negotiated security framework” led by the Government of National Accord in Tripoli and with the support of the United Nations.

2019-01-29,"MADRID (Reuters) - Wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa forecast better profitability and said prices were stabilising on Tuesday, sending its shares as much as 9 percent higher. The company formed by a merger between Spain’s Gamesa and the wind power business of Siemens stuck to its guidance for an earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin of 7 to 8.5 percent for the full year. Chief Executive Marcus Tacke told analysts on a conference call he expects a stronger second half to the year, after the company said its EBIT margin for the October-December quarter fell to 6.1 percent from 6.3 percent. Siemens Gamesa, which vies with Denmark’s Vestas to lead the global wind turbine sector, said revenue for the period rose to 2.26 billion euros (1.96 billion pounds) from 2.13 billion a year earlier. Although shares in Siemens Gamesa initially fell by 2.5 percent on EBIT and net profit being below some expectations, they rebounded on the firm’s outlook and were up 9 percent at 1235 GMT, leading Spain’s IBEX index.     The company said profitability had been dragged down by pricing on a backlog of orders struck in 2018, a year in which they fell 9 percent, and a worse performance by its onshore unit.    Wind businesses around the world have faced margin pressure as governments phase out subsidies and move towards more competitive contract tenders.     Siemens Gamesa said market prices for turbines were stabilising and new orders in the first quarter were pricing broadly in line with those at the end of last year.  Banco Sabadell analysts said in a note that this explained some of the share gains, especially in view of a 3.5 percent fall in the firm’s shares the previous day.  “We take a positive view of the messages given by the company, especially those related to stability in prices and their confidence that they can reach the middle of the guidance range given for the year,” the analysts said. A trade row during which the United States and China imposed tariffs on each other’s imports has driven up the cost of steel, the main raw material for wind turbine parts. Tacke said Siemens Gamesa had taken this into account in giving guidance for future performance, but discussions between the two major economies now needed to play out.  “We still need to see how the recent discussion is going to be concluded, depending on if there is an upside or a downside opportunity out of it,” he said.  He reiterated an earlier calculation given by the company of an increase of 2-4 percent in the costs of U.S. projects, depending on the product.  additional reporting by Jose Elias Rodriguez; editing by Jason Neely and Alexander Smith",https://uk.reuters.com/article/siemensgamesa-results/update-3-siemens-gamesas-positive-margin-price-forecasts-lift-shares-idUKL5N1ZT1FA,29 Jan 2019,"* Revenue 2.26 bln euros, up from 2.13 bln a year before

2019-01-29,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany saw a sharp fall in the number of new onshore wind turbines installed last year, industry groups said on Tuesday, and warned there was little prospect of a recovery without government help.  Wind power is one of the most important drivers of Germany’s transition to renewable energy, accounting for nearly 30 percent of total power generation sent to public grids in 2018, according to Fraunhofer institute research. However, the rapid expansion in onshore wind energy achieved from 2013 to 2017 came to a halt last year due to red tape, opposition from local communities, and uncertainty among operators after the government abandoned 20-year fixed payments for new projects in favor of an auction system. Germany installed 2,402 megawatts (MW) worth of onshore wind turbines in 2018, down 55 percent from 2017, engineering group VDMA and wind energy association BWE said in a joint statement. The groups had expected 3,300 MW of additional capacity. “The stop and go must end,” said Matthias Zelinger, managing director at VDMA Power Systems, of government policy towards wind power. “A sustained and faster expansion of renewables would be logical, given that costs have been reduced and a plan to go without brown and hard coal-to-power generation has just been announced.” Zelinger said Germany risked falling behind EU rivals and overseas competitors in the battle to lead the global wind industry. VDMA represents companies such as Siemens Gamesa, Nordex and Senvion.  Wind has become all the more important as Germany wants to produce 65 percent of power from renewable sources by 2030, Zelinger said. A government-appointed commission at the weekend recommended a halving of coal plant capacity by that date as well as faster renewables growth, among a raft of related measures to meet that target and exit coal fully by 2038. A recovery in the wind industry could perhaps build from 2021, after parliament two months ago approved special 8,000 MW tenders for wind and solar energy plus an unspecified amount of offshore wind between 2019 and 2021, on top of regular tenders. This legislation was brought in to compensate for the ruling coalition’s move to shelve strict emissions targets for 2020 and instead push for more aggressive ones by 2030.

2019-01-29,"PARIS (Reuters) - Total and partners including China’s CNOOC have made a significant new gas discovery off the coast of Britain at the North Sea Glengorm prospect, with recoverable resources estimated at around 250 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Total said further drilling and testing would be carried out to appraise the resources and productivity of the reservoir. “Glengorm is another great success for Total in the North Sea, with results at the top end of expectations and a high condensate yield in addition to the gas,” said Kevin McLachlan, Total’s Senior Vice President for Exploration, in a statement. The discovery is close to existing infrastructures operated by Total and offers tie-back possibilities, such as the Elgin-Franklin platform and the Culzean project, scheduled to start production this year, the company said. It also presents upside potential with several other prospects identified on the same block, it added. Britain’s Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) welcomed the discovery as it underlined the area’s potential. “Our official estimate is that there still remains between 10 and 20 billion barrels plus to be recovered, so there is every chance of yet more significant finds, provided industry can increase exploration drilling,” said Andy Samuel, Chief Executive of the Oil & Gas Authority. Kevin Swann, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said that at 250 million boe, Glengorm was the largest gas discovery in the United Kingdom since Culzean in 2008. “This was third time lucky for CNOOC at Glengorm. Technical problems saw it try and fail to drill the prospect twice in 2017, so persistence has paid off. This is a good start to what could prove to be a pivotal year for UK exploration with several high impact wells in the plan,” Swann said.   Total holds a 25 percent working interest in Glengorm. China’s CNOOC Petroleum Europe Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited, holds a 50 percent stake and is the operator, while Euroil, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison E&P SpA, holds 25 percent.

2019-01-29,"BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it had concluded that U.S. soybeans can be used in biofuels in the European Union, part of the bloc’s push to improve strained trade relations with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump agreed in July not to impose tariffs on EU car imports while the two sides explored ways to boost trade including a possible deal to remove tariffs on non-auto industrial goods and to boost EU imports of U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas. The Commission said in a statement the recognition of U.S. soybeans for use in biofuels was valid until July 1, 2021, but could extend beyond that date as long as they met sustainability criteria set in new EU rules in the 2021-2030 period. “Today’s decision is new proof that the European Union is delivering on our commitments,” a Commission spokesman said. The Commission, which negotiates trade deals for the 28-nation EU, has said the July agreement led to a 112 percent rise in U.S. soybean imports in the second half of 2018. The U.S. share of the EU market is now about 75 percent. The increase has been driven by a slide in the U.S. soybean price, which slid after China imposed higher tariffs on U.S. beans in its trade row with Washington, rather than because of any concerted action by the EU, analysts said.

2019-01-29,"WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member’s crude exports to the United States and at pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down. Russia, a close ally of Venezuela, denounced the move as illegal interference in Venezuela’s affairs and said the curbs meant Venezuela would probably have problems servicing its $3.15 billion sovereign debt to Moscow. Minutes before the sanctions announcement, Juan Guaido, the opposition leader who proclaimed himself interim president last week with U.S. backing, said congress would name new boards of directors to the company and its U.S. subsidiary, Citgo. Guaido, supported by the United States and most countries in the Western Hemisphere, says Maduro stole his re-election and must resign to allow new, fair polls. Maduro, in a live national broadcast on Monday, accused the United States of trying to steal U.S. refining arm Citgo Petroleum, the OPEC member’s most important foreign asset, which also manages a chain of U.S. gas stations. He said Venezuela would take legal actions in response.  In the first sign of serious retaliation, three sources with knowledge of the decision said PDVSA had ordered customers with tankers waiting to load Venezuelan crude bound for the United States to prepay for the cargoes or they will be authorized to fill the vessels or leave the ports.  The Trump administration sanctions stopped short of banning U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil, but because the proceeds of such sales will be put in a “blocked account,” PDVSA is likely to quickly stop shipping much crude to the United States, its top client.  “If the people in Venezuela want to continue to sell us oil, as long as the money goes into blocked accounts we will continue to take it, otherwise will we not be buying it,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a White House briefing. Oil at sea, already paid for, would continue its journey to the United States, he said. White House national security adviser John Bolton said at the briefing the measure would cost Maduro $11 billion in lost export proceeds over the next year and block him from accessing PDVSA assets worth $7 billion. While there are significant exceptions, such as rules that should allow Citgo to keep using Venezuelan crude in U.S. refineries, the sanctions will likely cause some reordering of global oil flows as Venezuela seeks to sell elsewhere. Gulf refineries that use Venezuela’s heavy crude will have to look for alternatives to replace supplies. Despite a sharp decline in oil exports due largely to mismanagement of the industry and the economic crisis Venezuela remains the fourth-biggest vendor of oil to the United States, supplying some 500,000 barrels per day. Citgo, Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp are the three largest buyers of Venezuelan crude in the United States.  “They are not allowing tankers bound for Valero, Citgo and Chevron to leave Venezuelan ports if not prepaid,” a PDVSA source said referring to a decision by the company’s trade and supply division. Other exceptions in the sanctions will make it easier for Chevron Corp to keep participating in a joint venture in Venezuela, and allow U.S. entities in Venezuela to keep buying PDVSA gasoline.  In Moscow, Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said Venezuela could struggle to service its debt to Moscow. “There will probably be problems. Everything now depends on the army, on the soldiers and how faithful they will be to their duty and oath. It is difficult, impossible to give a different assessment,” he said on Tuesday. The Kremlin condemned the U.S. sanctions as illegal interference in Venezuela, while Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they looked like an attempt to confiscate Venezuelan state assets. The sanctions, contained in an executive order issued by U.S. President Donald Trump, freeze U.S.-based assets of PDVSA, Venezuela’s largest source of revenue. The Trump administration had long held off on targeting Venezuela’s vital oil sector for fear that it would hurt U.S. refiners and raise oil prices for Americans. White House officials had also expressed concern about inflicting further hardship on the Venezuelan people. The latest sanctions appear to seek to build on the momentum mounting in recent weeks against Maduro at home and abroad. U.S. officials said the sanctions on PDVSA were intended to prevent Maduro’s government from siphoning off funds from the oil company to maintain his grip on power. Mnuchin said oil supplies were sufficient to ensure no significant impact on U.S. gas prices in the short term. Even though the Venezuelan military has shown no sign of abandoning Maduro, Bolton said: “Our assessment based on numerous contacts on the ground is that the rank and file of the Venezuelan military is acutely aware of the desperate economic conditions in the country and we think they look for ways to support the National Assembly government.” Countries around the world have recognized Guaido, the National Assembly speaker, as Venezuela’s rightful leader, and the United States vowed to starve Maduro’s administration of oil revenue after he was sworn in on Jan. 10 for a second term that was widely dubbed illegitimate. Maduro has promised to stay in office, backed by Russia and China, which have bank rolled his government and fought off efforts to have his government disavowed by the United Nations. Bolton reiterated that Maduro would be held responsible for the safety of U.S. diplomatic personnel in Venezuela as well as Guaido and other opposition figures.

Despite the upcoming action - a key Brexit vote in the UK , Wednesday’s U.S. Federal Reserve decision and Thursday’s conclusion of the latest Sino-U.S. trade talks - European and Asian stocks held up relatively well. London’s FTSE rose 1 percent and Frankfurt and Paris both made some ground. Utilities and other safety plays benefited from a series of U.S. profit alerts, including from digger maker Caterpillar, overnight. News that the U.S had levelled charges against China’s telecom giant Huawei days before the next round of trade talks between Washington and Beijing knocked sentiment. But it was offset by promises of more economic stimulus from China, which had berated Washington on Monday for blocking the appointment of judges for its World Trade Organisation appeal against U.S. tariffs. Amid the turmoil, gold broke through $1,300 an ounce to reach its highest since mid June. “Investors are very cautious with many uncertainties on U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit. Huawei is at the centre of dispute, creating very noisy background for the trade talks,” said Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets. “All these are making it more difficult for investors to judge the market’s direction. Money is fleeing into assets such as gold, seeking safety.” ,” The U.S.-Sino moves, as well as bets that the U.S. Fed will sound more cautious on Wednesday, kept the dollar near a two-week low and heightened the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. Sterling held at $1.3166 and 86.88 pence to the euro before crucial votes later in the day aimed at breaking a deadlock in the UK parliament over Brexit . The pound has rallied 6 percent from Jan. 4 lows, but further gains may be limited unless lawmakers emerge with a big majority on the votes. Most European government bond yields were little changed. Weaker economic data and unknowns like the trade feuds and Brexit have all boosted expectations that interest rates will stay low. New debt deals from Greece, Belgium and Austria were also in the pipeline. The slide in rates has also encouraged governments to launch new bond deals. Even Angola, which has just taken IMF aid, said it was eyeing a bond sale. In Asia, shares were mixed, with losses for Australia and New Zealand, with their benchmark indices down 0.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Japanese and Chinese stocks both recovered from early wobbles to finish in the green. Markets will have more catalysts this week with over 100 of the S&P500 companies reporting results, including Amazon , Apple and Facebook. Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow and S&P 500 each closed down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq was off more than 1 percent. The losses came after Caterpillar and Nvidia Corp joined a growing list of companies cautioning about the crippling effects of softening Chinese demand. “Both companies are seen as industry bellwethers, and their disappointing results provide further evidence that this time China’s slowdown is for real,” said Rodrigo Catril, Sydney-based strategist at National Australia Bank. Worryingly, earnings at China’s industrial firms too shrank in December, pointing to more troubles for the country’s vast manufacturing sector, which are already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures. Oil recovered after overnight losses. U.S. crude was last up 35 cents at $52.34 a barrel; Brent gained 37 cents to $60.30. Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA on Monday, a step that is likely to curb its crude exports to the U.S. and ratchet up the pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.

2019-01-29,"(Repeats Jan. 23 story; no changes to text) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Collin Eaton Jan 23 (Reuters) - Potential U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s crude oil exports would cut off the nation from Gulf Coast refiners that are among its biggest customers, likely forcing it to send more crude to China, India or other Asian countries, traders said on Wednesday. U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela’s heavy crude would have even more trouble securing supplies as Canadian and Mexican crudes are often not as discounted and are limited in availability. The United States is considering moves to cripple Venezuela’s oil shipments, which account for nearly all of the country’s exports, in response to the reelection of President Nicolas Maduro that was widely viewed as a sham. Washington has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s president as protests against Maduro erupted across the country. It is also considering sanctions on oil deliveries, a move it has until now resisted, energy company sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Venezuela, on average, exported about 500,000 barrels of crude a day to the United States in 2018, according to U.S. Energy Department data. Those shipments fell in November to an estimated 358,000 barrels per day, however, according to a report by Caracas-based consultancy Gas Energy Latin America seen by Reuters. The U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years with more shipments going to Russia and China. [GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to the United States: tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB ] Those deliveries are being made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures as output from state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, has slumped to near 70-year lows in a nationwide economic crisis. Venezuela’s output has been cut in half since 2016 to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources. Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments, according to a Barclays research note published last week. In the wake of sanctions, the country could seek additional deals with Turkey, India or other Asian nations, one trader of Venezuelan crude said. Gas Energy’s report said India was the second-largest importer of Venezuelan crude in November. “It will be costly for Venezuela but eventually they’ll be able to sell that oil to Asia at a discount. There will be a period in the middle in which they have difficulty selling those barrels,” said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. [GRAPHIC: Top U.S. importers of Venezuelan crude: tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E ] Though the United States produces nearly 12 million barrels of oil a day, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply sub in light crude. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour WTC-MRS, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude WTC-HLS have risen as buyers scramble for supply. Mars traded at a $6.90 premium to U.S. crude on Wednesday, a five-year high, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, as bidders came into the market to secure supplies through the second quarter, traders said. “It would make a tight market even tighter. If it happens, it would be an unambiguous headwind for refiners already struggling to find supplies,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy in Bethesda, Maryland. [GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to U.S. refiners: tmsnrt.rs/2S42EI5. ] Traders said the United States may need to sell oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cover supply shortfalls as additional shipments are secured via Canada or Mexico.

2019-01-29,"NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - A top Myanmar investment official on Tuesday suggested alternatives such as downsizing or relocating a stalled Chinese-backed dam project that has strained ties between the neighbours.  Myanmar angered China in 2011 when its former quasi-civilian government suspended the $3.6 billion (2.7 billion pounds) Myitsone hydro-power dam in the country’s north amid environmental concerns. Asked about the dam at an investment conference, Thaung Tun, chairman of Myanmar’s investment commission, listed several problems, from an earthquake fault line running under the project site to a large catchment area affecting residents. “Catchment area would be twice the size of Singapore. This would mean that a lot of villages will have been displaced from their accessible land. That is the issue,” Thaung Tun told reporters at the conference in the capital Naypyitaw. Thaung Tun listed several alternatives, including scaling back the dam, moving it to a different location, or offering the operator an alternative project. He did not say if the government had a preferred option. Myanmar had to consider its relations with China, its largest trade partner, and “was working hard to find the solution,” he said. Spearheading these efforts is a commission launched by Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, which came to power in 2016, to review the dam. Myanmar also began informal talks with Beijing and dam operator Yunnan International Power Investment, a unit of State Power Investment Corp. China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters that the dam was a “commercial cooperation project” already agreed upon by both countries and had been through a complete approval process. “Relevant bodies and companies in China and Myanmar are in communication about this project, positively and appropriately handling problems that arise in the project’s cooperation process,” it said. Finding a solution is critical for Suu Kyi, who has benefited from Beijing’s support at the United Nations following a 2017 army crackdown that drove 730,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the former Burma. Myanmar also needs Beijing’s help in peace talks with several ethnic armed groups operating along northern and eastern borders with China. Thaung Tun said original plans for the dam were not “thought out” and failed to consider the impact on the community and the environment. The dam in the northern state of Kachin is very unpopular. Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) lost a seat in Kachin by-elections last year and party officials have voiced concern about their popularity in ethnic minority areas ahead of the 2020 general election. China’s Yunnan province, the planned destination for about 90 percent of the dam’s electricity, now has a power surplus, Thaung Tun said. “There’s no need for this dam now,” he said. On Monday, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi opened the first government-led investment conference by calling on global investors to put their money in Myanmar, seeking to offset the negative impact of the Rohingya crisis and slow pace of economic reforms.

2019-01-29,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday asked for China’s understanding over Malaysia’s plan to cancel a $20-billion rail project that spearheads China’s infrastructure push in the Southeast Asian nation, saying Kuala Lumpur could not afford it. Since winning power last May, Mahathir has repeatedly vowed to renegotiate or cancel what he calls “unfair” Chinese projects authorised by predecessor Najib Razak, whose near-decade long rule ended in electoral defeat amid a massive financial scandal.  The cabinet has decided to cancel the contract with China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCCC) for the East Coast Rail Link project, economic affairs minister Mohamed Azmin Ali said last week. “We seek understanding from the parties concerned,” Mahathir told reporters on Tuesday, adding that Malaysia was burdened with “heavy debt” and could not afford the project, one of the biggest signed in China’s signature Belt and Road initiative. “It is not because we want to frustrate or throw out the contract, it is because we are really tight in terms of finance.” The contract may cost the country more than 100 billion ringgit (18.49 billion pounds) in total, Mahathir said, adding that Malaysia would still have to pay a cancellation fee. “The huge compensation is not as huge as the amount of debt we will carry for the next 30 years.” The government was still determining how much to pay CCCC as cancellation fee, Azmin said last week. Government officials have previously said the project cost had been inflated.  In Beijing this week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was unaware of the project cancellation.  On Tuesday, Mahathir said an official statement is to be issued in the next few days, with the finance ministry to provide a detailed explanation soon.  In August Mahathir had said the project would be cancelled “for now”, but the government later said it was in talks with CCCC on the future of the rail line.  Mahathir has blamed Najib’s administration for taking total government debt and liabilities to more than 1 trillion ringgit, including that of scandal-plagued state fund 1MDB, which is being investigated for corruption in at least six countries.

2019-01-29,"BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The United States should bear responsibility for the consequences of its sanctions on Venezuela, China said on Tuesday, after Washington imposed sweeping restrictions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA. The latest U.S. sanctions announced on Monday appear to be aimed at pressuring President Nicolas Maduro to step down and to build on the momentum that has mounted in recent weeks against him at home and abroad. Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader who proclaimed himself interim president last week with U.S. backing, and who is supported by most Western countries, says Maduro stole his re-election and must resign to allow new, fair polls. China has said it opposes unilateral sanctions. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said historical experience showed foreign interference “only makes situations more complicated”. “The relevant country’s sanctions on Venezuela will lead to the deterioration of conditions of people’s lives,” Geng told a regular news briefing in Beijing, referring to the United States. “They should bear responsibility for the serious consequences from this,” he said. China has lent more than $50 billion to Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements over the past decade, securing energy supplies for its fast-growing economy. But the financing dried up as the South American country’s economy began spiralling downward in 2015, pressured by plummeting oil prices. The Trump administration had long held off targeting Venezuela’s oil sector for fear that it would hurt U.S. refiners and raise oil prices for Americans. White House officials had also expressed concern about inflicting further hardship on the Venezuelan people. Reporting by Michael Martina

2019-01-29,"PARIS/CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Total is launching its biggest exploration campaign for years in 2019 as part of a turnaround plan that is ditching the company’s focus on risky long-shots in favour of areas known to contain commercial levels of oil or gas. The French major aims to drill 23 wells this year, its senior vice president for exploration, Kevin McLachlan, told Reuters, in waters off Mauritania, Senegal, Namibia, South Africa, Guyana and Brazil. While the company declined to say how many wells it drilled in 2018, McLachlan said 2019 would be Total’s largest programme in years. The 23 wells planned represent about a trebling of the levels of 2017 and 2016, and is higher even than the 20 drilled in 2013, before the oil price crash. The company’s new game plan is to concentrate efforts on emerging and mature basins, which offer a greater chance of exploration success. It is moving away from its higher-risk, higher-reward strategy of targeting “frontier” areas that have not been commercially exploited, an approach which yielded scant rewards and saw outlier Total fall behind rivals. As a result the proportion of its exploration capital the African-focused company is spending on frontier areas has dropped to 15 percent, from 40 percent five years ago. “We were spending a lot of money in frontier,” said McLachlan, a Canadian geophysicist who joined Total in 2015 to lead the five-year revamp of its exploration strategy. “Now we want balance.”  Most of the wells it aims to drill this year will target known giant fields, he added.  Total has broken ranks with some rivals in recent years and largely ignored the rush to U.S. shale. It is looking to eke out conventional resources, particularly in Africa where it has the biggest industry presence. The strategy carries risks though, and has left the company exposed to the kind of political instability that has deterred others. McLachlan said Total’s exploration budget would remain broadly in line with 2018, when it was $1.2 billion, and 2017, when it was $1.1 billion. That is still less than half the level of 2014, when the price crash forced all majors to cut spending. Appraisals of discoveries in 2018 could offer signs that Total’s shift in exploration strategy is paying off. The company announced a 1 trillion cubic feet gas discovery off Shetland in the North Sea last year. Appraisals are ongoing for the Ballymore discovery in the Gulf of Mexico with Chevron, and Calypso in Cyprus with Eni.  A major discovery in 2019 could cement the turnaround after a drought between 2009 and 2014 when it spent billions in exploration with little barrels to show for it, while rivals Eni Exxon Mobil and BP, racked up successes. Yet there is still work to do in terms of converting exploration dollars into commercial success. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said Total had aggressively snapped up exploration blocks in 2017 and 2018, which took it to the top of the industry table with over 189,000 square km added since 2015 - around 70,000 higher than its nearest competitor. But in terms of discoveries since 2015, Total still lags some peers, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Andrew Latham.       “It is clearly behind Exxon Mobil. Exxon’s success in Guyana marks them out as industry leader,” said Latham, adding that Eni’s Zohr gas discovery in Egypt was the next top find. “Thereafter, it is competing well with the other majors, it has been involved in a string of multi-hundred million barrel big new finds, whereas in the previous four years it would have been one of the weaker or weakest of the majors.”     As part of its turnaround plan, Total has created five regional exploration hubs with a concentration of geoscientists, instead of teams spread out in 38 countries. A new, central 10-person leadership team reviews and chooses projects, compared with decisions being made locally before, while people with exploration track records have been placed in executive positions for the first time. Like some competitors, including Exxon and BP, Total is looking to deepwater exploration at a time when technological advances - particularly in 3D digital seismic imaging - is aiding a comeback in that area following a decade when industry advances have been focused on onshore shale. Of the 23 wells in Total’s drill programme this year, it has already started work at the deepwater Brulpadda field off South Africa. Two industry sources close to the project say the potential for a discovery is high and could signal a game-changer not only for Total, but also for the country. “We are expecting the results in the coming days,” Total’s Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said. While Total has said the field could hold between 500 million to over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, one of its partner in the project is more upbeat. “The outlook for finding hydrocarbons is extremely high. The question is whether it is gas or oil, and whether it is a good-quality reservoir,” Keith Hill, CEO of Africa Oil Corp, a minority stakeholder in the field, told Reuters, adding that the field could hold 1.5 to 3 billion barrels. Other oil companies and South African authorities are likely to be watching closing. “Any potential discovery will ultimately result in the attraction of other oil companies and the growing of the oil and exploration and production industry in South Africa,” said Viljoen Storm, acting chief executive of the country’s state-owned Petroleum Agency.

2019-01-29,"NAYPYITAW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A top Myanmar investment official on Tuesday suggested alternatives such as scaling back or relocating a stalled Chinese-backed dam project that has strained ties between the neighbours. Myanmar angered China in 2011 when its former quasi-civilian government suspended the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydro-power dam in the country’s north amid environmental concerns. Asked about the dam at an investment conference, Thaung Tun, chairman of Myanmar’s investment commission, listed several problems, from an earthquake fault line running under the project site to a large catchment area affecting residents. “Catchment area would be twice the size of Singapore. This would mean that a lot of villages will have been displaced from their accessible land. That is the issue,” Thaung Tun told reporters at the conference in the capital Naypyitaw. Thaung Tun listed several alternatives, including scaling back the dam, moving it to a different location, or offering the operator an alternative project. He did not say if the government had a preferred option. Myanmar had to consider its relations with China, its largest trade partner, and “was working hard to find the solution,” he said. Spearheading these efforts is a commission launched by Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, which came to power in 2016, to review the dam. Myanmar also began informal talks with Beijing and dam operator Yunnan International Power Investment, a unit of State Power Investment Corp. China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has previously said it would “maintain communication” with Myanmar over the project. Finding a solution is critical for Suu Kyi, who has benefited from Beijing’s support at the United Nations following a 2017 army crackdown that drove 730,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the former Burma. Myanmar also needs Beijing’s help in peace talks with several ethnic armed groups operating along northern and eastern borders with China. Thaung Tun said original plans for the dam were not “thought out” and failed to consider the impact on the community and the environment. The dam in the northern state of Kachin is very unpopular. Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) lost a seat in Kachin by-elections last year and party officials have voiced concern about their popularity in ethnic minority areas ahead of the 2020 general election. China’s Yunnan province, the planned destination for about 90 percent of the dam’s electricity, now has a power surplus, Thaung Tun said. “There’s no need for this dam now,” he said. On Monday, Nobel laureate Suu Kyi opened the first government-led investment conference by calling on global investors to put their money in Myanmar, seeking to offset the negative impact of the Rohingya crisis and slow pace of economic reforms.

2019-01-29,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - European companies bought a record amount of wind power capacity last year, as energy-hungry businesses like aluminum producers and IT giants look for greener ways to drive their machinery and data centers. As wind power becomes competitive on price with conventional energy in many countries, big companies have rushed to secure renewable energy to manage costs and reduce their carbon emissions, while boosting their image with customers. New wind deals through so-called corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) were signed in Europe last year for 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, up from 1.3 GW in 2017, according to new data from industry body WindEurope. Some companies have turned their support for wind power into a marketing opportunity, with the world’s top brewer AB InBev running an advert during American Football’s Super Bowl to say its Budweiser beer is made by using 100 percent renewable energy - to a backing track of Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in The Wind”. Wind power PPAs signed by companies in Europe have now reached a total capacity of 5 GW, almost the same as Denmark’s total wind energy capacity, WindEurope said. In 2018, the biggest buyers of wind power in Europe were aluminum producers Norsk Hydro and Alcoa, which both signed big deals to buy power from farms in Norway and Sweden. In July, Hydro signed the world’s longest corporate PPA - for 29 years - with Green Investment Group (GIG), a unit of Australian investment bank Macquarie. The PPA market was traditionally driven by the IT sector to power data centers, but other industries have since joined in. Carmaker Mercedes-Benz announced its first PPA deals in Poland and Germany in 2018, with the latter set to power its electric vehicle and battery manufacturing. While companies are interested in buying renewable power to reduce their carbon emissions and manage volatile energy costs, wind firms are looking at new ways to secure income as the subsidies that have underpinned the industry taper off. In the United States, companies like Alphabet’s Google, Facebook and Walmart have already developed a mature market for corporate PPAs. Corporate and other non-utility customers signed nearly 40 percent of capacity contracted in the United States in the third quarter, according to data from the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA).

The mood was expected to be subdued elsewhere with spreadbetters suggesting a tentative start for Europe while futures for the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq were each off 0.2 percent. In Asia, the losses were led by Australia and New Zealand, with their benchmark indices down 0.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Chinese shares opened in the red, then recovered in the afternoon. Shanghai’s SSE Composite was up 0.1 percent while the blue-chip index climbed 0.4 percent. Overall, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was still down 0.2 percent even after recouping some of its earlier losses. Japan’s Nikkei, down about 1 percent almost all day, turned around to end 0.1 percent higher. Despite the late uptick in share prices, the mood was still gloomy after the U.S. Justice Department unsealed indictments against China’s top telecom equipment maker, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, accusing it of bank and wire fraud to evade Iran sanctions and conspiring to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile US Inc. The jolt threatens to undermine prospects for a trade deal between the economic giants as markets nervously await a round of trade talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He set to meet U.S. officials on Wednesday and Thursday. Further complicating matters, China triggered the legal process on Monday for the World Trade Organization to hear Beijing’s challenge to U.S. tariffs, and berated the United States for blocking the appointment of judges who could rule on it. Souring U.S.-China relations roiled global markets for much of last year, and have kept investors on the back foot this month. The trade war’s broadening impact on world growth is one reason the U.S. Federal Reserve has signalled it will be patient on policy after raising rates four times in 2018. Indeed, many economists, including the International Monetary Fund, have cut their forecasts for global growth this year, citing the U.S.-China trade war. “Slowdown is feeding into some acute areas of economic unease,” U.S. bank Citi said in a note, citing recent disappointing factory output data out of Europe and China. It noted that investors were pricing in a 1 percent contraction in global earnings per share (EPS) this year. “This would be the worst year-on-year percentage change in EPS since 2015” even though economic growth is likely to be much higher this year than seen in 2015, the note said. Markets will have more catalysts this week with over 100 of the S&P500 companies reporting results, including Amazon , Apple and Facebook. Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow and S&P 500 each closed down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq was off more than 1 percent. The losses came as shares of Caterpillar and Nvidia Corp nosedived after the two manufacturers joined a growing list of companies cautioning about the crippling effects of softening Chinese demand. “Both companies are seen as industry bellwethers and their disappointing results provide further evidence that this time China’s slowdown is for real,” said Rodrigo Catril, Sydney-based strategist at National Australia Bank. Worryingly, earnings at China’s industrial firms too shrank in December, pointing to more troubles for the country’s vast manufacturing sector already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures. Slowdown fears slugged the U.S. dollar, which faltered to its lowest in two weeks on Monday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 95.733. Against the safe haven Japanese yen, the dollar was down at 109.32, on track for a third straight session of losses. The downbeat global growth impulse mean investors will look for further confirmation the Fed will pause its rate-hike cycle at a two-day policy meeting ending Wednesday.

2019-01-29,"CARACAS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Venezuelans braced for the deepening of a brutal economic crisis on Tuesday after the United States imposed sanctions sharply curbing the country’s vital oil exports, while the socialist government responded by refusing to load crude cargoes without payment. The Trump administration hopes the sanctions, which bar state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela from collecting proceeds from crude sales to U.S. refineries, pressure President Nicolas Maduro to step down and allow opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido to call elections. In a defiant national broadcast on Monday night, Maduro said he would take legal action to challenge the sanctions and defend Citgo Petroleum Corp, PDVSA’s U.S. refining subsidiary, which he accused the United States of trying to steal. He also pledged to retaliate, but did not announce any specific measures. “We will provide the reciprocal and convincing response needed to defend Venezuela’s interests in due time,” Maduro said. PDVSA responded to the sanctions by ordering customers with tankers waiting to load crude destined for the United States to prepay, according to three sources with knowledge of the decision. Such prepayment could be in violation of the sanctions, setting the stage for a standoff at the ports. The loss of revenue from the United States, the No. 1 buyer of Venezuelan crude, was sure to further hamper the government’s ability to import basic goods like food and medicine, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that has prompted more than 3 million people to flee the hyperinflation-stricken country in recent years. “If you do not find a place for that crude quickly, the room for maneuver will shrink and imports will be affected,” said Asdrubal Oliveros, director of Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalitica. Guaido, who argues that Maduro usurped the presidency on taking office for a second six-year term on Jan. 10 following a May 2018 election considered fraudulent by the opposition, has said he is prepared to receive $20 million in humanitarian aid pledged by the United States. He also moved to set up new boards of directors for Citgo and PDVSA, which could allow his parallel government to collect money held in escrow accounts in the United States. But to truly control state functions, he would need the support of the military. It has so far stood by Maduro, who has kept officers’ support in part by granting them control of key state institutions like PDVSA, although the company’s output has collapsed in just over a year of military rule. The sanctions threatened to hasten PDVSA’s unraveling. “There is total shock. This company is already too beat-down,” a high-level manager said on Monday on condition of anonymity.

2019-01-29,"(Repeats with no change in text) By Marianna Parraga Jan 28 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run company oil company, PDVSA, hit by U.S. sanctions on Monday, ordered customers with tankers waiting to load Venezuelan crude bound for the United States to pay for the cargoes before they depart, three sources with knowledge of the decision told Reuters. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, in a move aimed at limiting embattled President Nicolas Maduro’s access to oil revenues, stopped PDVSA from collecting the proceeds of oil exported to U.S. customers, while freezing assets of PDVSA’s units, including U.S. refining arm Citgo Petroleum Corp. Maduro, whose authority is being challenged by the self-proclaimed president and head of the congress, Juan Guaido, said earlier his government would start legal action to protect Citgo. He did not mention if PDVSA planned changes to its exports. “They are not allowing tankers bound for Valero, Citgo and Chevron to leave Venezuelan ports if not prepaid,” a PDVSA source said, referring to a decision by the company’s trade and supply division. Venezuela exports about 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to the United States. Citgo, Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp are the three largest buyers of Venezuelan crude in the United States. Valero said it planned to “comply with the sanctions” and diversify oil purchases to reduce the impact on its business. “Valero will continue to support the Administration and will provide officials with relevant information that will help the U.S. refining system to function efficiently,” it said in a statement. Refining firm Phillips 66, another buyer of Venezuelan oil until last year, said it expected to be able to obtain alternative crude grades and “mitigate any disruption in crude supply for our operations.” Traders and shippers with tankers anchored around Venezuelan ports said they saw no clear way for U.S. customers to pay for Venezuelan crude after sanctions, even if payments are intended to be made before loading. According to the new sanctions, any proceeds from Venezuelan crude exported to U.S. companies will stay in special bank accounts in the United States. The trading sources said they feared the European Union may follow with similar measures freezing PDVSA’s accounts in Europe. Several years ago, PDVSA moved its bank accounts that receive money from oil exports mainly to China. It also has accounts in Europe. But U.S. firms willing to transfer money to those foreign accounts still need to find correspondent banks in the United States willing to authorize the transactions, which is difficult because of sanctions.

2019-01-29,"ISLAMABAD, Jan 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Pakistan’s government has proposed to eliminate taxes associated with manufacturing of solar and wind energy equipment in the country, in an effort to boost the production and use of renewable power and overcome power shortages. A new government budget bill, expected to be approved in parliament within a month, would give renewable energy manufacturers and assemblers in the country a five-year exemption from the taxes. “Pakistan is paying the heavy cost of an ongoing energy crisis prevailing for the last many years,” Finance Minister Asad Umar said last week in a budget speech. “In this difficult time, the promotion of renewable energy resources like wind and solar has become indispensable.” Only about 5 to 6 percent of the power to Pakistan’s national electrical grid currently comes from renewable energy, according to the country’s Alternate Energy Development Board (AEDB). The proposed tax reduction should boost that by encouraging greater local manufacturing of equipment needed for renewable power expansion, said Asad Mahmood, a renewable energy expert with the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, which sits within the Ministry of Energy. But manufacturers said the tax breaks likely would not be sufficient to spur expansion of local renewable energy industries. Naeem Siddiqui, the chairman of Ebox Systems, which assembles solar panels in Islamabad, said the new tax breaks were good news but Pakistani manufacturers would still struggle compete with tax-free, low-priced imports of foreign-built solar panels and other renewable energy equipment. “The government has already waived off taxes and duties on the import of renewable energy products, and local manufacturers cannot compete with the low-priced imported items,” he said. Pakistan today imports more than 95 percent of the solar panels and other renewable energy systems it uses, largely from China, said Aamir Hussain, chief executive officer of Tesla PV, one of the largest manufacturers of solar energy products in Pakistan. “As long as the government will not impose duties on the import of finished products, the local market cannot grow,” he said. Pakistani manufacturers also might need government help in pushing sales of new Pakistani clean energy products abroad, in order to build bigger markets and lower manufacturing costs, Siddiqui said. Mahmood, of the energy ministry, said he believed the government would also move to cut existing duties on the import of components used in manufacturing finished renewable energy products, in order to help Pakistani manufacturers. Taxes on those components have pushed up prices of Pakistani-made renewable energy systems, making them harder to sell and leading several companies to the brink of failure, he said. Local manufacturers should work with the government to determine which components should be manufactured locally and which imported to ensure costs of locally made wind and solar systems are competitive, he said. Muhammad Abdur Rahman, managing director of Innosol, a company that imports and installs renewable energy systems, said that cheap imports of renewable energy systems from China remain the main barrier to building more such systems in Pakistan. “The local industry is facing pricing issues because of low-quality solar energy appliances being imported in the country that are very cheap as compared to the local market,” he said. That might be resolved in part by the government starting a certification system for renewable energy products to grade them according to quality, he said. Amjad Ali Awan, chief executive officer of the Alternate Energy Development Board, said the aim of the new policies was for renewable energy to supply 28 to 30 percent of the country’s national electrical grid by 2030.

2019-01-29,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * MSCI ex-Japan weakens, Nikkei soft too * Investors wary about growth after Caterpiller, Nvidia results * Markets eye U.S.-China trade talks, Fed policy meeting By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Asian shares faltered on Tuesday and the dollar hovered near two-week lows as prospects for a Sino-U.S. trade deal was dealt a blow after the United States charged Chinese telecom firm Huawei with bank fraud and for conspiring to steal trade secrets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.5 percent with Australia’s benchmark index down 0.7 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI off 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei slid over 1 percent. U.S. stock futures also lost ground following from a torrid overnight session on Wall Street, with E-Minis for the S&P 500 down 0.5 percent. Investors were nervously awaiting a fresh round of U.S.-China trade talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meeting U.S. officials on Wednesday and Thursday. Prospects for a deal between the economic giants will be tested as the U.S. Justice Department unsealed indictments against China’s top telecom equipment maker, Huawei, accusing it of bank and wire fraud to evade Iran sanctions and conspiring to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile US Inc. Souring U.S.-China relations roiled global markets for much of last year, and have now started to hurt world growth, one reason the U.S. Federal Reserve has signalled it will be patient on policy after raising rates four times in 2018. Overnight, markets got a reminder of the potentially damaging economic impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war as Wall Street stocks were hit by profit warnings. The losses came as shares of Caterpillar and Nvidia Corp nosedived after the two manufacturers joined a growing list of companies cautioning about the crippling effects of softening Chinese demand. Caterpillar plunged more than 9 percent for its worst single-day drop since August 2011 while chipmaker Nvidia slid 13.8 percent. “Both companies are seen as industry bellwethers and their disappointing results provide further evidence that this time China’s slowdown is for real,” said Rodrigo Catril, Sydney-based strategist at National Australia Bank. The downbeat global growth impulse mean investors will look for further confirmation the Fed will pause its rate-hike cycle at a two-day policy meeting ending Wednesday. Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow and S&P 500 each closed down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq was off more than 1 percent. Worryingly, earnings at China’s industrial firms too shrank in December, pointing to more troubles for the country’s vast manufacturing sector already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures. Slowdown fears slugged the U.S. dollar which faltered to its lowest in two weeks on Monday. The dollar’s index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 95.766. Against the safe haven Japanese yen, the dollar was down at 109.16, on track for a third straight session of losses. Markets will have more catalysts this week with over a 100 of the S&P500 companies reporting results, including Amazon , Apple and Facebook. Many economists, including the International Monetary Fund, have cut their forecasts for global growth this year citing the U.S.-China trade war. “Slowdown is feeding into some acute areas of economic unease,” U.S. investment bank Citi said in a note, citing recent disappointing factory output data out of Europe and China. “In some respects, markets seem to have reacted more to recent negative changes in economic data than at other points in recent decades,” it added, while noting investors are now pricing in a 1 percent contraction in global earnings per share (EPS) this year. “This would be the worst year-on-year percentage change in EPS since 2015” even though economic growth is seen much higher this year than in 2015. Elsewhere, Sterling dithered against the dollar ahead of voting in Britain’s parliament on Tuesday that aims to break the Brexit deadlock. It was last at $1.3145 Oil remained on a slippery slope with U.S. crude down 0.17 pct at $51.90 a barrel and Brent easing a shade to $59.90 a barrel. U.S. gold futures hovered near a seven-month high around $1,303.6 per ounce. Spot gold was last at 1,303.8 after breaking above a key psychological barrier of $1,300 an ounce on Friday.

2019-01-29,"(Repeats Jan. 28 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ThSHUZ By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers stepped up their purchases of oil and refined products last week on growing hopes of a U.S.-China trade truce and that the global economy will avoid a severe slowdown in 2019. But fund buying has been concentrated in crude rather than fuels, which is consistent with producer club OPEC tightening the supply side of the market while the demand outlook remains more uncertain. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted their net long position in Brent crude futures and options by 30 million barrels to 203 million barrels in the week to Jan. 22 (tmsnrt.rs/2ThSHUZ). Portfolio managers have raised their net long position in Brent in six of the last seven weeks, by a combined 66 million barrels since Dec. 4, according to exchange data. Funds now hold four bullish long positions in Brent for every one bearish short position, up from a ratio of just over 2:1 in early December, but far from the recent peak of 19:1 at the end of September. Fund managers also increased their net long position in European gasoil for the third week running by 4 million barrels to 15 million barrels. Gasoil positions are up by 13 million barrels since the end of December. In both cases, however, most of the new buying last week came from the closure of existing short positions rather than opening fresh long ones. It follows the largest sell-off ever recorded in crude and gasoil during the fourth quarter and confirms many fund managers sense prices have found a floor, at least temporarily. The preponderance of short-covering suggests most managers think oil prices will not fall further rather than any great optimism about future increases. By cutting oil production early and aggressively, OPEC has removed some of the downside risk to oil prices in 2019 but the upside potential remains unclear until the threat of recession is resolved.

2019-01-29,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sees coal as a key way to boost the economy, but burning more coal may worsen pollution in a country already choking on some of the world’s most toxic air. With the country staggering under the weight of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme and human rights violations, defectors and analysts say Pyongyang has increased the domestic use of coal, which is blocked for export. Seven coal power plants and one oil-fired plant produce nearly 50 percent of North Korea’s electricity, with the rest coming from hydro power, according to South Korean government data. For households, coal is also a key fuel source for cooking and heating. But an increased reliance, which Kim announced in his New Year address, may have deadly implications. Per capita, North Korea’s air pollution mortality rate was the world’s highest at 238.4 deaths per 100,000 population as of 2012, a 2017 report from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed. That was 10 times higher than the rate in South Korea and higher than those of China and India, where smog often envelops major cities.  North Korea has acknowledged the correlation between coal and polluted air, but said it has had limited access to cleaner options.  “A combination of limited capital investment in infrastructure, limited access to efficient and low emission technologies ... and reliance on energy produced from coal in low efficiency thermal power plants has impacted air quality in urban and industrial areas,” North Korea’s 2012 report on environment and climate change outlook submitted to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said. According to the report, coal is the main fuel used by homes in North Korean cities. In rural areas, wood is the main source, while coal comes in second. Many rural North Koreans say they’re aware of the pollution, but have more pressing problems. “From the moment we woke up, we had to think about how much rice was left in our jar and how much firewood we had,” said Ji Cheol-ho, a North Korean defector who lived in a coal mine town in North Hamgyong province before fleeing to the South in 2007.  “We don’t die right away from eating dust, but we do if we don’t eat food,” said Ji, now an official at NAUH, a human rights activist group, who regularly talks to sources inside the North.    Analysts say North Korea has typically reserved its higher-quality coal for export. Using it domestically instead would have at least a small impact on minimising additional pollution, experts say. “Using good quality of coal would reduce emissions,” said Kim Yong-pyo, professor of chemical engineering & material science at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.  But North Korean facilities lack sufficient filtering, so using more coal of any kind would likely lead to more carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, he said. Reuters journalists in Pyongyang late last year observed thick smoke pouring from the stacks of several facilities, often covering parts of the capital in smog. To raise public awareness about air pollution in 2017, North Korea’s state television aired a special warning about it and provided tips such as wearing masks. In 2003, North Korea set goals to address air pollution, and is working to upgrade older thermal power plants, according to reports the country submitted to UNEP and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But “limited technical and financial resources” prevented detailed monitoring of air quality, the report said, and it is not clear whether the North Korean government followed through on its recommendations.     Experts say a lack of reliable data make it difficult to gauge exactly how much damage Kim Jong Un’s coal plan might do to the environment and air quality. But they agree it will have an impact outside his country’s borders, especially in South Korea, Kim Yong-pyo said. Air pollution harms and kills millions of people every year, especially in Asia, according to the WHO. In South Korea, up to 20 percent of air pollutants are estimated to originate in the North, experts say. In a 2017 survey by the state-funded Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, South Korean respondents said air pollution was their biggest concern, eclipsing even North Korea’s nuclear threats. Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in promised last year to restore the North’s damaged forests in an effort to fight air pollution.      “Some air pollutants travel over to the South from the North. If forests are built well ... those could be reduced,” South Korea’s Forest Service minister Kim Jae-hyun, who visited Pyongyang last year to discuss the matter, told reporters in January.  Kim Soon-tae, a professor of environment and safety engineering at Ajou University, who has studied the impact of North Korean pollutants, said better data from the North is essential to devising air pollution policies in the South. “North Korea’s air quality is our homework to do, and we have to think about North Korean people’s health as well,” Kim said.

2019-01-29,"SYDNEY, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Tuesday, edging up from a near two-week low in the previous session when prices fell around 3 percent on fears of supply growth and a global economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.07 per barrel, up 8 cents from their last settlement. WTI futures closed down 3.2 percent on Monday when prices touched $51.33 a barrel - the lowest since Jan. 17. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing down 2.8 percent in the previous session when prices hit a low of $59.49 a barrel - the lowest since Jan. 15. “Rising supplies continue to put downward pressure on crude prices despite the efforts of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers to limit production,” said Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst, OANDA. U.S. drillers added 10 oil rigs last week, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday, in another sign of the expanding record U.S. crude production that has soured market sentiment.
