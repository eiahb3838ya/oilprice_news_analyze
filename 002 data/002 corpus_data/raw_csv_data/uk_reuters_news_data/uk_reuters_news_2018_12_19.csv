2018-12-19,"(Adds comment from Anadarko Petroleum) By Liz Hampton Dec 19 (Reuters) - Colorado oil and gas producers could soon face a tougher permitting process as newly elected state officials take office and revamp regulations, the incoming speaker of the state’s House of Representatives said on Wednesday. The change comes after voters in the fifth-biggest U.S. oil-producing state in November elected a wave of Democratic lawmakers who want restraints on fossil-fuel production. At the same time, however, state voters rejected a proposal that would have required at least 2,500 feet (762 meters) of separation between new wells and homes, schools and parks. Newly elected officials want increased local control over the development of oil and gas activities, potentially creating new hurdles for some projects, KC Becker, House speaker-elect, told oil industry analysts and investors on a conference call hosted by Robert W. Baird & Co. “Some things the industry is not going to like,” she said during the call. “I think they’re always nervous about anything that could slow down permitting. That could end up happening.” This week, the state’s oil regulator revised drilling setbacks near school properties. The change requires a 1,000-foot (305 m) setback be measured from outdoor playgrounds and athletic fields rather than from buildings. Colorado’s oil output is nearing half a million barrels per day, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Newly elected state officials have outlined plans to diversify its energy mix and environmental groups have pledged to bring tougher regulations to the oil industry. Colorado Governor-elect Jared Polis, a Democrat, has said he wants all the electricity on the state’s grid to come from renewable energy by 2040. Meanwhile, Colorado Rising, a group that pushed the failed November setback initiative, has formed an exploratory committee to begin looking at a 2020 ballot initiative to “address the dangers of oil and gas extraction,” the group said in a release last week. Oil producers with operations in Colorado, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Noble Energy Inc, contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to efforts to thwart the 2018 setback measure. Anadarko said modifying the setback rule “was a meaningful step forward”, and Noble referred questions to the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, which said it was “proud of what has been accomplished” from meetings with school districts and environmental groups to develop the revised setback.

2018-12-19,"(Add details, back ground) CAIRO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - South Sudan on Wednesday exported one million barrels of oil from its Toma South oilfield via its northern neighbour Sudan’s ports, Sudanese news agency SUNA said. Sudan’s oil minister, Azhari Abdel Qader, said the exports were a result of “the efforts of President Omar al-Bashir and his counterpart Salva Kiir to achieve peace and stability in South Sudan,” SUNA said. Abdel Qader also said the two countries are negotiating with a Russian company to build a refinery on the Red Sea for both countries’ benefit. The agency did not identify the Russian company. South Sudan’s oil minister Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth told SUNA that oilfields in South Sudan’s Wahda region will begin production at the end of this month in cooperation with Sudan. Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir had said in August that oil would be pumped from Wahda to Sudan beginning on Sept. 1, after the South Sudan government signed a final Sudanese-brokered peace deal with its main rebel group.

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets gave up earlier gains and continued a weeklong sell-off on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a fresh interest rate hike and said “some” further rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead.  The decision, announced at 2 p.m. Eastern time (1900 GMT), slashed more than 700 points off of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and sent MSCI’s index of global stocks down nearly 0.9 percent for the day. The index is down nearly 13 percent since the start of December due to concerns that global economic growth is slowing. “This is clearly a disappointment for those hoping for a dovish rate hike,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston. “It is a more moderate rate hike but it is a rate hike and there is still a gap between where the Fed is and where the market is in terms of policy expectations for next year.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 351.98 points, or 1.49 percent, to 23,323.66, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 39.2 points, or 1.54 percent, to 2,506.96 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 147.08 points, or 2.17 percent, to 6,636.83. U.S. stocks are on pace tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks added to the selling pressure in U.S. stocks when he said the pace of the balance sheet reduction is on a preset course and adjusting the pace of the balance sheet reduction is not an option at this time. The U.S. central bank’s rate hike will likely dampen investor appetite for riskier assets throughout the globe, said Jorge Mariscal, emerging markets chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.  “People are worried about growth and to hear the Fed isn’t (worried) concerns the market,” he said. “In turn, that supports the U.S. dollar and that is negative news for emerging markets in general.” The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan, which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy.  Logistics and delivery firm FedEx Corp, (FDX.N) considered a bellwether for the world economy, slashed 2019 forecasts, noting “ongoing deceleration” in global growth. The company’s shares sunk over 12 percent, pushing its stock down nearly 35 percent since the start of the year.  “It’s a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown. More importantly, the market is adjusting to the idea this will translate into lower earnings growth,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking at Union Bancaire Privee in Zurich. Expectations of slower growth and the equity sell-off have sent 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest since August.  Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 16/32 in price to yield 2.7655 percent, from 2.823 percent late on Tuesday. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.02 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.08 percent to $1.137.

2018-12-19,"HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. and Norwegian oil majors Chevron and Equinor (EQNR.OL) have become the latest target of activist investors moving to force five of the biggest oil companies to commit to fixed emissions targets and align with the Paris climate agreement.     The effort, part of a wave of climate-related proxy resolutions planned for spring 2019 annual shareholder meetings, is being led by investor groups Follow This, As You Sow and Arjuna Capital. The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a goal of capping temperature warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) before the turn of the century. The activist investors of Chevron Corp said on Wednesday they had filed annual meeting resolutions calling for the oil company to embrace greenhouse gas reductions. They now want Chevron (CVX.N) to report on how it can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris accord, arguing climate change presents “portfolio risks to investors,” according to a copy of the resolution reviewed by Reuters. Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     “We filed the first carbon asset risk resolution in 2013,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow. “There has been progress, but not enough.” In Europe, Follow This filed a climate resolution for Equinor’s 2019 annual general meeting, mirroring its activist moves on BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS). A spokesman for Equinor said it was supporting the Paris climate agreement. “We have our own climate roadmap and clear goals for how to cut Co2 emission,” he said. Following pressure from its investors, Shell made a U-turn setting out plans to introduce three-year or five-year carbon emissions targets linked to customers’ use of its fuels and affecting executive pay beginning in 2020. BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) also have set short-term targets on reducing their own carbon dioxide emissions.  When asked why Follow This has not targeted Total and Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), the group’s founder Mark van Baal said ownership thresholds make it harder to file resolutions in some countries, for example, a 1 percent hurdle in France. This week, two other groups of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) investors said they would file a shareholder resolution calling on the world’s largest oil company to set targets.  This year, Chevron resolutions to limit its methane emissions and to adapt its business to a low carbon economy received 45 percent and 8 percent support, respectively.

2018-12-19,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers from both U.S. parties introduced legislation on Wednesday to give Congress more say in any deal on civil nuclear power cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia.  The Trump administration is eager to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia to share nuclear power technology with the kingdom, as the domestic industry struggles to compete with lower-priced power sources such as natural gas. But the talks have come under scrutiny since the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Despite President Donald Trump’s desire to maintain close ties to Saudi Arabia, several of his fellow Republicans have joined Democrats in blaming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi’s death. The crown prince has denied knowledge of the operation that killed Khashoggi. The No Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act would require the House of Representatives and the Senate to approve any so-called 123 agreement with the kingdom. Typically, such agreements go into effect unless majorities of Congress pass joint resolutions of disapproval.   It is unlikely that the legislation will pass before the end of the current Congress in January, but the bill raises scrutiny of any deal. It also calls on Saudi Arabia to release details of Khashoggi’s killing before a deal is approved. Concern about whether Saudi Arabia could use nuclear power to develop a weapons program mounted after the crown prince told CBS in an interview in March that his kingdom would develop nuclear weapons if its archrival Iran did.  “This legislation would ensure that we put key checks in place to ensure that Saudi Arabia never ends up with the U.S. technology or materials to make a nuclear bomb, and that Congress is the final say,” said Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat.  Markey introduced the bill with Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican. Representatives Brad Sherman, a Democrat, and Luke Messer, a Republican, have introduced companion legislation in the House.   The talks have slowed as Saudi pushed for relaxing nonproliferation guidelines, known as the “gold standard,” that could allow it to enrich uranium or reprocess fuel waste. Those processes raise concerns because they have potential to create quantities of uranium and plutonium that could be used in nuclear bombs.    Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Saudi Arabia this month to talk about the potential deal. Perry has said he told the kingdom it is important for it to be perceived to be strong on nonproliferation. This year, the kingdom put the United States on a short list of countries for a deal. The winner will likely be selected next year. U.S. reactor builder Westinghouse, which and is owned by Brookfield Asset Management, would likely sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in any deal.

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A slowdown in global consumer confidence threatens to overshadow the holiday shopping season in the United States, which despite a strong start is not immune to developments in Europe.     Super Saturday, the last before Christmas and the biggest shopping day of the U.S. holiday season, is likely to bring in more than $26 billion in revenue, retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners (CGP) said, up from $24.5 billion a year ago. But shares in U.S. retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) were hit on Monday after a profit warning from British online fashion retailer ASOS (ASOS.L), showing that even previously high-flying, online-only retailers were vulnerable to deteriorating consumer sentiment.     The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again on Wednesday and with European retailers reporting weaker sales and Chinese consumers holding back, there are concerns that U.S. consumers could turn skittish too.     U.S. package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Tuesday  cut its 2019 profit forecast after Europe’s economy weakened and the U.S. trade row exacerbated a slowdown in China. “Many people are worried that this is as good as it gets, when it comes to spending and consumer confidence,” Shawn Kravetz, Esplanade Capital LLC’s chief investment officer, said. A global index of retailers .TRXFLDGLPUY4 has fallen by more than 17 percent in the past three months. European gloom deepened on Wednesday after Ceconomy (CECG.DE), Europe’s biggest consumer electronics retailer, said it expected profit to fall again. The continent’s retailers are grappling with uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union, slow economic growth and protests over fuel taxes in France and other factors. Consumers in the United States continue to spend for now and despite a sharp rise in online orders hurting spending in stores during the Thanksgiving weekend, bricks-and-mortar locations have since gained momentum.      Holiday traffic to J.C. Penney (JCP.N) stores increased 10 percent year-on-year from Black Friday through Dec. 10, according to data from Orbital Insight, which analyses satellite imagery such as the number of cars in a retailer’s parking lot.  Traffic was 7 percent higher at Target Corp  (TGT.N) stores for the period and up 5 percent at Walmart Inc (WMT.N). A drop in the price of gasoline could insulate U.S. retailers from some of the pain felt elsewhere, with data from the American Automobile Association (AAA) on Dec. 17 showing the national gas price average of $2.37 is the cheapest seen during the month of December since 2016. “Consumers will definitely notice they have a little more money in their pockets and buy an extra gift or two,” said James Bohnaker, associate director, U.S. macro and consumer economics at financial data company IHS Markit. However, he expects the impact on retail spending to be limited.  Others expect a bigger bump. According to CGP, every dime of gasoline price increase or decline adds or takes away about $1.5 billion every month in discretionary spending. Of this, about $500 million, or a third, converts to retail spending. Last year holiday spending was depressed by about $2.5 billion after a rise in gas prices, but this year the drop in prices is likely to free up about $3 billion in spending, Craig Johnson, president at CGP said.  Johnson said this was particularly a factor for those on lower incomes, adding that “for the first time in three years, gas prices are going to add to spending and not hurt it.”  Many on social media expressed excitement at lower gas prices.  “I’m an Uber driver, so with gas prices being lower, it’s awesome,” Keyhanna (@Keyhanna_J) wrote in a Twitter direct message to Reuters. “I can save a lot more to travel home for the holidays and spend spend or pay off some debt before the new year,” she said. At U.S. clothing retailers, better designs, fewer discounts and lower inventory, have resulted in less clutter on the sales floor and better customer traffic including at teen chains like American Eagle Outfitters Inc (AEO.N) and some department stores like Macy’s Inc (M.N), industry executives said.     “It’s the best apparel numbers I have seen in as much as a decade,” Steve Sadove, senior advisor at Mastercard Inc said. That contrasts with Europe where fashion chains including Primark (ABF.L), Superdry (SDRY.L) and Italy’s low-cost OVS (OVS.MI) have all warned of weak sales in the run-up to Christmas. And while Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC) resisted discounting, it reported disappointing sales. Three consultants told Reuters they expect between 5 to 10 percent growth in U.S. apparel sales this holiday season but cautioned that sales growth at some large department stores like J.C. Penney might be slow.     Demand in the category is being led by athleisure clothing at chains like Lululemon Athletica (LULU.O), Gap Inc’s Athleta brand, teen brands like Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N), and the continued success of off-price clothing chains like TJX (TJX.N), Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O) and Burlington Coat Factory. Laggards include sporting goods chains, they added. The category includes companies like Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS.N), Bass Pro Shops and Modell’s Sporting Goods.

2018-12-19,"SOFIA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - State-owned Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) said on Wednesday it would very likely appeal the hefty fine the European Union antitrust regulators slapped on it for blocking rivals’ access to key gas infrastructure in Bulgaria between 2010 and 2015. The European Commission fined BEH 77 million euros ($88 million) on Monday, saying the company abused its market dominance to hinder competition. BEH’s gas supply unit, Bulgargaz, and its gas network operator, Bulgartransgaz, are also subject to the fine. BEH and its units denied any wrongdoing and said they believed the access to the Balkan country gas network and its gas storage facility had always been granted in line with the law. They also said the imposed fine was disproportionate. “The companies will carefully look at the decision and will probably appeal it by challenging both the allegations and the amount of the fine,” BEH said in a statement. BEH said although the fine should be paid within three months, in the case of an appeal it can either make a provisional payment of the fine or provide collateral. The Bulgarian government says the European Commission would have agreed to a settlement only if Sofia sold a majority take in Bulgatransgaz to a European strategic investor as a guarantee that market would not be distorted. Bulgaria, which still meets all of its gas needs through one route from one supplier — Russia’s Gazprom — says such an option is unacceptable, as its gas pipelines were strategic infrastructure. “On the final line of the negotiations we proposed all kinds of options that should guarantee transparency and control ... including selling a minority stake,” deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev told ministers. “Naturally, no-one from the government would seek an agreement for a majority stake sale,” he said in minutes from a cabinet meeting, published by the government’s press office. Sofia plans to keep Bulgargaz and Bulgartransgaz as BEH’s units, which is in line with EU energy rules. The country is working to diversify its gas routes and suppliers. It also wants to build a new pipeline that is likely to transport mainly Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to central Europe, bypassing Ukraine.

2018-12-19,"* Budget proposal assumes $60 per barrel oil price * Spending plan assumes 2.3 mbpd oil production * President to seek second term in February poll (Adds quotes, analyst, bullet points) By Paul Carsten and Camillus Eboh ABUJA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari presented an 8.83 trillion naira ($28.80 billion) budget for 2019 on Wednesday, laying out plans to drive growth to a raucous parliament that highlighted divisions two months before an election. The spending plan for Africa’s top oil producer assumes crude production of 2.3 million barrels a day, an oil price of $60 per barrel and an exchange rate of 305 naira to the dollar. Buhari’s handling of the economy - which emerged from its first recession in 25 years this year but remains sluggish - has become a campaign issue. The main opposition candidate, businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar, has criticised policies implemented by Buhari since taking office in 2015 and vowed to double the size of the economy to $900 billion by 2025 if elected. Coming months after dozens of lawmakers defected to the opposition, Buhari received a rowdy reception with many of his statements greeted by jeers and chants of “lies”, while supporters at times stood to applaud. “We are supposed to be above this,” said Buhari at one point, in response to boos. Buhari said 2.28 trillion naira had been allocated to capital spending and 2.14 trillion naira for debt service, of which 80 percent was domestic debt that he said accounted for about 70 percent of the total debt. “Although our national debt is within sustainable limits, we need to increase our domestic resource mobilisation to bring down our debt-revenue ratio over the medium term,” he said. The spending plan is smaller than the record 9.12 trillion-naira budget for 2018 that he signed into law in June. The 2019 budget must still be approved by parliament, a process that can take months. Previous budgets have been delayed by wrangling and next year there will be the added complication of the presidential election followed by gubernatorial elections weeks later. “The proposal is unlikely to be approved before February’s election, meaning that both the assembly and Mr. Buhari himself might be replaced mid-way through the process,” said John Ashbourne, Africa economist at Capital Economics. “Even once the budget is finalised, it may not prove an accurate guide to actual spending,” he said, adding: “More broadly, today’s speech underlined the fact that another term for Mr. Buhari would mean policy stability.” Nigeria’s economy grew by 1.81 percent in the third quarter of this year. Inflation rate rose slightly in November to 11.28 percent compared with a year ago. $1 = 306.6000 naira

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Surging U.S. crude oil production will offset OPEC’s output cuts aimed at rebalancing the market as soon as the end of next year - undercutting the group’s efforts as shale producers ramp up output regardless of the price environment, forecasts show. U.S. oil production in the most recent week was 11.6 million bpd a day, just off the all-time record of 11.7 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. If production expands at the rate that the EIA has forecast, it will effectively eat up OPEC’s cuts by the end of 2019. [EIA/S] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia agreed to sweeping cuts of 1.2 million bpd earlier in December, with non-OPEC allies contributing 400,000 bpd of that reduction.  That is equivalent to the 1.18 million bpd in additional production the United States is expected to add next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said last week, due to growth in shale early in 2019 and in several long-awaited offshore projects set to come online late in the year.  Concerns about oversupply have hit oil prices hard in the last two months, with the price of U.S. crude slumping to $46 a barrel on Tuesday from a peak at more than $76 a barrel in October. U.S. oil production last year soared past an output record of 10 million bpd set in 1970.  With advances in technology including hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, the United States surged to become the world’s largest crude producer, and output is now expected to exceed 12 million bpd in the next several months.  “Relative to how big this looming supply tsunami is, [the OPEC cut] is not nearly enough to prevent big inventory builds next year,” said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy, a consultancy in Washington, D.C.   It underscores OPEC’s increasing difficulty in keeping a lid on supply to bring prices to a level the cartel sees as acceptable for state budgets. Saudi Arabia’s 2019 budget is set to increase to an all-time high in 2019, but economists estimate its budget is predicated on Brent crude averaging about $70 a barrel in 2019; it currently trades at $58 a barrel. (For a graphic on 'U.S. output gains approach OPEC cuts in late 2019' click tmsnrt.rs/2PFpkJw) OPEC data released this month shows the group is set to lose market share in 2019, falling from about 33 percent of crude in 2018 to 31 percent in 2019.  “I think this [production cut] is not a once-and-for-all resolution,” said Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman of IHSMarkit. “This is going to be an ongoing process of a global market coming to terms with continuing growth out of the United States. The global oil market is firmly in the shale era.” For a graphic on U.S. output gains approaching OPEC cuts in late 2019, see: tmsnrt.rs/2QSsNZQ.  OPEC and its allies cut production by 1.6 million bpd at the end of 2016 in a successful effort to reduce a worldwide supply glut, but during the life of that agreement, U.S. output increased by 1.62 million bpd, shifting market share away from OPEC.   That process could be even swifter this time out - part of the reason why OPEC and other forecasters expect the cuts will only last for a set six months. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said on Wednesday he expected stocks of global oil to fall by the end of the first quarter.

2018-12-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran denied on Wednesday reports that its exports of crude oil to Chile’s state energy company ENAP might have been a possible source of noxious fumes that caused hundreds of people to seek hospital treatment in August. A total of 508 people, most of them children, sought treatment in Quintero and nearby Puchuncavi in August after residents reported a strong smell in the air. Chilean law enforcement officials are investigating Iranian crude oil as a possible source of the odour. On Wednesday, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) denied any links between its crude exports to Chile and the noxious fumes. NIOC said international inspectors monitor the flow, loading and export of its oil and issue certificates which allow continuation of the exports. “Iran’s export terminals are equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories and devices for checking and measuring the quality and amount of the oil, and the quality of the export oil is always being examined at different times of the day,” NIOC said in a statement published by the oil ministry news agency SHANA.

Crude oil futures have plummeted almost 10 percent since last Thursday while world stock markets have tumbled to 19-month lows. Investors expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to announce one more interest rate hike at a policy meeting later in the day, but they speculated that the U.S. central bank might signal that it plans to stop tightening monetary policy. “Financial market volatility, falling inflation expectations, and pockets of slowing growth will likely combine to produce a dovish hike in December”, BNP Paribas told clients.

2018-12-19,"MADRID (Reuters) - Wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa is booking 14 colossal specialized cranes, has hired new staff and boosted capacity by up to 80 percent at its Spanish factories as developers strain to meet a 2020 deadline for cutting carbon emissions. More wind farms are set to be built across Spain in 2019 than in any previous year, the APPA association of renewable energy companies calculates, surpassing a pre-recession boom in 2008 and putting unprecedented pressure on the supply chain.  “It is an enormous challenge ... We can really sense the urgency,” Enrique Pedrosa Gomez, Siemens Gamesa’s (SGREN.MC) CEO for southern Europe and Africa onshore, told Reuters. The Madrid-listed firm, owned by Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE), vies with Denmark’s Vestas (VWS.CO) to lead the global wind farm business. Gomez says it is complicated but feasible for the industry to install the 4,600 megawatts of wind power, which - along with 3,900 MW of solar capacity - must be in place by early 2020 to meet the terms of government auctions held in 2016 and 2017. Building the auctioned wind capacity will cost more than 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion), according to the Spanish Wind Energy Association. But some in the sector doubt that every plant can be brought on stream in time, underlining the scale of the challenge Spain faces in managing its shift away from carbon after years of standstill in adding new capacity. “They will be close, but they can’t build it all,” said Brian Gaylord, senior analyst for Latin America and southern Europe at Wood Mackenzie.  “It was unwise to award so much capacity back to back.”     (For graphic on Spanish renewable energy capacity, click tmsnrt.rs/2GsYCVd) Spain is sprinting to meet a 20 percent European Union target for energy generated from renewable sources in 2020, from its current level of around 17 percent. The Wind Energy Association says this target, which if missed could potentially lead to EU infringement proceedings and potential fines, is within reach, but is calling for a stable framework to reach future targets. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has made promoting green energy a cornerstone policy, and is working on a climate change law which foresees installing at least 3,000 MW each year to 2030. “We need regulation that helps keep investment coming to the market in Spain,” said the wind energy association’s director Juan Virgilio Marquez. “This isn’t about sudden spurts and jamming on the brakes, but advancing bit by bit every year towards achieving the targets.” The European Environment Agency said last month that the EU’s progress towards increasing the use of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency was slowing, putting its ability to meet its 2020 and 2030 targets at risk. A 2008 property market crash precipitated a deep recession in Spain and put paid to several years of significant additions to the country’s renewable energy capacity as cuts to state subsidies for alternative energy froze investment and prompted lawsuits against Spain. The roughly 1,400 MW of capacity that APPA expects to be installed by the end of this year pales in comparison with next year’s planned construction but is nonetheless the biggest increase since 2012. “You don’t want to go from a market where it is basically famine to feast so quickly,” said Wood Mackenzie’s Gaylord. While the domestic market sank, Spanish companies that had specialized in wind energy technology focused on exporting, but now the tide is turning. At Aguado Wind Services just outside Madrid, logistics manager Carlos Lopez says last year most of his business consisted of transporting rotors, nacelles (housings for turbine components) and masts for export, but now he has around 40 projects pending in Spain. The most popular location for new wind farms is the northeastern region of Aragon, followed by the northwestern region of Castile and Leon. Developers are trying to get the projects done as soon as possible, but wintry weather could slow construction in the coming months, Lopez warned. “In the most difficult areas it might not be possible to go as fast as people want. We often have to stop work for snow or fog.” Erecting turbines whose rotors can exceed 130 meters (427 ft) in diameter poses a particularly big logistical challenge, but solar plant developers are feeling the time pressure too. “We have a year left to get these projects working, which we are perfectly able to do, but we have to move fast,” said Pablo Burgos, founder of solar energy group Solarpack.

2018-12-19,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Environmental group Greenpeace said on Wednesday it could halve its workforce in India to 30 early next year due to a block on its bank account after accusations of illegal donations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nationalist government has tightened scrutiny of non-profit groups over the past four years. It says they often act against India’s interests and has revoked licenses for thousands of foreign-funded groups. Known for its campaigns against India’s coal-fired power plants, Greenpeace has been barred from receiving foreign donations since 2015. The Enforcement Directorate, India’s financial crime investigating agency, froze its main bank account on Oct. 5. Greenpeace, which denies wrongdoing, said it only had funds to pay employees for about two more months, meaning half of the staff of 30 locals were at risk of losing their jobs. “There are multi-pronged attacks on us,” said Greenpeace spokesman Nandikesh Sivalingam, blaming the coal lobby. “The coal industry is strong and powerful even if governments do want to move away from coal, including for climate change reasons.” It was not immediately possible to contact the Enforcement Directorate and a spokesman for the Finance Ministry, under which it operates, declined comment. Asok Dasgupta, president of lobby group Independent Power Producers Association of India, said it was unfair to blame power producers for action against Greenpeace. “I don’t understand this opposition to coal,” he told Reuters. “Renewable power can’t take over coal for many, many years. Fortunately we have got good coal reserves and we should use them.” Since Modi took office in 2014, India has cancelled  registration of nearly 15,000 non-governmental groups under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. Critics say the government has been using the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non-profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of India’s rapid economic development or questioned its human rights record. In October, Indian authorities froze the bank accounts of rights watchdog Amnesty International after a raid on its  office.

2018-12-19,"WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Two Democratic lawmakers urged the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday to better protect U.S. oil and gas pipelines from cyberattacks, after a report they requested detailed a lack of federal oversight of the critical conduits. A federal report released on Wednesday said Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, does not have a process to update its pipeline security guidelines to reflect revisions to standards considered by experts and regulators to be the industry bible on cybersecurity. The standards on avoiding hacker attacks are the Cybersecurity Framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The report by the General Accountability Office, or GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was requested by Senator Maria Cantwell and U.S. Representative Frank Pallone. “Protecting our pipelines, and the people who live and work near them, must be a top priority for our government and I hope this report will prompt the Trump administration to start treating this challenge with the urgency it deserves,” Cantwell said in a release. DHS, which concurred with 10 GAO recommendations in the report, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cantwell’s comments. The GAO’s recommendations for the TSA included implementing a process for reviewing, and if necessary revising, security guidelines at regular intervals. Energy infrastructure has long been a target of hackers. Last week, hackers using a variant of the notorious Shamoon virus crippled more than 300 computers owned by Italian oil services company Saipem and brought down servers in the Middle East and India. The company did not know who conducted the strike, but an official at a cybersecurity company CrowdStrike said he believed Iran was responsible. The report on Wednesday found TSA relied on self-evaluations by the pipeline industry to determine whether operators have critical facilities in their systems that could be the target of hackers. That is a classification the agency uses to determine calculations about the vulnerability of pipelines to cyberattacks. As a result, operators for one third of the top U.S. 100 pipeline systems, based on volume, told the TSA they did not have critical facilities, and the TSA did not verify the self-evaluations, it said. The report also said TSA had not tracked the status of security review recommendations to pipeline operators for the past five years. The vulnerability of gas pipelines to cyberattacks has been one argument that U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a Republican, has used to justify asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to bail out aging nuclear and coal power plants, which do not depend on pipelines. Cyber experts said Perry’s plan would not shield the grid from hackers because they have a wide array of options for hitting electricity infrastructure. FERC, an independent agency of the Department of Energy, rejected the Perry directive, but the issue could come up again.

2018-12-19,"(Adds analyst reaction, details of release, reaction) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Lower gas prices pulled Canada’s annual inflation rate in November down to 1.7 percent, the first time in 10 months it has been below the Bank of Canada’s 2.0 percent target, underscoring market expectations that imminent interest rate hikes are off the table. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast the annual rate would fall to 1.8 percent from 2.4 percent in October. November’s rate matched the 1.7 percent seen in January 2018. The Bank of Canada, which has raised rates five times since July 2017 as the economy strengthened, said earlier this month that economic data heading into the fourth quarter had been weaker than expected. “There’s absolutely no rush for the bank and probably the earliest we’re going to hear from them is in the springtime, in terms of rate hikes,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. The central bank, which had predicted lower gas prices would pull down the annual rate, is due to announce its next interest rate decision on Jan. 9 and markets expect no change. Statistics Canada said on Wednesday that gasoline prices fell by 5.4 percent from November 2017 on lower crude prices and overall energy costs dropped by 1.3 percent over the same period. In both cases, it was the first year-over-year decline since June 2017. It also noted that the Bank of Canada’s three core inflation measurements came in at 1.9 percent, the first time they have all been below 2.0 percent since June 2018. “That informs a near-term dovish Bank of Canada. No hike in the first quarter (of 2019), probably returning to a hike in April is still our call,” said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. The Canadian dollar pared its gains on the news, touching C$1.3446 to the U.S. dollar, or 74.37 U.S. cents. The drop in the overall annual rate was the sharpest in absolute terms since May 2012, when lower gas prices pulled it down to 1.2 percent from 2.0 percent in April.

2018-12-19,"* All eyes on Fed meeting, markets wager on a “dovish” hike * World stocks inch off 19-mth low, Brent oil up half a percent * Oil plunge drags on inflation outlook (Updates throughout, adds quote) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Global equity and crude oil markets attempted on Wednesday to claw their way out of a three-day long plunge that saw investors seek out the safety of bonds amid mounting pessimism over world growth. Oil’s spectacular fall - down almost 10 percent since last Thursday - and world stocks’ plunge to 19-month lows have prompted speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done with tightening after its policy meeting later in the day. There was also some support from China which announced an additional $14.5 billion medium-term lending facility to finance small private businesses. Market focus is now firmly on the U.S. Federal Reserve which is widely expected to deliver a rate rise but could signal a pause next year. Futures are pricing less than one rise in 2019, down from three not long back. “Financial market volatility, falling inflation expectations, and pockets of slowing growth will likely combine to produce a dovish hike in December”, BNP Paribas told clients. While Brent crude inched up 0.5 percent to $56.5 a barrel after plunging 6 percent overnight, its 35 percent fall since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world just as trade and economic activity are cooling. The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy. And logistics and delivery firm FedEx, considered a bellwether for the world economy, has slashed 2019 forecasts, noting “ongoing deceleration” in global growth. European shares added to earlier tentative gains, rising 0.5 percent by 1300 GMT while MSCI’s global equity index rose 0.2 percent. However the global benchmark has fallen 6 percent since the start of this month, given the fragile Sino-U.S. tariff truce and signs of slower company earnings worldwide. Wall Street appears set for a stronger opening, with the S&P500 index futures up 0.8 percent. But U.S. stocks are set for their worst December since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML “It’s a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown.

Expectations of a Fed pause and the equity sell-off have sent 10-year Treasury yields to the lowest since August at 2.799 percent - down 20 basis points in December - though the equity recovery lifted yields off those troughs. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the bond rally were easy to find. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s closely watched monthly survey found more than half of its participants now flagging a global economic slowdown next year. It also showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record. The poll also revealed the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, their gains coming at the expense of equities. The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar’s major props and pulled its index back 0.3 percent to 96.8, from a recent top of 97.711. Villamin of UBP said that while uncertainty had grown about the Fed’s rate rise path, other currencies from the yen to the euro still lacked interest rate support. “Why the dollar won’t be too weak is that the alternatives are not attractive,” he said. “The only real attractive currency out there is the dollar ... we think dollar strength will stay another 3-6 months.” U.S. futures pointed to a firmer Wall Street opening. The bright spot on world markets is Italy where bond yields continued their fall after Rome struck a deal with the EU Commission over its contentious 2019 budget, signalling an end to weeks of wrangling. The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap - a measure of Italian risk - narrowed to 251 bps, the tightest since late September. That spread had been over 300 bps as recently as end-November. “Everyone was expecting an agreement to be reached, but many people were expecting this to come in Q1 or Q2 next year,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. “With risk sentiment stabilising this morning, it looks like the momentum can increase in Italian bonds.” Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and Dhara

2018-12-19,"(Adds comments on OPEC, non-OPEC agreement and China relationship) By Stephen Kalin RIYADH, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said he expects global oil stocks to fall by the end of the first quarter but added that the market remained vulnerable to political and economic factors as well as speculation. “We remain focused on fundamentals, I can tell you we will achieve balance between supply and demand in 2019,” he told reporters. Oil stabilised on Wednesday after one of its biggest falls in years, but remained under pressure from oversupply and concern that a slowing global economy would depress demand for fuel. Falih added that OPEC and non-OPEC members, including Russia, are committed to reducing stocks under the agreement reached in Vienna on Dec. 7. Supplies have already started to fall in the last few weeks, he said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. The U.S.-China trade war would not have an impact on Saudi Arabia’s relationship with China, Falih added. Speaking at a post-budget panel earlier, he said oil giant Aramco will double its production and availability of gas over the next 10 years. On renewable energy projects, Falih said Saudi Arabia has is implementing an agreement with SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund to provide 200 gigawatts of solar power in the kingdom. The country’s Public Investment Fund agreed to invest $45 billion in the giant tech fund led by SoftBank and the pair are working with other parties on a number of solar projects. Saudi Arabia is embarking on a drive to transform its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. It views solar power as a way to cut the amount of crude it uses to generate power at home and raise its overseas shipments. The government also wants to privatise Saudi Electricity as part of wider reforms to its energy sector. Reporting by Stephen Kalin

2018-12-19,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union set out short-term measures on Wednesday to limit disruption to air traffic, financial services and trade if Britain left the bloc without a deal next March.  However, in a sign that a no-deal Brexit would not be business as usual, there would be new checks to currently frictionless trade, which could lead to tail-backs near ports and delays to deliveries. Every shipment of live animals or animal products from Britain would face controls at EU borders and Britons would lose the right to travel with their pets using EU pet passports.  The European Union would only allow British trucks to carry goods into the bloc, assuming also Britain allowed EU trucks in, until the end of next year. The European Commission, which presented the plans, also warned of higher charges for using credit or debit cards because EU rules limiting such fees would no longer apply. Asked if the European Union was offering Britain a relatively attractive no-deal option, Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference the measures were simply designed to limit disruption. Dombrovskis said that the best way to avoid harming the British economy would be for Britain to stay in the European Union. In the case of Brexit, the withdrawal agreement agreed with the British government was better than no deal. “In the case of no deal, doing some preparation to limit damage is better than not doing any preparation at all,” he said. The Commission’s measures cover transport, financial services, customs and border checks, taxation and climate change and will need to be backed by the European Parliament and the 27 countries remaining in the EU. The EU executive proposed allowing British airlines to fly to and from EU airports for 12 months, assuming Britain offered equivalent rights to EU airlines. The bloc would also recognise UK clearing houses for financial derivatives for a year. The Commission, which is coordinating the European Union’s response to Brexit, also called on the 27 other EU governments to allow British nationals living in their countries to stay and work from March 29, the day Britain is due to leave. The Commission was keen to stress that the measures were limited in time. It also said that the contingency measures would not apply to British territory Gibraltar, which has an active financial services sector.

2018-12-19,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy’s nuclear security office is developing a project to help other countries handle nuclear waste, an effort to keep the United States competitive against global rivals in disposal technology, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The push comes as the United States struggles to find a solution for its own mounting nuclear waste inventories amid political opposition to a permanent dump site in Nevada, proposed decades ago, and concerns about the cost and security of recycling the waste back into fuel. The National Nuclear Security Administration is considering helping other countries by using technologies that could involve techniques such as crushing, heating and sending a current through the waste to reduce its volume, the sources said. The machinery would be encased in a “black box” the size of a shipping container and sent to other countries with nuclear energy programs, but be owned and operated by the United States, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.  “That way you could address a country’s concerns about spent fuel without transferring ownership of the technology to them,” said one of the sources. The NNSA confirmed a project to help other countries with nuclear waste is underway but declined to provide details. “We are in the conceptual phase of identifying approaches that could reduce the quantity of spent nuclear fuel without creating proliferation risks - a goal with significant economic and security benefits,” NNSA spokesman Dov Schwartz said. The effort is being led by NNSA Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Brent Park, a nuclear physicist and former associate lab director at the Energy Department’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, appointed by President Donald Trump in April. The NNSA declined a Reuters request for an interview with Park. The sources did not name countries to which the service would be marketed, or where the waste would be stored after it is run through the equipment. But they said they were concerned the processes under consideration could increase the risk of dangerous materials reaching militant groups or nations unfriendly to the United States. Former President Jimmy Carter banned nuclear waste reprocessing in 1977 because it chemically unlocks purer streams of uranium and plutonium, both of which could be used to make nuclear bombs. The NNSA’s Schwartz said the plans under consideration do not involve reprocessing, but declined to say what technologies could be used. The sources familiar with the NNSA’s deliberations said there are three basic ways that the physical volume of nuclear waste can be reduced, all of which are costly. At least one of the techniques poses a security threat, they said. The first, called consolidation, reduces the volume of nuclear waste by taking apart spent fuel assemblies and crunching the waste down to two times smaller than the original volume – an approach that is considered costly but which doesn’t add much security risk. A second technique involves heating radioactive pellets in spent fuel assemblies. The process, which gives off gases that must be contained, results in a waste product that has more environmental and health risks. A third approach called pyroprocessing - developed at the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory - puts spent fuel in liquid metal and runs an electric current through it. That reduces volume, but concentrates plutonium and uranium – making it a potential proliferation risk. The nuclear community is divided on whether pyroprocessing fits the definition of reprocessing.  The Trump administration has made promoting nuclear technology abroad a high priority, as the United States seeks to retain its edge as a leader in the industry, amid advancements by other nations like Russia, and France – both of which already offer customers services to take care of waste. U.S. reactor builder Westinghouse, which emerged from bankruptcy in August and is owned by Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), hopes to sell nuclear power technology to countries from Saudi Arabia to India, but faces stiff competition from Russia’s state-owned Rosatom. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Saudi Arabia this month for talks on a nuclear energy deal with the kingdom, despite pushback from lawmakers concerned about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The United States is also struggling to support its own nuclear industry at home, with aging reactors shuttering, new projects elusive due to soaring costs, and an ongoing political stalemate over a permanent solution for mounting nuclear waste stockpiles. The United States produces some 2,000 metric tons of nuclear waste each year, which is currently stored in pools or in steel casks at the nation’s roughly 60 commercial nuclear power plants across 30 states. The federal government designated Nevada’s Yucca Mountain as the sole permanent U.S. nuclear waste repository decades ago to solve the problem, spending about $13 billion on the project, but it has never opened due to local opposition.  Thomas Countryman, the State Department’s top arms control officer during the Obama administration, said the government should make headway on the domestic problem before helping other countries. “The primary issue on this front … is not that the U.S. can’t offer a low-volume option to potential buyers; rather it’s that the U.S. still has no option for disposing of its own spent fuel,” he said. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said NNSA should be less concerned about volume of waste and more concerned about the dangers that make it hard to store. “It’s not the volume of the nuclear waste that’s the issue, but the radioactivity and heat it gives off as well as the fact that it remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years,” he said.

2018-12-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Budweiser beer will be brewed in Britain using solar power from 2020 following a 15-year deal signed by brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) and renewable power developer Lightsource BP, the companies said on Wednesday. Lightsource BP will develop and operate 100 megawatts (MW) of solar projects to generate enough electricity for AB InBev’s breweries. The power being generated is the equivalent to the amount used by 18,000 homes. The solar projects are expected to be completed and connected to Britain’s power grid by the end of 2020. AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer, produces more than 17 million cans and bottles of Budweiser beer each week from its two main breweries in Magor, South Wales and Samlesbury, Lancashire. The initiative is part of the company’s sustainability goals which include purchasing all electricity from renewable sources by 2025, AB InBev said in a statement. No financial details were disclosed, but Lightsource said the deal would enable it to develop the solar projects without subsidies. Oil major BP (BP.L) acquired a 43 percent stake in Lightsource, Europe’s biggest solar energy developer, last year.

2018-12-19,"* All eyes on Fed meeting, markets wager on a “dovish” hike * Fed seen dropping “gradual increases”, lowering dot forecast * Latest plunge in oil prices drags on inflation outlook (Updates prices, adds charts) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Global equity and crude oil markets attempted on Wednesday to claw their way out of a three-day long plunge that saw investors seek out the safety of bonds amid mounting pessimism over world growth. Oil’s spectacular fall - down almost 10 percent since last Thursday - and world stocks’ plunge to 19-month lows have spurred speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done with tightening after its policy meeting later in the day. While Brent crude inched up 0.5 percent to $56.5 a barrel after plunging 6 percent overnight, its 35 percent fall since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world just as trade and economic activity are cooling. The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy. And on Tuesday, logistics and delivery firm FedEx, considered a bellwether for the world economy, slashed its 2019 forecasts, noting “ongoing deceleration” in global growth. European shares rose 0.3 percent and MSCI’s global equity index firmed a touch, though it has fallen 6 percent since the start of this month, given the fragile nature of the Sino-U.S. tariff truce and signs that company earnings worldwide are slowing. While equity futures signal a stronger opening on Wall Street, U.S. stocks are set for their worst December since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML “It’s a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown. More importantly, the market is adjusting to the idea this will translate into lower earnings growth,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking at Union Bancaire Privee in Zurich. “It’s being complicated by the tightening liquidity situation with the Fed expected to move today and the ECB having signalled the end of its (stimulus)”. Futures are sticking with a two-in-three chance of a rate rise on Wednesday and Villamin expects the Fed to move twice in 2019. That’s a more hawkish call than the broader market which is pricing less than one rise in 2019, down from three not long back. The expectations of a Fed pause and the equity selloff sent 10-year Treasury yields to the lowest since August at 2.799 percent - down 20 basis points in December - while two-year yields touched a three-month trough of 2.629 percent, sliding from November’s 2.977 percent peak. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the bond rally were easy to find. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s closely watched monthly survey found more than half of its participants now flagging a global economic slowdown next year. It also showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record. The poll also revealed the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, their gains coming at the expense of equities. The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar’s major props and pulled its index back 0.3 percent to 96.8, from a recent top of 97.711. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.15 percent to 112.37 yen , while the euro nudged up to $1.1383 from a $1.1266 low. Villamin of UBP said that while uncertainty had grown about the Fed’s rate rise path, other currencies from the yen to the euro still lacked interest rate support. “Why the dollar won’t be too weak is that the alternatives are not attractive,” he said. “The only real attractive currency out there is the dollar ... we think dollar strength will stay another 3-6 months.” U.S. futures pointed to a firmer Wall Street opening. The bright spot on world markets is Italy where bond yields continued their fall after Rome struck a deal with the EU Commission over its contentious 2019 budget, signalling an end to weeks of wrangling. The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap - a measure of Italian risk - narrowed to around 255 bps, the tightest since late September. That spread had been over 300 bps as recently as end-November. “Everyone was expecting an agreement to be reached, but many people were expecting this to come in Q1 or Q2 next year,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. “With risk sentiment stabilising this morning, it looks like the momentum can increase in Italian bonds.” Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and Dhara

2018-12-19,"HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. and Norwegian oil majors Chevron and Equinor (EQNR.OL) have become the latest target of activist investors moving to force five of the biggest oil companies to commit to fixed emissions targets and align with the Paris climate agreement.     The effort, part of a wave of climate-related proxy resolutions planned for spring 2019 annual shareholder meetings, is being led by investor groups Follow This, As You Sow and Arjuna Capital. The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a goal of capping temperature warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) before the turn of the century. The activist investors of Chevron Corp said on Wednesday they had filed annual meeting resolutions calling for the oil company to embrace greenhouse gas reductions. They now want Chevron (CVX.N) to report on how it can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris accord, arguing climate change presents “portfolio risks to investors,” according to a copy of the resolution reviewed by Reuters. Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     “We filed the first carbon asset risk resolution in 2013,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow. “There has been progress, but not enough.” In Europe, Follow This filed a climate resolution for Equinor’s 2019 annual general meeting, mirroring its activist moves on BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS). A spokesman for Equinor said it was supporting the Paris climate agreement. “We have our own climate roadmap and clear goals for how to cut Co2 emission,” he said. Following pressure from its investors, Shell made a U-turn setting out plans to introduce three-year or five-year carbon emissions targets linked to customers’ use of its fuels and affecting executive pay beginning in 2020. BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) also have set short-term targets on reducing their own carbon dioxide emissions.  When asked why Follow This has not targeted Total and Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), the group’s founder Mark van Baal said ownership thresholds make it harder to file resolutions in some countries, for example, a 1 percent hurdle in France. This week, two other groups of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) investors said they would file a shareholder resolution calling on the world’s largest oil company to set targets.  This year, Chevron resolutions to limit its methane emissions and to adapt its business to a low carbon economy received 45 percent and 8 percent support, respectively.

2018-12-19,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers from both U.S. parties introduced legislation on Wednesday to give Congress more say in any deal on civil nuclear power cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia.  The Trump administration is eager to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia to share nuclear power technology with the kingdom, as the domestic industry struggles to compete with lower-priced power sources such as natural gas. But the talks have come under scrutiny since the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Despite President Donald Trump’s desire to maintain close ties to Saudi Arabia, several of his fellow Republicans have joined Democrats in blaming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi’s death. The crown prince has denied knowledge of the operation that killed Khashoggi. The No Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act would require the House of Representatives and the Senate to approve any so-called 123 agreement with the kingdom. Typically, such agreements go into effect unless majorities of Congress pass joint resolutions of disapproval.   It is unlikely that the legislation will pass before the end of the current Congress in January, but the bill raises scrutiny of any deal. It also calls on Saudi Arabia to release details of Khashoggi’s killing before a deal is approved. Concern about whether Saudi Arabia could use nuclear power to develop a weapons program mounted after the crown prince told CBS in an interview in March that his kingdom would develop nuclear weapons if its archrival Iran did.  “This legislation would ensure that we put key checks in place to ensure that Saudi Arabia never ends up with the U.S. technology or materials to make a nuclear bomb, and that Congress is the final say,” said Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat.  Markey introduced the bill with Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican. Representatives Brad Sherman, a Democrat, and Luke Messer, a Republican, have introduced companion legislation in the House.   The talks have slowed as Saudi pushed for relaxing nonproliferation guidelines, known as the “gold standard,” that could allow it to enrich uranium or reprocess fuel waste. Those processes raise concerns because they have potential to create quantities of uranium and plutonium that could be used in nuclear bombs.    Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Saudi Arabia this month to talk about the potential deal. Perry has said he told the kingdom it is important for it to be perceived to be strong on nonproliferation. This year, the kingdom put the United States on a short list of countries for a deal. The winner will likely be selected next year. U.S. reactor builder Westinghouse, which and is owned by Brookfield Asset Management, would likely sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in any deal.

2018-12-19,"(Adds comment from Homeland Security) By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Two Democratic lawmakers urged the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday to better protect U.S. oil and gas pipelines from cyberattacks, after a report they requested detailed a lack of federal oversight of the critical conduits. The report released on Wednesday said Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, does not have a process to update its pipeline security guidelines to reflect revisions to standards considered by experts and regulators to be the industry bible on cybersecurity. The standards on avoiding hacker attacks are the Cybersecurity Framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The report by the General Accountability Office, or GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was requested by Senator Maria Cantwell and Representative Frank Pallone. “Protecting our pipelines, and the people who live and work near them, must be a top priority for our government and I hope this report will prompt the Trump administration to start treating this challenge with the urgency it deserves,” Cantwell said in a release. A DHS official said TSA is “extremely proud” of its work on pipeline cybersecurity, which has included the publication of security guidelines, information sharing, and analysis of pipeline security reviews. The GAO issued 10 recommendations for the TSA including implementing a process for reviewing, and if necessary revising, security guidelines at regular intervals. DHS agreed with all the recommendations in the report. Energy infrastructure has long been a target of hackers. Last week, hackers using a variant of the notorious Shamoon virus crippled more than 300 computers owned by Italian oil services company Saipem and brought down servers in the Middle East and India. The company did not know who conducted the strike, but an official at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike said he believed Iran was responsible. The report on Wednesday found TSA relied on self-evaluations by the pipeline industry to determine whether operators have critical facilities in their systems that could be the target of hackers. That is a classification the agency uses to determine calculations about the vulnerability of pipelines to cyberattacks. As a result, operators for one third of the top U.S. 100 pipeline systems, based on volume, told the TSA they did not have critical facilities, and the TSA did not verify the self-evaluations, it said. The report also said TSA had not tracked the status of security review recommendations to pipeline operators for the past five years. The vulnerability of gas pipelines to cyberattacks has been one argument that U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a Republican, has used to justify asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to bail out aging nuclear and coal power plants, which do not depend on pipelines. Cyber experts said Perry’s plan would not shield the grid from hackers because they have a wide array of options for hitting electricity infrastructure. FERC, an independent agency of the Department of Energy, rejected the Perry directive, but the issue could come up again. Reporting by Timothy Gardner; editing by Peter Cooney and

2018-12-19,"BENGHAZI, Libya/TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya’s biggest oilfield, El Sharara, will reopen, the country’s    internationally recognized government said on Wednesday after   Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj flew there to persuade protesters to end a blockage. Production had not restarted yet as oil workers were waiting for orders from state oil firm NOC. A spokesman for NOC declined to comment when Reuters called. Sarraj’s office gave no time frame. A spokesman for a group of tribesmen, who took over the 315,000 barrels a day-field with state guards on Dec 8, said the government had agreed to implement their demands within a week from Dec 22. “El Sharara oilfield will be reopened after reaching an agreement with Fayez al-Sarraj,” Mohammed Ahmed said. “Urgent (demands), like liquidity and fuel, will start (being implemented) on Saturday, other demands will be implemented within 45 days”, he said. The Tripoli-based government had earlier announced a development fund worth 1 billion Libyan dinars ($717 million) for the long-neglected south in a bid to appease the protesters. The tribesmen had demanded better state services for the south, which produces around 400,000 bpd of day, but lacks basic facilities such as hospitals or electricity. The guards, which NOC said had facilitated the protest, had demanded salary payments they said they were owed. It was not immediately clear when NOC would agree to reopen the field. Its Chairman Mustafa Sanalla had denounced the protesters as “militia” NOC would not negotiate with — comments which had drawn criticism of the Tripoli-based chief of staff. Sarraj said in a statement he had met the protesters at the field and understood the factors driving their action, describing the demands as “legitimate”. El Sharara crude is transported to the Zawiya port, which is also home to a refinery. NOC runs the field with Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, Austria’s OMV and Norway’s Equinor, formerly known as Statoil. Libya had in recent months boosted output to up to 1.3 million barrels a day, its highest level since 2013 when a wave of protests and blockages against oil facilities began. NOC is widely seen by armed groups and civilian protesters as an easy target to milk in the absence of a weak state and deteriorating public services.

2018-12-19,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted oil major  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) a financial hardship waiver this year temporarily freeing its Montana refinery from U.S. biofuel laws, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Exxon, which reported earnings of almost $20 billion in 2017, became the largest known company to be awarded a such a waiver by the Trump administration’s EPA under a program meant to protect the smallest fuel facilities from going bust. Farm state lawmakers have complained that the hardship waivers are being overused in a way that is killing demand for corn-based ethanol, and they were likely to criticize the waiver awarded to one of the world’s biggest and most profitable companies. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel each year or buy compliance credits from competitors that do. But it allows the EPA to exempt plants of less than 75,000 barrels per day if they show complying would cause financial hardship. The EPA has vastly expanded the program under President Donald Trump, but is reviewing how it handles further requests as it seeks to balance the competing interests of refiners and ethanol producers. Exxon’s waiver was granted before the review began, and covers its 60,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Billings, Montana, for the 2017 compliance period, said the sources, who asked not to be named. EPA spokesman Michael Abboud declined to comment on whether the refinery received a waiver, but pointed out that the waiver program requires the agency only to consider the financial situation of the refinery and not its owner. “This was a decision Congress made when drafting the Renewable Fuel Standard and EPA implements the small refinery exemption program consistent with that explicit direction,” he told Reuters in an emailed statement. ExxonMobil declined to comment.  Reuters reported earlier this year that Andeavor (MRO.N) and Chevron (CVX.N), both large and highly profitable refiners, were also granted recent EPA exemptions for their small facilities. The EPA keeps the identities of companies receiving waivers secret, arguing the information is business sensitive. But the agency recently began publishing the numbers of exemptions granted. It said it awarded 29 exemptions to small refineries in 2018 for the 2017 compliance year so far, up from 19 for 2016 and just seven for 2015.  The EPA has attributed the program’s expansion mainly to a lawsuit brought by two oil refiners that challenged its denial of their waiver requests under President Barack Obama’s administration.  A federal judge ruled last year the EPA was using too narrow a test to evaluate applications. The EPA, which relies partly on advice from the Department of Energy, has asked DOE to review its scoring system for applications before considering additional waiver requests. Biofuel backers have argued that the waiver program’s expansion was politically driven by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, a supporter of the fossil fuels industry who sought ways to lower compliance costs for energy companies.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa responded to the news with a call for an overhaul of the waiver process. “That Exxon was reportedly granted a ‘small refiner’ waiver for ‘hardship’ just goes to show how abused the process has been,” he said in an emailed statement. “There’s no good reason multibillion dollar oil refining giants should be able to skirt the law.”  Pruitt resigned amid a slew of ethics scandals last July and has been replaced in the interim by his deputy Andrew Wheeler. Trump has said he was likely to nominate Wheeler to serve as the permanent EPA chief. That would require U.S. Senate confirmation, and several powerful pro-corn Senators such as Grassley are agitating for measures to protect ethanol demand.  “I suspect Wheeler would be more invested in maintaining the reputation of the agency,” a biofuels industry participant said, asking not to be named. “He also would not want to upset people who will have a say in his confirmation.” Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; editing by Richard Valdmanis and David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-exxon-mobil/exclusive-exxon-mobil-secured-u-s-hardship-waiver-from-biofuels-laws-sources-idUKL1N1YO1PD,19 Dec 2018,"The U.S.

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, recovering somewhat from a sharp selloff during the previous session, after U.S. data showed strong demand for refined products. Sentiment remained negative, however, as investors grappled with weakening demand and worries about oversupply. Brent crude futures rose 98 cents to settle at $57.24 a barrel, a 1.74 percent gain. The front-month U.S. light crude contract CLF9, which expires on Wednesday, gained 96 cents to settle at $47.20 a barrel, a 2.08 percent gain. The second-month contract CLG9 settled at $48.17 a barrel. Crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive decrease, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 4.2 million barrels, versus expectations of  a 573,000-barrel increase, the EIA said. Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market’s proxy for diesel. Heating oil futures gained nearly 3 percent to settle at $1.8054 a gallon.     “Today’s price advance appears driven as much by profit-taking/short-covering rather than any noticeable shift in the oil balances,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. The markets slumped on Tuesday, extending recent declines. Global benchmark Brent tumbled to a session low of $55.89 a barrel, a bottom last reached in October 2017. WTI sank to $45.79, the weakest since August 2017. Broader financial markets have been under pressure on worries about higher U.S. interest rates. As expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and noted that “some” further gradual rate hikes would be needed. Oil prices pared gains following the decision as the U.S. dollar index trimmed losses. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. “There’s slight disappointment that the Fed is not done (raising rates),” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “People are a little bit concerned that if the Fed raises the rates, that could slow the economy and hurt oil demand at the same time.” Brent and WTI have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of October as crude supply has increased. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

2018-12-19,"(Updates throughout to reflect Fed policy decision in U.S. afternoon trading) By David Randall NEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Global equity markets gave up earlier gains on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced another interest rate hike and said “some” further rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead. The decision, announced at 2 p.m. Eastern time (1900 GMT), briefly slashed nearly 200 points off of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and halved the day’s modest gains in MSCI’s index of global stocks. The index remains down nearly 12 percent since the start of December. “This is clearly a disappointment for those hoping for a dovish rate hike,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston. “It is a more moderate rate hike but it is a rate hike and there is still a gap between where the Fed is and where the market is in terms of policy expectations for next year.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87.55 points, or 0.37 percent, to 23,588.09, the S&P 500 gained 13.76 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,559.92 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.11 points, or 0.25 percent, to 6,801.02. U.S. stocks are on pace for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan, which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy. Logistics and delivery firm FedEx, considered a bellwether for the world economy, slashed 2019 forecasts, noting “ongoing deceleration” in global growth. “It’s a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown. More importantly, the market is adjusting to the idea this will translate into lower earnings growth,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking at Union Bancaire Privee in Zurich. “It’s being complicated by the tightening liquidity situation with the Fed expected to move today and the ECB having signaled the end of its (stimulus)”. Expectations of a Fed pause and the equity sell-off have sent 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest since August. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.787 percent, from 2.823 percent late on Tuesday. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows.

2018-12-19,"ZAGREB, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Croatian energy group INA plans to invest more than four billion kuna ($616 million) to modernise its largest refinery but a second, smaller refinery will be converted into an industrial plant, it said on Wednesday. The investment plan, approved by INA’s management board on Wednesday, is aimed at stemming losses in its refining division, currently running at around one billion kuna a year. INA owns two refineries in Croatia, one in the northern Adriatic port of Rijeka, and a smaller one in the central town of Sisak. The plan foresees major investment in Rijeka to turn it into a top-level European refinery, INA said in a statement. “Total investments are worth more than 4 billion kuna, which would represent the single largest investment project in the history of the company,” it said. “The final investment decision is planned for 2019, provided all preconditions assuring return on investment are met,” INA said. The modernised refinery should be ready to operate in 2023. INA’s biggest shareholder is Hungary’s MOL which owns slightly below half, while the Croatian government controls close to 45 percent. Under the investment plan, the Sisak refinery will be turned into another type of industrial facility. The Sisak site would remain a major employer, but it was necessary to convert it from loss-making crude oil processing to “viable alternative industrial activities,” the statement said. The new business in Sisak may include bio-component refining and petrochemical production, INA said, adding that it could also involve a modern logistics hub, bitumen, renewables and lubricant production. Without giving details of possible job losses at Sisak, INA said it was prepared to offer alternative jobs to affected workers and severance payments significantly higher than the Croatian average. Workers at Sisak have repeatedly voiced concerns in recent years about MOL’s alleged plans to shut down the plant, putting pressure on the Croatian government to prevent it. The company estimated that, if fully implemented, its plans would increase average yearly core profit, or EBITDA, by more than one billion kuna. MOL and the Croatian government have been at odds for several years about management rights and investment policy at INA. Two years ago, the Zagreb government announced it intended to buy back INA shares from MOL, but little has happened since. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic recently said that a final decision would depend on the price set by MOL. In the first nine months of this year, INA’s revenues were 16.23 billion kuna, 21 percent more than in the same period last year. EBITDA amounted to 2.7 billion kuna, roughly the same as in the first nine months of 2017.

2018-12-19,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted oil major  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) a financial hardship waiver this year temporarily freeing its Montana refinery from U.S. biofuel laws, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Exxon, which reported earnings of almost $20 billion (15.85 billion pounds) in 2017, became the largest known company to be awarded a such a waiver by the Trump administration’s EPA under a programme meant to protect the smallest fuel facilities from going bust. Farm state lawmakers have complained that the hardship waivers are being overused in a way that is killing demand for corn-based ethanol, and they were likely to criticise the waiver awarded to one of the world’s biggest and most profitable companies. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel each year or buy compliance credits from competitors that do. But it allows the EPA to exempt plants of less than 75,000 barrels per day if they show complying would cause financial hardship. The EPA has vastly expanded the programme under President Donald Trump, but is reviewing how it handles further requests as it seeks to balance the competing interests of refiners and ethanol producers. Exxon’s waiver was granted before the review began, and covers its 60,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Billings, Montana, for the 2017 compliance period, said the sources, who asked not to be named. EPA spokesman Michael Abboud declined to comment on whether the refinery received a waiver, but pointed out that the waiver programme requires the agency only to consider the financial situation of the refinery and not its owner. “This was a decision Congress made when drafting the Renewable Fuel Standard and EPA implements the small refinery exemption programme consistent with that explicit direction,” he told Reuters in an emailed statement. ExxonMobil declined to comment.  Reuters reported earlier this year that Andeavor (MRO.N) and Chevron (CVX.N), both large and highly profitable refiners, were also granted recent EPA exemptions for their small facilities. The EPA keeps the identities of companies receiving waivers secret, arguing the information is business sensitive. But the agency recently began publishing the numbers of exemptions granted. It said it awarded 29 exemptions to small refineries in 2018 for the 2017 compliance year so far, up from 19 for 2016 and just seven for 2015.  The EPA has attributed the programme’s expansion mainly to a lawsuit brought by two oil refiners that challenged its denial of their waiver requests under President Barack Obama’s administration.  A federal judge ruled last year the EPA was using too narrow a test to evaluate applications. The EPA, which relies partly on advice from the Department of Energy, has asked DOE to review its scoring system for applications before considering additional waiver requests. Biofuel backers have argued that the waiver programme’s expansion was politically driven by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, a supporter of the fossil fuels industry who sought ways to lower compliance costs for energy companies.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa responded to the news with a call for an overhaul of the waiver process. “That Exxon was reportedly granted a ‘small refiner’ waiver for ‘hardship’ just goes to show how abused the process has been,” he said in an emailed statement. “There’s no good reason multibillion dollar oil refining giants should be able to skirt the law.”  Pruitt resigned amid a slew of ethics scandals last July and has been replaced in the interim by his deputy Andrew Wheeler. Trump has said he was likely to nominate Wheeler to serve as the permanent EPA chief. That would require U.S. Senate confirmation, and several powerful pro-corn Senators such as Grassley are agitating for measures to protect ethanol demand.  “I suspect Wheeler would be more invested in maintaining the reputation of the agency,” a biofuels industry participant said, asking not to be named. “He also would not want to upset people who will have a say in his confirmation.” Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; editing by Richard Valdmanis and David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-exxon-mobil/exclusive-oil-giant-exxon-secured-u-s-hardship-waiver-from-biofuel-laws-sources-idUKL8N1YH6EO,19 Dec 2018,"The U.S.

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A slowdown in global consumer confidence threatens to overshadow the holiday shopping season in the United States, which despite a strong start is not immune to developments in Europe.     Super Saturday, the last before Christmas and the biggest shopping day of the U.S. holiday season, is likely to bring in more than $26 billion in revenue, retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners (CGP) said, up from $24.5 billion a year ago. But shares in U.S. retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) were hit on Monday after a profit warning from British online fashion retailer ASOS (ASOS.L), showing that even previously high-flying, online-only retailers were vulnerable to deteriorating consumer sentiment.     The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again on Wednesday and with European retailers reporting weaker sales and Chinese consumers holding back, there are concerns that U.S. consumers could turn skittish too.     U.S. package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Tuesday  cut its 2019 profit forecast after Europe’s economy weakened and the U.S. trade row exacerbated a slowdown in China. “Many people are worried that this is as good as it gets, when it comes to spending and consumer confidence,” Shawn Kravetz, Esplanade Capital LLC’s chief investment officer, said. A global index of retailers .TRXFLDGLPUY4 has fallen by more than 17 percent in the past three months. European gloom deepened on Wednesday after Ceconomy (CECG.DE), Europe’s biggest consumer electronics retailer, said it expected profit to fall again. The continent’s retailers are grappling with uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union, slow economic growth and protests over fuel taxes in France and other factors. Consumers in the United States continue to spend for now and despite a sharp rise in online orders hurting spending in stores during the Thanksgiving weekend, bricks-and-mortar locations have since gained momentum.      Holiday traffic to J.C. Penney (JCP.N) stores increased 10 percent year-on-year from Black Friday through Dec. 10, according to data from Orbital Insight, which analyses satellite imagery such as the number of cars in a retailer’s parking lot.  Traffic was 7 percent higher at Target Corp  (TGT.N) stores for the period and up 5 percent at Walmart Inc (WMT.N). A drop in the price of gasoline could insulate U.S. retailers from some of the pain felt elsewhere, with data from the American Automobile Association (AAA) on Dec. 17 showing the national gas price average of $2.37 is the cheapest seen during the month of December since 2016. “Consumers will definitely notice they have a little more money in their pockets and buy an extra gift or two,” said James Bohnaker, associate director, U.S. macro and consumer economics at financial data company IHS Markit. However, he expects the impact on retail spending to be limited.  Others expect a bigger bump. According to CGP, every dime of gasoline price increase or decline adds or takes away about $1.5 billion every month in discretionary spending. Of this, about $500 million, or a third, converts to retail spending. Last year holiday spending was depressed by about $2.5 billion after a rise in gas prices, but this year the drop in prices is likely to free up about $3 billion in spending, Craig Johnson, president at CGP said.  Johnson said this was particularly a factor for those on lower incomes, adding that “for the first time in three years, gas prices are going to add to spending and not hurt it.”  Many on social media expressed excitement at lower gas prices.  “I’m an Uber driver, so with gas prices being lower, it’s awesome,” Keyhanna (@Keyhanna_J) wrote in a Twitter direct message to Reuters. “I can save a lot more to travel home for the holidays and spend spend or pay off some debt before the new year,” she said. At U.S. clothing retailers, better designs, fewer discounts and lower inventory, have resulted in less clutter on the sales floor and better customer traffic including at teen chains like American Eagle Outfitters Inc (AEO.N) and some department stores like Macy’s Inc (M.N), industry executives said.     “It’s the best apparel numbers I have seen in as much as a decade,” Steve Sadove, senior advisor at Mastercard Inc said. That contrasts with Europe where fashion chains including Primark (ABF.L), Superdry (SDRY.L) and Italy’s low-cost OVS (OVS.MI) have all warned of weak sales in the run-up to Christmas. And while Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC) resisted discounting, it reported disappointing sales. Three consultants told Reuters they expect between 5 to 10 percent growth in U.S. apparel sales this holiday season but cautioned that sales growth at some large department stores like J.C. Penney might be slow.     Demand in the category is being led by athleisure clothing at chains like Lululemon Athletica (LULU.O), Gap Inc’s Athleta brand, teen brands like Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N), and the continued success of off-price clothing chains like TJX (TJX.N), Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O) and Burlington Coat Factory. Laggards include sporting goods chains, they added. The category includes companies like Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS.N), Bass Pro Shops and Modell’s Sporting Goods.

2018-12-19,"SOFIA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - State-owned Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) said on Wednesday it would very likely appeal the hefty fine the European Union antitrust regulators slapped on it for blocking rivals’ access to key gas infrastructure in Bulgaria between 2010 and 2015. The European Commission fined BEH 77 million euros ($88 million) on Monday, saying the company abused its market dominance to hinder competition. BEH’s gas supply unit, Bulgargaz, and its gas network operator, Bulgartransgaz, are also subject to the fine. BEH and its units denied any wrongdoing and said they believed the access to the Balkan country gas network and its gas storage facility had always been granted in line with the law. They also said the imposed fine was disproportionate. “The companies will carefully look at the decision and will probably appeal it by challenging both the allegations and the amount of the fine,” BEH said in a statement. BEH said although the fine should be paid within three months, in the case of an appeal it can either make a provisional payment of the fine or provide collateral. The Bulgarian government says the European Commission would have agreed to a settlement only if Sofia sold a majority take in Bulgatransgaz to a European strategic investor as a guarantee that market would not be distorted. Bulgaria, which still meets all of its gas needs through one route from one supplier — Russia’s Gazprom — says such an option is unacceptable, as its gas pipelines were strategic infrastructure. “On the final line of the negotiations we proposed all kinds of options that should guarantee transparency and control ... including selling a minority stake,” deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev told ministers. “Naturally, no-one from the government would seek an agreement for a majority stake sale,” he said in minutes from a cabinet meeting, published by the government’s press office. Sofia plans to keep Bulgargaz and Bulgartransgaz as BEH’s units, which is in line with EU energy rules. The country is working to diversify its gas routes and suppliers. It also wants to build a new pipeline that is likely to transport mainly Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to central Europe, bypassing Ukraine.

2018-12-19,"* Budget proposal assumes $60 per barrel oil price * Spending plan assumes 2.3 mbpd oil production * President to seek second term in February poll (Adds quotes, analyst, bullet points) By Paul Carsten and Camillus Eboh ABUJA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari presented an 8.83 trillion naira ($28.80 billion) budget for 2019 on Wednesday, laying out plans to drive growth to a raucous parliament that highlighted divisions two months before an election. The spending plan for Africa’s top oil producer assumes crude production of 2.3 million barrels a day, an oil price of $60 per barrel and an exchange rate of 305 naira to the dollar. Buhari’s handling of the economy - which emerged from its first recession in 25 years this year but remains sluggish - has become a campaign issue. The main opposition candidate, businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar, has criticised policies implemented by Buhari since taking office in 2015 and vowed to double the size of the economy to $900 billion by 2025 if elected. Coming months after dozens of lawmakers defected to the opposition, Buhari received a rowdy reception with many of his statements greeted by jeers and chants of “lies”, while supporters at times stood to applaud. “We are supposed to be above this,” said Buhari at one point, in response to boos. Buhari said 2.28 trillion naira had been allocated to capital spending and 2.14 trillion naira for debt service, of which 80 percent was domestic debt that he said accounted for about 70 percent of the total debt. “Although our national debt is within sustainable limits, we need to increase our domestic resource mobilisation to bring down our debt-revenue ratio over the medium term,” he said. The spending plan is smaller than the record 9.12 trillion-naira budget for 2018 that he signed into law in June. The 2019 budget must still be approved by parliament, a process that can take months. Previous budgets have been delayed by wrangling and next year there will be the added complication of the presidential election followed by gubernatorial elections weeks later. “The proposal is unlikely to be approved before February’s election, meaning that both the assembly and Mr. Buhari himself might be replaced mid-way through the process,” said John Ashbourne, Africa economist at Capital Economics. “Even once the budget is finalised, it may not prove an accurate guide to actual spending,” he said, adding: “More broadly, today’s speech underlined the fact that another term for Mr. Buhari would mean policy stability.” Nigeria’s economy grew by 1.81 percent in the third quarter of this year. Inflation rate rose slightly in November to 11.28 percent compared with a year ago. $1 = 306.6000 naira

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Surging U.S. crude oil production will offset OPEC’s output cuts aimed at rebalancing the market as soon as the end of next year - undercutting the group’s efforts as shale producers ramp up output regardless of the price environment, forecasts show. U.S. oil production in the most recent week was 11.6 million bpd a day, just off the all-time record of 11.7 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. If production expands at the rate that the EIA has forecast, it will effectively eat up OPEC’s cuts by the end of 2019. [EIA/S] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia agreed to sweeping cuts of 1.2 million bpd earlier in December, with non-OPEC allies contributing 400,000 bpd of that reduction.  That is equivalent to the 1.18 million bpd in additional production the United States is expected to add next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said last week, due to growth in shale early in 2019 and in several long-awaited offshore projects set to come online late in the year.  Concerns about oversupply have hit oil prices hard in the last two months, with the price of U.S. crude slumping to $46 a barrel on Tuesday from a peak at more than $76 a barrel in October. U.S. oil production last year soared past an output record of 10 million bpd set in 1970.  With advances in technology including hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, the United States surged to become the world’s largest crude producer, and output is now expected to exceed 12 million bpd in the next several months.  “Relative to how big this looming supply tsunami is, [the OPEC cut] is not nearly enough to prevent big inventory builds next year,” said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy, a consultancy in Washington, D.C.   It underscores OPEC’s increasing difficulty in keeping a lid on supply to bring prices to a level the cartel sees as acceptable for state budgets. Saudi Arabia’s 2019 budget is set to increase to an all-time high in 2019, but economists estimate its budget is predicated on Brent crude averaging about $70 a barrel in 2019; it currently trades at $58 a barrel. (For a graphic on 'U.S. output gains approach OPEC cuts in late 2019' click tmsnrt.rs/2PFpkJw) OPEC data released this month shows the group is set to lose market share in 2019, falling from about 33 percent of crude in 2018 to 31 percent in 2019.  “I think this [production cut] is not a once-and-for-all resolution,” said Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman of IHSMarkit. “This is going to be an ongoing process of a global market coming to terms with continuing growth out of the United States. The global oil market is firmly in the shale era.” For a graphic on U.S. output gains approaching OPEC cuts in late 2019, see: tmsnrt.rs/2QSsNZQ.  OPEC and its allies cut production by 1.6 million bpd at the end of 2016 in a successful effort to reduce a worldwide supply glut, but during the life of that agreement, U.S. output increased by 1.62 million bpd, shifting market share away from OPEC.   That process could be even swifter this time out - part of the reason why OPEC and other forecasters expect the cuts will only last for a set six months. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said on Wednesday he expected stocks of global oil to fall by the end of the first quarter.

2018-12-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran denied on Wednesday reports that its exports of crude oil to Chile’s state energy company ENAP might have been a possible source of noxious fumes that caused hundreds of people to seek hospital treatment in August. A total of 508 people, most of them children, sought treatment in Quintero and nearby Puchuncavi in August after residents reported a strong smell in the air. Chilean law enforcement officials are investigating Iranian crude oil as a possible source of the odour. On Wednesday, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) denied any links between its crude exports to Chile and the noxious fumes. NIOC said international inspectors monitor the flow, loading and export of its oil and issue certificates which allow continuation of the exports. “Iran’s export terminals are equipped with state-of-the-art laboratories and devices for checking and measuring the quality and amount of the oil, and the quality of the export oil is always being examined at different times of the day,” NIOC said in a statement published by the oil ministry news agency SHANA.

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Global equity markets edged higher on Wednesday after a three-day sell-off which had investors seeking safety in bonds due to mounting pessimism over world economic growth. Crude oil futures have plummeted almost 10 percent since last Thursday while world stock markets have tumbled to 19-month lows.

2018-12-19,"MADRID (Reuters) - Wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa is booking 14 colossal specialized cranes, has hired new staff and boosted capacity by up to 80 percent at its Spanish factories as developers strain to meet a 2020 deadline for cutting carbon emissions. More wind farms are set to be built across Spain in 2019 than in any previous year, the APPA association of renewable energy companies calculates, surpassing a pre-recession boom in 2008 and putting unprecedented pressure on the supply chain.  “It is an enormous challenge ... We can really sense the urgency,” Enrique Pedrosa Gomez, Siemens Gamesa’s (SGREN.MC) CEO for southern Europe and Africa onshore, told Reuters. The Madrid-listed firm, owned by Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE), vies with Denmark’s Vestas (VWS.CO) to lead the global wind farm business. Gomez says it is complicated but feasible for the industry to install the 4,600 megawatts of wind power, which - along with 3,900 MW of solar capacity - must be in place by early 2020 to meet the terms of government auctions held in 2016 and 2017. Building the auctioned wind capacity will cost more than 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion), according to the Spanish Wind Energy Association. But some in the sector doubt that every plant can be brought on stream in time, underlining the scale of the challenge Spain faces in managing its shift away from carbon after years of standstill in adding new capacity. “They will be close, but they can’t build it all,” said Brian Gaylord, senior analyst for Latin America and southern Europe at Wood Mackenzie.  “It was unwise to award so much capacity back to back.”     (For graphic on Spanish renewable energy capacity, click tmsnrt.rs/2GsYCVd) Spain is sprinting to meet a 20 percent European Union target for energy generated from renewable sources in 2020, from its current level of around 17 percent. The Wind Energy Association says this target, which if missed could potentially lead to EU infringement proceedings and potential fines, is within reach, but is calling for a stable framework to reach future targets. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has made promoting green energy a cornerstone policy, and is working on a climate change law which foresees installing at least 3,000 MW each year to 2030. “We need regulation that helps keep investment coming to the market in Spain,” said the wind energy association’s director Juan Virgilio Marquez. “This isn’t about sudden spurts and jamming on the brakes, but advancing bit by bit every year towards achieving the targets.” The European Environment Agency said last month that the EU’s progress towards increasing the use of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency was slowing, putting its ability to meet its 2020 and 2030 targets at risk. A 2008 property market crash precipitated a deep recession in Spain and put paid to several years of significant additions to the country’s renewable energy capacity as cuts to state subsidies for alternative energy froze investment and prompted lawsuits against Spain. The roughly 1,400 MW of capacity that APPA expects to be installed by the end of this year pales in comparison with next year’s planned construction but is nonetheless the biggest increase since 2012. “You don’t want to go from a market where it is basically famine to feast so quickly,” said Wood Mackenzie’s Gaylord. While the domestic market sank, Spanish companies that had specialized in wind energy technology focused on exporting, but now the tide is turning. At Aguado Wind Services just outside Madrid, logistics manager Carlos Lopez says last year most of his business consisted of transporting rotors, nacelles (housings for turbine components) and masts for export, but now he has around 40 projects pending in Spain. The most popular location for new wind farms is the northeastern region of Aragon, followed by the northwestern region of Castile and Leon. Developers are trying to get the projects done as soon as possible, but wintry weather could slow construction in the coming months, Lopez warned. “In the most difficult areas it might not be possible to go as fast as people want. We often have to stop work for snow or fog.” Erecting turbines whose rotors can exceed 130 meters (427 ft) in diameter poses a particularly big logistical challenge, but solar plant developers are feeling the time pressure too. “We have a year left to get these projects working, which we are perfectly able to do, but we have to move fast,” said Pablo Burgos, founder of solar energy group Solarpack.

2018-12-19,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Environmental group Greenpeace said on Wednesday it could halve its workforce in India to 30 early next year due to a block on its bank account after accusations of illegal donations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nationalist government has tightened scrutiny of non-profit groups over the past four years. It says they often act against India’s interests and has revoked licenses for thousands of foreign-funded groups. Known for its campaigns against India’s coal-fired power plants, Greenpeace has been barred from receiving foreign donations since 2015. The Enforcement Directorate, India’s financial crime investigating agency, froze its main bank account on Oct. 5. Greenpeace, which denies wrongdoing, said it only had funds to pay employees for about two more months, meaning half of the staff of 30 locals were at risk of losing their jobs. “There are multi-pronged attacks on us,” said Greenpeace spokesman Nandikesh Sivalingam, blaming the coal lobby. “The coal industry is strong and powerful even if governments do want to move away from coal, including for climate change reasons.” It was not immediately possible to contact the Enforcement Directorate and a spokesman for the Finance Ministry, under which it operates, declined comment. Asok Dasgupta, president of lobby group Independent Power Producers Association of India, said it was unfair to blame power producers for action against Greenpeace. “I don’t understand this opposition to coal,” he told Reuters. “Renewable power can’t take over coal for many, many years. Fortunately we have got good coal reserves and we should use them.” Since Modi took office in 2014, India has cancelled  registration of nearly 15,000 non-governmental groups under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. Critics say the government has been using the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non-profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of India’s rapid economic development or questioned its human rights record. In October, Indian authorities froze the bank accounts of rights watchdog Amnesty International after a raid on its  office.

2018-12-19,"WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Two Democratic lawmakers urged the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday to better protect U.S. oil and gas pipelines from cyberattacks, after a report they requested detailed a lack of federal oversight of the critical conduits. A federal report released on Wednesday said Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, does not have a process to update its pipeline security guidelines to reflect revisions to standards considered by experts and regulators to be the industry bible on cybersecurity. The standards on avoiding hacker attacks are the Cybersecurity Framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The report by the General Accountability Office, or GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was requested by Senator Maria Cantwell and U.S. Representative Frank Pallone. “Protecting our pipelines, and the people who live and work near them, must be a top priority for our government and I hope this report will prompt the Trump administration to start treating this challenge with the urgency it deserves,” Cantwell said in a release. DHS, which concurred with 10 GAO recommendations in the report, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cantwell’s comments. The GAO’s recommendations for the TSA included implementing a process for reviewing, and if necessary revising, security guidelines at regular intervals. Energy infrastructure has long been a target of hackers. Last week, hackers using a variant of the notorious Shamoon virus crippled more than 300 computers owned by Italian oil services company Saipem and brought down servers in the Middle East and India. The company did not know who conducted the strike, but an official at a cybersecurity company CrowdStrike said he believed Iran was responsible. The report on Wednesday found TSA relied on self-evaluations by the pipeline industry to determine whether operators have critical facilities in their systems that could be the target of hackers. That is a classification the agency uses to determine calculations about the vulnerability of pipelines to cyberattacks. As a result, operators for one third of the top U.S. 100 pipeline systems, based on volume, told the TSA they did not have critical facilities, and the TSA did not verify the self-evaluations, it said. The report also said TSA had not tracked the status of security review recommendations to pipeline operators for the past five years. The vulnerability of gas pipelines to cyberattacks has been one argument that U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a Republican, has used to justify asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to bail out aging nuclear and coal power plants, which do not depend on pipelines. Cyber experts said Perry’s plan would not shield the grid from hackers because they have a wide array of options for hitting electricity infrastructure. FERC, an independent agency of the Department of Energy, rejected the Perry directive, but the issue could come up again.

2018-12-19,"(Adds analyst reaction, details of release, reaction) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Lower gas prices pulled Canada’s annual inflation rate in November down to 1.7 percent, the first time in 10 months it has been below the Bank of Canada’s 2.0 percent target, underscoring market expectations that imminent interest rate hikes are off the table. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast the annual rate would fall to 1.8 percent from 2.4 percent in October. November’s rate matched the 1.7 percent seen in January 2018. The Bank of Canada, which has raised rates five times since July 2017 as the economy strengthened, said earlier this month that economic data heading into the fourth quarter had been weaker than expected. “There’s absolutely no rush for the bank and probably the earliest we’re going to hear from them is in the springtime, in terms of rate hikes,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. The central bank, which had predicted lower gas prices would pull down the annual rate, is due to announce its next interest rate decision on Jan. 9 and markets expect no change. Statistics Canada said on Wednesday that gasoline prices fell by 5.4 percent from November 2017 on lower crude prices and overall energy costs dropped by 1.3 percent over the same period. In both cases, it was the first year-over-year decline since June 2017. It also noted that the Bank of Canada’s three core inflation measurements came in at 1.9 percent, the first time they have all been below 2.0 percent since June 2018. “That informs a near-term dovish Bank of Canada. No hike in the first quarter (of 2019), probably returning to a hike in April is still our call,” said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. The Canadian dollar pared its gains on the news, touching C$1.3446 to the U.S. dollar, or 74.37 U.S. cents. The drop in the overall annual rate was the sharpest in absolute terms since May 2012, when lower gas prices pulled it down to 1.2 percent from 2.0 percent in April.

2018-12-19,"* All eyes on Fed meeting, markets wager on a “dovish” hike * World stocks inch off 19-mth low, Brent oil up half a percent * Oil plunge drags on inflation outlook (Updates throughout, adds quote) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Global equity and crude oil markets attempted on Wednesday to claw their way out of a three-day long plunge that saw investors seek out the safety of bonds amid mounting pessimism over world growth. Oil’s spectacular fall - down almost 10 percent since last Thursday - and world stocks’ plunge to 19-month lows have prompted speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done with tightening after its policy meeting later in the day. There was also some support from China which announced an additional $14.5 billion medium-term lending facility to finance small private businesses. Market focus is now firmly on the U.S. Federal Reserve which is widely expected to deliver a rate rise but could signal a pause next year. Futures are pricing less than one rise in 2019, down from three not long back. “Financial market volatility, falling inflation expectations, and pockets of slowing growth will likely combine to produce a dovish hike in December”, BNP Paribas told clients. While Brent crude inched up 0.5 percent to $56.5 a barrel after plunging 6 percent overnight, its 35 percent fall since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world just as trade and economic activity are cooling. The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy. And logistics and delivery firm FedEx, considered a bellwether for the world economy, has slashed 2019 forecasts, noting “ongoing deceleration” in global growth. European shares added to earlier tentative gains, rising 0.5 percent by 1300 GMT while MSCI’s global equity index rose 0.2 percent. However the global benchmark has fallen 6 percent since the start of this month, given the fragile Sino-U.S. tariff truce and signs of slower company earnings worldwide. Wall Street appears set for a stronger opening, with the S&P500 index futures up 0.8 percent. But U.S. stocks are set for their worst December since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML “It’s a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown. More importantly, the market is adjusting to the idea this will translate into lower earnings growth,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking at Union Bancaire Privee in Zurich. “It’s being complicated by the tightening liquidity situation with the Fed expected to move today and the ECB having signalled the end of its (stimulus)”. Expectations of a Fed pause and the equity sell-off have sent 10-year Treasury yields to the lowest since August at 2.799 percent - down 20 basis points in December - though the equity recovery lifted yields off those troughs. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the bond rally were easy to find. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s closely watched monthly survey found more than half of its participants now flagging a global economic slowdown next year. It also showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record. The poll also revealed the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, their gains coming at the expense of equities. The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar’s major props and pulled its index back 0.3 percent to 96.8, from a recent top of 97.711. Villamin of UBP said that while uncertainty had grown about the Fed’s rate rise path, other currencies from the yen to the euro still lacked interest rate support. “Why the dollar won’t be too weak is that the alternatives are not attractive,” he said. “The only real attractive currency out there is the dollar ... we think dollar strength will stay another 3-6 months.” U.S. futures pointed to a firmer Wall Street opening. The bright spot on world markets is Italy where bond yields continued their fall after Rome struck a deal with the EU Commission over its contentious 2019 budget, signalling an end to weeks of wrangling. The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap - a measure of Italian risk - narrowed to 251 bps, the tightest since late September. That spread had been over 300 bps as recently as end-November. “Everyone was expecting an agreement to be reached, but many people were expecting this to come in Q1 or Q2 next year,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. “With risk sentiment stabilising this morning, it looks like the momentum can increase in Italian bonds.” Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and Dhara

2018-12-19,"(Adds comments on OPEC, non-OPEC agreement and China relationship) By Stephen Kalin RIYADH, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said he expects global oil stocks to fall by the end of the first quarter but added that the market remained vulnerable to political and economic factors as well as speculation. “We remain focused on fundamentals, I can tell you we will achieve balance between supply and demand in 2019,” he told reporters. Oil stabilised on Wednesday after one of its biggest falls in years, but remained under pressure from oversupply and concern that a slowing global economy would depress demand for fuel. Falih added that OPEC and non-OPEC members, including Russia, are committed to reducing stocks under the agreement reached in Vienna on Dec. 7. Supplies have already started to fall in the last few weeks, he said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. The U.S.-China trade war would not have an impact on Saudi Arabia’s relationship with China, Falih added. Speaking at a post-budget panel earlier, he said oil giant Aramco will double its production and availability of gas over the next 10 years. On renewable energy projects, Falih said Saudi Arabia has is implementing an agreement with SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund to provide 200 gigawatts of solar power in the kingdom. The country’s Public Investment Fund agreed to invest $45 billion in the giant tech fund led by SoftBank and the pair are working with other parties on a number of solar projects. Saudi Arabia is embarking on a drive to transform its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. It views solar power as a way to cut the amount of crude it uses to generate power at home and raise its overseas shipments. The government also wants to privatise Saudi Electricity as part of wider reforms to its energy sector. Reporting by Stephen Kalin

2018-12-19,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union set out short-term measures on Wednesday to limit disruption to air traffic, financial services and trade if Britain left the bloc without a deal next March.  However, in a sign that a no-deal Brexit would not be business as usual, there would be new checks to currently frictionless trade, which could lead to tail-backs near ports and delays to deliveries. Every shipment of live animals or animal products from Britain would face controls at EU borders and Britons would lose the right to travel with their pets using EU pet passports.  The European Union would only allow British trucks to carry goods into the bloc, assuming also Britain allowed EU trucks in, until the end of next year. The European Commission, which presented the plans, also warned of higher charges for using credit or debit cards because EU rules limiting such fees would no longer apply. Asked if the European Union was offering Britain a relatively attractive no-deal option, Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference the measures were simply designed to limit disruption. Dombrovskis said that the best way to avoid harming the British economy would be for Britain to stay in the European Union. In the case of Brexit, the withdrawal agreement agreed with the British government was better than no deal. “In the case of no deal, doing some preparation to limit damage is better than not doing any preparation at all,” he said. The Commission’s measures cover transport, financial services, customs and border checks, taxation and climate change and will need to be backed by the European Parliament and the 27 countries remaining in the EU. The EU executive proposed allowing British airlines to fly to and from EU airports for 12 months, assuming Britain offered equivalent rights to EU airlines. The bloc would also recognise UK clearing houses for financial derivatives for a year. The Commission, which is coordinating the European Union’s response to Brexit, also called on the 27 other EU governments to allow British nationals living in their countries to stay and work from March 29, the day Britain is due to leave. The Commission was keen to stress that the measures were limited in time. It also said that the contingency measures would not apply to British territory Gibraltar, which has an active financial services sector.

2018-12-19,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy’s nuclear security office is developing a project to help other countries handle nuclear waste, an effort to keep the United States competitive against global rivals in disposal technology, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The push comes as the United States struggles to find a solution for its own mounting nuclear waste inventories amid political opposition to a permanent dump site in Nevada, proposed decades ago, and concerns about the cost and security of recycling the waste back into fuel. The National Nuclear Security Administration is considering helping other countries by using technologies that could involve techniques such as crushing, heating and sending a current through the waste to reduce its volume, the sources said. The machinery would be encased in a “black box” the size of a shipping container and sent to other countries with nuclear energy programs, but be owned and operated by the United States, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.  “That way you could address a country’s concerns about spent fuel without transferring ownership of the technology to them,” said one of the sources. The NNSA confirmed a project to help other countries with nuclear waste is underway but declined to provide details. “We are in the conceptual phase of identifying approaches that could reduce the quantity of spent nuclear fuel without creating proliferation risks - a goal with significant economic and security benefits,” NNSA spokesman Dov Schwartz said. The effort is being led by NNSA Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Brent Park, a nuclear physicist and former associate lab director at the Energy Department’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, appointed by President Donald Trump in April. The NNSA declined a Reuters request for an interview with Park. The sources did not name countries to which the service would be marketed, or where the waste would be stored after it is run through the equipment. But they said they were concerned the processes under consideration could increase the risk of dangerous materials reaching militant groups or nations unfriendly to the United States. Former President Jimmy Carter banned nuclear waste reprocessing in 1977 because it chemically unlocks purer streams of uranium and plutonium, both of which could be used to make nuclear bombs. The NNSA’s Schwartz said the plans under consideration do not involve reprocessing, but declined to say what technologies could be used. The sources familiar with the NNSA’s deliberations said there are three basic ways that the physical volume of nuclear waste can be reduced, all of which are costly. At least one of the techniques poses a security threat, they said. The first, called consolidation, reduces the volume of nuclear waste by taking apart spent fuel assemblies and crunching the waste down to two times smaller than the original volume – an approach that is considered costly but which doesn’t add much security risk. A second technique involves heating radioactive pellets in spent fuel assemblies. The process, which gives off gases that must be contained, results in a waste product that has more environmental and health risks. A third approach called pyroprocessing - developed at the Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory - puts spent fuel in liquid metal and runs an electric current through it. That reduces volume, but concentrates plutonium and uranium – making it a potential proliferation risk. The nuclear community is divided on whether pyroprocessing fits the definition of reprocessing.  The Trump administration has made promoting nuclear technology abroad a high priority, as the United States seeks to retain its edge as a leader in the industry, amid advancements by other nations like Russia, and France – both of which already offer customers services to take care of waste. U.S. reactor builder Westinghouse, which emerged from bankruptcy in August and is owned by Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), hopes to sell nuclear power technology to countries from Saudi Arabia to India, but faces stiff competition from Russia’s state-owned Rosatom. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Saudi Arabia this month for talks on a nuclear energy deal with the kingdom, despite pushback from lawmakers concerned about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The United States is also struggling to support its own nuclear industry at home, with aging reactors shuttering, new projects elusive due to soaring costs, and an ongoing political stalemate over a permanent solution for mounting nuclear waste stockpiles. The United States produces some 2,000 metric tons of nuclear waste each year, which is currently stored in pools or in steel casks at the nation’s roughly 60 commercial nuclear power plants across 30 states. The federal government designated Nevada’s Yucca Mountain as the sole permanent U.S. nuclear waste repository decades ago to solve the problem, spending about $13 billion on the project, but it has never opened due to local opposition.  Thomas Countryman, the State Department’s top arms control officer during the Obama administration, said the government should make headway on the domestic problem before helping other countries. “The primary issue on this front … is not that the U.S. can’t offer a low-volume option to potential buyers; rather it’s that the U.S. still has no option for disposing of its own spent fuel,” he said. Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said NNSA should be less concerned about volume of waste and more concerned about the dangers that make it hard to store. “It’s not the volume of the nuclear waste that’s the issue, but the radioactivity and heat it gives off as well as the fact that it remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years,” he said.

2018-12-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Budweiser beer will be brewed in Britain using solar power from 2020 following a 15-year deal signed by brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) and renewable power developer Lightsource BP, the companies said on Wednesday. Lightsource BP will develop and operate 100 megawatts (MW) of solar projects to generate enough electricity for AB InBev’s breweries. The power being generated is the equivalent to the amount used by 18,000 homes. The solar projects are expected to be completed and connected to Britain’s power grid by the end of 2020. AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer, produces more than 17 million cans and bottles of Budweiser beer each week from its two main breweries in Magor, South Wales and Samlesbury, Lancashire. The initiative is part of the company’s sustainability goals which include purchasing all electricity from renewable sources by 2025, AB InBev said in a statement. No financial details were disclosed, but Lightsource said the deal would enable it to develop the solar projects without subsidies.

2018-12-19,"* All eyes on Fed meeting, markets wager on a “dovish” hike * Fed seen dropping “gradual increases”, lowering dot forecast * Latest plunge in oil prices drags on inflation outlook (Updates prices, adds charts) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Global equity and crude oil markets attempted on Wednesday to claw their way out of a three-day long plunge that saw investors seek out the safety of bonds amid mounting pessimism over world growth. Oil’s spectacular fall - down almost 10 percent since last Thursday - and world stocks’ plunge to 19-month lows have spurred speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done with tightening after its policy meeting later in the day. While Brent crude inched up 0.5 percent to $56.5 a barrel after plunging 6 percent overnight, its 35 percent fall since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world just as trade and economic activity are cooling. The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy. And on Tuesday, logistics and delivery firm FedEx, considered a bellwether for the world economy, slashed its 2019 forecasts, noting “ongoing deceleration” in global growth. European shares rose 0.3 percent and MSCI’s global equity index firmed a touch, though it has fallen 6 percent since the start of this month, given the fragile nature of the Sino-U.S. tariff truce and signs that company earnings worldwide are slowing. While equity futures signal a stronger opening on Wall Street, U.S. stocks are set for their worst December since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML “It’s a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown. More importantly, the market is adjusting to the idea this will translate into lower earnings growth,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking at Union Bancaire Privee in Zurich. “It’s being complicated by the tightening liquidity situation with the Fed expected to move today and the ECB having signalled the end of its (stimulus)”. Futures are sticking with a two-in-three chance of a rate rise on Wednesday and Villamin expects the Fed to move twice in 2019. That’s a more hawkish call than the broader market which is pricing less than one rise in 2019, down from three not long back. The expectations of a Fed pause and the equity selloff sent 10-year Treasury yields to the lowest since August at 2.799 percent - down 20 basis points in December - while two-year yields touched a three-month trough of 2.629 percent, sliding from November’s 2.977 percent peak. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the bond rally were easy to find. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s closely watched monthly survey found more than half of its participants now flagging a global economic slowdown next year. It also showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record. The poll also revealed the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, their gains coming at the expense of equities. The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar’s major props and pulled its index back 0.3 percent to 96.8, from a recent top of 97.711. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.15 percent to 112.37 yen , while the euro nudged up to $1.1383 from a $1.1266 low. Villamin of UBP said that while uncertainty had grown about the Fed’s rate rise path, other currencies from the yen to the euro still lacked interest rate support. “Why the dollar won’t be too weak is that the alternatives are not attractive,” he said. “The only real attractive currency out there is the dollar ... we think dollar strength will stay another 3-6 months.” U.S. futures pointed to a firmer Wall Street opening. The bright spot on world markets is Italy where bond yields continued their fall after Rome struck a deal with the EU Commission over its contentious 2019 budget, signalling an end to weeks of wrangling. The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap - a measure of Italian risk - narrowed to around 255 bps, the tightest since late September. That spread had been over 300 bps as recently as end-November. “Everyone was expecting an agreement to be reached, but many people were expecting this to come in Q1 or Q2 next year,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. “With risk sentiment stabilising this morning, it looks like the momentum can increase in Italian bonds.” Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and Dhara

2018-12-19,"* For a graphic on changing land use click on tmsnrt.rs/2GrBm9U By Alexis Akwagyiram MAKURDI, Nigeria, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Peter Zion has been unable to hold his infant son since attackers wielding machetes cut him so badly that his hands lost their ability to grip. He was attacked in January by nomadic herdsmen in the central Nigerian state of Benue, caught in the crossfire of a violent feud with local farmers over land rights that has killed hundreds in the country’s Middle Belt this year. As a member of the Livestock Guards, a state government backed rural security force of 4,000 unarmed officers, he was guarding a farm when the attackers staged a dawn raid. Some 73 people were killed in that and other attacks in the first days of 2018. Zion - who first spoke to Reuters from his hospital bed in the days following the attack - was cut with a machete across his face, torso and arms, and was shot at close range in his right thigh. Ten months later, his face scarred, he moved slowly with a crutch and was unable to move his hands. “If I want to pick my baby they will come and drop the baby in my lap,” said the 32-year-old. “My wife feeds me. If I want to go to the toilet she also supports me,” he said. Zion couldn’t move from his hospital bed for two months after the attack and was eventually discharged after a six-month stay that was followed by another two months convalescing in his village. The father of two sold his yam farm and a fish farm to pay his hospital bills. He is no longer able to do his job with the Livestock Guards and cannot afford the physiotherapy he needs. About 15 Livestock Guards were killed in the attack that crippled Zion, But they continue to patrol Benue, calling in the police or military at the first sign of danger. Zion said their work remains vital. “The job is important because there is a crisis in land in the state,” he said.

2018-12-19,"MAKURDI, Nigeria - A Reuters analysis of land use data shows how a massive expansion of farming in Nigeria’s Middle Belt has cut access to grazing land for nomadic herders and fuelled persistent violence. If the coming dry season in Nigeria follows the pattern of previous years, violence will soon erupt between herders in search of water for their cattle and farmers determined to protect their land. In the past, authorities have blamed the violence on religion or ethnic divisions. But a close examination of the changes in land use in central Nigeria shows just how much it comes down to a simple clash over resources. The stakes are high. Amnesty International said the violence has killed more than 3,600 people since 2016, most of them this year.   Clashes between herding and farming communities in 2018 have killed more people than the conflict involving the Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. Reuters journalists have tracked long-term land trends in Nigeria by analysing United States Geological Survey data.  The analysis of data released publicly only in 2016 shows open grazing land available in Nigeria’s Middle Belt declined by 38 percent between 1975 and 2013 while the area dedicated to farming nearly trebled. That means less land for nomads to feed their cattle, supporting the view of local people that the conflict is based on the availability of land rather than ethnic or religious differences. The shift towards farming not only reflects Nigeria’s rapid population growth, but also successive governments’ efforts to diversify the economy away from its heavy reliance on oil. Violence involving Fulani herders and farmers from other ethnic groups has been widespread since 2011 but most frequent in Nigeria’s Middle Belt, a region where the mostly Christian south converges with the Islamic north. (For a graphic on changing land use click on tmsnrt.rs/2GrBm9U) In 1975, grazing land was plentiful. It made up 52 percent of all land in Nigeria, while farmland made up 23 percent. In the Middle Belt, grazing land was even more plentiful - 61 percent was grazing land, while farmland accounted for 14 percent. In 2013, Grazing land decreased to 38 percent of the Middle Belt and farmland increased to 42 percent. The trend was similar across all of Nigeria. Reuters found that between 1975 and 2013, Nigeria’s Middle Belt lost about 84,000 square kilometres of land available to herders. “There is no single kilometre you go through without seeing farmland, unlike what used to happen in the ‘50s when the population was less,” said Samuel Ortom, Benue state governor, referring to the impact of Nigeria’s growing population. The United Nations predicts it will reach 400 million by 2050, more than double the present 190 million.  USGS data reveals that almost half of the 176,000 square km that changed from grazing land to farmland from 1975 to 2013 in Nigeria was in the Middle Belt. The central states make up about one third of Nigeria’s land area. But the Middle Belt is not strictly defined. Add another 50 km around the borders of these states and the Middle Belt accounts for almost two-thirds of the nationwide switch from grazing land to farmland. Many of the farmers are Christian and the herders are mainly Muslim, but locals see the land issue as paramount. “It’s a competition for limited land, it’s not about ethnicity or religion,” said Baba Othman Ngelzarma, National Secretary of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association of Nigeria. Some argue that anti-grazing laws punish the herders’ centuries-old nomadic way of life, which can be seen as cattle and herders traverse the Middle Belt’s roads and dusty bush paths. The herders are usually young men and boys - some as young as 9. Herders travel by foot with their animals - usually cows. They can walk hundreds of kilometres over the course of a few months, often crossing the porous borders that separate Nigeria from its neighbours: Benin, Niger and Cameroon. But land use has changed, even if herders’ customs have not. The Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast has helped to push herders into central Nigeria, say analysts, while changes in the north’s climate also encourage nomadic herdsmen to move further south. Herders start to move out as fertile land turns into desert because of over-exploitation and drought.  Springs and streams have dried up across the far northern Sahelian belt, prompting large numbers of herders to seek other pastures and sources of water for their cattle in the savannah of Nigeria’s central and southern states. Farmers say their crops have been destroyed by the herders’ cattle. As the fight over fertile land has intensified, so too have disputes over crop damage, water pollution and cattle theft. The violence between herders and farmers has forced thousands to flee their homes and huge camps have sprung up in Benue and Plateau states. In one outbreak of violence, more than 200 people were killed during a weekend in June. “We were just cooking. Before we knew it, some gunshots from nowhere,” said Kangyan Dankye, a resident in a camp in Plateau, describing an attack on her home by herders. “We just ran away,” said Dankye, who lost five relatives in the violence.

2018-12-19,"HOUSTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Activist investors of Chevron Corp said on Wednesday they had filed annual meeting resolutions calling for the oil company to embrace greenhouse gas reductions and align its operations with the Paris climate agreement. The effort, part of a continuing wave of climate-related proxy resolutions planned for spring 2019 annual shareholder meetings, is being led by investor groups As You Sow and Arjuna Capital. Last year, the two failed to win enough votes at Chevron on resolutions dealing with methane emissions and business risk. They now want Chevron to report on how it can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris accord, arguing climate change presents “portfolio risks to investors,” according to a copy of the resolution seen by Reuters. Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “We filed the first carbon asset risk resolution in 2013,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow. “There has been progress, but not enough.” The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a goal of capping temperature warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) before the turn of the century. This week, two groups of Exxon Mobil Corp investors said they would file a shareholder resolution calling on the world’s largest oil company to set targets for lowering its greenhouse gas emissions. Earlier, Royal Dutch Shell set out plans to introduce three-year or five-year carbon emissions targets linked to customers’ use of its fuels and affecting executive pay beginning in 2020, following pressure from its investors. BP and Total also have set short-term targets on reducing their own carbon dioxide emissions. This year, As You Sow and Arjuna lost votes calling for Chevron to limit methane emissions and to adapt its business to a low carbon economy. Those resolutions received 45 percent and 8 percent support, respectively.

2018-12-19,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain’s BP has launched the sale of U.S. oil and gas onshore assets that could raise more than $3 billion to help pay for other fields in the United States it bought in October from BHP (BHP.AX), industry and banking sources said. The sale proceeds will partly fund the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s onshore assets that are mostly around oil-producing fields in Texas and Louisiana. BP had said it would sell $5 billion to $6 billion to finance the deal. The London-listed firm wants to focus on production from its holdings in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to match rivals Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) whose production there is set to rise sharply in coming years. BP’s onshore business, which it has rebranded as BPX, sent out information packages last week on the assets it was selling and its representatives held a meeting in New York with the management teams of potential buyers, the sources said.     This follows a series of informal talks the company held with private equity firms since the end of November aimed at gauging interest in the assets, two of the sources said.      Interested parties include U.S. buyout funds Carlyle (CG.O) and Warburg Pincus, one of the sources said.     BP, which sources said was not using a banking advisor on the sale, declined to comment. Carlyle and Warburg Pincus were not immediately available for comment. Investors have been stepping up pressure on publicly traded oil firms to curb spending and boost returns. “That pressure is taking public companies out of the universe of buyers in the market, creating opportunities for private-equity companies,” said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Drillinginfo. Private equity firms such as Ascent Resources, Aethon Energy Management and Encino Acquisition Partners have all made large purchases of oil-producing assets this year. BP is offering seven packages, all of them consisting of shale assets it held before the BHP deal, two of the sources said.      Those include fields in the San Juan basin which straddles the Colorado-New Mexico border, the Cotton Valley field in East Texas, the Arkoma and Anadarko basins in Oklahoma, and the Wamsutter basin in Wyoming. There are a small number of non-operated stakes being offloaded, the sources said.     The most attractive pieces are thought to be the San Juan assets, which include around 9,000 operated and non-operated wells and were the backbone of BP’s U.S. onshore operations prior to the BHP deal, along with the Wamsutter basin. (For a graphic on 'BP U.S. onshore assets sales' click tmsnrt.rs/2S57CAZ) The sales document says the entire portfolio generates around $700 million in operating cashflow a year.     Most of the assets are gas-rich, which could deter some investors at a time when the abundance of gas production across the United States has pushed down prices for the fuel. The Permian, encompassing parts of Texas and New Mexico, is at the heart of the U.S. shale boom and has some of the lowest production costs in North America, which is valuable when U.S. WTI crude prices CLc1 have slumped almost 40 percent since reaching a peak in October. <O/R>     U.S. shale production is forecast to hit 8.2 million bpd in January, according to the U.S. Energy Department, as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, drives U.S. output to a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd), making it the world’s biggest crude producer.

2018-12-19,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Throw-away plastic items such as straws and polystyrene cups will be banned in the European Union by 2021, EU officials agreed on Wednesday, as they passed measures to cut plastic use in a bid to reduce marine litter. Negotiators from the European Parliament and for the 28 EU countries agreed a list of 10 single-use plastic products with readily available alternatives that will be banned. The items include cotton buds, cutlery, plates, straws, drink stirrers, sticks for balloons and food containers made of expanded polystyrene. For other plastic items, such as food containers and drinks cups and lids, the focus will be on limiting their use and setting clean-up obligations in some cases for manufacturers. All plastic bottles will have to have at least 30 percent recycled content by 2030. Producers of tobacco filters containing plastic will have to cover the costs for public collection of cigarette stubs. “We have all heard the warning by the World Economic Forum and others that, measured by weight, there will be more plastic than fish in the world’s oceans by 2050 if we continue dumping plastic in the sea at the present rate,” Austria’s sustainability minister Elisabeth Koestinger said.  Austria, which holds the rotating EU presidency, led talks on behalf of the 28 EU members. Environmental campaign group Greenpeace hailed the measures as a significant step forward in tackling plastic pollution, but said they fell short in certain areas. There was no EU-wide target to reduce consumption of food containers and cups, no obligation for EU countries to adopt targets, and a requirement only by 2029 to ensure 90 percent of plastic bottles are collected separately, Greenpeace said.  The EU recycles only a quarter of the 25 million tonnes of plastics waste it produces per year. China’s decision to stop processing waste coupled with growing alarm over damage to oceans has pushed the continent to end reliance on developing countries to deal with its waste.

Iraqi Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban said in a statement that the agreement with the oil services firm was aimed at boosting production from Majnoon. A deal was also signed on Wednesday between Basra Oil Co, which manages Majnoon, and Oil Exploration Co, two state-run Iraqi firms, to conduct a seismic survey in Majnoon. “Carrying out a three-dimensional seismic survey by the Oil Exploration Company in Majnoon will help to obtain accurate data and boost production at the field,” Ghadhban said. In June, Royal Dutch Shell exited Majnoon in southern Iraq and handed the field’s operations to Basra Oil. Crude oil output from Majnoon is more than 240,000 barrels per day (bpd), the statement said. Iraq is the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia and pumps around 4.6 million bpd, below its capacity, in line with global, OPEC-led supply cuts aimed at supporting prices. The bulk of Iraq’s oil is exported via southern terminals, which account for more than 95 percent of the country’s state revenue. Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed, Writing by Nafisa Eltahir and

Spreadbetters pointed to a muted start for Europe with Estoxx 50 a tad weaker while Dax futures were barely changed. FTSE futures were slightly weaker. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.5 percent, while Shanghai blue chips fell over 1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.6 percent. Oil had stolen the show as a supply glut saw Brent shed almost 6 percent overnight. U.S. crude was last up 20 cents at $46.55 a barrel, while Brent recouped 31 cents to fetch$56.57. Brent’s 35 percent plunge since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world at a time when trade and economic activity are already cooling. That has only added to pressure on the Fed to abandon its commitment to yet more hikes. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned the central bank not to “make yet another mistake”, while a Wall Street Journal editorial called for a pause. So far, the futures market is sticking with a two-in-three chance of a rate increase on Wednesday. “Despite recent market volatility we think that it is still more likely than not that the Fed will raise rates,” said ANZ senior economist Tom Kenny. “But we lean slightly toward the Fed removing the reference to the need for ‘further gradual increases’.” He also expects the median Fed forecast, or dot plots, to drop to two rate rises for next year, from the three projected back in September. The market is well ahead of that and pricing in less than one rise in 2019. Stocks were left in the dust by bonds as 10-year Treasury yields hit their lowest since August at 2.799 percent , testing a major chart level at 2.80 percent. Yields on two-year U.S. notes touched a three-month trough of 2.629 percent, a massive turnaround from November’s 2.977 percent peak. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the rally were easy to find. The latest survey of fund managers globally from BofA Merrill Lynch showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record, while just over half expected the world economy to slow next year. Investors rushed into bonds, with the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, while cutting equities. “Investors are close to extreme bearishness,” said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. “All eyes are on the Fed, and a dovish message could equal a bear market bounce.” The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar’s major props and pulled its index back to 96.921 , from a recent top of 97.711. The dollar fell to 112.39 yen, from a 113.70 high last week, while the euro nudged up to $1.1383 from a $1.1266 low. In commodity markets, gold held near its recent five-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher interest rates waned. Spot gold was a shade firmer at $1,249.81 per ounce.

2018-12-19,"* LNG imports to hit record high of 42.8 mln T -Refinitiv data * Strong demand for power generation has boosted LNG imports * LNG imports to be lower in 2019 on increased coal, nuke power * S.Korea's LNG imports: tmsnrt.rs/2QZQH5M By Jane Chung SEOUL, Dec 19 (Reuters) - South Korea’s imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are set to reach an all-time high over 42 million tonnes in 2018 thanks to robust power generation demand, but next year’s shipments are likely to ebb on increased coal and nuclear power. South Korea, the world’s No.3 LNG importer after Japan and China, typically takes between 33 million and 37 million tonnes of LNG a year, mainly for heating, power generation and cooking. This year, a volume of 42.8 million tonnes of LNG is the expected intake, up 13.8 percent from 37.6 million tonnes last year, according to ship-tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon. That would top 2013 LNG import levels of nearly 40 million tonnes, the country’s customs data showed. That was the year South Korea faced a series of nuclear reactor shutdowns due to a safety scandal over faulty parts, which led to an increase in gas power generation. “Gas usage for power generation sharply rose this year because the country’s nuclear utilization rate was the lowest so other power sources like gas had to fill the void,” said Shin Ji-yoon, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities in Seoul. In the six months of the year, an average of almost half of the country’s 24 nuclear reactors were offline for planned maintenance, according to Reuters calculations based on data from state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. As of now, six reactors are shut down. South Korea’s nuclear utilization rates dropped to just 63.6 percent for the first three quarters of 2018, the lowest rate ever, according to the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power data. Coal and nuclear together produce about 70 percent of South Korea’s total electricity needs, although the country is trying to lower its dependence on those two fuels to shift its energy policy towards cleaner and safer energy in the long term. This year, gas power’s share of the country’s power supply mix outstripped nuclear-produced electricity over January-October, according to calculations on data from Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO). Gas-fired generation through October accounted for 26.7 percent of electricity produced, up from 20.3 percent last year, while nuclear made up 23.1 percent, down from 27.6 percent. Looking ahead, South Korea’s LNG demand growth for power generation is expected to hover around 1 percent in 2019, down from nearly 20 percent this year, robbed of room to grow as more coal and nuclear power plants are still coming online despite the plans for a long-term shift in policy, according to a report by state-funded think-tank Korea Energy Economic Institute. “We expect that (LNG) imports next year will be lower than this year but will still exceed 40 million tonnes,” said Nicholas Browne, director of Asia-Pacific gas and LNG at Wood Mackenzie.

2018-12-19,"* Concerns about oversupply weigh on oil markets * Producer deal to cut output does not kick in until January * U.S. crude oil inventories rose last week -API * Pessimism over global economic growth also drags * Markets look to outcome of Fed meeting BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose on Wednesday to claw back part of their more than 5 percent losses from the previous session, with worries about oversupply and a slowing global economy keeping markets under pressure. U.S. crude oil had climbed 37 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $46.24 per barrel by 0122 GMT, after plunging 7.3 percent the day before in a session when it touched its lowest since August last year at $45.79. Global benchmark Brent was up 0.85 percent, or 49 cents, at $56.75 per barrel. It dropped 5.62 percent on Tuesday, at one point marking a 14-month low of $56.16 a barrel. “The toxic combination of oversupply worries and global growth distress should see oil prices languish into year-end as negative momentum is leading price action,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA. U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline inventories increased, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday. If the build in crude stockpiles is confirmed by U.S. government data Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. Meanwhile, analysts said that upcoming output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had so far failed to stimulate the market as they were not due to kick in until next month. Output from de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia as well as the United States and Russia - leading producers outside the group - has been at or near record highs. The U.S. government has said shale production is expected to climb to over 8 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time on record by the end of December. Russian oil output hit a record 11.42 million bpd this month, an industry source told Reuters. However, there were some factors tightening supply, with Libya’s state oil company declaring force majeure at the country’s largest oilfield. That came a week after the firm announced a contractual waiver on exports from the field following its seizure by protesters. Elsewhere, a speech marking 40 years of market liberalisation by Chinese President Xi Jinping offered no specific support measures for the second largest economy, disappointing investors who were expecting fiscal policy loosening and a tax cut. China’s Shanghai crude futures fell 5.95 percent in tandem with Brent’s decline overnight to trade at 388.9 yuan ($56.41) per barrel on Wednesday, the lowest level since their launch in March. Oil market investors were also turning their attention to the outcome of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve that is due to end on Wednesday.
