2018-12-09,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has denied allegations that Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch knew about the carmaker’s emissions test cheating almost three months before U.S. authorities made it public in September 2015.  Citing internal documents from investigators, German weekly Bild am Sonntag reported that Poetsch, VW’s finance head at the time, learned about the carmaker’s violations of the rules in late June 2015. The paper cites a confidential presentation from the VW legal department, available to investigators in proceedings about the carmaker’s alleged market manipulation. According to the report, a presentation dubbed “Sacramento” and dated June 24, 2015, stated that U.S. emissions rules were being violated and that the company may also have breached its supervisory obligations.  The paper also reported that, according to testimony from a leading VW lawyer, referred to as “witness P.”, Poetsch received the presentation on June 29, 2015. He was also informed then that 600,000 vehicles in the U.S. were affected and that the financial risk for VW stood at 35 billion euros ($39.8 billion). Volkswagen said in a statement on Sunday that it had been aware of the allegations for some time. “The presentation by the witness P. is emphatically rejected as inaccurate.” The diesel issue was the subject of a number of discussions with Poetsch in the summer of 2015, Volkswagen said.  “However, none of these discussions had the content and quality which could have made capital markets law relevant for Mr. Poetsch.” Volkswagen added that until the publication of the Notice of Violation by the U.S. authorities on September 18, 2015 it did not have sufficiently concrete indication of a situation that could be share price sensitive. Poetsch became VW chairman shortly after the “Dieselgate” scandal broke in 2015. Plaintiffs in a market manipulation lawsuit in Germany say Volkswagen failed in its duty to inform investors about the potential financial implications of the emissions test cheating, which has so far cost the company 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines. The company has argued it did not inform investors of the issue because it did not want to endanger the chance of reaching a settlement with the U.S. authorities.

2018-12-09,"(Adds context, industry details) MEXICO CITY, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Mexico’s energy secretary Rocio Nahle said on Saturday that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s newly installed administration would cancel two February bidding rounds for oil and gas blocks, including Mexico’s first shale areas on offer. Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, has sharply criticized the landmark energy opening enacted by his predecessor, President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose government planned the February auctions. The new president previously said he would suspend future oil auctions pending a review of the more than 100 contracts already awarded, but has not detailed what would become of the auctions slated for February. Mexico’s oil industry is struggling to stem a long-running crude output decline, posing one of the biggest challenges for Lopez Obrador’s six-year term. He has yet to disclose a full plan for the sector. Nahle told reporters at an event in the state of Chiapas on Saturday that two bidding rounds would be canceled. Together they would have auctioned off 46 oil and gas blocks, including the first shale areas in Mexico to be offered to private and foreign oil companies. The dense rock has been successfully tapped over the past decade in the United States, including the lucrative Eagle Rock formation in Texas just across Mexico’s northern border. Nahle did not address auctions for partnership rights for seven onshore joint venture contracts with national oil company Pemex, which are also scheduled for February. Under Mexican law, the independent oil regulator known as the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) runs the auctions and supervises contracts. The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lopez Obrador’s energy initiatives have so far focused on reducing fuel prices by building a new refinery in his home state of Tabasco, where he is expected to announce details of the project on Sunday. He has also encouraged private oil producers already awarded contracts in Mexico to deliver barrels quickly.
