2018-04-24,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - The Armenian opposition leader who helped force the country’s prime minister to resign called on supporters to stage a rally on Wednesday after planned talks with the ruling Republican Party were cancelled. Serzh Sarksyan, who previously served as Armenia’s president for a decade, resigned as prime minister on Monday after almost two weeks of street protests prompted by accusations he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power. “The Republican Party is thinking about taking advantage of Serzh Sarksyan’s resignation and wants to keep power,” opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan said in a video appeal posted on his Facebook page after he led thousands of people on a march on Tuesday. “We can’t agree on the appointment of this party’s representative as prime minister and we can’t allow this corrupted system to continue to exist,” he said, urging supporters “to come to the square and finish the velvet revolution.” Pashinyan played a key role in ousting Sarksyan, organising many of the protests and calling for the premier to go in a televised exchange before being jailed and then released. He had been set to start talks with the ruling party on Wednesday, but they were cancelled late on Tuesday. Sarksyan was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow is closely watching events in the former Soviet republic, where it has two military bases. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now. Acting Prime Minister Karen Karapetyan, an ally of the ousted Sarksyan, called on the president to organise another meeting, where all political forces could participate. “Being concerned by the current situation. ... I’m calling on the president to organise the meeting ... with the participation of parliamentary and non-parliamentary political forces,” Karapetyan said in a statement posted on his website. Armenian President Armen Sarkissian, another ally of the ex-premier, was sworn in as president earlier this month after being elected by parliament. Under a revised constitution approved in a 2015 referendum, most state powers shifted to the prime minister while the presidency became a largely ceremonial post. The opposition and ruling party could not agree on an agenda or format for Wednesday’s meeting, although Karapetyan said one of the topics at a rescheduled session could be holding early parliamentary elections, something Pashinyan was insisting on. In another move likely to prolong the political crisis that has rocked one of Russia’s closest allies from the former Soviet Union, Pashinyan said on Tuesday he was ready to be the country’s next premier and would keep up pressure on the ruling elite until it agreed to real change. “If people put this responsibility on me, I’m ready to become the prime minister,” Pashinyan, wearing his trademark black baseball cap and military-style T-shirt, told reporters. The 42-year-old politician said the velvet revolution he had helped bring about was not over and that the next step would be the election of a new prime minister by parliament and the holding of an early parliamentary election. If elected, Pashinyan said he would try to maintain a balance in foreign policy, but ruled out challenging the presence of Russian military bases in Armenia or the country’s membership in Russia-led military and economic alliances. “We are not going to make any sharp geopolitical moves,” he said. Many experts said it was too early to predict what lies ahead. “What is needed is a sober power-sharing reconfiguration,” said Richard Giragosian, a director of the Yerevan-based Regional Studies Centre. “Yet such consensus and compromise seems very far away, and with mounting expectations and anger dangerously high, the real challenge of governance is only just beginning.” Reporting by Margarita Antidze and Hasmik Mkrtchyan; Writing by Margarita Antidze and Andrew Osborn; Editing by Gareth Jones and Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/armenia-politics/update-3-armenian-opposition-leader-calls-new-rally-for-wednesday-idUKL8N1S17DD,24 Apr 2018,"* Acting PM calls on president to organise new meeting

2018-04-24,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed a rule on Tuesday that would limit the kinds of scientific research it can use in crafting regulations, an apparent concession to big business that has long requested such restrictions. Under the new proposals, the EPA will no longer be able to rely on scientific research that is underpinned by confidential medical and industry data. The measure was billed by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt as a way to boost transparency for the benefit of the industries his agency regulates. But scientists and former EPA officials worry it will hamstring the agency’s ability to protect public health by putting key data off limits. “The science that we use is going to be transparent, it’s going to be reproducible,” Pruitt told a gathering at the EPA. “It’s going to be able to be analyzed by those in the marketplace, and those that watch what we do can make informed decisions about whether we’ve drawn the proper conclusions or not,” said Pruitt, who has been pursuing President Donald Trump’s mission to ease the regulatory burden on business.  The EPA has for decades relied on scientific research that is rooted in confidential medical and industry data as a basis for its air, water and chemicals rules. While it publishes enormous amounts of research and data to the public, the confidential material is held back. Business interests have argued the practice is tantamount to writing laws behind closed doors and unfairly prevents them from vetting the research underpinning the EPA’s often costly regulatory requirements. They argue that if the data cannot be published, the rules should not be adopted. But ex-EPA officials say the practice is vital. “Other government agencies also use studies like these to develop policy and regulations, and to buttress and defend rules against legal challenges. They are, in fact, essential to making sound public policy,” former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and former assistant administrator for air and water Janet McCabe  wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times last month. The new policy would be based on proposed legislation spearheaded by the chairman of the House of Representatives Science Committee, Lamar Smith, a Republican who rejects mainstream climate change science. Emails obtained through a public records request last week showed that Smith and his staff met with Pruitt’s staff in recent months to craft the policy. Those emails also showed that Pruitt’s staff grappled with the possibility the policy would complicate the chemicals industry, which submits reams of confidential data to EPA regulatory programs. Pruitt’s proposal “ensures that data will be secret no more,” Smith said in remarks introducing Pruitt at the EPA gathering. “For too long the EPA has issued rules and regulations based on data that has been withheld from the American people.” But a letter signed by 985 scientists on Monday said the proposal would “greatly weaken” the agency’s ability to consider all the scientific information needed to form rules and implored Pruitt not to go through with the restrictions. The proposal will be open for a 30-day comment period and would have to be finalized before entering into force.

2018-04-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Tuesday as concerns the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran faded somewhat, reducing worries about the future of Iranian exports. U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to seek stronger measures to contain Iran. At a joint news conference, Trump did not repeat threats to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear agreement but made clear he has little patience for it. Renewed sanctions could harm Iran’s ability to export its crude. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA, said new sanctions against Tehran ""could push oil prices up as much as $5 per barrel."" (GRAPHIC: Asia crude oil demand - reut.rs/2K2V89x) Brent LCOc1 slid 85 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $73.86 a barrel. Earlier in the session it hit $75.47, its highest since November 2014. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell 94 cents to $67.70. WTI’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 was as wide as $6.32, the most since Jan. 2, on rising U.S. production.  Prices briefly extended losses in post-settlement trading after data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, showed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. Analysts had expected a decline in stockpiles. (GRAPHIC: Russia vs Saudi vs U.S. oil production - reut.rs/2JlrzPq) “We’re still really nestled within 3-1/2 year highs,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy. “With oil prices near $70, a dollar here or there is not really enough to move the needle,” he said.  Before slipping, Brent hit its highest since Nov. 27, 2014, which is the day the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided it would not curb global output. Prices subsequently went on a multi-year plunge.  Oil began recovering in 2016 as OPEC discussed a return to market management with the help of Russia and other non-members. A deal to rein in output started in January 2017. Meanwhile, oil demand in top consumer Asia is expected to hit a record in April. “Prices are being driven up by tight supply due to high production outages in Venezuela plus the cuts implemented by OPEC and Russia,” said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank. “What is more, demand appears robust.” Growing U.S. demand, indicated by strong refinery utilization rates, is very supportive to prices, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.  “You could get rid of all of these geopolitical headlines -Syria, trade - and if you did that, you would still have a very impressive demand situation in the United States,” he said.

2018-04-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of world stocks tumbled on Tuesday, erasing early gains as U.S. bond yields scaled the 3 percent threshold for the first time in four years, while oil prices reversed course after climbing above the $75 per barrel mark.  Equities in Europe hit session lows before closing near the unchanged mark and U.S. stocks began to retreat after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield crossed the 3 percent mark to a high of 3.003 percent, its highest since January 2014. In addition, the two-year yield US2YT=RR touched 2.5 percent for the first time since September 2008. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.9958 percent, up from 2.973 percent late on Monday. The move higher in yields sapped the appetite for stocks, which initially rose on a strong batch of earnings from Verizon (VZ.N) and Caterpillar (CAT.N). Rising bond yields provide more competition for stocks, especially those with high dividend yields.  “These higher Treasury yields are providing competition with riskier fixed income products and things like REITs and dividend-producing stocks,” said Bill Northey, senior vice president with U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana.    The bond market sell-off since late last week stemmed from inflation worries caused by rising commodity prices and growing Treasury debt supply, as well as bets the Federal Reserve would raise key borrowing costs further, analysts said. Higher commodity prices also pose a risk for equities, with Caterpillar shares reversing course and last down 6.2 percent after the heavy equipment maker forecast increases in material expenditures due to rising steel prices.  “There are factors that are adding to inflation pressure like a tightening labor market, trade tension and rising commodity prices,” Northey said.      The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.03 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.64 percent. MSCI’s index is on track for its fourth straight decline, its longest losing streak in a month.  Wall Street was also weighed down by a 4.77 percent drop in Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) as strong growth in ad sales on search and YouTube were not enough to offset a surge in costs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 424.56 points, or 1.74 percent, to 24,024.13, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 35.73 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,634.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 121.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,007.35. The Dow has fallen for five straight sessions, its longest losing streak since an eight-day skid in March 2017.  Despite the disappointing outlooks, U.S. corporate earnings have gotten off to the strong start that was widely anticipated, with the expected growth rate for the quarter currently at 21.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 118 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported through Tuesday morning, 77.1 percent have topped expectations.   After climbing above $75 a barrel LCOc1 to their highest since November 2014, Brent crude oil prices, the global benchmark, and U.S. crude prices were lower as concerns over the possibility that the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran faded. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled down 1.37 percent at $67.70 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $73.86, down 1.14 percent on the day.

2018-04-24,"* Government says oil tankers arrived to ease shortage * Drivers spent night in line at gas station to buy fuel By Khalid Abdelaziz KHARTOUM, April 24 (Reuters) - Vehicles queued for hours at gas stations in Sudan’s capital on Tuesday as a fuel shortage caused by the government’s difficulty in importing it due to a foreign currency crisis hit home. Once an exporter of oil, Sudan was forced to begin importing it after the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of what had been the country’s oil output and its main source of foreign currency. “I have been waiting at the gas station from last night until midday today. This bus is my only source of income,” said Adam Abdullah. The 45-year-old bus driver is one of many workers who spent the night at a gas station to refuel their vehicles. “I have been waiting for hours to find transportation to return home. This is something we cannot stand. Where is the government?” asked Intesar Awad from a bus station in the heart of Khartoum. Hundreds of others queued for rides home around her - joining lines that have built up since the end of last week as the currency crunch has bitten deeper. The Sudanese pound has dropped to 35 to the dollar from 33 pounds earlier this week, a black market trader told Reuters. He expected the Sudanese pound to weaken further in coming days. Inflation quickened to 55.6 percent in March year-on-year from 54.34 percent in February. Prices have risen since the pound plummeted to record lows on the black market in recent months, prompting the central bank to make two steep devaluations since the start of the year. It now officially trades at about 28 pounds to the dollar from 6.7 pounds in late December. The Sudanese pound hit a record low of about 40 pounds to the dollar earlier this year on the black market, but the devaluations and a ban on deposits of dollars obtained from the black market have reversed this trend. The central bank has also introduced restrictions on withdrawals, leaving many unable to take out cash from banks. Minister of State for Finance Abdelrahman Drar said in a statement on Tuesday that five tankers carrying petroleum products had arrived at Sudan’s main port to alleviate the shortages. Potentially increasing the short-term uncertainty, two Nigerian oil companies, Express and Misana, on Monday sold their 30 percent joint stake in Sudan’s al-Rawat oil field to Sudan National Petroleum Corporation or Sudapet, Khartoum’s state news agency SUNA reported. Sudapet now owns all the shares in al-Rawat, which falls along the While Nile, 420 km south of Khartoum. It hopes to increase output in the long-term, reducing the dependence on imports, through increased exploration.

2018-04-24,"(Adds Cambrige University, BP spokesman comments) LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley on Tuesday urged Cambridge University not to yield to pressure from hundreds of students and academics to cut its investments in fossil fuels and pointed to BP’s donations to the university. “We donate and do a lot of research at Cambridge so I hope they come to their senses,” Dudley told the AIPN International Petroleum Summit. BP did not immediately disclose how much it has been donating to the university. In 2015/16 it gave grants worth around 1.4 million pounds, according to Cambridge, and in 2000 a 22 million pound donation from BP helped to create the BP Institute for Multiphase Flow, which focuses on research in surfaces and particles and fluid dynamics. Cambridge said the University Council will publish its decision on whether it will change its investments after years of campaigning by students and academics after a meeting next month. A spokesman for BP said after Dudley’s comments that he does not expect the group’s relationship with Cambridge to change. “One should not infer from Bob’s comments that he was in any way linking our support of Cambridge with the University’s decision on whether or not to divest from the oil and gas industry.” Last week, about 350 Cambridge academics signed a letter to the university and its colleges, which enjoy a certain degree of independence from the university’s central administration, to excise fossil fuel investments from the roughly 6.3 billion pounds ($8.81 billion) at their disposal. “We ... call on the university’s investment office to immediately freeze any new investments in fossil fuel companies, and to divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds within five years,” an open letter said. Signatories include chemist David King, who was Britain’s Special Representative for Climate Change until last year following his seven-year stint as the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor. Activists in the Cambridge Zero Carbon Society said they received a letter on Monday from vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope which stated the university had a leadership role in understanding and tackling climate change. “The objective ... is to promote and execute urgent and tangible action to deliver a carbon neutral future. The University is already taking steps that must be further expanded in the areas of its investments, research, education, estate and policy decisions,” Toope’s letter said. This mirrored Cambridge’s response when asked about Dudley’s comments. A spokesman for the activist group said in response to Dudley, “if the University is unable to divest its endowment in line with the democratic wishes of students and staff due to these threats, then there is no longer academic independence at Cambridge.” The world’s top oil and gas companies are facing rising pressure from investors to shift to cleaner energy and renewables in order to meet international targets to sharply reduce carbon emissions by the end of the century. Dudley said that BP was going to invest around $500 million per year in renewables in the coming years, but that the world will need oil and gas “for many years to come.” $1 = 0.7154 pounds

2018-04-24,"April 24 (Reuters) - The Russian government may feel compelled to support Oleg Deripaska after the billionaire and his businesses were hit by U.S. sanctions this month, because his sprawling empire employs tens of thousands of people across Russia. Deripaska’s group Basic Element (Basel) owns or controls about 100 companies around the world that range from the world’s second biggest aluminium producer Rusal to a carmaker and power generation firms. Basel’s website says about 200,000 people are employed by these businesses. The majority are in Russia but it does not give a precise breakdown. Ten cities across Russia depend on his companies for employment, according to government data from 2015. Below is a more detailed list of companies owned by Basel and their employees: * Basel controls En+ Group, which employs about 35,000 people. * En+ holds a 48.13 percent stake in Rusal, the aluminium firm that employs 62,000 people, of which 52,390 are in Russia, a 2016 Rusal report said. It did not give 2017 figures. * En+ Group owns EuroSibEnergo, which draws together power generation and coal assets such as hydropower unit IrkutskEnergo and coal firm VostSibUgol. It employs 30,000 people. * Basel also owns Russian Machines, which employs 57,000 people in the range of companies it controls such as carmaker GAZ Group and other firms involved in making railway carriages, road construction and agriculture. * Basel Aero, which runs four airports in the southern cities of Sochi, Krasnodar, Anapa and Gelendzhik, employs about 6,000 people. * Basel controls a range of firms involved in building houses and producing construction materials, such as GlavMosStroi, GlavStroi Development, GlavStroi SPB and BaselCement. These firms employ more than 20,000 people. * AgroHolding Kuban, a Basel subsidiary involved in crop growing and livestock breeding, has about 5,000 workers.

2018-04-24,"WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency is close to announcing a new policy that would stop it from relying on scientific research underpinned by confidential data in its rulemaking, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The measure will be billed by the agency as a way to boost transparency for the benefit of the industries it regulates, according to the sources who asked not to be named. But scientists and former EPA officials worry the move will hamstring the agency’s ability to protect public health by putting key medical and industry data off limits. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has been pursuing President Donald Trump’s mission to ease the regulatory burden on business, is expected to unveil the new policy as early as Tuesday afternoon, the sources said. EPA officials did not respond to requests for comment. The EPA has for decades relied on scientific research that is rooted in confidential medical and industry data as a basis for its air, water and chemicals rules.

The new policy would be based on proposed legislation spearheaded by House Science Chairman Lamar Smith, a Republican from Texas who denies mainstream climate change science. Emails obtained through a public records request last week showed Smith or his staff met with Pruitt’s staff in recent months to craft the policy. Those emails also showed that Pruitt’s staff grappled with the possibility the policy would complicate things for the chemicals industry, which submits reams of confidential data to EPA regulatory programs.

2018-04-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) Chief Executive Bob Dudley on Tuesday urged Cambridge University not to yield to pressure from hundreds of students and academics to cut its investments in fossil fuels and pointed to BP’s donations to the university. “We donate and do a lot of research at Cambridge so I hope they come to their senses,” Dudley told the AIPN International Petroleum Summit. BP did not immediately disclose how much it has been donating to the university.  In 2015/16 it gave grants worth around 1.4 million pounds, according to Cambridge, and in 2000 a 22 million pound donation from BP helped to create the BP Institute for Multiphase Flow, which focuses on research in surfaces and particles and fluid dynamics. Cambridge’s University Council is expected to decide within weeks whether it will change its investments after years of campaigning by students and academics. Last week, around 350 Cambridge academics signed a letter to the university and its colleges, which enjoy a certain degree of independence from the university’s central administration, to excise fossil fuel investments from the roughly 6.3 billion pounds at their disposal. “We ... call on the university’s investment office to immediately freeze any new investments in fossil fuel companies, and to divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds within five years,” an open letter said. Signatories include chemist David King, who was Britain’s Special Representative for Climate Change until last year following his seven-year stint as the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor. Cambridge had no immediate response to Dudley’s comments. Activists in the Cambridge Zero Carbon Society said they received a letter on Monday from vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope which stated the university had a leadership role in understanding and tackling climate change.  “The objective ... is to promote and execute urgent and tangible action to deliver a carbon neutral future. The University is already taking steps that must be further expanded in the areas of its investments, research, education, estate and policy decisions,” Toope’s letter said.  When asked about Dudley’s comment, a spokesman for the activist group said “if the University is unable to divest its endowment in line with the democratic wishes of students and staff due to these threats, then there is no longer academic independence at Cambridge.” The world’s top oil and gas companies are facing rising pressure from investors to shift to cleaner energy and renewables in order to meet international targets to sharply reduce carbon emissions by the end of the century. Dudley said that BP was going to invest around $500 million (358 million pounds) per year in renewables in the coming years, but that the world will need oil and gas “for many years to come.” (This version of the story corrects spelling of name in paragraphs 10, 11) Reporting by Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Alexandra Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/bp-ceo-cambridge/refile-cambridge-donor-bp-urges-university-to-keep-fossil-fuel-investments-idUKL8N1S13IX,24 Apr 2018,"BP Chief Executive Bob

2018-04-24,"TORONTO, April 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc dropped more than 4 percent on Tuesday after a Minnesota judge agreed the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement project was needed, but rejected the company’s preferred route. Enbridge has proposed a C$8.2 billion ($6.4 billion)replacement of its existing Line 3 export pipeline, which extends from Alberta into Wisconsin, doubling capacity on the line to 760,000 barrels per day. But the project has run into opposition in Minnesota from the state, along with Native American tribes and environmental activists who have questioned whether the replacement is needed. Administrative Law Judge Ann O’Reilly, of the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings for the Public Utilities Commission ruled late on Monday that Enbridge should be issued permission for the replacement, but said the company should use its existing right of way, adding hurdles to the project’s construction. Under the judge’s recommended route, the existing pipeline would need to be removed and the new one put in its place. Enbridge had asked to leave its current Line 3 in the ground and lay new pipe, at times following a new corridor in the state. The company said in a statement that it was pleased the judge had supported the project and said it would review her recommendations on routing. The latest obstacle to Line 3 comes as work has been halted on Kinder Morgan Canada’s Trans Mountain expansion pending a May 31 decision on whether the project, which faces opposition in the Canadian province of British Columbia, will go ahead. Canada’s oil producers, meanwhile, are desperate for new export pipelines, as rising production and tight capacity on existing pipelines and via rail has led to Canadian crude trading at a wide discount to the West Texas Intermediate benchmark. Shares of Enbridge were down 4.72 percent at C$37.94 on Tuesday morning. $1 = 1.2827 Canadian dollars

2018-04-24,"YEREVAN, April 24 (Reuters) - A politician who forced Armenia’s prime minister to resign led thousands of people on a march on Tuesday to mark the anniversary of Ottoman Turk massacres of Armenians in 1915, cementing his growing political stature. Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan resigned on Monday after almost two weeks of street protests prompted by accusations he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power. nL8N1S048K] Lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan played an instrumental role in ousting Sarksyan, organising many of the protests and calling for the premier to go in a televised exchange before being jailed and then released. He is set to start talks with the ruling party on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Pashinyan led thousands of people through the capital Yerevan to a hilltop memorial dedicated to the victims of the 1915 massacres. Some chanted his name and waved the national flag. Armenia say the killings during World War One constituted genocide. Muslim-majority Turkey accepts that many Christian Armenians were killed in fighting during the war but denies the killings amounted to genocide. Given the anniversary’s solemn nature, politicians decided to largely refrain from making political statements about the country’s future on Tuesday. But acting prime minister Karen Karapetyan, an ally of the ousted Sarksyan, said it was important to stay united amid the political tumult. “We are going through a very difficult stage in our new history...demonstrating to the entire world that despite difficulties and unresolved problems we are united,” Karapetyan said in a statement after laying flowers at the memorial to the victims of the massacres. “We reaffirm our determination to build strong statehood and a free and civilised society.” Sarksyan’s allies like Karapetyan remain in important positions in government and it remains unclear whether his resignation will herald any real change. Armenia’s political parties in parliament must now put forward the name of a new prime minister within seven days. Pashinyan, 42, appears keen to play a major role in the political reconfiguration. He has a history of political activism and was among opposition activists who demonstrated against Sarksyan’s 2008 presidential election victory. Ten people were killed in clashes that followed that win. After a period of hiding, Pashinyan surrendered to the police in 2009 and was sentenced to four years in prison for organising civil disturbances. He was released two years later under an amnesty. “Nikol is a really popular leader, whom we trust,” Karen Mkhitaryan, a 19-year-old student, said of Pashinyan. Politicians and experts said on Tuesday that Sarksyan, who was president for a decade before trying to extend his time in power, decided to step down due to what they described as unbearable pressure coming from the mass protests. “Thousands of people were in the streets for days demanding his resignation and the moment came when he had no resources to suppress this movement,” Ararat Mirzoyan, an opposition leader, told Reuters. Some said Sarksyan’s move was a rare example of political wisdom from a leader under pressure. “Serzh Sarksyan has confirmed once again that he is a real statesman,” Eduard Sharmazanov, a vice speaker of parliament, told Reuters. Others praised him for not resorting to a bloody crackdown to stay in power, something he had hinted at on Sunday. Sarksyan was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow is closely watching events in Armenia, where it has two military basesy. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now. Many experts say it is too early to predict what lies ahead however. “What is needed is a sober power-sharing reconfiguration,” said Richard Giragosian, a director of the Regional Studies Centre. “Yet such consensus and compromise seems very far away, and with mounting expectations and anger dangerously high, the real challenge of governance is only just beginning.” (Writing by Margarita Antidze/Andrew Osborn; editing by Angus MacSwan)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/armenia-politics/armenian-politician-who-forced-pms-resignation-leads-thousands-in-march-idUKL8N1S15S8,24 Apr 2018,"A politician who forced

2018-04-24,"PARIS, April 24 (Reuters) - French billionaire Vincent Bollore, who was being questioned by police on Tuesday over allegations related to port concessions in Africa, has turned family-owned Groupe Bollore into an international conglomerate in 37 years at the helm. The Brittany-based maker of high-quality thin papers used in printing and publishing that he inherited in the early 1980s has become an 18.3 billion-euro ($22.35 billion) global group with a Paris listing and 80,000 employees. The 66-year-old, a friend to former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and several African leaders, has said he would hand control of the group to his four children in February 2022, the year of his 70th birthday and the bicentenary of the company. Bollore’s transport and logistics arm, built up through successive acquisitions and investments since the 1990s, delivered most of the group’s operating profits in the past two decades. It generated 7.9 billion euros of revenue in 2017. The division, headed by one of Bollore’s three sons, Cyrille, is particularly active in West Africa, where its subsidiary employs 25,000 people. Bollore Africa Logistics operates 16 container ports in Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Ghana, Gabon, Benin, Congo, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Togo and Comoros. The company runs rail services in Cameroon, Benin and Ivory Coast and also has investments in oil and gas projects, agro-industry, telecoms and the pharmaceutical sector. In addition, it is active in oil logistics, including the distribution and storage of fuel and oil products in France, Germany and Switzerland. With annual sales of more than 10 billion euros, the communications business overtook transport and logistics as Bollore’s top revenue earner after the accounts of France’s Vivendi were consolidated into the group balance sheet. Bollore became the biggest investor in the media giant in 2014 and now owns 20 percent of Vivendi, the owner of pay-TV group Canal Plus and the world’s biggest music label Universal Music Group. Bollore controls Vivendi thanks to a French law giving double voting rights to long-term shareholders. The media company absorbed Havas in 2017, when Bollore sold its 60 percent controlling stake in the advertising firm in a deal worth 3.9 billion euros. Another of Bollore’s sons, Yannick, replaced his father as Vivendi’s chairman last week. The smallest division by turnover, the energy storage unit generated 311 million euros in revenues last year but Bollore sees huge potential. The billionaire is a proponent of battery technology, which is used by the Autolib electric car sharing service that Bollore operates in Paris and other French cities. Bollore’s batteries are produced by the group’s wholly-owned factories in Europe. The division also produces plastic film for capacitors and ultra-thin film for packaging. $1 = 0.8188 euros

O’Neill told Reuters on the sidelines of an investment conference in London that LNG production would be fully restored by May. “We loaded one shipment ... and production will be in full swing before the end of the month,” he said. A magnitude 7.5 quake rocked the country’s remote mountainous highlands on Feb. 26, killing at least 100 people, destroying roads and disrupting LNG production — Papua New Guinea’s main source of foreign revenue. Fiscal pressures were already high as a result of the collapse in oil prices to $27 a barrel in early 2016. Gas prices are closely linked to oil. Crude markets have since recovered, breaking above $75 a barrel for the first time in nearly 3-1/2 years on Tuesday. That will help make up the revenue shortfall sustained because of the devastating quake, O’Neill said. “It certainly will affect the last couple of months, we received no revenue because of the earthquake,” he added. O’Neill, who stayed in London to rustle up investment following last week’s meeting of Commonwealth leaders, also said the country was preparing to launch its debut Eurobond. “In the next few weeks we will be announcing the lead managers,” he said, adding a shortlist had been drawn up for the planned $500 million 10-year bond to be sold before year-end. Papua New Guinea’s total debt stood at 31 percent of GDP, of which almost two-thirds are domestic debt, the premier said. “In terms of our debt management, we are comfortable,” said O’Neill, adding his country had no plans to talk to the International Monetary Fund about assistance. But recent pressures have cast a shadow over the economic and fiscal outlook. Earlier this year, ratings agency S&P Global lowered the Pacific island nation’s credit rating to B from B+, while Moody’s downgraded its outlook to negative from stable. Both cited a deteriorating debt profile, lower economic growth and rising liquidity risk. Once production is fully restored at ExxonMobil Corp’s Papua New Guinea LNG project, O’Neill said there were plans to add three LNG trains to the existing two and details would be announced before November’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. Apart from natural gas, the country can also earn foreign export revenue from mining, although its Panguna mine on the island of Bougainville, once one of the world’s biggest copper mines, has been shut since a civil war in 1989. Bougainville Copper has been working to restart the mine and has contested a decision by the Bougainville government to impose an indefinite moratorium. “The constitution and the overall legislation from the federal national government is the one that underpins all the other legislation. It’s subject to the main laws,” the prime minister said when asked about the moratorium. He declined to predict the outcome of court deliberations. Papua New Guinea also hit the headlines over environmental protests because of plans by Toronto-listed Nautilus Minerals to mine the ocean floor. “We are reviewing some of the environmental issues. We will continue to engage with Nautilus to see how we can mitigate that,” O’Neill said.

Equities in Europe hit session lows and U.S. stocks lost ground after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield crossed the 3 percent mark to a high of 3.003 percent, its highest level since January 2014. In addition, the two-year yield touched 2.5 percent for the first time since September 2008. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.9939 percent, from 2.973 percent late on Monday. The move higher in yields dampened the appetite for stocks, which had been higher on the back of a strong batch of earnings from names such as Verizon, up 1.94 percent and Caterpillar, up 2.88 percent. “The market has to get used to the notion that this could be just another step in reversing a trend that has been in place in the market for nearly four decades,” said Frank Cappelleri, technical market analyst and trader at Instinet in New York, referring to declining rates on bond yields. “From my perspective, if this downtrend is going to break, this is the best chance of it over the last five years.” The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.23 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.16 percent. MSCI’s index has declined for three straight sessions, its longest losing streak in a month. Gains on Wall Street were also hemmed in by a 4.93 percent drop in Google parent Alphabet as strong growth in ad sales on search and YouTube were not enough to offset a surge in costs. Google kicked off a big week for tech sector earnings, with results expected from 23 names in the group including Facebook and Microsoft. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.44 points, or 0.19 percent, to 24,401.25, the S&P 500 lost 6.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,663.97 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 52.08 points, or 0.73 percent, to 7,076.52. Chipmaker AMS slumped 9.64 in Swiss trading after it reported first-quarter sales towards the lower end of its guidance range on Monday and warned of a downturn owing to weaker orders from one of its main customers. AMS did not name the customer, but the Austrian company is a big supplier to Apple, making components for the iPhone. U.S. earnings thus far have gotten off to the strong start that was expected, with the expected growth rate for the quarter currently at 21.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 118 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported through Tuesday morning, 77.1 percent have topped expectations. Brent crude oil prices, the global benchmark, rose above $75 a barrel to their highest level since November 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts, strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. U.S. crude rose 0.16 percent to $68.75 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.87, up 0.21 percent on the day. Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak

2018-04-24,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland’s plan to improve air quality and switch to electric vehicles could be financed with help from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a top EBRD official said. Poland aims to have 1 million electric cars on its roads by 2025 as it seeks to cut emissions in its most polluted towns. It has offered tax and other incentives to make electric cars more accessible and is working on a Polish electric car prototype. Air quality activist group Polski Alarm Smogowy says cities such as Warsaw, Katowice and Krakow are among the dirtiest in Europe. “We will be delighted to support projects going towards electromobility, both in terms of public transport and other projects that could lead to the development of this sector,” Grzegorz Zielinski, EBRD’s Poland chief, told Reuters. He said the EBRD could for example help finance the use of electric buses, rather than diesel ones, in some Polish towns. Poland, which is highly dependent on coal, has not yet requested the money, nor specified how much it is budgeting for spending on the project.   Helping Poland become cleaner is one of the key elements of EBRD’s new country strategy approved earlier this month.  Zielinski also said EBRD was ready to provide financing for Poland’s first offshore wind farms. The two most advanced projects are developed by state-run utility PGE (PGE.WA) and Polenergia (PEPP.WA) controlled by the Kulczyk family, one of the richest in Poland.  EBRD has helped financed many onshore wind farms in Poland in the past but has criticised government policies which have made them unprofitable.  In 2016 the government unexpectedly banned building wind farms too close to dwellings and imposed a higher property tax on wind farm owners. In its most recent proposal it has withdrawn from the tax though. Zielinski said that these regulatory changes for renewables were one of the reasons why many foreign investors have put on hold their investment decisions in Poland. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) used to say that coal would remain Poland’s dominant source of energy for many years and saw renewable energy as unstable.  But more recently it has suggested Poland needs cleaner sources of energy, including nuclear power and offshore wind farms, to reduce emissions and meet EU targets.  EBRD sees its annual investment in Poland in the coming years similar to previous years. It spent 660 million euros in 2017 and 780 million euros in 2016.

2018-04-24," LONDON (Reuters) - The slump that characterised the oil market between the middle of 2014 and the middle of 2016 has been replaced by what looks like the beginning of a boom. Benchmark Brent prices have already risen by more than $45 per barrel or 170 percent from their cyclical trough in early 2016. Front-month futures prices, at almost $75 per barrel, are now trading close to the inflation-adjusted average for the last price cycle, which started in 1998 and finished in 2016. So far this year, futures prices have averaged nearly $68 per barrel, which is well above the post-1973 real average price of $50-$55. Futures prices have shifted from a big contango during the slump into an increasingly wide backwardation since the middle of 2017, which is consistent with a shift from over-supply to under-supply. (For a chartbook click here: tmsnrt.rs/2JkTIpK) Global oil consumption is predicted to increase by more than 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, the fourth consecutive year of very strong growth. Non-OPEC oil production is forecast to increase by 2.0 million bpd or more this year, mostly as a result of a large increase in U.S. shale plus other output increases from Canada, Brazil and Norway. But with steep declines in output from OPEC member Venezuela as a result of unrest and mismanagement, and continued curbs on production by other OPEC and non-OPEC members, global production is failing to keep pace with consumption. OECD inventories have dropped sharply and are now in line with the five-year average, eliminating the surplus of over 300 million barrels inherited from the slump. If inventories are adjusted for the rise in consumption, which gives a more accurate picture of the market balance, stocks are now well below the five-year average and continue to tighten. So on every indicator, from spot prices and spreads to consumption, production and inventories, the oil market is now well into the boom phase of the cycle. But booms are always followed by slumps. If OPEC allows the oil market to tighten too much in 2018/19, it will create the conditions for the next downturn a few years later. Senior OPEC officials insist the organisation’s work on rebalancing the market has not yet been completed and they resist the characterisation of “mission accomplished”. In particular, they point to the relatively low level of investment in exploration and production to justify the need for continued production curbs and even higher prices. But investment is a lagging indicator. Investment was slow to pick up during the early stages of the last boom (1998-2008) then proved stubbornly resilient in the first stages of the slump (2014-2016). Lagging upstream investment is one of the principal causes of cyclical instability in the oil market and has been since the beginning of the modern petroleum industry. If OPEC members wait for an acceleration of upstream investment before relaxing their production curbs, as ministers have indicated, they will almost certainly over-tighten the market in the meantime. The oil market is already tight and the increasingly wide backwardation indicates traders expect it to become even tighter during the second half of the year, when oil consumption moves seasonally higher. If OPEC maintains its current output curbs through December, the market is set to become exceptionally tight, which will push prices and spreads towards unstable levels. The resulting increase in prices and spreads will accelerate production growth even further and start to restrain consumption growth. OPEC ministers profess to be unconcerned about the impact on either supply or demand, but they have often misjudged market responses in the past. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has already resumed its upward trend over the last three weeks in response to higher prices, which will increase shale output even further by the end of 2018. Consumption changes are harder to measure in real-time, and tend to lag behind changes in oil prices, but the rise in prices will restrain demand too, as it has always done during every previous period of rising prices. OPEC members deny that they are principally responsible for the increase in oil prices over the last year or that they should adjust their production policy in response. They can point to unplanned outages in Venezuela and other producing nations, as well as unexpectedly strong demand from consumers, for drawing down inventories faster than they predicted at the end of last year. They can also point to growing concern among traders about the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and re-imposition of sanctions on Iran for accelerating price increases. All these arguments are true. And all these factors are outside OPEC’s control. But production policy is something OPEC controls directly and for which it is responsible. OPEC’s current production levels were set back in November 2016, when the market was heavily oversupplied, inventories were rising, and prices had only risen modestly from cyclical lows. What was appropriate then is arguably no longer appropriate now. If OPEC members decide to extend current levels through to the year-end, they will probably be held responsible for the price increase likely to follow. U.S. President Donald Trump has already indicated he holds OPEC responsible for rising oil prices via a message on his Twitter account. If oil and fuel prices continue rising, the political pushback from consumer countries against OPEC will only intensify. But what should concern the organisation more is the very real risk that further price increases will prove counter-productive. By over-tightening the market in 2018/19, OPEC will be creating conditions for the next cyclical downturn in 2020/21. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-04-24,"SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s Raizen Combustiveis SA agreed to buy downstream assets in Argentina from Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSa.L) for $950 million (680.17 million pounds), according to a securities filing on Tuesday. Raízen Combustiveis, a joint venture between Brazil´s Cosan SA Indústria e Comércio (CSAN3.SA) and Shell, will have a 20 percent market share in fuel distribution in Argentina after acquiring a network of 645 gas stations in the country. Raízen also is acquiring a refinery in Buenos Aires, LPG and aviation fuel terminals and a lubricant plant, among others, which have an annual net revenue of $3.3 billion. Reuters first reported that Raízen would buy the business last August. The deal in Argentina is similar to the model Shell operates in downstream assets in Brazil. The network of 6,200 gas stations that uses the Shell brand is owned by its joint venture with Cosan. During the sale process, Raízen´s bid topped rival offers by Argentine oil company YPF SA, Chile’s Quinenco SA and China National Petroleum Corp’s Petrochina Co. The businesses acquired by Raízen will continue their relationships with Shell through various commercial agreements, representing an estimated value of $300 million, Shell said. The Anglo-Dutch company said it will keep its upstream interests in the Vaca Muerta shale formation, which was not included in the Raízen deal, as it “sees substantial long-term growth potential in Argentina’s shale resources.” The sale is part of Shell’s strategy to simplify its portfolio through a $30 billion divestment programme by 2018, and follows a strategic review of the downstream business in Argentina that began in August 2016.

2018-04-24,"LONDON, April 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain’s plan to leave the European Union will not affect its commitment to curb carbon emissions and combat climate change, a senior British government official said on Tuesday. The country’s 2016 decision to leave the EU bloc has raised fears that it will fail to deliver on its legally binding target to cut emissions by 80 percent on 1990 levels by 2050. But existing national legislation will dictate Britain’s climate ambition and “that will not change with Brexit”, said Nick Bridge, special representative for climate change at Britain’s foreign office. “Climate change is the greatest diplomatic challenge ever,” he told an audience of policymakers, businesses and charities at an event on climate change diplomacy at Imperial College London. “We’re at the point where extreme events like storms destroy entire economies and regions.” Britain and other countries have a “moral duty” to act on climate change, Bridge said, adding that it would require more investment in renewable energy like wind and solar as well as efforts to put a price on pollution. Pedro Tie, head of environment and climate change at the Brazilian embassy in London, said climate change was not just an environmental issue, but an economic and social one too. “Developing countries in particular face the challenge of decoupling their economic growth from an increase in carbon emissions,” he told the event. Brazil is doing this by boosting its use of biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel which pollute less than fossil fuels, he said. Bridge said the British government plans to use its diplomatic expertise to ramp up global action on climate change. “We’re ready to offer every advice and encouragement to see the United States back into the Paris Agreement,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump last year said he would pull his country out of the 2015 Paris Agreement, arguing that staying in would cost the United States trillions of dollars in lost jobs and damage to its industries. However, Trump left the door open to renegotiating the pact. The pact set a goal of keeping the rise in average global temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, and ideally to 1.5 degrees. The world has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius. (Reporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2018-04-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate General Electric (GE.N) will test the world’s  largest wind turbine in a facility in northeast England, it said on Tuesday. GE Renewable Energy, the renewable arm of the U.S. firm, and the British government-funded Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult signed a five-year agreement to test GE’s Haliade-X 12 megawatt (MW) turbine in Blyth, Northumberland. “This is an important agreement because it will enable us to prove Haliade-X in a faster way by putting it under controlled and extreme conditions,” John Lavelle, president & CEO of GE’s Offshore Wind business said in a statement. Britain is aiming to be a leader in offshore wind technology and its capacity could grow by five times current levels to 30 gigawatts by 2030, according to a report funded by a range of industry participants. Britain’s energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry welcomed the agreement and said it highlights Britain’s world class research and testing facilities. The largest wind turbines currently in operation are MHI Vestas’ 9 MW turbines installed at Vattenfall’s windfarm off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland. Companies have been building larger turbines to help get more power from each turbine installed and drive down the cost of the electricity they produce. The agreement also includes a 6 million pound combined investment from Britain’s Innovate UK and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to install the world’s largest and most powerful grid emulation system at the Catapult’s Blyth centre.

2018-04-24,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China gasoline exports vs Singapore gasoline profit margin: reut.rs/2KaruiW By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 24 (Reuters) - China’s surging imports of crude oil this year are the major driver of higher prices on the demand side, but the flip side to this is soaring Chinese fuel exports that are hurting profit margins at regional refiners. The world’s largest crude importer took in 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter, up 7 percent from the same period in 2017, according to customs data. Exports of refined products, however, have jumped by even larger margins, with shipments of gasoline and diesel reaching record highs in March, according to the data released on Monday. Gasoline exports were 1.7 million tonnes in March, or about double what they were in the same month last year. In the first quarter, China shipped 3.6 million tonnes of gasoline, or about 312,000 bpd, and some 43 percent above the 216,000 bpd exported in the same period of 2017. Diesel exports were 2.4 million tonnes in March, equivalent to about 580,000 bpd, with shipments around 392,000 bpd in the first quarter, a gain of some 12 percent on the year-ago period. Taking all oil products together shows that China’s exports in the first quarter were 1.27 million bpd, up almost 20 percent on 1.06 million bpd shipped in the same period last year. Looking at crude import numbers along with the product exports shows that of the additional 600,000 bpd of crude oil imported in the first quarter, about 210,000 bpd was exported as additional refined fuels. It appears that this rising supply of oil products from China has weighed somewhat on regional prices, especially in gasoline, which has witnessed the biggest increase in exports from China. The profit margin, or crack, on producing a barrel of 92-RON gasoline from Brent crude in Singapore GL92-SIN-CRK, the regional benchmark, slumped to the lowest in 20 months on April 19, hitting $5.42 a barrel. It has since recovered somewhat to $6.50 a barrel as of Monday, but it’s still almost 60 percent below the recent peak of $16.34, reached in August last year. Diesel has fared better, with the profit margin in Singapore for a barrel of gasoil, the term for diesel before retail additives are added, ending at $14.80 on Monday. This is slightly higher than the $14.27 a barrel at the end of last year, and also up from the low so far this year of $13.17, reached in early March. The difference between the gasoline and diesel markets this year is that the region has had to absorb a sharp increase in Chinese gasoline exports, but not so much of diesel. And now, product prices are still high enough to prompt Chinese refiners to export refined fuels. The ability of China’s refiners to export fuels has been aided by the higher crude import quotas granted this year to smaller, independent refiners, by the authorities in Beijing. There may be some temporary relief for the region’s other exporters of refined fuels, such as Singapore, South Korea, Japan and India, as some Chinese plants enter scheduled maintenance. This should lower the processing rate at Chinese refineries, which hit a record 12.13 million bpd in March, above the previous high of 12.03 million bpd in November 2017. What is becoming increasingly clear, though, is that China is emerging as a major player in the markets for refined fuels in Asia, especially since the authorities seem ready to allow refiners to import more crude and export surplus products.

U.S. stock futures pointed to a firm open on Wall Street , although European shares were mixed with stock markets in London and Frankfurt around 0.3 percent higher and shares in Paris flat. Markets brushed off further signs that European powerhouse economy Germany is losing some of its momentum, with the Ifo business climate index falling in April. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei added 0.9 percent as a lower yen supported export-heavy firms and Chinese shares posted their strongest gains in two months . That left MSCI’s world equity index a tad higher after three days of declines. The recovery in stocks came as bond markets also bounced back from a selloff. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields came within striking distance of the psychologically significant barrier of 3 percent on Monday, which in the past has triggered market spasms. “There’s a tug and a pull from all kinds of things in equity markets right now, such as the approach of U.S. bond yields to 3 percent, but I don’t think that would be the end of the world,” said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco. Earnings meanwhile, especially from the tech sector, were in focus after a turbulent few months for leading U.S. tech firms. Google parent Alphabet was up slightly in volatile after-hours trading on Monday after the tech giant reported a 73 percent jump in profits in the first quarter. Chipmaker AMS reported first-quarter sales towards the lower end of its guidance range on Monday and warned of a downturn owing to weaker orders from one of its main customers. AMS did not name the customer, but the Austrian company is a big supplier to Apple, making components for the iPhone. SAP, Europe’s largest tech company by stock market valuation, meanwhile announced upbeat results in the seasonally tough first quarter. Of around 18 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 that have already reported, 78.2 percent beat consensus estimates. Brent crude oil prices, the global benchmark, rose above $75 a barrel to their highest level since November 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts, strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were 0.5 percent higher at $69.11 a barrel. A rally in oil prices and renewed focus on the inflation outlook has added to upward pressure on bond yields recently. “It is this move higher in crude oil prices, along with the rise in demand, that is helping fuel the recent rise in yields as well as the positive tone for equity markets,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London. “However if it continues too far we could start to see it act as a drag on equity markets, if prices along with yields start to move even higher.” The fallout from rising U.S. bond yields, which have helped lift U.S. financial stocks, continued to be felt in currency markets. The euro nursed losses at a two-month low on growing concerns that firmer Treasury yields would reduce incremental demand for the region’s bonds and stocks at a time when hedge funds have amassed record long bets on the single currency. It stabilised around $1.22 on Tuesday after having slumped to $1.2185 in Asia, its lowest since March 1. The dollar set a two-month high of 108.87 yen and was holding near those levels. Elsewhere, aluminium hit its lowest in nearly two weeks, extending declines from the previous day after Washington gave U.S. companies more time to comply with sanctions on Russian producer Rusal and hinted at further sanctions relief.

2018-04-24,"MINSK (Reuters) - Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko on Tuesday said the constitution could be “improved” to share some of his powers, but not in the near future. Lukashenko has run Belarus in authoritarian style since 1994, during which time he changed the constitution to expand his control and push opposition forces out of parliament. In an annual address to lawmakers that referenced the  overthrow of Armenia’s prime minister, Lukashenko said he was considering decentralising some of his authority. “The constitution will be improved. Life changes and we change,” he said. “Yes, I can easily hand over some powers to other branches of government.” He was speaking a day after Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan resigned after almost two weeks of street protests.  Lukashenko said he had asked the constitutional court to prepare recommendations on changes to the constitution, but cautioned that the plans were theoretical for now.  “Personally, I have not even thought about a referendum yet,” he said, referring to the public vote needed to bring any changes into force. Seeking to improve ties with the European Union and lessen Belarus’s dependence on Russia, Lukashenko has in recent years heeded calls from the West to show more leniency towards political opposition. He has pardoned several political prisoners, while the opposition is represented in parliament for the first time in 20 years following a 2016 election that Western observers said was not fully democratic but an improvement on previous votes. The opposition in Belarus is made up of about a dozen parties and groups that have struggled to popularize their cause in the face of government repression.  Nevertheless, in 2017 the biggest public protests in years prompted the authorities to suspend a new tax on those not in full-time employment - a rare about-face for Lukashenko. Citing Ukraine’s 2013/14 ‘Maidan’ uprising and the political upheaval in Armenia, Lukashenko said any constitutional changes would be carried out in accordance with the law to prevent public outcry and instability. “If someone thinks that we will take the constitution and create conditions for our own Maidans - that won’t happen,” he said. “I promised and will never break my vow, otherwise it will be like in Armenia.” Writing by Alessandra Prentice; editing by Matthias Williams",https://uk.reuters.com/article/belarus-lukashenko/belarus-leader-says-may-loosen-grip-on-power-but-not-yet-idUKL8N1S12GM,24 Apr 2018,"Belarussian President Alexander

2018-04-24,"ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Innogy (IGY.DE) said on Tuesday a proposed deal by parent RWE (RWEG.DE) and rival E.ON (EONGn.DE) to break up the German energy group lacked clarity, adding it would comment on the transaction once the offer period had officially started. Last month, RWE and E.ON announced the landmark deal to split up Innogy’s assets between them and turn RWE into a renewables champion, while E.ON will become Europe’s largest operator of power and gas grids. As part of the deal, E.ON will launch a 40 euros-per-share, or 5.2 billion euro (4.56 billion pounds), bid for Innogy’s minority shareholders, with the offer period expected to start at the end of April. That bid does not apply to Innogy parent RWE, which holds 76.8 percent of the group following an equity carve-out. “Most of the details, however, remain open,” Innogy Chief Executive Uwe Tigges told shareholders at the group’s annual general meeting, adding the group’s board would issue a reasoned opinion no later than two weeks after the offer period starts. Open questions in the transaction include uncertainty over where the brunt of the up to 5,000 jobs cuts that E.ON plans as part of the deal will occur, with Innogy demanding no forced layoffs at its operations. E.ON sees synergies of 600-800 million euros through the asset swap, that will see its renewable operations go to RWE, which will get a 16.7 percent stake in E.ON to become its largest shareholder. Under the deal, Innogy would effectively cease to exist once the deal has closed in the second half of 2019, only three years after it was split off from RWE and listed separately on the stock exchange. “The fact is that, as it stands today, Innogy is an economically independent and strong energy company,” Tigges said. “And that is how it will remain until such time as the transaction has been concluded.” Tigges was officially appointed as Innogy CEO on Tuesday, having filled in on an interim basis following the sudden departure of Peter Terium in December, just a week after a profit warning send the group’s shares tumbling.

2018-04-24,"* Market optimistic; LNG bubble never came - Total * Slow approvals for new projects may tighten supply - Trafigura By Jessica Jaganathan and Florence Tan SINGAPORE, April 24 (Reuters) - Last year’s strong demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), led by Asia’s major economies, is expected to continue this year and should absorb some of the new supply coming onstream, industry executives said at a conference on Tuesday. The global LNG industry has been expecting prices to be depressed by a rush of supply as projects to produce 40 million to 50 million tonnes per year of LNG are coming online, mainly in Australia and the United States, over the next two years. But, a surge in Asian demand last year took the market by surprise, with some producers now expecting the new supply to be easily absorbed by the increasing consumption across Asia. “For the past three years, we were told at every conference that we’ll have a gas bubble, that gas is oversupplied, that we won’t be able to sell LNG... but it’s a bubble that never came,” said Jean-Pierre Mateille, vice president of trading at Total’s gas and power division. Trade flow data on Thomson Reuters Eikon show global liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports have risen 40 percent since 2015, to almost 40 billion cubic metres (bcm) a month. Growth accelerated in 2017, with imports up by a fifth, largely because of rising demand in China, but also in South Korea and Japan. China, which overtook South Korea as the world’s second-largest LNG importer in 2017, will still import large volumes of LNG this year though at a slower pace, the executives said. China’s LNG imports soared after the government ordered millions of homes to switch to natural gas and electric heating from coal to counter rising air pollution. This switch will continue to boost LNG imports into the country this year, Total’s Mateille told the LNG Forum 2018 conference. Despite the new Australian and U.S. supply, demand will catch up in the long run, said Royal Dutch Shell Energy’s Executive Vice President Steve Hill. Trafigura’s head of LNG Hadi Hallouche said: “If we move away from the next one, two, three years, the industry is growing at 20 to 30 million tonnes every year but we’re not taking FIDs (final investment decisions) for that kind of volume.” “There seems to be a consensus that from two years onwards we have a (supply) crunch because we have under-invested in production,” he said.

2018-04-24,"CALVIA, Spain, April 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - P uerto Rico, battered by Hurricane Maria in September, is working “day and night” to restore public services, but a row with Washington over a fiscal turnaround plan for the bankrupt U.S. territory is draining energy from the recovery effort, said the Caribbean island’s secretary of state. Luis Rivera Marín, Puerto Rico’s second-highest official, said the territory’s government would not comply with some of the cost-cutting measures announced by the federal oversight board last week, which affect public policies such as pensions. “We are going to take care of our most vulnerable - our children, our elderly - and we will take the necessary measures so that through tourism and technology, we can return to economic growth (and) pay our debts,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the Smart Island World Congress in Mallorca. Last year, Puerto Rico filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, owing $71.5 billion of bonds and $50 billion in pension obligations. The oversight plan forecasts that Puerto Rico would be able to pay back $6.7 billion through 2023. Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rosselló said in a statement on Thursday the board “usurps the powers of the democratically elected government”. Rivera Marín, a former commercial lawyer, said Puerto Rico’s government agreed with about 80 percent of the plan, but would disregard the rest. “It distracts us; we need to put all of our energy in the rebuilding,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of the start of the hurricane season in June. “We are working day and night to make sure the last home on the island gets its power back, all schools are reopened, hospitals provide proper health services - that’s our focus.” Some 40,000 customers have been without power since Hurricane Maria took out the island’s electricity supply. Restoring electricity in Puerto Rico - which suffered its latest blackout last week when a transmission line failure cut power to almost all 3.4 million residents - has been a major challenge. Rivera Marín said the Puerto Rico government was working on ways to avoid the same thing happening in future storms. It has changed the law, for example, to allow individuals, businesses and cooperatives to set up micro-grids that can operate independently of the main power grid if needed. People can now store and use solar power they produce from panels installed at home, he said. Puerto Rico aims to source 25 percent of its energy from clean sources - mainly solar and wind - by 2025, up from 5 percent now, Rivera Marín said. It currently relies on imported diesel for 75 percent of its needs, which is costly and polluting. “We want to get rid of diesel altogether,” Rivera Marín said, noting the aim is to bring the cost per kilowatt hour of electricity down from $0.24 to less than $0.20 by 2020. “It would help hotels, the fiscal position, family budgets - everyone,” he said. Another measure to deal better with disasters is to improve data collection on everything from logistics to hospitals and generator sizes, in partnership with businesses and using blockchain and cloud storage, he added. Puerto Rico also wants to turn the destruction wrought by the hurricane into an opportunity to build better housing for its people, Rivera Marín said. More than 472,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm, many of them wooden shacks with tin roofs. Puerto Rico - where 40 percent live below the U.S. poverty line - has asked Washington for money to build “dignified housing” that can better withstand storms, Rivera Marín said. So far $20 billion in assistance has been granted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for long-term disaster recovery in Puerto Rico, including housing. The island’s economy relies heavily on manufacturing for the pharmaceuticals industry, which was disrupted by the hurricane. After the storm, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans left for the U.S. mainland, and some have yet to return. But that process of “relocation” had already spiked before the disaster, because of bad economic conditions, Rivera Marín said. “There has been a brain drain,” he said. The island’s government is “stopping the bleeding” through policies such as lower tax rates for doctors, he added. ""Now we are working on prosperity, on making Puerto Rico safe - making a place where your children can get a good education, where you can find a good job or build a small business for yourself,"" said Rivera Marín.

The Kremlin was speaking a day after Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan resigned after almost two weeks of mass street protests that plunged the ex-Soviet republic into political crisis. “For now we see that the situation is not unfolding in a destabilising way which is a cause for satisfaction,” Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. “We hope that order and stability will be maintained in the country and that the outlines of a consensus political configuration will appear in the near future.” When asked if the Kremlin regarded the events as a revolution, Peskov said he would not draw parallels with what happened in Ukraine in 2014 when big protests brought about a change in power that shifted the country away from Russia’s orbit towards the West.

2018-04-24,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil services group Saipem (SPMI.MI) is looking round for growth opportunities after a bid by rival Subsea 7 (SUBC.OL) for U.S. contractor McDermott (MDR.N) sent waves through the sector. “The bid is a sign of consolidation in the sector that needs to be monitored closely,” Saipem CEO Stefano Cao said on Tuesday in a conference call after first quarter results. Subsea 7 made an unsolicited offer worth about $2 billion for McDermott on Monday, a deal that could make the Oslo-listed contractor a market leader for subsea equipment. The move comes after Schlumberger (SLB.N) and Subsea 7 started talks earlier this year to form a joint venture to deliver subsea installations and services. Oil firms have returned to profit thanks to higher oil prices and cost cuts made in the downturn but their suppliers are still feeling the squeeze. Cao, who said there were some timid signals of recovery in the industry, added that consolidation of the sector usually came with an upturn. “There’s no reason why it shouldn’t happen in the future,” he said, adding parts of its business could be combined with other companies. “The onshore drilling business could be a candidate for integration with other operators in the sector,” Cao told analysts on a conference call.  Cao, a former top executive at Eni, was appointed CEO of Saipem for a second time earlier this year. The group is controlled by oil major Eni (ENI.MI) and state lender CDP. He has previously said the company is ready to reassess its cooperation agreement with Norway’s Aker Solutions (AKER.OL) to develop subsea oil and gas projects. Saipem, a leader in subsea engineering and construction, is looking to develop new lines of business to boost order books, including floating wind power farms. It is currently talking to France’s EDF (EDF.PA) in a bid to build two wind farms. Earlier on Tuesday Saipem reported a net loss of 2 million euros ($2.4 million) in the first three months, including 13 million euro reorganisation costs. It had a net profit of 47 million euros in the same period last year. Sales and operating profit guidance for the year were confirmed but net debt expectations were lifted to around 1.3 billion euros from a previous 1.1 billion euros due to the acquisition of a pipelaying vessel. “Whilst a higher net debt position is a negative, we believe this will be mitigated the market’s support for investing in assets as the cycle is evidently turning,” said Morgan Stanley in a note. At 0925 GMT Saipem shares were down 0.5 percent while the European oil and gas index .SXEP was up 0.7 percent.

2018-04-24,"SINGAPORE, April 24 (Reuters) - The port  of Rotterdam expects to see its first ship-to-ship (STS) liquefied natural gas (LNG) refuelling operation in June, marking an important milestone in the use of the cleaner burning fuel in shipping. The opening of STS marine refuelling, also known as bunkering, is significant because it makes the cleaner fuel more accessible to shippers, said Cees Boon, senior safety adviser at the Port of Rotterdam. “A lot milestones will follow,” said Boon in an email on Tuesday. In June, it is expected that short-haul sea vessels will be the first to undergo LNG bunkering through STS operations in the port of Rotterdam, followed by LNG-fuelled cruise ships in November and then larger deep-sea vessels by the end of 2019, said Boon. Short-haul LNG-fuelled shipping vessels have so far only been able to refuel with LNG in Rotterdam through truck-to-ship transfers while at dock. Rotterdam is Europe’s largest port and bunkering hub, and is actively promoting the use of LNG as a marine fuel. Rotterdam sold 1,500 tonnes of LNG bunker fuels in 2017, up from just 100 tonnes the year before, data on the port’s website showed. Shippers are looking to LNG to help them meet stricter emissions regulations in 2020 and beyond.

2018-04-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Anglo American (AAL.L) will resume output of iron ore from  Minas-Rio in Brazil only in the fourth quarter of 2018 after  pipeline leaks, denting annual group earnings (EBITDA) by $300-400 million. The news pushed share prices 1.2 percent lower by 0850 GMT, as analysts said the problem was more disruptive than previously thought, although overall group production was broadly in line with expectations. As a whole, the company reported a 4 percent increase in total production on a copper equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the same period of 2017, citing improved efficiency. But Minas-Rio in southeast Brazil, Anglo American’s biggest development project, has suffered repeated delays and is on hold pending an investigation into leaks in the more than 500-km pipeline that helps to deliver its iron ore to export markets.     Anglo said it expected a pick up in the last quarter and 2018 output would be an estimated 3 million tonnes - the amount produced so far this year. That represents a 30 percent fall in production compared with 2017.   Every section of the pipeline will be checked and tested and operations will resume when Brazil’s regulatory authorities have given consent. In a statement, CEO Mark Cutifani also said Anglo was working with unions to agree “the appropriate terms for the approximately 35 percent of our employees at Minas-Rio who will be on an extended period of leave”. The total workforce is around 2,500. Anglo American shares had risen nearly 15 percent this year, outstripping its peers, despite the issues at Minas-Rio. It was one of the companies hardest hit by the commodities price crash of 2015-16, but has since sold some assets and improved productivity, while drawing strength from a more positive political mood in South Africa, its core territory. Anglo American’s overall 4 percent output increase derived from a 15 percent rise in diamond production as it expanded production at its new Gahcho Kue mine in Canada, while copper production rose 9 percent. Platinum and palladium rose by respectively 7 percent and 9 percent and its Kumba iron ore operations in South Africa increased output by 4 percent. Coking coal rose 6 percent.     Minas-Rio accounts for less than 5 percent of overall earnings as it is still in ramp-up phase. The group reported annual underlying EBITDA of $8.8 billion, a 45 percent increase year-on-year in February. Analysts said the shut-in did not fundamentally change their view on Anglo. Morgan Stanley analysts, which rate the stock “overweight”, said in a note there was time to make up the small impact on full-year revenue over the rest of the year. There was “no change to the investment case” in the company, it added.

European stocks opened broadly higher with blue-chip stock markets in London and Frankfurt 0.3 percent higher, while shares in Paris were flat. Markets brushed off further signs that Europe’s biggest economy Germany is losing some of its momentum, with the Ifo business climate index falling in April. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei added 0.9 percent as a lower yen supported export-heavy firms and Chinese shares posted their strongest gains in two months . That left MSCI’s world equity index marginally higher on the day after three days of declines. The recovery in stocks came as bond markets also bounced back from a selloff. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields came within striking distance of the key psychological barrier of 3 percent on Monday, a level in the past that has triggered market spasms. “The U.S. yield spike story has been a theme for the last 24 hours but we don’t expect a sharp surge as the U.S. continues to be in a late economic cycle,” said Christin Tuxen, a currency strategist at Danske Bank. Earnings meanwhile, especially from the tech sector, were in focus after a turbulent few months for leading U.S. tech firms. Google parent Alphabet was up slightly in volatile after-hours trading on Monday after the tech giant reported a 73 percent jump in profits in the first quarter. Chipmaker AMS reported first-quarter sales towards the lower end of its guidance range on Monday and warned of a downturn owing to weaker orders from one of its main customers. AMS did not name the customer, but the Austrian company is a big supplier to Apple, making components for the iPhone. SAP, Europe’s largest tech company by stock market valuation, announced upbeat results in the seasonally tough first quarter. Of around 18 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 that have already reported, 78.2 percent beat consensus estimates. Brent crude oil rose for a sixth day to hit its highest since November 2014 at over $75 a barrel, buoyed by expectations that supplies will tighten just as demand reaches record levels. Brent’s six-day rising streak is the longest such string of gains since December, with prices up more than 20 percent from 2018 depths plumbed in February. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $69.15 a barrel, up 0.7 percent. On Thursday, WTI rose to its strongest since Nov. 28, 2014 at $69.56. A rally in oil and crude prices and renewed focus on the inflation outlook has added to upward pressure on bond yields recently. “It is this move higher in crude oil prices, along with the rise in demand, that is helping fuel the recent rise in yields as well as the positive tone for equity markets,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London. “However if it continues too far we could start to see it act as a drag on equity markets, if prices along with yields start to move even higher.” The fallout from rising U.S. bond yields, which have helped lift U.S. financial stocks, was also felt in currency markets. The euro fell to a two-month low as concerns that rising U.S. Treasury yields would push the currency to break below a range it has been stuck within most of this year, prompting hedge funds to unwind some of their record long bets. It stabilised around $1.22, having plumbed to a low of $1.2185 in Asia, its lowest since March 1. The dollar set a two-month high of 108.87 yen and was holding near those levels. In commodities, aluminium extended losses after tumbling 7 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day drop in eight years.

2018-04-24,"TOKYO, April 24 (Reuters) - Japan’s top oil refiner JXTG Holdings on Tuesday said that Tsutomu Sugimori, head of its downstream refining unit, would become the company’s next president. Current JXTG Holdings President Yukio Uchida is to become chairman, the company said in a statement, with the changes taking effect following an annual shareholders meeting in late June. Faced with a continued decline in domestic oil demand, one of the company’s top challenges is to balance its 1.93 million barrels per day worth of refining capacity with demand. Sugimori, 62, said following a media briefing that there had been some progress in compiling plans for consolidating the company’s domestic refineries and other plants, but added that the steps would likely be announced one by one. He added that it was possible such announcements could come this year. Downstream refining unit JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp recently struck a deal with Vietnam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) to work on a feasibility study to co-operate JXTG’s 120,000-bpd Marifu refinery. Sugimori said Petrolimex wants its own refinery because of a lack of supply capacity in Vietnam where demand is growing rapidly. The study into exporting oil products from Marifu came after Petrolimex and JXTG concluded that for now it would be difficult to build a new refinery in Vietnam, he said. “If the Marifu refinery became a 50-50 venture, half of the refinery would belong to Petrolimex with half of volumes exported and that would help us to reduce our supply capacity as well,” he told reporters. Asked whether if it makes economic sense for Vietnam to import oil products from Japan, he said that there is a tariff barrier, which would need to be taken into account.

2018-04-24,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean steelmaker POSCO (005490.KS) on Tuesday said its operating profit for the first quarter of 2018 rose 9 percent from a year ago on firm steel demand and favourable market conditions, beating analyst estimates. The world’s fifth-biggest steelmaker said in a statement that it expected steel demand to keep growing thanks to “sustained restructuring in China’s steel industry and expectations of recovery in emerging market growth”. POSCO posted a consolidated operating profit of 1.49 trillion won (993.4 million pounds) for the January-to-March period, compared with 1.37 trillion won a year earlier and an average estimate of 1.37 trillion won from 16 analysts polled by Reuters.      Its first quarter revenue was up 5 percent at 15.9 trillion won, while its net profit climbed 10.9 percent to 1.1 trillion won.  The steelmaker also raised its 2018 consolidated sales target to 63 trillion won from 61.9 trillion won.  In the first quarter of this year, China’s economy grew 6.8 percent on the back of robust consumer demand and property investment.  Although U.S. steel tariffs could pose a risk to Asian producers, South Korean steelmakers were exempted from hefty steel tariffs in March in exchange for capping the country’s steel exports to the United States by 30 percent of the past three years’ average.  The company expected iron ore prices to be between $65 and $70 per tonne in the second quarter following the U.S. import tariffs, down from $74 a tonne in the first quarter.  Coking coal prices are expected to be between $180 and $190 per tonne in the second quarter, down from 229 per tonne in the previous quarter, it said.

2018-04-24,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Shell and Inpex are on the final stretch of a years-long race to export gas from offshore northern Australia, where both have spent billions of dollars building the world’s biggest maritime vessels to grab a slice of Asia’s booming LNG market. Anglo-Dutch energy major Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Inpex, Japan’s biggest oil and gas producer, are vying for first gas from two overlapping fields after delays and cost overruns that have plagued both projects. The pair have spent billions on offshore facilities, including Shell’s 490 metre (1,600 ft) long Prelude floating liquefied natural gas unit and Inpex’s Ichthys Explorer semi-submersible platform, both the world’s largest of their class. Inpex also has the 340 metre-long Ichthys Explorer, a floating LNG production and storage unit, built in South Korea, in parallel with Shell’s Prelude. “Prelude and Ichthys are both record breaking mega-projects that have been competing throughout their development,” said Saul Kavonic or energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Both arrived on site last year and are about to receive what’s known as a “cooling cargo” of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which indicates a plant is getting closer to starting output. The delivery is used to chill the facilities ahead of regular production of LNG, which is shipped at a temperature of minus 160 degrees Celsius. The race means more than just pride as the Prelude and Ichthys fields straddle the same gas in the Browse Basin, according to WoodMac. “Their reservoirs are connected, meaning whichever project starts producing first will draw some gas away from the other project,” Kavonic said. Ship tracking data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows the ‘Gallina’ LNG tanker arrived at Prelude in mid-April in order to deliver a cooling cargo, while the ‘Pacific Breeze’ is due to arrive at the Ichthys field from Malaysia this week. Both projects are still preparing for export, but Shell is grappling with the challenges of commissioning a brand new technology. “We currently assume first cargo from Ichthys in Q3 and from Prelude in Q4, with risk of further delays,” said Kavonic. A Shell spokeswoman reiterated that the oil major expects to get cash flow from Prelude in 2018. Inpex has said it expects a start-up at Ichthys, initially due in 2016, in April or May. “There is no change to the schedule that we announced in March,” Inpex spokesman Carlo Niederberger told Reuters. Although both projects feed from the Browse Basin, Inpex said it was not yet certain whether there would be direct competition for gas between the two fields. (MAP: Ichthys and Prelude gas fields off northwest Australia, reut.rs/2hXfXsW) Prelude - which will produce, process and export LNG - came at a cost of more than $13 billion, several years late and billions of dollars over initial estimates. Prelude is expected to have an annual LNG production capacity of 3.6 million tonnes, making it the smallest but most challenging Australian LNG project in recent years. Ichthys will send gas onshore to Darwin through an 890-km (550 mile) pipeline, where it will be processed into LNG for export. Once completed, the $40 billion project will have an annual LNG capacity estimated at nearly 9 million tonnes. Both Prelude and Ichthys will also produce condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil, as well as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Exports from new LNG projects including Ichthys and Prelude are expected to help Australia overtake Qatar to become the world’s largest LNG exporter by the end of the decade.

2018-04-24,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China kept fuel exports to North Korea to a trickle in March and exported no corn for a third straight month to its isolated neighbor, data showed on Tuesday, as sanctions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and missile program continued to bite.      Official data from the General Administration of Customs showed a sixth straight month of no shipments of diesel, gasoline and fuel oil. China has traditionally been the main source of North Korea’s fuel. The only oil products sent to North Korea was 3 tonnes of jet fuel and 55 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It was also the sixth month that China imported no iron ore, coal or lead from North Korea, in line with United Nations sanctions aimed at persuading Pyongyang to abandon its weapons program. It was the third month in a row that there were no corn exports from China to North Korea. Shipments of rice were just 457 tonnes. The export breakdown follows data on Monday that showed the value of China’s trade with North Korea was $155.3 million in March, down from $442 million last year and up from February’s $112 million. China remains North Korea’s largest trading partner and sole major ally, though overall trade has fallen in recent months as the UN stepped up sanctions, banning imports of some major commodities and seafood in September and capping annual oil product shipments in December.

Spreadbetters pointed to a firm opening in Europe with FTSE futures up 0.2 percent. Wall Street is also seen higher, with E-Minis for the S&P 500 gaining 0.3 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tacked on 0.1 percent following two straight days of declines that took it to its lowest since April 9. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.9 percent as a lower yen supported export-heavy firms. Chinese shares climbed 1.9 percent , while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 1 percent. U.S. bond prices rebounded too, capping four days of losses that sent 10-year Treasury yields closer to the key psychological barrier of 3 percent - a level not seen since early 2014. The U.S. dollar, which has risen in the past five sessions against a basket of major currencies, also took a breather to camp near a four-month peak. “Investors are now watching closely to see if we are in the eye of the recent storm of volatility or if we do have calm seas ahead leading to stronger global growth,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia. “Only time will tell but certainly the market is keeping a close eye on the news wires and screens for anything that may lead to a return to volatility and downside risk.” The bond market is bracing for combined sales of $96 billion in coupon-bearing Treasuries this week on greater government borrowing following a massive tax overhaul last year and a two-year budget agreement reached in February. Inflation worries are also mounting as oil and commodity prices have been rising in recent weeks. A market gauge of investors’ inflation expectations such as the 5-year forward inflation swap and 10-year breakeven yield have hit their highest levels in many months. These factors have stoked concerns that U.S. inflation, long subdued since the financial crisis a decade ago, could gain momentum as President Donald Trump’s tax cuts this year could stimulate an economy already near or at full employment. In such a scenario the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise rates more than three times this year in a further blow to equities. Analysts expect earnings growth at S&P 500 companies of nearly 20 percent in the first quarter, the strongest showing in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of around 18 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 that have already reported, 78.2 percent beat consensus estimates. In currencies, the dollar was a shade firmer at 108.81 yen after jumping almost 1 percent on Monday to its highest in ten weeks. The greenback also strengthened against emerging market currencies, hitting three-month highs against the South African rand and a 1-1/2-year top against the Brazilian real . But market players were not convinced the rally is here to stay. “We’re sceptical the USD has embarked on a strong and sustainable uptrend,” said Ray Attrill, Sydney-based head of fx strategy at National Australia Bank. “While momentum can extend USD gains we still maintain that secular forces acting against the dollar – namely the burgeoning ‘twin deficits’ - will stymie a significant USD recovery.” The euro held at $1.2213 after hitting its lowest since March 1 when Trump unveiled tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. In commodities, aluminium extended losses after tumbling 7 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day drop in eight years. Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange last stood at $2,243 per tonne after the United States extended the deadline for sanctions on Russian aluminium producer Rusal . The metal had rallied to its highest since mid-2011 last week at $2,718 a tonne on fears of a global shortage as a result of the U.S. sanctions. Oil prices held near 3-1/2-year peaks supported by production cuts by oil producing countries and wariness about geopolitical risks in the face of Washington’s threat to scupper a nuclear deal with Iran.

2018-04-24,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China gasoline exports vs Singapore gasoline profit margin: reut.rs/2KaruiW By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 24 (Reuters) - China’s surging imports of crude oil this year are the major driver of higher prices on the demand side, but the flip side to this is soaring Chinese fuel exports that are hurting profit margins at regional refiners. The world’s largest crude importer took in 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter, up 7 percent from the same period in 2017, according to customs data. Exports of refined products, however, have jumped by even larger margins, with shipments of gasoline and diesel reaching record highs in March, according to the data released on Monday. Gasoline exports were 1.7 million tonnes in March, or about double what they were in the same month last year. In the first quarter, China shipped 3.6 million tonnes of gasoline, or about 312,000 bpd, and some 43 percent above the 216,000 bpd exported in the same period of 2017. Diesel exports were 2.4 million tonnes in March, equivalent to about 580,000 bpd, with shipments around 392,000 bpd in the first quarter, a gain of some 12 percent on the year-ago period. Taking all oil products together shows that China’s exports in the first quarter were 1.27 million bpd, up almost 20 percent on 1.06 million bpd shipped in the same period last year. Looking at crude import numbers along with the product exports shows that of the additional 600,000 bpd of crude oil imported in the first quarter, about 210,000 bpd was exported as additional refined fuels. It appears that this rising supply of oil products from China has weighed somewhat on regional prices, especially in gasoline, which has witnessed the biggest increase in exports from China. The profit margin, or crack, on producing a barrel of 92-RON gasoline from Brent crude in Singapore GL92-SIN-CRK, the regional benchmark, slumped to the lowest in 20 months on April 19, hitting $5.42 a barrel. It has since recovered somewhat to $6.50 a barrel as of Monday, but it’s still almost 60 percent below the recent peak of $16.34, reached in August last year. Diesel has fared better, with the profit margin in Singapore for a barrel of gasoil, the term for diesel before retail additives are added, ending at $14.80 on Monday. This is slightly higher than the $14.27 a barrel at the end of last year, and also up from the low so far this year of $13.17, reached in early March. The difference between the gasoline and diesel markets this year is that the region has had to absorb a sharp increase in Chinese gasoline exports, but not so much of diesel. And now, product prices are still high enough to prompt Chinese refiners to export refined fuels. The ability of China’s refiners to export fuels has been aided by the higher crude import quotas granted this year to smaller, independent refiners, by the authorities in Beijing. There may be some temporary relief for the region’s other exporters of refined fuels, such as Singapore, South Korea, Japan and India, as some Chinese plants enter scheduled maintenance. This should lower the processing rate at Chinese refineries, which hit a record 12.13 million bpd in March, above the previous high of 12.03 million bpd in November 2017. What is becoming increasingly clear, though, is that China is emerging as a major player in the markets for refined fuels in Asia, especially since the authorities seem ready to allow refiners to import more crude and export surplus products.

2018-04-24,"* Beijing, Chinese cos to “control” increasing gas demand -Unipec * Unipec can source for LNG from Qatar, Australia, US By Florence Tan and Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, April 24 (Reuters) - China is unlikely to see a repeat surge in liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports this coming winter as the world’s largest energy consumer has learned from the previous cold season to keep demand under control, the head of Unipec said on Tuesday. “Last year was a special year,” Chen Bo, president of Unipec, the trading arm of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, told delegates at the LNG Forum in Singapore, referring to government policies that caused China’s LNG imports and prices in Asia to soar last winter. China overtook South Korea as the world’s second-largest LNG importer in 2017 with imports of 38 million tonnes, 46 percent higher than a year ago. The imports soared after the government ordered millions of homes to switch to natural gas and electric heating from coal to counter rising air pollution. “We didn’t have the experience before to deal with such a situation,” Chen said. This year, “demand will increase but the government and companies will control,” he added. The surge in gas demand caused by the government switching policy created a shortfall in supply that caused interruptions in shipments to industrial customers as gas was diverted to residential users. Chinese companies have announced plans to secure more gas ahead of next winter. Sinopec said in early April that it will increase its natural gas supplies significantly in the next six years and also plans to more than double its liquefied natural gas receiving capacity in the next six years to 26 million tonnes on an annual basis. PetroChina is filling up underground gas storage in southwest China with supplies from central Asia and Myanmar. China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) has also issued a tender seeking liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes for delivery for up to 2022. Chen said he sees sufficient LNG supplies in the market and Unipec has the flexibility to source supply from various countries. “For example, we can get supplies from the Qatar expansion, increase supplies from Australia, plus there is fantastic supplies from America,” he said. Sinopec operates three LNG receiving terminals in Qingdao, Beihai and Tianjin, each with a import capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum. The recently opened Tianjin facility received its first commercial cargo in February from Australia. Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan and Florence Tan; Editing by

2018-04-24,"GWADAR, Pakistan, April 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For over a decade, Pakistani officials have dreamed of transforming the small but strategically located fishing port of Gwadar into a duty-free port and free economic zone – Pakistan’s answer to Dubai. The aim is for Gwadar – located on the Arabian Sea near Iran and the mouth of the Persian Gulf – to become a regional commercial, industrial and shipping hub, as part of the ambitious China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. The corridor is designed to give China a shorter, more secure trading route, via Pakistan, to the Middle East and beyond, while also boosting Pakistan’s economy. Right now, however, the dusty “next Dubai” on Pakistan’s coast resembles the original mainly in one respect – it doesn’t have much water. “It hasn’t rained here for the last three years,” explains a local journalist, Sajid Baloch. Abdul Rahim, who works for the Gwadar Development Authority, under the provincial government of Balochistan, said climate change is playing a role in Gwadar’s thirst. “I would say because of climate change the rains have stopped – it used to rain much more often and in every season. Now Gwadar is facing severe water issues. There is no fresh water here,” Rahim said. Nearby Akra Kaur reservoir dried up two years ago, and water must now be brought from a more distant source, he said. Some of the water coming in is contaminated, leading to an increase in waterborne illnesses such as hepatitis, he added. Tapping groundwater isn’t a solution. “There is no point in digging wells as the underground water is all brackish,” Rahim said. Right now, the Gwadar peninsula – a hammerhead-shaped projection of land into the Arabian Sea – is home to about 100,000 people, following completion of the first phase of the port development. But as development continues, the area’s population is expected to grow to 500,000 by 2020, according to the port authority’s website. On one side of the peninsula is the deep-sea port, built by the Chinese state-owned China Overseas Holding Company. On the other side lies the local harbour. Fishing was Gwadar’s main economic activity before the port started operations, and some local people say they so far see little benefit in the government’s grand plans. “We are dying from thirst, there are no doctors in our hospitals, the electricity comes and goes and there is garbage everywhere as no one collects it,” complained Rasool Bux, a fisherman who lives near the harbour. “First fix all these problems. Then develop this dream of Dubai,” he urged. Bux said most in the town get their water from tankers that make the two-hour drive from Mirani Dam. But the tankers only come once or twice a month to his area, Bux said, and shortages are common. Muhammad Ali Kakar, the province’s planning and development secretary, told a government committee in December that the total demand for water in Gwadar city was 6.5 million gallons a day, but tankers supplied only 2 million gallons. To help solve the water shortages two desalination plants have been built in the port, with Chinese expertise. The smaller can provide 200,000 gallons of potable water per day to the port, while the larger one, recently completed in the adjacent duty-free zone, can supply double that amount. Both plants rely on power from generators, as there is not enough grid power in Gwadar to run them, said Sajjd H. Baloch, the director general of Gwadar Development Authority. Some fishermen say they now buy clean drinking water from the port, paying up to 50 Pakistani rupees (around $0.40) for a three-litre can. Gul Mohammed, the operations director for the port authority, said his agency was willing to supply clean water outside the port and duty-free zone, but would need to be paid to produce it. “We are willing to provide water from the larger plant to the city of Gwadar at the rate of 0.98 rupees per gallon, but the Government of Balochistan has to sign an agreement with us,” he said. The provincial government is reluctant to accept the offer, hoping for rains this year to fill the Akra Kaur dam, Rahim said. The Pakistani army, tasked with protecting the CPEC project, meanwhile, also has laid the foundation for a large desalination plant to be built with help from the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland. The plant, to be completed by July, will provide 4.4 million gallons of water a day, free of cost, to the inhabitants of Gwadar city, according to an army press release. Providing better services, including clean drinking water, is seen as a way of helping win local support for the development push – and to help quell an ongoing insurgency by Baloch separatists in the province. As part of the winning-hearts effort, the army also has brought in specialist doctors to supplement those already working at the local government-run hospital. A new road will soon connect the port to the Makran Coastal Highway, which links Gwadar to Karachi. Gwadar’s new airport will be Pakistan’s largest when it is complete. The China Power Company also plans to open a 300 megawatt coal-fired power plant around 20km (12 miles) from the port to provide electricity to Gwadar. Meanwhile, tourism has started too, and the port is increasingly bustling with visitors. “Certainly the security in Gwadar has improved considerably in the last two years. I would say that, given all the recent development, the dream of Dubai will be realised in a decade or so,” said Munir Ahmed, a port security officer.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, climbed as high as $75.20 in early trading on Tuesday, levels not seen since November, 2014. Brent was still at $74.89 a barrel at 0109 GMT, up 18 cents, or 0.2 percent from its last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $68.84 a barrel, up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent from their last settlement. Markets have been lifted by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) which were introduced in 2017 with the aim of propping up the market, as well as by the potential of renewed U.S. sanctions against Tehran. The United States has until May 12 to decide whether it will leave the Iran nuclear deal and instead renew sanctions against the OPEC member, which would further tighten global supplies. “Crude prices are now sitting at the highest levels in three years, reflecting ongoing concerns around geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which is the source of nearly half of the world’s oil supply,” ANZ bank said on Tuesday. OPEC’s efforts to tighten markets are being led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, where state-controlled oil firm Saudi Aramco is pushing for higher prices ahead of a partial listing planned for later this year or 2019. “Oil strength is coming from Saudi Arabia’s recent commitment to get oil back up to between $70 to $80 per barrel as well as inventory levels that are back in the normal range,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. The OPEC supply management and threat of new sanctions come just as demand in Asia, the world’s biggest oil consuming region, hits a fresh record as new and expanded refineries start up from China to Vietnam.

The bond market is bracing for combined sales of $96 billion in coupon-bearing Treasuries this week as the Treasury has ramped up its borrowing following last year’s massive tax overhaul and a two-year budget agreement reached in February. Inflation worries are also mounting as oil and commodity prices have been rising in recent weeks.

U.S. stocks were little changed on Monday as bond yield worries offset optimism on corporate earnings. Analysts expect earnings growth at S&P 500 companies of nearly 20 percent in the first quarter, the strongest showing in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Already of around 18 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 that have reported, 78.2 percent beat consensus estimates. Google parent Alphabet Inc fell 0.4 percent in volatile after-hours trading on Monday after it reported stronger-than-expected earrings. Higher U.S. bond yields boosted the dollar. The euro fell to $1.2198, its lowest level since March 1, when Trump unveiled his steel and aluminium tariffs. The common currency last stood at $1.2208. The dollar jumped to 108.755 yen, rising almost 1.0 percent on the previous day to hit its highest level in ten weeks. The greenback also strengthened against emerging market currencies, hitting three-month high against the South African rand and 1-1/2-year highs against the Brazilian real . In commodities, aluminium fell 7 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day drop in eight years, after the United States extended the deadline for sanctions on Russian aluminium producer Rusal. Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange last stood at $2,295 per tonne. The metal had rallied to its highest since mid-2011 last week at $2,718 a tonne on fears of a global shortage as a result of the U.S. sanctions. Oil prices held near 3-1/2-year highs supported by production cuts by oil producing countries and wariness about geopolitical risks in the face Washington’s threat to scupper the nuclear deal with Iran. “Despite the rise in oil prices in recent weeks, the U.S. rig counts has not increased that much. Recent data shows oil inventories have been falling so I expect oil prices to rise further unless we see a sharp increase in U.S. oil drilling rigs,” said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $68.98 per barrel, near last week’s high of $69.56 while Brent crude futures stood at $75.06 after having hit 3-1/2-year highs of $75.20.
