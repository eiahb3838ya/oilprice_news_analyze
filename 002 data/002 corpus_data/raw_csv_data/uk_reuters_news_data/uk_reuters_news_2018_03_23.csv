2018-03-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The threat of a trade war sent world stock markets broadly lower in choppy trading on Friday and boosted safer assets like the yen and government bonds, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect. After another bruising week, a key gauge of world equity markets was broadly headed for its first quarterly loss since early 2016 as a spike in volatility, rising inflation and the spectre of a trade war spooked investors who had enjoyed a multi-year bull run. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.8 percent. The index lost 3.4 percent this week for its worst week since early February when a spike in volatility had sent markets into a tailspin. “The equity markets are getting clobbered, which is not that surprising with fears of a trade war breaking out,” said Paul Fage, a TD Securities emerging markets strategist.  The losses accelerated near the close of U.S. trading.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 424.69 points, or 1.77 percent, to 23,533.20, the S&P 500 lost 55.43 points, or 2.10 percent, to 2,588.26 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 174.01 points, or 2.43 percent, to 6,992.67. The declines sent the Dow and the S&P 500 down more than 4 percent and more than 2.75 percent, respectively, for the year to date.  “There’s a whole lot less predictability in the news flow after this week, and I don’t think that gave investors a lot of confidence going into the weekend ‘long’ (stocks),” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York.     European stocks fell broadly, with the Euro Stoxx index dropping 0.9 percent. That followed large declines in Asia, where the Nikkei .N225 tumbled 4.5 percent and the Hang Seng .HSI index lost 2.5 percent.  China urged the United States to “pull back from the brink,” but investors fear Trump’s tariffs are leading the world’s two largest economies into a trade war with potentially dire consequences for the global economy. China disclosed its own plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation against U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium products. Amid the uncertain global economic climate, investors seeking safer assets jumped into government bonds in Europe and the United States.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.8117 percent, from 2.832 percent late on Thursday. In Europe, benchmark issuer Germany’s 10-year bond yields hovered close to 10-week lows struck a day earlier at around 0.52 percent. While German bond yields recovered in European trading, they suffered their biggest two-week drop since November. Many investors also turned to the Japanese yen, a currency likely to benefit from a full-fledged trade war.  The currency gained as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar to 104.635 yen, the first time it has been below 105 since November 2016. Investors later booked profits to leave the yen up 0.1 percent at 105.19 yen per dollar. The Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty, rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar, although it fell against the euro. The dollar index, tracking it against other major currencies, fell 0.4 percent.  U.S. crude rose 2.6 percent to $65.97 per barrel and Brent was last at $70.55, up 2.4 percent.

2018-03-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices rose on Friday, hitting their highest since late January after the Saudi energy minister said OPEC and allied producers would need to keep coordinating supply cuts into 2019, and as concerns grew over the future of Iranian crude exports. Brent crude futures jumped $1.54, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $70.45 a barrel. For the week, Brent was up about 6.4 percent, its strongest weekly rise since July. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures also had their biggest weekly gain since July, at 5.5 percent. WTI  settled at $65.88 a barrel, up $1.58, or 2.5 percent. U.S. hedge funds and other money managers raised their bullish bets on WTI in the week to March 20 by 34,488 contracts to 488,438, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.  “There are a number of bullish things to hang the hat of the rally on this week; be it the inventory report ... or the tariff news, or the heightened tensions between Saudi and Iran,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipper Data in Louisville, Kentucky.  President Donald Trump’s decision to replace national security adviser H.R. McMaster with John Bolton, who is seen as more hawkish on Iran, also supported prices, Smith said.  Global stock markets fell as investors worried about a trade stand-off between the United States and China. Trade jitters could also hit oil markets, but most analysts said other bullish factors outweighed them for now. U.S. energy companies added four oil rigs in the week to March 23 General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm reported. That brought the total number of rigs to 804, the highest in three years.  While U.S. production keeps rising, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers have curbed output. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters the curbs, instituted in January 2017, would need to continue into 2019 to reduce global inventories. The demand outlook also supported oil. “We’re continuing to see signs that demand is really healthy; total U.S. demand is more than 1 million barrels a day more than it was a year ago,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “As the fundamental picture continues to tighten, that’s going to attract further length in the market,” he said.  Morgan Stanley predicted Brent would hit $75 a barrel in the third quarter as seasonal demand picks up. It noted the market is “only three-four weeks away from peak refinery maintenance, after which crude and product demand should accelerate ... Global inventories are already at the bottom end of the five-year range.” Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla, Henning Gloystein and Roslan Khasawneh; Editing by David Gregorio and Phil Berlowitz",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-10-oil-rises-as-saudi-backs-extending-output-cuts-into-2019-idUKL3N1R51AM,23 Mar 2018,"* CFTC: Speculators raise their bullish bets on crude

2018-03-23,"CARACAS, March 23 (Reuters) - Angry Venezuelan oil workers demanding better benefits to counter crushing hyperinflation and food shortages clashed with security officials during a rare protest in the cafeteria of state oil company PDVSA’s headquarters on Friday. Venezuela is home to the world’s largest crude reserves but its creaking state-led economic model has all but collapsed, sparking four-digit inflation and long lines for everything from milk to medicines. Many struggling oil workers have kept mum for fear of losing their jobs and health insurance as President Nicolas Maduro’s government takes an increasingly tough line on dissent. But in a rare display of public anger, dozens of oil workers blocked access to the cafeteria that caters to PDVSA and the adjacent Oil Ministry during lunch hour on Friday to demand the payment of delayed benefits, three sources close to PDVSA told Reuters. Videos circulating on social media showed workers pushing and shoving with green-uniformed National Guard soldiers trying to keep order. “Get out!” the employees are heard yelling, as a huge photo of late leader Hugo Chavez towers above the mayhem. Workers also shouted “Resign!” in an apparent reference to current PDVSA president and oil minister Manuel Quevedo, a major general with no oil experience tapped late last year to replace his predecessor arrested for alleged graft. The poor work environment comes as Venezuela’s oil production has slipped to a near 30-year low of around 1.6 million barrels per day due to lack of investment, rampant crime in isolated oil fields, and a brain drain. PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.

2018-03-23,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States asked China on Friday not to implement a ban on imports of scrap materials, after the world’s top scrap buyer abruptly shut the door to many types of waste, throwing the global recycling industry into turmoil.  Reuters broke the news last July that China had told the World Trade Organization that it would stop accepting shipments of rubbish such as waste plastic and paper as part of a campaign against “foreign garbage”. The U.S. Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries said at the time that the ban would devastate an industry that supported 155,000 jobs and had exported scrap worth $5.6 billion to China in 2016. The United States raised concerns about the ban, and a subsequent revision of standards for a variety of scrap metals, at the WTO’s Council for Trade in Goods on Friday. “China’s import restrictions on recycled commodities have caused a fundamental disruption in global supply chains for scrap materials, directing them away from productive reuse and toward disposal,” a U.S. representative told the meeting, according to a trade official in Geneva. The United States recognized China’s environmental concerns but Beijing’s approach seemed to be having the opposite effect to what was intended, and its rules had changed far too quickly for industry to adjust, the U.S. representative told the meeting. China seemed to be breaching its WTO obligations by treating domestic and foreign waste differently and employing an overly trade-restrictive policy, the U.S. official said.  “We request that China immediately halt implementation and revise these measures in a manner consistent with existing international standards for trade in scrap materials, which provide a global framework for transparent and environmentally sound trade in recycled commodities.” The European Union’s representative at the meeting said China’s policy would force scrap to be rerouted to third countries which may not have facilities for safe recycling, or to landfill or incineration, causing environmental damage. The EU also questioned the science behind China’s ban, while several countries said they appreciated China’s goal but were not convinced about how it was trying to get there.  China’s representative agreed to take the comments into account but said that every country had a responsibility to dispose of its waste, and with its large population China was obliged to restrict imports of waste while cleaning up at home.  “China is seeking a path toward harmonization of man and nature,” the trade official quoted China’s delegate as saying. The dispute over scrap comes amid increased concerns of a full-blown trade war between the United States and China. U.S. President Donald Trump this week signed a memorandum targeting up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs over what his administration says is misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property but only after a 30-day consultation period that starts once a list is published.  Trump has also announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States.

2018-03-23,"OSLO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Winter sea ice on the Arctic Ocean covered the second smallest area on record this year, part of a thaw that is opening the region to shipping and oil exploration and may be disrupting weather far to the south, scientists said on Friday. The extent of floating ice likely reached an annual maximum of 14.5 million square kilometers (5.6 million square miles) on March 17, fractionally bigger than a record set in 2017, the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) said.  Sea ice around the North Pole freezes to its biggest at the end of the winter in March, and thaws to an annual minimum in September. The ice has shrunk in recent decades in a trend scientists link to man-made climate change. The 2018 winter ice is about a million square kilometers - roughly the size of Egypt or Colombia and bigger than the state of Texas - below the long-term average maximum, NSIDC data show. The center, affiliated with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, studies satellite data of the ice going back 39 years.      The diminishing ice seems at odds with remarks by President Donald Trump in a television interview in January that “The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now. But now they’re setting records.”     Until now, most scientific focus has been on a trend of shrinking Arctic sea ice in summer, which is opening shipping routes from the Pacific to the Atlantic and allowing oil and gas exploration even as it harms indigenous peoples and wildlife such as polar bears. Now, “things are increasingly about the winter time,” said Tor Eldevik, a professor at the University of Bergen’s Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research.      The winter retreat means ever bigger areas are ice-free year round, especially in the Barents Sea north of Russia and Norway which is becoming more like the Atlantic Ocean, he said.     The vast Shtokman natural gas field, north of Russia, is in an area that is now ice-free even in the depths of winter – helping Gazprom if it ever develops the find. The region was ice-bound in winter until the early 1980s, Eldevik said.     Shipping company Teekay (TK.N) said a tanker loaded a first cargo of liquefied natural gas at a terminal in Arctic Russia and traveled to France in January 2018 - the first ship to make such a winter voyage without an icebreaker.     The retreat may also affect weather far to the south.     Researchers suspect that Arctic warmth can disrupt the high altitude jet stream and send brief blasts of frigid air south - such as a “beast from the East” freeze in Europe last month or bitter cold brought by a “bomb cyclone” in the eastern United States.     “You could talk about the Arctic having a fever, and boy did the Arctic have a fever this winter, and when it does, Florida feels it,” Jennifer Francis, a professor at Rutgers University’s department of marine and coastal science, told reporters. Florida faced freezing temperatures this year and suffers long-term threats from sea level rise. At the other end of the planet, sea ice around Antarctica recently reached the second smallest for summertime since satellite records began in the 1970s, also behind 2017, the NSIDC said.

2018-03-23,"BOGOTA, March 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indigenous women from Ecuador’s Amazon rainforest have called on the country’s president to end oil and mining projects on their ancestral lands, as the nation pushes to open up more of its rainforest to drillers. Their meeting with Lenin Moreno at the presidential palace in the capital Quito late Thursday comes after the Andean nation launched a new bidding round this month for foreign companies to develop oil and gas reserves. Ecuador, one of the smallest producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), hopes to attract some $800 million in investment to boost production that the government says is vital to improve its sluggish economy. But women from Amazon indigenous groups say oil exploration damages their livelihoods, the environment and water sources on ancestral lands, and comes amid growing deforestation in unspoiled areas of the biodiverse region. “We don’t want more oil and mining companies,” Alicia Cahuiya of the Waorani group told the president at the meeting. “Oil has not brought development for the Waorani - it has only left us with oil spills and sickness.” The women also told the president, who was flanked by several ministers, that the government was failing to consult properly with indigenous communities about planned oil and mining projects on their lands, a right they are entitled to under law. “The oil and mining issue does not stop worrying me, because there is a future to take care of,” Moreno said at the meeting, which was streamed live on Facebook. “What you are completely right about is the importance of dialogue consensus, dialogue decisions ... about any decisions of my government with respect to oil and mining concessions.” The women presented the president with a list of demands they call the “Mandate of Amazonian Women”, which includes stopping oil, mining and logging projects, and conducting official investigations into attacks against indigenous leaders. “I hope (the president) will take this mandate seriously,” Nina Gualinga, one of about a dozen women who took part in the meeting, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Simmering tensions - including protests - between indigenous communities seeking to protect their lands and state-owned and foreign oil companies have been ongoing in Ecuador for decades. The issue has come before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which in 2012 ruled in favour of Ecuador’s Sarayaku indigenous community in the Amazon. The court said Ecuador had violated their right to prior, free and informed consultation before drillers in the late 1990s started exploration on lands where the Sarayaku people live. “We will return to our communities and wait for a response from the government,” said Zoila Castillo, vice-president of the parliament of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon (CONFENIAE). ""If we do not receive a response in two weeks, we will be back,"" she said. (Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2018-03-23,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Boeing (BA.N) lost a lawsuit against Denmark on Friday which related to the Danish government’s decision to buy Lockheed Martin’s (LMT.N) F-35 Lightning II combat jets in preference to Boeing’s F/A 18 Super Hornets. Boeing had taken Denmark to court over a lack of access to documents used in the government’s decision to buy the Lockheed Martin jets. “The court has found that the authorities’ decisions on refusal of access to the documents are legal and valid,” Copenhagen’s city court said in a summary of the verdict on its website on Friday. Boeing said it was disappointed by the decision and would now review it and consider how to proceed.   After Denmark decided to buy 27 of Lockheed Martin’s new warplanes in 2016, Boeing complained that the evaluation process for the planes competing for the order had been “flawed” and demanded access to the documents in the case. “Boeing initiated this legal action to gain a better understanding of the evaluation process, in which we believe the Ministry made a number of critical errors and omissions in its evaluation,” Boeing said in a statement on Friday.     Denmark’s defence ministry had denied Boeing access because the U.S. company had not specified which documents it wanted to see, and that it would too large a task to find all documents since preparations for the order began in 2005.

2018-03-23,"OSLO (Reuters) - Human activities are causing an alarming decline in the variety of plant and animal life on Earth and jeopardizing food, clean water and energy supplies, a U.N.-backed study of biodiversity said on Friday. Climate change will become a steadily bigger threat to biodiversity by 2050, adding to damage from pollution and forest clearance to make way for agriculture, according to more than 550 experts in a set of reports approved by 129 governments. “Biodiversity, the essential variety of life-forms on earth, continues to decline in every region of the world,” the authors wrote after talks in Colombia. “This alarming trend endangers the quality of life of people everywhere.” Four regional reports covered the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, Europe and Central Asia - all areas of the planet except the poles and the high seas. For the Americas, the report estimated that the value of nature to people - such as crops, wood, water purification or tourism - was at least $24.3 trillion a year, equivalent to the region’s gross domestic product from Alaska to Argentina. Almost two-thirds of those natural contributions were in decline in the Americas, it said. Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), said  biodiversity was not only about saving rare butterflies, trees, birds or rhinos. While that was important, he told Reuters a key message was: “Please stop thinking of biodiversity just as an environmental issue. It’s way more important than that”. Among other economic estimates, the Africa report said the absorption of greenhouse gases by a hectare (2.5 acres) of forest in Central Africa was worth $14,000 a year. Unless governments take strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions, “climate change may be the biggest threat to biodiversity” by mid-century, Watson said. He said U.S. delegates had not challenged findings about man-made climate change, although U.S. President Donald Trump doubts mainstream scientific opinion and plans to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. For pollution, eight of 10 rivers around the world with most plastic waste were in Asia. On current trends, overfishing meant there could be no exploitable fish stocks in the Asia-Pacific region by mid-century. Around the world, ever more animals and plants were under threat from human activities, ranging from elephants in Africa to rare mosses and snails in Europe, the study said.  “By 2100, climate change could ... result in the loss of more than half of African bird and mammal species,” said Emma Archer of South Africa, the co-chair of the African assessment. Rising human populations in many developing nations would require new policies, both to protect nature and to meet U.N. goals of eradicating poverty and hunger by 2030. In Europe and Central Asia, wetlands have declined by half since 1970, threatening many species. Amid the gloom, there were some bright spots. Forest cover had risen by 22.9 percent in China and other nations in northeast Asia between 1990 and 2015. Parks and other protected areas were expanding in many regions, including the Americas and Asia-Pacific. And populations of animals such as the Iberian lynx, Amur tiger and far eastern leopard were coming back from the brink of extinction thanks to conservation.

2018-03-23,"ALMATY, March 23 (Reuters) - Turkmenistan will vote in a parliamentary election on Sunday which may give President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov’s son a more prominent role and cement his status as a designated successor in the gas-rich Central Asian nation. All three parties in the election support Berdymukhamedov, 60, who has run the former Soviet republic since 2007 tolerating no dissent and the 125-seat parliament mainly rubber-stamps laws proposed by the president who is also the head of cabinet. However, the upcoming election may prompt a reshuffle among senior MPs and ultimately give Serdar Berdymukhamedov, the president’s only son, a bigger role, possibly that of speaker or deputy speaker. Serdar Berdymukhamedov, 36, became a parliament deputy in a by-election in 2016 after holding several mid-level government jobs. Since then, he has become a committee head and made a number of foreign visits, including one to neighbouring Kazakhstan this month which underscored his special status. Under the Turkmen constituion, the speaker becomes acting president if the head of state becomes unable to carry out his work. Serdar Berdymukhamedov has trained as agricultural engineer and later studied diplomacy in Russia and Switzerland, skills which he put to use during his work at the foreign ministry. His father is the centre of an elaborate personality cult and is commonly referred to as Arkadag, or protector, who in official parlance is overseeing an “era of might and happiness”. Turkmenistan’s economy depends heavily on exports of natural gas and came under stress after Russia, once the biggest buyer, halted all purchases of Turkmen gas in 2016. Its main customer now is China and the Ashgabat government is building a new pipeline through Afghanistan to Pakistan and China in an attempt to open up new export markets. For ordinary Turkmens, lower export revenues have manifested themselves in foreign currency shortages and foreign exchange restrictions. The black market flourished as a result, where the Turkmen manat currency trades at less than a third of its official value.

2018-03-23,"(Adds details, background) MOSCOW, March 23 (Reuters) - Mikhail Putin, identified by the Kremlin as a distant relative of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been appointed deputy chair of the management board of state-run gas giant Gazprom, the company said on Friday. Mikhail Putin was born in 1967 and studied medicine, according to a biography published by Gazprom. He worked in the health ministry, and between 2004 and 2007 was head of Gazprom’s medical directorate. His latest role was as deputy head of the management board at Sogaz, an insurance company for which Gazprom is a major client. Earlier this week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of Mikhail Putin: “As far as I know, he is a distant relative of the president. I don’t know if they have any interaction.” Mikhail Putin is a son of the president’s cousin, Interfax news agency reported. Gazprom declined to say what Mikhail Putin’s responsibilities in the company would be. Gazprom had a vacancy on its management board after Alexander Kozlov, who was in charge of the company’s logistics and procurement, died last December aged 65. Information about the president’s family is closely guarded from the public eye by Putin, a former head of Russia’s FSB secret service. He keeps his two daughters, Maria and Katerina, as well as his grandchildren, away from exposure to the media. Putin has said he wants them to lead normal lives. Reuters reported in 2015, citing sources who know her, that Katerina was using the surname Tikhonova, inherited from her grandmother. Katerina Tikhonova runs publicly-funded projects at Moscow State University and serves as the vice president for expansion and marketing of the World Rock’n’Roll Confederation.

2018-03-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has rejected plans for a new open cast coal mine in northeastern England, as it could hamper efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change, the minister for local government said on Friday. Supporters of the project had said it could bring much needed jobs to the region, while environmental campaigners said it would go against Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. Britain plans to phase-out coal use at its power stations by 2025 as a part of its efforts to meet its climate targets, and is part of an international alliance pushing other countries to do the same. Northumberland County Council agreed last year that the mine’s developer The Banks Group could extract 3 million tonnes of coal by cutting an open cast, or surface mine, near Druridge Bay, Highthorn. But local government minister Sajid Javid rejected the application on Friday following a public inquiry, government documents show. “The scheme would have an adverse effect on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change of very substantial significance, which he gives very considerable weight in the planning balance,” the government report, rejecting the application said. Gavin Styles, managing director at the mine’s developer Banks Mining, said Britain was still dependent on coal for a number of purposes and the decision had been taken for “purely political reasons.” “The importance of securing investment in North East England, creating dozens of high quality local jobs, and opening up opportunities for regional suppliers to win substantial contracts could not be any clearer,” he said in an emailed statement. The company said the project could employ 100 people and generate almost 50 million pounds ($70.43 million) in related contracts and other benefits to the community. Styles said the company would carefully review the decision before deciding on the most appropriate next steps to take. Environmentalists had criticized the plans, saying it would destroy an area of natural beauty and that extracting more coal is at odds with international pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate pact. “This is the first coal mine ever to be rejected in the UK because of climate change impacts – a vindication for everyone who has been calling for fossil fuels to be left in the ground,” said Rose Dickinson, campaigner with environmental group Friends of the Earth. Britain has a legally binding target to cut emissions of harmful greenhouse gases, such as those produced by fossil-fuel-based power plants, by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050, It has also signed up to the international Paris agreement to curb emissions.

2018-03-23,"* Plunging winter temperatures drove up demand * UK gas prices soared to record levels in March * Refilling must start from April for winter needs By Nina Chestney and Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - Benchmark British wholesale gas prices will stay elevated for the rest of 2018, as operators across Europe race to replenish inventories that have plunged to their lowest in at least five years. Prices soared to record highs in March as freezing temperatures lifted gas demand to its highest level since 2010, drawing down stocks across Europe and exacerbating tightness from outages and reduced liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. Britain, whose gas prices are a benchmark for other European hubs, relies on reserves to manage its winter demand. It will need to refill at record pace this summer, at a time when European nations are also chasing extra supplies. Adding to Britain’s headache, what was its largest storage site, Rough, has now closed, removing an extra cushion to meet winter demand that once had capacity to inject gas into the national network for 90 consecutive days if needed. Northwest European gas storage volumes are expected to start the summer season at about 6 billion cubic metres (bcm), the lowest level since at least 2013, when Thomson Reuters Eikon data for European inventories began and stocks stood at 10 bcm. “That does not mean that gas prices will spike but it’s unlikely that gas prices will drop - at least for the very beginning of the spring/summer season,” said Giacomo Masato, research analyst at brokerage Marex Spectron. Unseasonable cold weather in Britain is expected to continue to the end of March, pushing inventories lower still. British stocks now stand at 300 million cubic metres, compared to 1.1 bcm at the same point a year ago. “If we don’t see injection in April, the lag is going to be so acute going through summer, it has to be a flashing risk for next winter,” Thomson Reuters gas analyst Oliver Sanderson said. “The impact of acute storage depletion will be felt for some time to come. Lower inventories in June and July could be bullish, lifting the winter 2018 and August price. The European gas system is also acutely sensitive to unplanned outages,” he said. Summer 2018 gas prices are now about 45 pence per therm, having risen about 12 percent since early February, while the winter 2018 contract is about 53 per therm. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has raised its forecasts for British gas. It sees second quarter prices at $6/million British thermal units (mmbtu), or 42.6 pence per therm, 9 percent higher than its previous estimate. It sees full-year prices up 15 percent from its previous estimate at $6.13/mmbtu, or 43.5 per therm. BMI Research sees full-year prices averaging 45.0 pence per therm, up from a previous forecast of 43.0 per therm. Trevor Sikorski, analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects, said Europe now needed to find an extra 8-10 bcm by October to replenish stocks. “That will take quite a lot of additional LNG, and if not, increased nomination from Russia,” he said. Last year, monthly European Union gas consumption was around 28-40 bcm from April to the end of September, according to the EU’s statistics office Eurostat. Adding to upside pressure on prices, Russian gas giant Gazprom might not be able to reroute sufficient flows to Europe after it began unwinding its transit contract with Ukraine, analysts say. Tension between Moscow and London, after the poisoning of a former double agent living in Britain, has also raised questions about British energy security. Although Russian gas accounts for less than 1 percent of British demand, Britain relies heavily on supplies from the Netherlands, which may itself have to increase Russian imports as the Dutch government reduces output from a major gas field. The Dutch government says it wants to cut production to 12 bcm a year at its Groningen field “as quickly as possible”, from more than 21 bcm now. The initiative aims to reduce the risk of tremors caused by the production process. Britain could turn to its other main supplier, Norway, but it will face competition for the gas from elsewhere in Europe. The amount of LNG Britain receives over the summer is also uncertain as much depends on the development of Asian spot LNG premiums over European gas hubs. “There are geopolitical issues, storage is obviously a concern, uncertainty around Groningen, a lack of LNG although this might change and French nuclear is still a concern for me this winter,” said Wayne Bryan, analyst at Alfa Energy.

European stocks fell, with Germany’s Dax down 1.4 percent, the French CAC 40 1.3 percent lower and Britain’s FTSE 100 0.4 percent in the red. That followed large falls in the U.S. and overnight in Asia, although futures pricing pointed to a slight recovery for U.S. stocks when they opened on Friday. Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect. China urged the United States to “pull back from the brink”, but investors fear Trump’s tariffs are leading the world’s two largest economies into a trade war with potentially dire consequences for the global economy. China disclosed its own plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation against U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium products. The MSCI World Index, down around 3.4 percent since Monday, is on course for its worst week since early February when a spike in volatility sent markets into a tailspin. “The equity markets are getting clobbered, which is not that surprising with fears of a trade war breaking out,” said Paul Fage, a TD Securities emerging markets strategist. With investors seeking out safer assets, many have jumped into government bond markets in Europe and the United States. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which fell almost 8 basis points on Thursday, rose on Friday but were still set for their biggest two-week fall since November. In Europe, benchmark issuer Germany’s 10-year bond yields hovered close to 10-week lows struck a day earlier at around 0.52 percent. While German bond yields recovered in European trading, they were still on track for their biggest two-week drop since November. Many investors also turned to the yen, a currency likely to benefit from a full-fledged trade war. The Japanese currency gained as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar to 104.635 yen, the first time it has been below 105 since November 2016. Investors later booked profits to leave the yen up 0.1 percent at 105.19 yen per dollar. The Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty, rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar, although it fell against the euro. The dollar dropped 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies. “The FX market itself isn’t sure, and its reaction to risk-off and lower bond yields across the board is to buy the yen and the Swiss franc,” Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a daily note. In commodity markets, oil prices recouped overnight losses after Saudi Arabia said that OPEC and Russian-led production curbs introduced in 2017 will need to be extended into 2019 . U.S. crude futures were up 0.5 percent at $64.68 per barrel after losing 1.3 percent on Thursday, and Brent rose 0.68 percent to $69.38 before giving up most of those gains. Safe-haven spot gold rose 1.3 percent to $1,342 an ounce, its highest since Feb. 20. The precious metal is up 2.5 percent this week. Copper and iron prices both fell, as investors bet demand for the metals would suffer in a trade war. MET/L. Daniel Lockyer, senior fund manager at Hawksmoor Investment Management, said financial markets had failed to price in the risk of a sell-off. “It’s not that we thought trade wars would cause the market to fall, it’s that there was too much optimism priced into stock markets,” he said. Emerging markets also sold off heavily as investors dumped riskier assets on fears of a trade war. MSCI’s benchmark emerging equity index lost 1.7 percent. South Africa’s rand climbed 0.8 percent ahead of a decision by Moody’s on the fate of the country’s last remaining investment grade credit rating.

2018-03-23,"OSLO (Reuters) - Human activities are causing an alarming decline in the variety of plant and animal life on Earth and jeopardising food, clean water and energy supplies, a U.N.-backed study of biodiversity said on Friday. Pollution, climate change and forest clearances to make way for farmland were among the worsening threats to nature, according to more than 550 experts in a set of reports approved by 129 governments after talks in Colombia. “Biodiversity, the essential variety of life-forms on earth, continues to decline in every region of the world,” the authors wrote. “This alarming trend endangers the quality of life of people everywhere.” Four regional reports covered the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, Europe and Central Asia - all areas of the planet except the poles and the high seas. For the Americas, the report estimated that the value of nature to people - such as crops, wood, water purification or tourism - was at least $24.3 trillion a year, equivalent to the region’s gross domestic product from Alaska to Argentina. Almost two-thirds of those natural contributions were in decline in the Americas, it said. “Biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people sound, to many people, academic and far removed from our daily lives,” said Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). “Nothing could be further from the truth.” Among other economic estimates, the Africa report said the absorption of greenhouse gases by a hectare (2.5 acres) of forest in Central Africa was worth $14,000 a year. Around the world, ever more animals and plants were under threat, ranging from elephants in Africa to rare mosses in Europe. More than half of African bird and mammal species could be lost to climate change by 2100, it said. “By 2100, climate change could ... result in the loss of more than half of African bird and mammal species,” said Emma Archer of South Africa, the co-chair of the African assessment. For pollution, eight of 10 rivers around the world with most plastic waste were in Asia. On current trends, overfishing meant there could be no exploitable fish stocks in the Asia-Pacific region by mid-century. Rising human populations in many developing nations would require new policies both to protect nature and to meet U.N. goals to eradicate poverty and hunger by 2030. In Europe and Central Asia, wetlands have declined by half since 1970. The average ecological footprint - or land needed per person for a sustainable environment - was 5.1 hectares against an available 2.2. Amid the gloom, there were some bright spots. Forest cover had risen by 22.9 percent in China and other nations in northeast Asia between 1990 and 2015. Parks and other protected areas were expanding in many regions, including the Americas and Asia-Pacific. And populations of animals such as the Iberian lynx, Amur tiger and far eastern leopard were coming back from the brink of extinction thanks to conservation.

2018-03-23,"SINGAPORE, March 23 (Reuters) - Noble Group Ltd said this week’s resignation of its founder Richard Elman was due to “amicable differences” with the board and a group of senior creditors who are negotiating a debt restructuring that is crucial for its survival. In a statement late on Friday, Noble said Elman had informed the commodities trader he had resigned due to “amicable differences of opinion with the board and the ad hoc group of creditors on the way forwards.” The clarification, in response to a query from the Singapore bourse, comes days after Goldilocks, an Abu Dhabi Financial Group equity fund - a leading shareholder of Noble - filed a lawsuit in Singapore against the firm and some of its former and current senior executives, including Elman, alleging they inflated Noble’s assets. Singapore-listed Noble said it planned to resist any and all allegations or claims made against it. This week, the company defaulted on a bond as it hammers out a debt-for-equity swap after selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs over the past three years. On Tuesday, Elman, 77, resigned as a non-executive director. He founded Noble in 1986 and then rode a commodities bull run to build it into one of the world’s biggest traders. However, it plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its books. Noble has stood by its accounting. Goldilocks has opposed the restructuring, which is also facing criticism from some bondholders. Under the deal, Noble is seeking to halve its senior debt and hand over 70 percent of the restructured business to creditors. Noble’s market value has fallen to just $101 million, from $6 billion in February 2015, as the company reported record losses and shrunk its business.

2018-03-23,"(Adds details of release, background) OTTAWA, March 23 (Reuters) - Canada’s annual inflation rate in February jumped to 2.2 percent from 1.7 percent in January, the highest level in more than three years, in part due to costlier gasoline, Statistics Canada said on Friday. The annual rate - greater than the 2.0 percent forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll - was the most elevated since the 2.4 percent recorded in October 2014. The Bank of Canada, which has a 2.0 percent target for inflation, has raised interest rates three times since July 2017 amid a strengthening economy and near record low unemployment, and markets expect another hike by this July. Among the main contributors to the higher annual inflation rate in February were a 12.6 percent jump in gasoline prices and a 4.0 percent increase in food purchased from restaurants. The Bank of Canada’s three measures of core inflation also all strengthened. CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, increased to 1.9 percent, the highest since February 2012. CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, rose to 2.1 percent, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, also edged up to 2.1 percent.

2018-03-23,"* Southern exports in first 21 days of March dip by 70,000 bpd * Northern exports fall to 270,000 bpd * Plan to export crude by truck to Iran delayed By Alex Lawler LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - Oil exports from southern Iraq have fallen by 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) this month, according to shipping data and an industry source, suggesting OPEC’s second-largest producer is heading for a third month of lower shipments. Southern Iraqi exports in the first 21 days of March averaged about 3.36 million bpd, compared to 3.43 million bpd in February, shipping data followed by Reuters and independent tracking by an industry source showed. The fall suggests there is still no sign of extra supplies reaching the market from Iraq even though oil prices rallied this year to $71 a barrel for the first time since 2014, supported by an OPEC-led agreement to cut output. Iraq says it is committed to the OPEC deal. “We are seeing lower volumes,” the source who tracks Iraq’s exports said. Southern shipments have fallen as one of the single point loadings used to fill tankers was under maintenance for part of March because of a leak, a shipping agent said. Also, loadings have dropped at the small port of Khor al-Amaya. Iraq had been boosting exports from its southern terminals, which handle the bulk of such trade, to offset a halt in shipments from its northern Kirkuk oilfields in October after Iraqi forces seized control of fields from Kurdish fighters. Northern exports have averaged 270,000 bpd so far in March, compared with an estimated 340,000 bpd in February, according to shipping data and the industry source. That is far below levels of more than 500,000 bpd in some months of 2017. Iraqi oil officials say there are no plans to resume oil flow through the Kurdish-owned pipeline, as no agreement has been reached yet. Northern exports could rise if Iraq goes ahead with a plan to export Kirkuk oil by truck to Iran, but this has been delayed. Based on loadings so far, total exports in March have averaged 3.63 million bpd, down from 3.77 million bpd in February, 3.81 million bpd in January and 3.84 million bpd in December, according to Iraqi figures and loading data. Southern shipments reached a record in December. OPEC, Russia and other producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million bpd until the end of 2018 in an effort to get rid of a global crude glut and support prices. Iraq complied less with the supply deal than its OPEC peers, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, for much of 2017, but the drop in Kirkuk output boosted Iraqi and overall compliance.

2018-03-23,"* Soybeans are America’s biggest farm export to China * US soybean prices under pressure on worries over orders * Feedmakers worry trade action would push up prices * China soymeal prices rise on Friday By Hallie Gu and Josephine Mason BEIJING, March 23 (Reuters) - Chinese buyers of soybeans, the United States’ biggest agricultural export to the country, are quietly drawing up contingency plans to ensure supplies of critical raw materials in the event of a trade war, sources said. The moves are the strongest sign yet that businesses in the world’s most populous country are growing worried that critical commodities could get caught up in escalating trade tensions. At least two trading houses have started buying more rapeseed meal, an alternative ingredient used to make animal feed, in case the oilseed is a target of retaliation by Beijing, sources at the company familiar with the strategies said. “It is an obvious choice to seek other protein sources. We are buying more rapeseed meal, for example,” said one of the sources. As an extra layer of protection, his company has also started to include exit clauses in purchase contracts with U.S. suppliers giving them the right to cancel the order if needed. The second source said their firm was also purchasing more domestic distillers’ dried grains (DDGS), a byproduct of ethanol production used as an animal feed ingredient. The company is also considering ramping up purchases of Brazilian soybeans. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media and would not disclose further details due to the commercial sensitivity of the issue. Penalties on soybeans would be a powerful weapon in Beijing’s arsenal because they would especially hurt Iowa, a state that backed U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections. U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad was previously a long-serving governor of the farm state. The United States shipped more than $12 billion worth of soybeans to China last year. China buys two thirds of the beans traded worldwide, mainly from Brazil and the United States. China’s commerce and agriculture ministries told a delegation of U.S. soy growers last September that soybeans were being considered as a target for retaliatory action in the event of U.S. trade action against Beijing. On Thursday, Trump announced plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods for what he says is misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property, moving the world’s two largest economies closer to a trade war. China showed readiness to retaliate by declaring plans to levy additional duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports including fruit and wine in response to U.S. import tariffs on steel and aluminium, which were due to go into effect on Friday. Jim Sutter, chief executive of the U.S. Soybean Export Council, said it would not be a surprise for Chinese crushers and importers to make emergency plans. “They’re business people and they have to be thinking about their alternatives,” he said. Sutter had not heard of any specific contingency plans being developed. However, Chinese buyers would likely find it difficult to get by only using alternatives, because its industry relies so heavily on U.S. soybeans, he said. Even so, worries that China may cancel orders pushed cash bids for both soybeans and corn lower at grain elevators along Midwest rivers on Thursday, indicating decreased demand from export terminals at the U.S. Gulf, a U.S. grains exporter said. Soybeans dropped by about 2 cents to 6 cents per bushel and corn was down 1 to 4 cents per bushel. The threat of a trade war drove up prices for soymeal, hurting feedmakers and pig farmers, on Friday. The most-active soymeal futures prices on the Dalian Commodity Exchange were up 1.4 percent at 3,046 yuan per tonne. Traders and millers who crush soybeans and rapeseed to make meal and oil in China say there are no signs of panic in the country’s vast farming and livestock sector. Any immediate impact on crushers will be cushioned by a Brazilian crop coming to market. “We will deal with it if it happens,” said Ji Feng, a senior soybean trader at global commodities merchant Cargill, in a panel discussion at an oilseeds conference on Thursday. Still the increasingly heated rhetoric between the two countries has given some industry insiders pause this week. “I feel the trade war is really happening. Before it was just talk, but now it seems real,” said a purchasing manager at a medium-sized feed company who is bracing for a further spike in soymeal prices. “For me, the impact will be mainly on soymeal prices.” Reporting by Hallie Gu and Josephine Mason in BEIJING;

2018-03-23,"HANOI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Vietnam has halted an oil drilling project in the “Red Emperor” block off its southeastern coast licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol (REP.MC) following pressure from China, three sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Friday. It would be the second time in less than a year that Vietnam has had to suspend a major oil development in the busy South China Sea waterway under pressure from China. A source with direct knowledge of the situation said  government ministries in Vietnam had paused the project while the decision-making politburo debates whether to suspend or indefinitely terminate the contract. The decision, which hangs on whether the fees incurred by contract cancellation will exceed the cost of resisting Chinese pressure, is on hold until the politburo meets, the source said. That meeting has been delayed by overseas trips by Vietnam’s prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, a series of visits by foreign dignitaries to Hanoi, and the death of former prime minister Phan Van Khai on Saturday. “The ministries are determined to terminate the contract,” said the source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. A source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed that the project, which is a joint venture with state oil company PetroVietnam, had been stopped following pressure from China.  A source at Repsol told Reuters high-level executives had been discussing how to respond to the pressure, which had been applied both directly by China, and indirectly via Vietnam. A spokesman for Repsol in Madrid declined to comment.  PetroVietnam executives declined to comment. The Vietnamese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Asked at a regular briefing if China had pressed either Vietnam or Repsol, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not know where such news had come from, but did not elaborate. “We hope the relevant sides can work together to maintain the hard-earned positive situation in the South China Sea,” she said.  Red Emperor, known in Vietnamese as the Ca Rong Do field, is part of Block 07/03 in the Nam Con Son basin, 440 km (273 miles) off the coast of Vietnam’s southern city of Vung Tau. The $1-billion field of moderate size by international standards is seen as a key asset to help slow the decline of Vietnam’s stalling oil and gas production. But the block lies near the U-shaped “nine-dash line” that marks the vast area that China claims in the sea and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions. Located in waters around 350 metres (1,148 ft) deep, it is considered to be profitable from around $60 per barrel. Current Brent crude oil prices LCOc1 are almost $70 per barrel. The field’s estimated potential recovery is around 45 million barrels of crude oil, 172 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 2.3 million barrels of condensate, a super light form of crude oil that is mostly a byproduct of gas production. Global crude oil, by comparison, is at almost 100 million barrels per day. Global gas consumption is around 4 trillion cubic metres per year. The move came as Repsol was making final preparations for commercial drilling, according to the BBC, which first reported the news on Friday. A rig, the Ensco 8504, was due to depart from Singapore for the drill site on Thursday, the BBC said, citing an unnamed energy industry source. Repsol spent around 33 million euros ($41 million) on exploration in Vietnam last year, according to the company’s 2017 profit and loss statement. Repsol’s top management considers the Red Emperor site one of the company’s future growth projects. Repsol, which has a 51.75 percent stake in the project, signed a 384-million-euro rental contract for a rig to start work on a Vietnamese site in 2019, according to the statement. Just under half the company’s 1 billion euro ($1.23 billion) investments for which contracts have been signed for 2018 are in Vietnam.

2018-03-23,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European utilities plan to begin some direct trades with one another using blockchain technology within months, hoping to stay ahead in a world in which individuals may eventually sell green energy to one another. The distributed ledger technology that underpins the bitcoin currency has already been tested by energy operators for wholesale trading, but it will go live with just a few selected electricity and gas contracts to start with. The initiative, Enerchain, is a forerunner of more possible uses of the technology by established energy players and wider options explored by a raft of start-ups to harness its potential - many of them years away from execution. Regulators are seeking to control this strategic sector to avoid security issues, digital infrastructure is lagging and players must agree to share data and avoid privacy breaches. While tentative, Enerchain is a test of the utilities’ ability to protect their margins by dominating novel automated trading architectures matching energy producers with each other and also with users. Apart from staving off competition from more agile digital companies, it could help speed a sector shift in Germany from fossil fuels to renewables, bypassing nuclear, highlighted in a reorganisation of E.ON (EONGn.DE) and RWE (RWEG.DE) this month. German IT company Ponton has worked with 39 power and gas traders to build the peer-to-peer platform since 2016. Managing director Michael Merz told Reuters its members will choose contracts to go live with as soon as they set up a legal entity to pool budgets, probably in the second or third quarter of 2018, his first detailed comments on the timeline to mainstream media. The companies, which include prominent names such as Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI), Germany’s E.ON and Sweden’s Vattenfall, were driven by the need to lower transaction costs in an era of growing competition and energy supplies, he said. “Publishing orders and transactions via blockchain can replace trading via brokers,” Merz said. “We have developed an order execution process that works just like a typical OTC (over-the-counter) market front end.” Alongside brokers, potential losers from the Enerchain proposition include exchanges such as ICE (ICE.N) or EEX (DB1Gn.DE), but both are joining the blockchain party. ICE in January launched a cryptocurrency data feed in January and both it and EEX are discussing applications with customers and tech firms. “We see this new technology as a real opportunity to further improve our business,” EEX chief executive Peter Reitz said during the E-World of Energy trade fair last month. Instead of administering duplicate databases, blockchain comprises one record maintained by a network of participants rather than a centralised entity: accessible and unchangeable. Ponton would not monopolise Enerchain software, Metz said, but step back to develop other products, to simplify peer-to-peer grid processes and speed north Germany’s green power supply. Vattenfall business development manager Kilian Leykam said while Enerchain was still in test phase, “...we are confident that we will see live trades this year when all necessary technical and regulatory prerequisites are fulfilled.” Germany’s regulator the Bundesnetzagentur said it keeps a tight watch over networks and retail markets where suppliers are licensed and monitored regardless of the technology they use. Matthias Lang, an energy specialist at law firm Bird & Bird, said this creates high entrance hurdles which software developers should build into their processes from the start. “I have to clarify in practice, that I can only sell energy when I’ve got some, and what happens at other times,” he said. “Two or more suppliers must club together and someone has to control that.” Austrian utility Wien Energie, also part of the Enerchain initiative, has been testing blockchain for settling gas trades via the platform of Canadian start-up BTL, co-operating with the likes of ENI (ENI.MI) and BP (BP.L) since 2017. Vattenfall also participates in that test consortium, called BTL One Office, which is more focused on trade settlements, and is also close to revealing further progress. Energy shipments often involve lengthy chains of documents and multiple acknowledgement receipts. Even electronic platforms with central clearing functions can be slow and expensive. While blockchain cannot yet take on billions of dollars of transactions in equities or currency markets handling thousands of deals per second, energy trades are not overly complex and occur at a rate of one every few seconds, offering a good fit. (GRAPHIC: Blockchain the key - tmsnrt.rs/2G9UJDe) Some in a fiercely competitive commodities sector are reluctant to put their data on a common platform, however, making progress slow going. Research firm IDC estimates global investment in blockchain will more than double in 2018 to $2.1 billion from $945 million last year, most of it for banking, but expects “strong, double-digit growth” in the energy space between 2016 and 2021. Germany’s capital Berlin has become a thriving hub for start-ups looking at digital business models.  Its European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) polled attendees of the city’s annual blockchain in energy conference EventHorizon last year and said some 36 percent saw blockchain cutting utility process costs by almost a third. Another research firm, Trend Research of Bremen, has said more than 80 percent of energy companies it interviewed are planning or preparing blockchain processes, in decentralised energy production, electric mobility, retail sales, renewable power origin certificates, network management and billing. Merz said financial trading rules with high capital requirements did not apply to Enerchain, as it is defined as a communication channel for data exchanges. If successful, it could in theory allow the group to pool other professional resources such as risk management and compliance reporting. Christoph Burger, senior lecturer at ESMT, said Enerchain looked well placed to avoid the lack of trust issues that have caused other attempts to use blockchain to founder. “This is a nicely focused and well functioning use case ... and legal questions are easily resolved,” he said. New infrastructure is needed and new regulation and industry standards must be embedded before blockchain can transform existing mass market processes, experts say. “A public blockchain may involve everyone seeing the movements around my account, if my smart metre is hooked up to the network,” said Ewald Hesse, chief executive and co-founder of Grid Singularity, an energy data exchange platform hosted by the non-profit Energy Web Foundation (WEF). “It can’t be that everyone who is able to code knows what is happening.” It also must be clear who builds and maintains the systems. “Bear in mind that there might be job losses in areas such as controlling, legal, IT and administration,” said ESMT’s Burger. Start-ups are drawn to Germany, Europe’s biggest and most highly priced power market and home to 1.6 million small renewable power production units and over 80 million consumers. “Things are really going to take off here in the future,” said E.ON’s chief executive Johannes Teyssen of solar markets, where rising sales of inexpensive batteries could allow millions of prosumers to enter the scene. Solar panels owners dream of neighbourhood power-sharing schemes and of owning electric cars, helped by the roll out of 5G mobile data network services enabling “smart” home applications. They have been encouraged by sellers of the panels, which will start gradually losing 20-year fixed term subsidies in the next few years, who gloss over the fact that the smart meters needed to enable such schemes are years from being rolled out.

2018-03-23,"BEIJING, March 23 (Reuters) - China’s new vice president, a close ally of President Xi Jinping, on Friday made his first appearance on the political scene since taking up the job a week ago, in a relatively low-key meeting with the Philippines’ top diplomat. Vice President Wang Qishan, China’s former chief graft-buster, is expected to have dealing with the Trump administration as a major focus of his portfolio as ties with Washington nosedive, diplomatic sources say. U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods have brought the world’s two largest economies closer to a trade war. But Wang’s first task was the Philippines. Meeting Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano at the Zhongnanhai central leadership compound in Beijing, Wang said the Philippines was a traditionally friendly neighbour of China’s, state media said. In the new year both countries should continue to meet each other halfway, deepen cooperation and handle disputes appropriately, Wang added. Cayetano has been in China to discuss possible joint oil and gas exploration in the disputed South China Sea. China claims most of the South China Sea, a key trade route and home to areas that are believed to hold large quantities of oil and natural gas. Along with China, parts of the South China Sea are subject to competing claims from Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. The Philippines’ ties with China have warmed under President Rodrigo Duterte, who has put aside territorial disputes in exchange for trade opportunities and pledged financing for infrastructure projects. Duterte is visiting China next month to attend the Boao economic forum on the southern island province of Hainan and will meet Xi. Whether Xi could retain Wang in a senior role despite his reaching retirement age had been seen as a key measure of Xi’s power and the subject of intense interest in the lead-up to this month’s parliament, which approved his new role last weekend. In January, Wang, who turns 70 in July, was named a parliament delegate with the central province of Hunan despite having stepped down from the elite seven-man Politburo Standing Committee during a five-yearly leadership transition in October.

2018-03-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate CEFC had already started paying for a stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft when authorities took its chairman Ye Jianming away, halting the 6.5 billion pound ($9.1 billion) deal in its tracks, according to three sources close to the matter.   The fate of the deal, one of the largest Chinese investments in Russia, has become a litmus test of how far President Xi Jinping’s government is prepared to go with a crackdown on financially risky activities among big-spending conglomerates.  The acquisition of the stake in Russian state oil firm is seen as strengthening relations between Russia and China, the world’s top energy exporter and top energy consumer.  CEFC China Energy was buying the 14.16 stake from a consortium including Swiss trader Glencore (GLEN.L). It had transferred the first tranche of payment before it ceased all communications, the sources told Reuters. The sources declined to say how much had been paid. One said the fact some money has changed hands would make it more difficult for any party to back out of the deal. CEFC founder and chairman Ye was put under investigation by Chinese authorities over suspected economic crimes, Reuters reported at the beginning of March, and he will step down from his position at the firm.     Rosneft representatives have since travelled to China but failed to get any update from CEFC on the stake acquisition deal, according to the sources.  “The other party (CEFC) has just vanished,” one source said. Rosneft and Glencore declined to comment, while CEFC did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Another of the sources said it was difficult to predict how the deal would unfold. “One thing is clear though. The Kremlin wants China to own a stake in Rosneft. And China has long said it wants to boost Russian energy ties,” he added.     The Chinese foreign ministry said it did not know about the deal, but added: “China and Russia’s governments pay great attention to energy collaboration and keep close communication.” The Chinese national development and reform commission, a state economic management agency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Kremlin declined to comment.  The investigation into Ye, who founded CEFC in 2002, followed mounting concerns among Chinese authorities about the finances and opaque ownership of the Shanghai-based private firm which has grown from a niche fuel trader into an oil and finance conglomerate with assets across the world. An investment firm owned by the Shanghai government has been tasked with evaluating CEFC’s financial position as part of a restructuring and takeover process. State-controlled China Huarong Asset Management Co has taken a 36.2-percent stake in CEFC Hainan International, the unit that is acquiring the Rosneft stake. Complications to the deal could prove a blow for Rosneft boss Igor Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Sechin is keen to attract new foreign investment as a way of showing the Kremlin oil producer is not crumbling under the pressure of Western sanctions but is growing. In 2016, Sechin clinched a deal with Glencore and Qatar’s state fund QIA to sell 19.5 percent in Rosneft for 10.2 billion euros. Qatar contributed 2.5 billion euros with the rest mainly coming from Russian banks. Less than nine months later, CEFC agreed to buy out the majority of the stake with QIA keeping its stake intact at around 5 percent, equal to its initial contribution.

2018-03-23,"* Stock markets reel after Trump announces China tariffs * China urges U.S. to pull back from brink * Yen hits highest since November 2016 * U.S. Treasury yields set for biggest two-week fall since Sept * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - The threat of a global trade war sent stock markets sliding and investors rushing for the safety of currencies like the yen and government bonds on Friday, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods. World stocks, down 3.4 percent since Monday, are on course for their worst week since early February, when a spike in volatility sent markets into a tailspin. European stocks fell at the open, with Germany’s Dax down 1.6 percent, the French CAC 40 1.5 percent lower and Britain’s FTSE 100 0.8 percent in the red. That followed large falls in the U.S., with the S&P 500 shedding 2.5 percent, and overnight in Asia, where the Japanese Nikkei 225 was the biggest loser slumping 4.5 percent. Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period . China urged the United States to “pull back from the brink”, but investors fear Trump’s tariffs are leading the world’s two largest economies into a trade war with potentially dire consequences for the global economy. China disclosed its own plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation against the U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium products. “The equity markets are getting clobbered, which is not that surprising with fears of a trade war breaking out,” said Paul Fage, a TD Securities emerging markets strategist. With investors seeking out safer assets, many jumped into government bond markets in Europe and the United States. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which fell almost 8 basis points on Thursday, were set for their biggest two-week fall since September. In Europe, benchmark issuer Germany’s 10-year bond yield hovered close to 10-week lows struck a day earlier at around 0.52 percent and was on track for its biggest two-week drop since August, down 13 basis points. Many investors also turned to the yen, a currency likely to benefit from a full-fledged trade war. The Japanese currency gained 0.4 percent against the dollar to 104.87 yen, the first time it has been below 105 since November 2016. The Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty, rose 0.3 percent versus the dollar, although it remained flat against the euro. The dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies. “The FX market itself isn’t sure, and its reaction to risk-off and lower bond yields across the board is to buy the yen and the Swiss franc,” Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a daily note. In commodity markets, oil prices recouped overnight losses after Saudi Arabia said that OPEC and Russian-led production curbs introduced in 2017 will need to be extended into 2019 . U.S. crude futures were up 0.8 percent at $64.79 per barrel after losing 1.3 percent on Thursday and Brent gained 0.45 percent to $69.22. Safe-haven spot gold XAU= rose 1 percent to $1,341 an ounce, highest since Feb. 20. Copper and iron prices both fell, as investors bet demand for the metals would suffer in a trade war. MET/L. Daniel Lockyer, senior fund manager at Hawksmoor Investment Management, said financial markets had got ahead of themselves and were failing to price in the risk a number of factors could trigger a sell-off. “It’s not that we thought trade wars would cause the market to fall, it’s that there was too much optimism priced into stock markets,” he said.

2018-03-23,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Belgium’s Elia said on Friday it had decided to exercise its pre-emptive right to buy a 20 percent stake in German high-voltage energy network operator 50Hertz for 976.5 million euros ($1.2 billion), beating China’s State Grid. The purchase, from Australian infrastructure fund IFM Investors, brings Elia’s ownership in 50Hertz to 80 percent, allowing Elia to fully consolidate the asset. IFM will continue to hold the remaining fifth. State Grid’s [STGRD.UL] interest in the 20 percent stake, which first surfaced in December, has been viewed critically by German politicians, amid fears that China is taking control of key technologies while protecting its own companies against foreign takeovers. “We welcome the decision by our majority shareholder Elia to exercise its pre-emption right. This is a strong signal to bring the energy transition forward in Germany as well as in Europe,” 50Hertz Chief Executive Boris Schucht said in a statement. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter, will be financed via 70 percent hybrid and 30 percent senior debt issuance, Elia said, adding it did not expect a change to its credit rating. IFM and Elia bought 50Hertz from Swedish utility Vattenfall [VATN.UL] in 2010 for 810 million euros, meaning IFM was able to sell a 20 percent stake at six time the amount it paid.

2018-03-23,"(Adds detail of Atlas intentions; Noble stock price and market capitalisation; chart) By Gayatri Suroyo JAKARTA, March 23 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s PT Atlas Resources has filed a $260 million lawsuit against troubled commodity trader Noble Group and its chief executive, accusing them of giving false information, the coal company said this week. The lawsuit comes in the same week that Goldilocks Investment Co, a leading shareholder of Noble, also filed a lawsuit against the Singapore-listed commodity trader and some of its former and current senior executives, alleging they inflated Noble’s assets. Atlas is an Indonesian coal company operating on the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. Indonesian coal is the biggest remaining commodity that Noble trades. Atlas said in its stock exchange filing that it filed a suit against Noble’s chief executive William James Randall, Noble Group, and Noble Resources International in the Central Jakarta court on Monday for unlawful acts related to sales of three of Atlas’ subsidiaries. “The defendants have given a series of facts that they clearly knew as false information to the firm (Atlas Resources) that has caused material and immaterial losses,” Atlas said. Noble said it plans to resist any and all allegations or claims made against it. Atlas is seeking to cancel a share sale and purchase agreement, a share subscription agreement and three marketing agreements that were signed on March 2013, according to the Central Jakarta Court. Atlas had total sales of just below 300,000 tonnes in 2016, its website says. Its total assets as of September 2017 were worth $336 million. Atlas declined to comment on Friday. Noble’s shares dropped as low as S$0.087 on Friday, its lowest since 1999, reducing its market capitalisation to just S$133 million ($101 million). Noble said in a statement to the Singapore exchange on Friday that it was aware of the suit but had received no official notice. “As at the time of this announcement, the company has not been served with any writ relating to such a claim and the company is not aware of the grounds for the claim or any further details relating to the same. Nonetheless, the Company intends to vigorously defend any claim if served,” Noble said.

2018-03-23,"HANOI, March 22 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam has ordered Spanish energy firm Repsol to suspend its “Red Emperor” project off the country’s southeastern coast following pressure from China, the BBC reported on Friday. It would be the second time in less than a year that Vietnam has had to cancel a major oil development in the South China Sea under pressure from China. The move comes as Repsol was making final preparations for commercial drilling. A rig, the Ensco 8504, was scheduled to depart from Singapore for the drill site on Thursday, the report said, citing an unnamed energy industry source. The cancellation could cost Repsol and its partners $200 million in sunk investment, according to the BBC. Repsol and PetroVietnam executives could not immediately be reached for comment. The Vietnamese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Red Emperor, known in Vietnamese as the Ca Rong Do field, is part of Block 07/03 in the Nam Con Son basin, 440 km (273 miles) off the coast of Vietnam’s southern city of Vung Tau. The block lies near the U-shaped “nine-dash line” that marks the vast area that China claims in the sea and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions. The field can produce 25,000-30,000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic meters of gas a day, Vietnamese news provider Cafef.vn reported last month. Repsol spent around 33 million euros ($41 million) on exploration in Vietnam last year, according to the company’s 2017 profit and loss statement. The Red Emperor site is considered by Repsol’s top management as one of the company’s future growth projects. Repsol, which has a 51.75 percent stake in the project signed a 384 million euro rental contract for a rig to start work on a Vietnamese site in 2019, according to the statement.

2018-03-23,"* Spot LNG prices fell as demand declined * Feb gas imports by pipeline gained 16 pct on year * Feb fuel exports fell (Re-casts to lead with LNG) BEIJING, March 23 (Reuters) - China’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports fell in February from a record high in January, with growth in demand from industrial users easing as the country enjoyed its traditional week-long Lunar New Year holiday last month. The world’s number 2 economy brought in 3.99 million tonnes of LNG in February, up 69 percent from a year ago, but well down from the previous month’s 5.18 million tonnes, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Friday. Still, for the first two months for the year, LNG arrivals climbed 58 percent from the same period a year earlier to 9.15 million tonnes. Warmer weather will continue to dampen LNG imports, with China’s winter heating season having come to a close in mid-March. “The market needs less gas now,” gas analyst Diao Zhouwei with IHS said, predicting import volumes will decline again this month. Spot LNG prices fell to around 3,000 yuan per tonne ($474 per tonne) this week, slipping from a high of more than 6,000 yuan per tonne in December, Diao said. However, demand from industrial consumers such as fertilizer makers is set to pick up, with some businesses having resumed operations after shutting for more than two months during a winter gas supply crunch. Gas imports through pipelines grew 16 percent in February to 2.9 million tonnes, customs data showed. For the first two months of the year, gas piped in grew 12 percent to 5.5 million tonnes. Meanwhile, China’s monthly diesel exports fell to 1.04 million tonnes in February, the lowest since January 2017, while gasoline exports fell again from the peak level in December.

2018-03-23,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Asia’s oil and gas producers are starting to revive projects aimed at deflating years of ballooning energy imports after new investment dried up following the 2014 industry crisis.  Spending has so far been driven mainly by state oil companies such as India’s ONGC, Thailand’s PTTEP and PetroVietnam, which need to produce more oil and gas to ensure their countries’ energy security, executives said this week during an industry event in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  Asia is by far the biggest, fastest-growing consumer of oil, yet its output is falling faster than in any other region. That mismatch more than doubled Asia’s oil import bill to around $500 billion (354.1 billion pounds) last year, compared with year 2000 levels.  With oil prices back above $60 per barrel and at times flirting with $70 a barrel, oilfield service providers say there is renewed appetite for producers to spend and importers to cut import bills by investing in production. [O/R] “Asia is a net importer of energy. I think there’s a strong desire from Southeast Asian organizations to change that trend. We’ll see a lot more potential developments here to try to balance that equation,” said Ian Prescott, vice president for Asia with U.S. engineering company McDermott.  Fifty oil and gas fields in Southeast Asia, with a collective 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent in resources, will likely be approved for development between 2018 and 2020, according to consultancy Rystad Energy, requiring some $28 billion of capital expenditure from final investment decision (FID) to first production.  In one sign of revival, Abu Dhabi-owned Mubadala Petroleum, Malaysia’s state-owned Petronas [PETR.UL] and Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell agreed to spend $1 billion on a shallow-water gas project in Malaysia this week. In India, changes to gas pricing policies revived activities in its eastern deepwater fields, led by ONGC and a joint venture between Reliance Industries and BP. “India has waited too long to enter deepwater. Deepwater development makes more sense for the country (India) than importing LNG at $8 per million British thermal units,” Ashish Bhandari, a vice president at GE-owned oil service company Baker Hughes, said at the OTC Asia conference.  In Southeast Asia, PetroVietnam is developing a large gas field known as Block B, while Thailand’s PTTEP is on the hunt for more gas supplies in the region to meet demand in Thailand and Myanmar. Despite the uptick in activity, exploration for new oil and gas remains lower in Asia than elsewhere, especially onshore North America and in the Atlantic basin.  Kevin Robinson, vice president of Malaysia’s oil and gas service company Sapura Energy, said the main factors deterring investment in Asia were tough fiscal regimes, cumbersome bureaucracies, and maturing fields with limited future reserves.  “It’s a reality check for governments in Asia to look at how much investment they are getting, and how they need to improve their fiscal terms to attract more investment,” Robinson said. ONGC’s director of offshore, Rajesh Kakkar, said the “easy oil is gone ... what is left is deepwater, high pressure, and high temperature”, making extraction more costly.  But given competition from cheap producers in the Middle East and soaring output from shale drillers in the United States, Petronas’ Chief Executive Officer Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said there was pressure to keep costs low. “While oil prices are showing signs of recovery, the sustainability of these prices remains to be seen ... If we don’t keep these escalating costs in check, the industry runs the risk of negating the value we have gained from intensive cost efficiency efforts over the last 3 years.” Reporting by Florence Tan, Emily Chow and A.

2018-03-23,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s president on Thursday defended his decision to open the energy sector against attacks from the man currently favourite to succeed him, saying a rollback of the measure could cost the country billions of dollars in lost investment. The 2013-14 legislative overhaul that ended state oil firm Pemex’s decades-long monopoly was the centrepiece of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s economic agenda, and leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is leading polls for the July 1 presidential election, has threatened to unpick it. Speaking in the oil-rich state of Veracruz, Pena Nieto said those calling to walk back the reform risked condemning Mexico to an “obsolete” economic model, without naming Lopez Obrador. “To cancel the energy reform is practically to make disappear the investments that today require certainty,” Pena Nieto said at the inauguration of a technology centre. “We want ... the private sector to invest, for it to generate returns for Mexico and its people,” he added. Pena Nieto said over 800,000 jobs and $200 billion (£141.6 billion) worth of investment ultimately depended on the energy reform’s success. He is barred by law from seeking re-election. Lopez Obrador has pledged to review the oil and gas contracts awarded under Pena Nieto’s government if elected, and on Wednesday evening said his administration would consider unwinding the energy reform legislatively. Pena Nieto’s reform changed the constitution to grant private operators oil and gas exploration and production rights in a bid to reverse years of declining crude output. However, the reform coincided with a sharp decline in oil prices, and the government has said it will take time for the shake-up of the energy sector to bear fruit. Pledging to reduce Mexico’s dependence on policies “sent from abroad”, Lopez Obrador has attacked Pena Nieto’s economic agenda on the grounds that corruption is widespread. Corruption scandals, lacklustre growth and rising violence have battered the government’s reputation. Later on Thursday, Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell told local radio that to undo the energy reform would be “extremely harmful”, and would make Mexico more dependent on natural gas imports, and deny it major tax revenues. Joaquin Coldwell noted the only body authorized to revoke oil and gas contracts - provided serious violations are shown to have occurred - is the industry regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission, not the president.

2018-03-23,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) will not appeal against the U.S. trade commission ruling that allows Canada’s Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) to sell its newest jets to U.S. airlines without heavy duties, a Boeing spokesman said on Thursday. The decision by Boeing puts the trade challenge to rest. A Canadian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Boeing’s decision was “good news”. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) unanimously voted in January to reject Boeing’s complaint and discarded a Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of the 110-to-130-seat Bombardier CSeries jets for five years. The ITC had widely been expected to side with Chicago-based Boeing, the world’s largest maker of jetliners, which accused Bombardier of dumping the planes, or selling them below cost, in the U.S. market. However, the ITC said it rejected placing duties on Bombardier jets partly because Boeing had lost no sales or revenue when Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) ordered the aircraft in 2016 from the Canadian planemaker. The ITC ruled the 110-seat CSeries jets ordered by Delta and Boeing’s smallest 737 MAX 7 plane do not compete. The smaller end of the jet market is an increasing focus for the major manufacturers. Airbus SE (AIR.PA) has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries in a deal expected to close later this year, while Boeing is in tie-up talks with Bombardier’s Brazilian rival Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA). The Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the decision not to appeal.  It was not yet clear how Boeing’s decision will impact the planemaker’s relationship with the Canadian government, which is holding a competition for fighter jets worth between C$15 billion and $C19 billion.

Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, although the measures have a 30-day consultation period. Investors fear that the U.S. measures could escalate into a trade war, with potentially dire consequences for the global economy. China unveiled plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation against U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium products. “The economic impact on both China and the U.S. will be determined by what form the tariffs end up taking. The effects are likely to be felt more strongly in the U.S. and  increase both consumer and producer prices,” wrote Hannah Anderson, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “The equity market will bear the brunt of the market reaction. Most impacted will be the U.S., Korea, and Taiwan as companies domiciled in these markets make up a significant portion of the global production chain of Chinese exports.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tracked a large overnight drop in Wall Street shares and fell 2.4 percent. Australian stocks lost 1.9 percent and Japan’s Nikkei dropped 3.2 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI retreated 2.3 percent and Taiwan shares slid 2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 3.6 percent and Shanghai lost 2.8 percent. The Dow shed 2.9 percent, the S&P 500 dropped 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq fell 2.4 percent on Thursday. As equities took a beating, the yen, often sought in times of market turmoil, rallied against the dollar. The greenback fell roughly 0.5 percent to as low as 104.635 yen, its weakest since November 2016. The dollar was down more than 1 percent on the week. “In the longer run, protectionist policies touted by the United States could be watered down, in turn limiting the negative effect on trade and the global economy,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, referring to the decision by the United States to exempt some countries from steel and aluminium tariffs. “But until the United States makes such concessions, global stocks will be under pressure and the yen will appreciate, especially if China decides to confront the U.S. measures.” The euro was 0.2 percent higher at $1.2352. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies slipped 0.25 percent to 89.649. It has lost roughly 0.6 percent on the week, weighed down by a steady decline in U.S. Treasury yields. Yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell 7.5 basis points overnight as bond prices rose on jitters gripping the broader financial markets. The yield stood at 2.802 percent after going as low as 2.799 percent the previous day. Thursday’s fall was the 10-year note’s biggest decline in yield since September 2017. Oil prices recouped overnight losses after Saudi Arabia said that OPEC and Russian-led production curbs introduced in 2017 will need to be extended into 2019.

2018-03-23,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May urged EU leaders to seize on “a new dynamic” in Brexit talks and solve differences over a future border with Ireland to agree a deal on their future partnership. Leaders of the European Union are expected to sign off on Friday on an offer of a transition period and set out their terms for forthcoming talks on post-Brexit trade. At the end of a Thursday night summit dinner, May took to the floor to call on them not to squander that opportunity to reach an overall deal. By securing agreement on a 21-month transition period to allow businesses to prepare after Britain leaves the bloc in March next year, May now faces possibly the hardest part of a negotiation that has already shaken her grip on power. “We have the chance, now, to create a new dynamic in the talks to work together to explore workable solutions — in Northern Ireland, in our future security cooperation and in order to ensure the future prosperity of all our people,” she told the leaders at the end of a dinner of scallops and lamb. “This is an opportunity it is our duty to take and to enter into with energy and ambition,” she added, according to a senior British official. May hopes the expected agreement by EU leaders on Friday will mark the start of the end of punishing talks, during which she has been criticised by some in her own party for giving too much away to Brussels and failing to take a tough enough stance.  Some critics said the tone had been set for those talks when the lights went out at a meeting she had called with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss an attack on a former Moscow spy in the English city of Salisbury which Britain has blamed on Russia. May, under pressure from Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party for settling for a standstill transition with the EU when almost nothing changes, has long wanted to discuss future ties with the bloc, a conversation her government believes can settle some of the thorniest issues. One such problem is the border between Northern Ireland and  EU member Ireland, which has been all but invisible since a peace agreement was signed to end decades of sectarian conflict in the North.  Both London and Brussels agree there should be no hard border, but they differ over how that can be achieved. May has suggested a customs partnership or a streamlined  arrangement, where jointly implemented measures and the use of technology minimise friction. EU officials reply by saying the easiest way to secure that would be to stay in its customs union — something the British leader has ruled out. The standoff has left a backstop agreement — that could see the British province of Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs union — still in the transition text, although subject to negotiators finding an ‘operational’ compromise. That, for some Brexit campaigners, is a major concern. But a senior British official voiced confidence the difficulties over the border could be resolved now that the two sides were talking about the future.  “Once we move on to this stage of being able to talk about the future relationship, that is where we believe the solution to the Irish border will be found,” he told reporters. “It will be a solution in terms of our entire relationship with the EU.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Alastair Macdonald",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-may/seize-on-new-dynamic-to-agree-brexit-deal-may-tells-eu-idUKL8N1R504A,23 Mar 2018,"British Prime Minister

2018-03-23,"* Oil shakes off looming U.S./China trade stand-off * Brent to rise to $75/b by Q3 on strong demand - Morgan Stanley By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, pushed up by Saudi statements that OPEC and Russian led production curbs that were introduced in 2017 will need to be extended into 2019 in order to tighten the market. The rise in oil prices defied global stock markets and other commodities, which slumped on the back of worries about a trade stand-off between the United States and China. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China, while China unveiled plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $65.09 a barrel at 0045 GMT, up 79 cents, or 1.2 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $69.64 per barrel, up 73 cents, or 1.1 percent. Traders said the driver for crude futures was a statement by Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who said on Thursday that OPEC members will need to continue coordinating with Russia and other non-OPEC oil-producing countries on supply curbs in 2019 to reduce global oil inventories. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader, as well as a group of non-OPEC countries led by Russia, struck a production supply agreement in January 2017 to remove 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from global markets and end a supply glut. The pact is set to expire at the end of this year, but Saudi Arabia now seems to be pushing for an extension. “We know for sure that we still have some time to go before we bring inventories down to the level we consider normal and we will identify that by mid-year when we meet in Vienna,” Falih told Reuters in an interview in Washington. “And then we will hopefully by year-end identify the mechanism by which we will work in 2019.” Although analysts said the potential stand-off between the United States and China could also hit oil markets, for now most said demand looked healthy. Morgan Stanley also cited a pick-up in seasonal demand in the coming month and geopolitical risk as potential supports for oil prices, “We are only 3-4 weeks away from peak refinery maintenance, after which crude and product demand should accelerate ... Global inventories are already at the bottom end of the five-year range. With the inventory cushion largely gone, oil prices will likely be more sensitive to geopolitical risk factors,” the U.S. bank said. “There are sufficient reasons to expect oil prices to strengthen further from here, and we stick with our (Brent) $75 per barrel call for Q3,” Morgan Stanley said.

2018-03-23,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Amnesty International on Friday denounced Western arms sales to Saudi Arabia and its allies in a coalition battling the Houthis in Yemen, saying such traffic made a “mockery” of a global arms trade treaty. The rights group accused both the Saudi-led coalition forces and the Iran-allied Houthis of committing potential war crimes in the three-year conflict. More than 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen since March 2015 when Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Muslim Arab states launched a military campaign against the Houthis, a group of Shi’ite fighters who had seized the capital and forced President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi to flee. “There is extensive evidence that irresponsible arms flows to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition have resulted in enormous harm to Yemeni civilians,” Lynn Maalouf, Director of Research for the Middle East at Amnesty International, said in a statement.  “But this has not deterred the USA, the UK and other states, including France, Spain and Italy, from continuing transfers of billions of dollars’ worth of such arms. As well as devastating civilian lives, this makes a mockery of the global Arms Trade Treaty.” The organisation said it had documented 36 coalition air strikes since 2015 that appeared to have violated international law, adding that some may amount to war crimes. The documented attacks had killed 513 civilians, including at least 157 children, and wounded 379 others, according to Amnesty.  It said the Houthis and their allies had conducted arbitrary arrests and detentions of opponents, and that scores of men and women had been subjected to enforced disappearances and harsh sentences following unfair trails. Saudi Arabia and its allies have repeatedly denied allegations of war crimes and say their campaign is directed against Houthi fighters, and not civilians. The Houthi movement has also denied accusations of war crimes. Amnesty said that as the conflict enters its fourth year it shows no real signs of abating and that all sides were impeding the delivery of humanitarian aid to at least 22.2 million people in need of assistance and more than one million suffering from suspected cases of cholera. The rights group said that despite the loosening of a blockade on Yemeni ports imposed by the Saudi-led coalition, it continues to impose restrictions on aid and commercial imports of essential goods. Two rights groups in France said on Friday they would take legal action against the French government unless it halts sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates within two months. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the Yemen conflict with President Donald Trump this week during a visit to the United States. U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told Prince Mohammed on Thursday that there was an urgent need to end the war.
