2018-05-01,"(Adds details on output forecast, share buyback plan, CEO comment) May 1 (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp topped Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit due to higher crude prices and lower costs and the shale oil producer raised its annual production forecast on Tuesday. Oil prices, which are trading around $70 a barrel, helped the company sell oil at $63.66 per barrel, up from $50.34 a year earlier, despite oil output dropping 19 percent in the quarter. Total costs fell 35.5 percent to $2.49 billion in the quarter. Anadarko increased its full-year production guidance to 658,000-685,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) from 652,000 - 679,000 boe/d. The company, which had increased its share buyback program to $3 billion in February, said it would complete the program by mid-2018. “We will consider expanding this program further should free cash flow from the current operating environment continue to increase,” Chief Executive Officer Al Walker said in a statement. Anadarko, like its peers, has been under increasing shareholder pressure to keep a lid on costs and increase returns. The oil producer reported net profit attributable to shareholders of $121 million, or 22 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $318 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the Woodlands, Texas-based company earned 52 cents share, higher than the average analyst estimate of 40 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company were marginally lower at $66.50 in after-market trading.

2018-05-01,"GENEVA(Reuters) - India should follow China’s example and clean up the air in its cities, which are among the world’s worst for outdoor pollution, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. The WHO’s database of more than 4,300 cities showed Indian cities such as New Delhi, Varanasi and Patna were among the most polluted, based on the amount of particulate matter under 2.5 micrograms found in every cubic meter of air. Chinese cities such as Xingtai and Shijiazhuang and the Saudi refining hub at Jubail were also highly polluted, but the data for those places was 4-5 years old, and Maria Neira, WHO’s head of public health, said China had made big improvements that India should follow. “There is a big step at the government level (in China) declaring war on air pollution,” Neira said. “One of the reasons for that is that the health argument was very strongly presented, and the fact that the citizens were really breathing air that was totally unacceptable.” “We would be very happy if we would see a similar movement now in India which is one of the countries for which we are particularly concerned, although there are good initiatives which can be put in place quickly, still the levels are very high and we would like to see a similar decision and leadership.” The WHO says nine out of 10 people on the planet breathe polluted air, and it kills 7 million people each year, almost all of them in poor countries in Asia and Africa. About a quarter of deaths from heart disease, stroke and lung cancer can be attributed to air pollution, the WHO says. Globally, outdoor air pollution has remained high and largely unchanged in the past six years, while household air pollution has got worse in many poorer countries, as people continue to cook with solid fuel or kerosene, instead of cleaner fuels such as gas and electricity.  “The transition to clean fuels and technology in the home, clean household energy, is too slow. It’s been three decades and we still have three billion people primarily relying on (polluting) fuels and technologies, and that’s for cooking alone,” said WHO technical officer Heather Adair-Rohani. WHO’s global assessment is based on satellite data and modeling overlaid on the database of cities, which is self-selecting because it is based on voluntary reporting, with numbers that have been hugely revised since the previous report.  The most polluted city in 2016’s report, Zabol in Iran, has had its pollution level cut fourfold in the latest version of the database, and now appears to be cleaner than Australia’s capital Canberra. “The data we are presenting today is I think the most accurate you can expect at the moment,” Neira said.       (For a graphic on 'Map showing air pollution in various towns and cities' click tmsnrt.rs/2JHi39m) Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/health-pollution/through-a-fog-of-data-air-of-indian-cities-looks-dirtiest-idUKL8N1S82P7,01 May 2018,"India should follow China's example

2018-05-01,"(Adds company comment, background on refinery) SAO PAULO, May 1 (Reuters) - A Brazilian federal judge on Tuesday upheld a state court decision handed down in February that forced Norsk Hydro ASA to cut output at a major alumina refinery, the latest blow for the Norwegian company’s operations in Brazil. In February, a court in Pará, the northern state where the Alunorte refinery is located, ordered the refinery to reduce its output by 50 percent, following allegations by prosecutors of a waste spill at one of Alunorte’s bauxite refuse deposits. The company has since admitted it discharged untreated rain and surface water into a river, which it called “unacceptable,” but has denied significant parts of prosecutors’ allegations and has said there was no evidence of a lasting environmental impact. Alunorte is the world’s largest alumina refinery, transforming bauxite to alumina, which is turned into aluminum at huge smelters. Founded in 1995, Alunorte produces 5.8 million metric tonnes of alumina a year, according to Norsk Hydro’s website. In his decision on Tuesday upholding the lower court’s ruling, federal Judge Arthur Pinheiro Chaves said that failure to honor the conditions set by the courts would result in a daily fine of 1 million reais ($285,000). A spokesman for Norsk Hydro said the company had not formally been notified of the decision and would analyze the case before issuing comment. The spokesman added, however, that the company was already complying with the state court decision and was open to dialogue with stakeholders at the municipal, state and federal levels. In April, the company sued state prosecutors in Para in a bid to spur a new study to assess the spill. Reporting by Gram Slattery and Flavia Bohone; Editing by

2018-05-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose on Tuesday, helped by optimism over U.S. trade negotiations, while the dollar broke into positive territory for the year. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said Mexico will respond to the latest U.S. proposals to rework automotive sector rules under a revised North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) when ministers meet next week. Also, U.S. President Donald Trump’s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said he hoped to further open China’s economy to U.S. companies. The comments helped reverse early losses in stocks in the S&P 500, though the Dow ended lower. “There is a certain level of fear that has seeped into this market,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “But there are positive outlooks out there on trade.” Apple shares rose about 4 percent after the closing bell after the company beat revenue and profit expectations in its March quarter. The shares ended the regular session up 2.3 percent. Technology sector results so far – at least from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Samsung and SAP – have broadly beaten forecasts for the first quarter, and overall aggregate U.S. earnings growth is tracking seven-year highs of almost 25 percent. The recent rise in oil prices fueled expectations the Federal Reserve could flag more interest rate hikes at its policy meeting this week. The dollar attracted attention as it turned positive for 2018 .DXY just ahead of a statement Wednesday from the Fed. While U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates, investors will be on the lookout for any clues on the outlook for rates or the economy. A divergence between growth and the rate outlook versus those of other countries prompted investors to push the currency higher. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.68 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.72 percent to $1.199. “We’re pretty much back to where we were at the beginning of the year, so a lot of the dollar weakness has been pretty much wiped out,” said Sireen Harajli, foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 64.1 points, or 0.27 percent, to 24,099.05, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 6.75 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,654.8 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 64.44 points, or 0.91 percent, to 7,130.70.

2018-05-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A biofuels trade group asked a federal court on Tuesday to rule whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency violated the law in granting a growing number of small refineries exemptions from renewable fuel laws, according to a court filing. The Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA), which counts oil major BP Plc as a member, submitted a petition to review the agency’s waiver decisions in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington DC.  “ABFA members are concerned that Administrator (Scott) Pruitt is granting these exemptions in an arbitrary and capricious manner to undisclosed parties behind closed doors with no accountability for its decision-making process,” Michael McAdams, the head of the trade group, said in a statement. The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit is the latest move in the biofuel industry’s fight with the EPA over the agency’s expansion of the small-refinery hardship exemption from the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).  The RFS requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel each year or purchase blending credits from other companies - a policy intended to provide a boost to Midwestern corn growers, reduce pollution and cut fuel imports.  In the past, the EPA has issued between six and eight waivers from the RFS per year to refining operations of less than 75,000 barrels per day that can demonstrate they are struggling financially to comply. The EPA has said it has granted more than two dozen waivers for 2017 but has declined to name the recipients. The surge in approvals comes after a federal judge in August said the EPA had been using criteria that was too strict in denying exemptions. Biofuel groups say the EPA is using the court decision as a rationale to gut the RFS, and that some of the nation’s largest refining companies have secured exemptions.  Reuters reported in April that Andeavor, one of America’s biggest refining companies, which reported about $1.5 billion in net profit last year, was among companies that received hardship waivers. An Andeavor spokeswoman Destin Singleton declined to comment for that article. The EPA also granted a waiver to a refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, according to two industry sources briefed on the matter.  The EPA keeps the names of the recipients secret, arguing it is confidential business information.

2018-05-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slid more than 1 percent on Tuesday as the dollar remained near a four-month high, but worries that U.S. President Donald Trump will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal underpinned the market. The U.S. dollar surged into positive territory for 2018 and broke past key levels against several currencies as a divergence between growth and the interest rate outlook versus other countries spurred investors to chase the currency higher. [USD/] A strong dollar makes greenback-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies. “The strength of the dollar is where the pressure is coming from,” said Gene McGillian, vice president at Tradition Energy. The risk of the U.S. pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, resulting in sanctions on the producing nation, has already largely been priced in, underpinning the market, he said.  Brent crude for July delivery settled at $73.13 a barrel, down $1.56 or 2.1 percent in the session. The June contract expired on Monday, settling up 53 cents at $75.17. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery settled down $1.32, or nearly 2 percent, at $67.25 a barrel. Crude extended losses briefly in post-settlement trade, after industry trade group the American Petroleum Institute released weekly inventory figures showing a larger-than-expected crude stockpile build.  Oil prices rose on Monday as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented what he called evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program. Tehran has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons.  But analysts said the lack of a smoking gun took some of the heat out of oil prices.  Olivier Jakob of PetroMatrix said the announcement “did not bring anything new to the table,” and the market therefore shed some of the previous day’s gains.  “It shows how much the market has already priced in the expectation that Trump will not extend the waivers,” he said.  Trump has given Britain, France and Germany a May 12 deadline to fix what he views as the flaws of the 2015 nuclear deal, or he will reimpose sanctions.     Still, crude prices were within striking distance of a more than three-year high hit in late April, and analysts said the market is sensitive to any developments on Iranian sanctions. Growing U.S. crude production and stockpiles have weighed on the market. Ahead of weekly data, crude stockpiles were forecast  building last week while refined product inventories were seen declining, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday. [EIA/S] The API released its data at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Tuesday, and the official government report is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday.

2018-05-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California and a group of 16 other states on Tuesday challenged the Trump administration’s decision to revise strict U.S. vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency rules put in place under former President Barack Obama. The 17 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision in April to declare U.S. vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency rules through 2025 “not appropriate.” The legal challenge comes as Democrats and environmental advocates vow to aggressively challenge the Trump administration’s plans to weaken the vehicle rules touted by the Obama administration as one of its biggest climate actions. EPA chief Scott Pruitt said standards on model year 2022 to 2025 vehicles should be revised, reversing a decision on tighter standards put in place by the Obama administration in January 2017. California Governor Jerry Brown announced the suit’s filing in Sacramento, accusing the EPA of “breaking the law” and putting children at risk by boosting asthma-inducing tailpipe emissions. “This is about health, it’s about life and death,” Brown said. He said Pruitt and President Donald Trump “want people to buy more gas, create more pollution.” The U.S. Transportation Department has drafted a proposal likely to be made public this month that would freeze vehicle requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. The proposal could formally go to the White House for review later this week.  Reuters has reported the draft would assert that a 1975 law bars California from imposing its own state emissions rules, as it has long done nonetheless under a series of Clean Air Act waivers. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Tuesday the administration was reviewing the lawsuit but declined to comment.   Automakers including General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp want the Trump administration and California to reach agreement to extend national standards. New York, Illinois, Washington, Massachusetts, Iowa, Virginia, New Jersey, Maryland, other states and the District of Columbia are among those suing. Brown said the states and DC cover 140 million Americans, or 40 percent of the country. The states argue that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, failed to follow its own regulations, and violated the Clean Air Act.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said the “Trump administration conducted a phony study” to justify less rigid emission rules. The Obama rules adopted in 2012 sought to double average fleet-wide vehicle fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025, but included an evaluation due by April 2018 to determine if the rules were appropriate. Adjusting for a shift in consumer demand to larger vehicles, the current rules are projected to hike fuel efficiency to a fleetwide average of 46.8 miles per gallon by 2026, according to a letter sent Tuesday by Senator Tom Carper to Pruitt and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Carper said that, according to a draft proposal he obtained, the administration favors freezing standards through 2026 and that would result in a fleetwide average of 37 mpg by 2026. Carper said the draft shows the administration’s preferred alternative would result in Americans using 206 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 versus the current standards. Automakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and the shift in U.S. consumer preferences to bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. The Trump administration plans to argue the weaker rules will lead to cheaper vehicles, boost sales and employment and improve safety by prodding faster turnover of older vehicles, people briefed on the matter and Carper’s letter said. In March 2017, Trump suggested he would soften the mandates. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he told autoworkers. California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols told Reuters last month that a group of states was considering the legal move, but it does not mean they could not still try to reach agreement with automakers and the federal government. “We can sue and talk at the same time,” Nichols said. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the states’ lawsuit and said the Trump administration could not stop Americans from working to improve the climate. “The EPA would have better luck trying to require horse-and-buggies than they would trying to stop the push for cleaner vehicles,” Bloomberg said in a statement.

2018-05-01,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) has proposed a $2 billion share buyback to improve returns, alongside plans to cut total debt and trading liabilities by a minimum of 500 billion roubles ($7.9 billion) this year. Rosneft said in a statement on Tuesday that it would reduce debt partly by selling non-core assets, adding that the proposed share buyback programme would be carried out between 2018 and 2020 through open market repurchases.  “The Company continues to demonstrate robust financial results and proposed new initiatives will enable us to improve the focus on the business using core strengths that will result in the enhancement of shareholder returns,” Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin said. The proposals are part of the “Rosneft-2022” strategy and are focused on increasing profitability and returns on its existing assets, the oil company, in which BP has a 19.75 percent stake, said.  Rosneft has been expanding aggressively, investing billions of dollars in foreign assets and last month Moscow-based brokerage Aton described it as the “most leveraged oil company in Russia”. Rosneft’s most recently published estimate for its net debt was 2.216 trillion roubles, excluding prepayments of foreign firms, as of the end of June last year. “We are strong believers in the fundamental value of Rosneft that is not fully appreciated by today’s volatile equity markets,” Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, added. Rosneft also said that enhancing its investment governance, project management practices and improving procurement would mean a 20 percent decrease in its capital expenditures guidance for 2018 to 800 billion roubles. This would help it achieve a sustained cash flow impact within “Rosneft-2022”. The company also said it would achieve an improvement in its working capital position of 200 billion roubles by the end of 2018 through “a number of initiatives in the trading business and the procurement function”. It said it would carry out a review of its asset portfolio, focused on decreasing the share of “tail and non-core assets” and disposing of these should provide incremental net cash flow to shareholders, Rosneft said. Rosneft has filed legal challenges in European courts against EU sanctions imposed in 2014 and 2015 over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis.

2018-05-01,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The incoming boss of BASF (BASFn.DE) has thrown his weight behind the chemical titan’s contentious strategy of keeping divergent businesses folded into one company, at a time when its major rivals such as DowDuPont are breaking themselves up. The comments from Martin Brudermueller, who will take over as CEO on Friday, provide clarity on a key strategic issue that is dividing investors, in marked contrast to predecessor Kurt Bock who would not be drawn on which path he favored.  The German group has grown from a 19th century indigo dye workshop to a diversified juggernaut worth $95 billion. It is the only major Western chemicals player banking on an integrated value chain - which it dubs “Verbund” - where a company owns businesses throughout the production process.  “We often hear the Verbund getting criticized for being too rigid. That’s not true,” said 56-year-old Brudermueller.  “If you have everything under one roof, you can coordinate things much better, that is the sense in which we will develop it further. You wouldn’t normally want to sell attractive businesses that are growing,” he told Reuters and other reporters in remarks released late on Tuesday.  At its Ludwigshafen headquarters and at five other hubs abroad, BASF runs close-knit networks of chemical reactors that churn out products as diverse as basic commodities, coatings, vitamins, drug ingredients and engineering plastics. Bock, when asked in February whether BASF would continue to have diverse businesses under one roof or was considering other options, said the company might learn from what rivals did but did not say which path he favored. Both strategies have potential advantages; break-ups can create more focused individual companies and allow stronger units to attract investors unshackled from weaker ones, while an integrated model can reduce costs. U.S. rival DowDuPont (DWDP.N) is planning to break up into a Materials Science division that relies on in-house basic petrochemicals plants and a Specialty Products unit selling more differentiated and complex materials. A third spin-off will focus on agriculture. In other recent separation deals in the industry, Bayer (BAYGn.DE) spun off its Covestro plastics unit and is now selling down the shares, Air Products spun-off specialty chemicals unit Versum (VSM.N) and coatings group Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS) is selling its specialty chemicals division.  BASF competes with DowDuPont in areas such as pesticides, engineering plastics, nutrition, insulation foams and petrochemicals. Its rival’s three-way split will restore BASF’s position as the world’s largest chemical maker but some investors and analysts would rather see it lose that crown. Patrick Jahnke, portfolio manager at Deka Investments, which owns BASF stock, said he favored the firm selling its upstream petrochemical assets, saying the benefits of physical proximity to downstream operations could be shared with a new owner. “You can sell the assets but the factory remains in place,” Jahnke said. “There are many who would pay a high price (for upstream BASF assets). Private equity would run the business with higher debt and optimized for cash flows and would arrive at a better profitability,” he added. Upstream refers to basic petrochemicals, and downstream to more complex specialty chemicals. A portfolio manager at a top 20 BASF shareholder, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to comment publicly on the investment, also saw the merits of a break-up. “Downstream, speciality chems could work separately,” the manager said. “To de-clutter and reduce complexity ... tends to increase multiples and returns, but German companies are not well known for it.” BASF has said that sharing logistics, excess energy and by-products within its chemical complexes saves it more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) per year. There are also supporters of the integrated approach among BASF’s shareholders.  Arne Rautenberg, of Union Investment, said there was still a lot of value in the model. “The results this year wouldn’t have been good without the basic chemicals assets,” he said. Any move to separating them from the rest “would very much surprise me and I wouldn’t be excited”, he added.  BASF has been a tale of two sectors over the past year. Supply bottlenecks at rivals and strong industrial demand have flung BASF’s basic chemicals business into a surprise upward cycle. Meanwhile, margins of its more complex, specialty products, the group’s designated growth drivers, have been squeezed by higher raw materials prices.  “If upstream strength dissipates and the downstream margin struggles continue, then we think investor focus will turn to portfolio questions,” HSBC analyst Sriharsha Pappu said in a recent research note. If allowed to strike out on their own, BASF units making construction chemicals, coatings and catalytic converters could bolster their earnings and fetch better trading multiples on the stock market, the HSBC analyst said.  Brudermueller, a BASF veteran, is currently chief technology officer and deputy CEO at the firm, which is due to report first-quarter results on Friday. He said that his focus would be on new technologies after taking over from CEO Bock, who by contrast had been the company’s finance chief before taking the helm and has a background in business administration.  The CEO-designate cited cathode materials for car batteries as one area of focus, and also using BASF’s new supercomputer to speed up discovery of new compounds. “The fact that I have a background in technology and science will result in us having a change in perspective,” he said, adding that he would provide an update on BASF’s strategy towards the end of the year.

2018-05-01,"May 1 (Reuters) - Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP) said on Monday it filed with Pennsylvania utility regulators on Friday to restart its Sunoco Mariner East 1 natural gas liquids pipeline and hopes the line will return to service this week. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission suspended operations on the Mariner East 1 pipeline on March 7 after sinkholes were discovered near the project. “Our integrity testing for (Mariner East 1) is complete and has demonstrated that the line has been and will continue to be safely operated, as we have previously stated,” Lisa Dillinger, a spokeswoman for ETP, said in an email. The shutdown forced shippers, including U.S. gas producers Range Resources Corp and Antero Resources Corp, to find another route for their liquids and is likely causing more ethane to be injected into the region’s natural gas pipelines, according to analysts. One other route for the liquids is Enterprise Products Partners LP’s ATEX pipeline, which delivers liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to the Mont Belvieu storage facility in Texas, according to analysts. Mariner East 1 can transport up to 70,000 bpd of propane and ethane from the Marcellus and Utica basins in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including ETP’s Marcus Hook industrial complex near Philadelphia. Separately, ETP is building the $2.5 billion Mariner East 2 pipeline, which will boost total capacity of the Mariner East project to 345,000 bpd and open the pipe to suppliers in Ohio and West Virginia. Since May 2017, Mariner East 2 has received 51 notices of violation from Pennsylvania regulators due in part to inadvertent returns or spills. Delays related to those spills, among other things, have pushed the expected startup of Mariner East 2 from the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the second quarter of 2018. Some analysts, however, do not expect Mariner East 2 to enter service until the third quarter. In an analyst call following the release of its earnings  in April, Antero said if Mariner East 2 does not come online when expected and is delayed until the end of the year, it would cost the company about $30 million in cash flow.

2018-05-01,"* U.S. stocks lower in late morning trading * Dollar breaks into positive territory for year * Oil falls after recent strong gains * Apple results in focus after reports of weak iPhone demand (Updates with early U.S. markets’ activity, changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - The dollar broke into positive territory for the year and U.S. bond yields inched higher again on Tuesday as the recent rise in oil prices fueled expectations the Federal Reserve could flag more interest rate hikes at its policy meeting this week. U.S. stocks fell in late morning trading as the latest batch of earnings from companies such as Pfizer and Tapestry , formerly Coach, disappointed investors, and as energy shares fell. Apple’s quarterly results are due after Wall Street closes and will be a big focus after several weeks of speculation about ebbing smartphone demand based on selective reports from companies in its supply chain. Technology sector results so far – at least from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Samsung and SAP – have broadly beaten forecasts for Q1 and the overall aggregate U.S. earnings growth is tracking seven-year highs of almost 25 percent. The dollar attracted attention as it turned positive for 2018 just ahead of a two-day Fed meeting that is expected to pave the way for another two or even three U.S. rate hikes this year. A divergence between growth and the rate outlook versus those of other countries prompted investors to push the currency higher. The dollar index rose 0.65 percent, with the euro down 0.65 percent to $1.1998. “We’re pretty much back to where we were at the beginning of the year, so a lot of the dollar weakness has been pretty much wiped out,” said Sireen Harajli, foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258.77 points, or 1.07 percent, to 23,904.38, the S&P 500 lost 13.31 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,634.74 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.74 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,058.52. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.54 percent. May Day holidays across Asia and Europe meant trading was thinner than usual. For Europe’s stocks followers, only London’s FTSE and Denmark’s bourse were open. U.S. Treasury yields rose, with prices pressured ahead of a quarterly refunding announcement. The U.S. Treasury is scheduled to announce its findings on a refunding survey on Wednesday, with analysts projecting an increase in auction sizes, or new issuance at different points on the yield curve. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 10/32 in price to yield 2.9718 percent, from 2.936 percent late on Monday. Brent oil prices eased off four-month highs of just over $75 a barrel set on Monday on worries that U.S. President Donald Trump may pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and thereby bring back sanctions on its oil output. The White House had said on Monday that information provided by Israel on Iran’s nuclear program had provided “new and compelling details”. A high-level U.S. trade delegation will also be in Beijing for meetings later this week, amid lingering worries about a possible trade war between the world’s top two economies. U.S. crude fell 1.23 percent to $67.73 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.72, down 1.3 percent on the day. Gold slid to a two-month low as the dollar strengthened. Spot gold was down 0.7 percent at $1,306.26 an ounce, off an earlier low of $1,305.36, its weakest since March 1. Additional report by Karen Brettell in New York, Marc Jones

2018-05-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - Uber’s licence in the southern English coastal city of Brighton will not be renewed, the local council said on Tuesday, adding the taxi app is not “fit and proper” and citing concerns over a data breach and the use of drivers from outside the area.

2018-05-01,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria could eventually be in the market for up to 10 new or used fighter jets to replace its ageing Soviet-designed MiG-29s, Defence Minister Krasimir Karakachanov said on Tuesday. NATO has encouraged its eastern members, such as Bulgaria which joined in 2004, to develop, buy and operate new alliance weaponry compatible with older Soviet-era systems. But the question of which warplanes to buy has been vexing successive governments in Bulgaria for more than a decade, and Karakachanov said it could opt for more than the eight aircraft laid down in a plan approved by parliament in 2016 but never implemented. “We have made a change,” Karakachanov said. “We have written a minimum of eight in the new project. There are options, when negotiating, for the number to be 8, 9 or 10.” Karakachanov, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, did not say which aircraft the government should consider. “I will not go into the details of the conversations that we have held in advance or what kind of proposals we have received,” he said.   Some eastern European NATO allies that were once Soviet satellites still rely on Russian warplanes - two-thirds of Poland’s military equipment dates from the Soviet era, for example. Under the 2016 plan, Bulgaria was supposed to acquire the eight jets between 2018 and 2020 in a 1.5 billion lev ($923 million) deal to improve its compliance with NATO standards. The process, however, hit procedural snags and is expected to start almost from scratch at a government meeting next week. In June last year Sofia said it would start talks to buy new Gripen warplanes from Swedish manufacturer Saab but the purchase was put on hold after lawmakers questioned if all bidders for the contract had been treated equally.  Three months later Prime Minister Boyko Borissov also expressed doubt that the Gripen was the best choice, although he had initially told his Swedish counterpart that negotiations on buying them would proceed within weeks. Bulgaria also received offers from Portugal for secondhand U.S. F-16s and from Italy for secondhand Eurofighter Typhoons.

2018-05-01,"* Oil producer seeks to cut food import bill * Government offers incentives to farmers * Drought-hit farms rely heavily on rains By Hamid Ould Ahmed BOURKIKA, Algeria, May 1 (Reuters) - Algerian farmer Hassen Miri trudges through mud to inspect his durum wheat field, helping the oil producing nation in its efforts to boost agricultural output and reduce food imports. “Things are moving slowly but better than in past years,” said Miri, who has fields of cereals and vegetables in Bourkika, about 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital Algiers. “I’m optimistic,” he said, after weeks of heavy rain relieved a long period of drought in the North African country. Algeria, a member of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has long neglected its farmers and focused on its oil and gas industry that generates about 60 percent of state revenues. But a crash in oil prices from above $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016, left the nation struggling to fund its $50 billion annual import bill and has prompted the government to look for ways to ease the strain on its coffers. With 20 percent of the import bill going on food, the government has launched a drive to increase local production, seeking to encourage farmers with incentives such as low interest loans and free vaccinations for livestock. It is also expanding the use of irrigation to cover 2 million hectares in 2019 from 1.3 million hectares now, officials say, helping farmers who rely on rains that can fail. The government is building 15 new dams to add to the 80 existing ones to water cereals covering an area of 600,000 hectares, up from just 60,000 hectares now. “Now Algeria is offering the agricultural sector with great support, with huge funds to help the production and to provide food for all Algerians,” said Mohamed Djahed, head of the parliamentary agriculture committee. The government wants to boost output of wheat - one of the main items on the food import bill - to 5.3 million tonnes by 2022 from 3.5 million tonnes in 2017. Algeria, one of the world’s biggest wheat importers, is expected to consume 10.55 million tonnes of the grain in the 2018/19 season, the U.S. foreign agricultural service said. Algeria also wants to double output for other products such as potatoes, milk and meat over four years. In addition to promoting Algerian production, the government has drawn up a list of 851 items that it now bans from being imported, including some food products. But government initiatives are taking time to feed through. Official figures show the overall value of food imports fell by just 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier, while the value of cereal and milk imports rose. “Algeria has all the tools needed to promote production,” said an economics professor at Algiers university, asking not to be identified. “But, as usual, the implementation will take time because of bureaucracy.” Nevertheless, farmers are responding to the government push. Mohamed Amine Abid, who breeds dairy cattle, has increased his herd to 70 cows from 40 since starting up in 2013, helped by state aid that included an extra piece of land. “Our objective is to develop the Algerian cow. We want it to be born in and raised in Algeria to get used to our climate,” he said. The state budget is still stretched, even as oil prices have been recovering, so some government initiatives have been scrapped. But Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said agriculture spending, worth about $2 billion this year, would not be cut in 2019. However, analysts say providing aid is not sufficient to achieve the government’s goal of increasing agriculture’s share of economic output from 12 percent now, as long as youths are losing interest in the land and looking elsewhere for jobs. “We need to win the food security battle,” said 50-year-old farmer Ahmed Moussaoui.

2018-05-01,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel signed a 15-year, $775 million (568.72 million pounds) deal with the self-ruling Palestinian Authority on Tuesday to put electricity distribution for Palestinians in the West Bank in PA hands and build four power plants to that end, officials said. The nearly three million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territory currently rely on Israel for their electricity, with neighbouring Jordan providing power to the Jericho area in the Jordan river valley. The deal does not apply to the Gaza Strip, whose two  million Palestinians suffer frequent blackouts due to severe fuel shortages and continued power-sharing disputes between Gaza’s Islamist Hamas rulers and the West Bank-based PA. As part of the new deal, the PA will pay off a 915-million-shekel debt to the state-owned utility Israel Electric Corp (IEC) [ISECO.UL], while taking charge of the distribution of electricity to West Bank Palestinians. The IEC will sell power to the Palestinian Electricity Transmission Company (PETL) through four plants to be built by the IEC and PA. PETL will own the power plants and channel the electricity supply. “The agreement ... frees the Palestinian electricity sector of complete Israeli control, which has lasted for decades,” said a statement issued in the name of Hussein Al-Sheikh, head of the PA’s civil affairs agency.  Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said the agreement paves the way for Palestinians to develop a modern grid. “(The deal) brings about a new reality in the Palestinians’ energy sector, reduces restrictions on electricity supply, strengthens economic stability...and opens a new era in economic relations between the two sides,” said Israeli Finance Ministry Director-General Shai Babad.    Palestinians in Gaza, an impoverished coastal enclave largely blockaded by Israel, suffer up to 18 hours of power cuts per day due to fuel shortages. The electricity Gaza gets from Israel, Egypt and a local power plant remains under half the estimated 600 megawatts that would satisfy daily needs. Talks on a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza have been frozen since 2014 and Israel and the PA have sparred repeatedly over unpaid PA debts to the IEC. The deal includes collateral and a guarantee mechanism to ensure the IEC is paid.

2018-05-01,"(Adds details, quotes) By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, May 1 (Reuters) - India asked Japan on Tuesday to help build infrastructure needed to boost the usage of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in India and elsewhere in Asia, India’s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said after a meeting with Japan’s trade minister Hiroshige Seko. India wants to increase the share of gas, which is a cleaner fuel than oil, to 15 percent of its energy usage by 2030 from 6.2 percent currently. “Explored opportunities for Japanese investments in India’s gas infrastructure and SPR (strategic petroleum reserve) program,” Pradhan tweeted after a meeting with Seko. The two ministers also discussed the possibility of developing joint energy projects in Africa, Pradhan said. Seko’s visit to New Delhi has come at a time when India is preparing to create a network with other major oil consumers in Asia, such as China, South Korea and Japan, to negotiate better terms with sellers. The world’s biggest LNG buyers, all in Asia, are increasingly clubbing together to secure more flexible supply contracts in a move that shifts power to importers from producers in an oversupplied market. The world’s three biggest LNG buyers - China, Japan and South Korea - joined together last year in March to secure flexible supply contracts. India was not part of that group. However, in October the Indian cabinet approved a plan allowing New Delhi to work with Japan to make long-term LNG import deals more affordable for its consumers.

2018-05-01,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Larsen & Toubro (LART.NS) has agreed to sell its electrical and automation business for 140 billion rupees ($2.1 billion) to Schneider Electric SE (SCHN.PA), partnering with Temasek, in the biggest M&A deal announced in the Indian market this year. Schneider Electric will combine the business it is buying with its low voltage and industrial automation products business in India, it said. Schneider will own 65 percent in the combined business, while Singapore state investor Temasek [TEM.UL] will have a 35 percent stake. The cash deal is part of L&T’s plan to sell its non-core business at a time when India’s biggest engineering group has seen slower growth in orders amid a prolonged economic downturn. The sale matches L&T’s “stated intent of unlocking value within the existing business portfolio,” Chief Executive, S.N. Subrahmanyan, said in a statement. The deal includes all segments of its electrical and automation business except marine switchgear and servowatch systems, L&T said. The electrical and automation (E&A) business, which has factories in India as well as in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia and the United Kingdom, had net revenue of 50.38 billion rupees, or about 4.5 percent of L&T’s consolidated revenue, for the year to March 2017. “This is a good deal for them,” said A.K. Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital, referring to the valuation. “L&T has a clear vision of divesting businesses with low margins.” Goldman Sachs last week forecast a “bright” outlook for L&T saying it expected the company’s near-term earnings growth to be robust with stable order inflows and pick up in execution.  The company’s effort to deleverage its balance sheet and improve its returns over the medium term through a combination of operational improvement and non-core asset sales will be instrumental in re-rating the stock, Goldman analysts wrote in a note dated April 23. Of the 140 billion rupees deal price, Schneider will contribute 34.25 billion rupees in cash, while Temasek will give 50.75 billion rupees. The joint venture will also take on debt of 55 billion rupees to fund the deal, Schneider said, adding it expected significant revenue and cost synergies.         After the deal, which L&T said is expected to close in 18 months, India will become Schneider’s third-biggest country in terms of revenue, at par with France. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup advised Schneider on the L&T deal, according to two sources with direct knowledge.  L&T’s in-house M&A team worked on the deal with Indian investment bank Arpwood Capital advising it, a company spokesman said. L&T shares closed 1.7 percent higher on Monday.

2018-05-01,"* Dollar breaks into positive territory for year * Oil just under $75 a barrel amid Iran deal nerves * Cautious cheer from stocks as Trump extends tariffs exemptions * Pound hurt by softer UK data * Apple results in focus after reports of weak iPhone demand * Gold hits 6-week low, emerging markets knocked by strong dollar By Marc Jones LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - The dollar broke into positive territory for the year and bond yields were creeping higher again on Tuesday, as the recent rise in oil prices fuelled bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will flag more interest rate hikes this week. May Day holidays across Asia and Europe meant trading was thinner than usual, though there was more than enough news flow to keep those that were open occupied. There was some optimism after U.S. President Donald Trump extended steel and aluminium tariff exemptions for Europe, Canada and Mexico for another month. But there was cause for caution too: Disappointing British manufacturing and consumer lending figures added to Europe’s recent run of poor data, worries about Iran’s nuclear deal simmered in oil markets, and Wall Street was waiting for Apple’s results following recent whispers of weak iPhone demand. The dollar made most of the running, though, as it turned positive for 2018 just ahead of a two-day Fed meeting that is expected to pave the way for another two or even three U.S. rate hikes this year. Dollar bulls in London took advantage of the holiday in most of the rest of Europe to push the currency to almost $1.20 per euro and helped it make good ground against the Swiss franc and the data-dented pound. “Provided the Fed conveys a steady-as-she-goes approach and it isn’t seen to be back tracking - and there is no reason from the data why it should - the dollar should be consolidating and pushing on from this level,” said Bank of New York Mellon senior currency strategist Neil Mellor. He added that the key change has been the move of the U.S. Treasury bond yield to 3 percent last week. It was nudging up at 2.96 percent on Tuesday, which also left the gap between U.S. and German 10-year benchmark bond yields just off its widest level in nearly three decades. The dollar has surged over 3 percent in the last two weeks. “It has been a bit like a dam bursting,” Mellor said of the Treasury move. For Europe’s stocks followers, only London’s FTSE and Denmark’s bourse were open. They were both higher though, thanks to the boost to exporters of lower domestic currencies, upbeat results from oil giant BP and relief that Trump hadn’t pushed ahead with his steel and aluminium tariffs for now at least. U.S. stock futures were barely budged ahead of the New York open . Overnight in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei closed up 0.2 percent while Australian shares hit seven-week highs as its huge metals sector also breathed easier. Apple’s quarterly results are due after Wall Street closes and will be a big focus after several weeks of speculation about ebbing smartphone demand based on selective reports from companies in its supply chain. Technology sector results so far – at least from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Samsung and SAP – have broadly beaten forecasts for Q1 and the overall aggregate U.S. earnings growth is tracking seven-year highs of almost 25 percent. “Earnings have been really strong so far, Microsoft and Amazon had a bumper quarter. The only concern has been Apple,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. The strong dollar was felt widely across commodity markets and the emerging economies that are now borrowing record amounts of debt in the U.S. currency — $3.7 trillion according to the latest figures this week from the Bank for International Settlements. MSCI’s emerging market share index fell 0.4 percent with Russian dollar-denominated stocks chalking up some of the biggest losses and currencies and bonds staying firmly under pressure too. Brent oil prices eased off four-month highs of just over $75 a barrel set on Monday on worries that U.S. President Donald Trump may pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and thereby bring back sanctions on its oil output. The White House had said on Monday that information provided by Israel on Iran’s nuclear programme had provided “new and compelling details”. A high-level U.S. trade delegation will also be in Beijing for meetings later this week, amid lingering worries about a possible trade war between the world’s top two economies. Copper, which is highly attuned to China’s economy, hit its lowest in three weeks at $6,752 a tonne, accelerating downwards after it broke below its 200-day moving average at $6,800. Gold, meanwhile, hit a six-week low of $1,307.40 an ounce, as the dollar strength and bets on higher interest rates kept it on the slide having already gone dropped through its 100-day moving average. “Investors are buying dollars and this is adding pressure,” ActivTrades analyst Carlo Alberto de Casa said. “Almost 50 percent of traders (are) expecting a fourth raise (in U.S. interest rates) by the end of the year.” Additional report by Jan Harvey in London and Hideyuki Sano

2018-05-01,"* Saudi blue chips seen expensive after rally * Al Rajhi drops 1.9 pct after Q1 results in line, recent surge * DSI cut sharp early losses after shareholder’s assurance * Emaar defies weak Dubai market on strong earnings By Saeed Azhar DUBAI, May 1 (Reuters) - Saudi stocks slid 0.6 percent on Tuesday as concerns grew about rich valuations for blue-chip stocks after the region’s biggest stock market hit a more than a two-year high last week. Most Gulf markets were lower with Dubai and Qatar both falling more than 1 percent. Al Rajhi Bank dropped 1.9 percent despite reporting a 7.3 percent rise in first-quarter net profit on Tuesday, marking the ninth quarter of earnings growth in a row. The profit was in line with analysts’ forecasts, but gave little incentive for investors to buy more after the stock’s surge this year. It has gained nearly 28 percent. Property firm Dar Al Arkan Real Estate, a favourite stock among retail investors, dropped 3 percent. The Saudi benchmark index has eased after surging past the 8,300-point level last week to its highest level since August 2015. On Tuesday, it closed at 8,158 points. Foreign funds were net sellers last week, taking profits after the market’s run-up this year ahead of FTSE Russell’s decision to upgrade Riyadh to emerging market status, said Faisal Potrik, head of research at Riyad Capital. With two weeks to Ramadan, market activity is likely to slow down, he said, but he expects buying interest will return ahead of index compiler MSCI’s decision in June on whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging market. In the week through last Thursday foreigners were net sellers to the tune of $48 million, stock exchange data showed. Vrajesh Bhandari, a portfolio manager at Al Mal Capital in Dubai, said he expects more downside for the market as it consolidates the year-to-date gains. The index is still up nearly 13 percent this year. “Purely on fundamentals, we don’t see a lot of value in large caps – our thesis can change if we see top corporates delivering earnings growth, either by way of stimulating demand through lower prices or cutting costs aggressively,” he said. Dubai stocks fell 1.2 percent, hurt by selling in DAMAC Properties which tumbled 6.9 percent, while contractor Drake and Scull (DSI) fell 3.3 percent on news that it did not get approval to increase its capital via a new strategic partner. DSI had plunged nearly 10 percent earlier, hitting an all-time intraday low of 1.10 dirhams. However, it erased some of its losses after an announcement by Abu Dhabi investor Tabarak that it has not sold any shares in the company and reassured on its long-term commitment. Tabarak owns 5.5 percent of DSI. Emaar Properties bucked the market, rising 0.7 percent after reporting an 8.5 percent increase in net profit on Tuesday on the back of strong contributions from its shopping malls business despite a weaker property market. In Qatar, Vodafone Qatar rose more than 1.6 percent in early trade, but quickly gave up most of its gains due to retail selling in the Qatar market. It was down 1.8 percent at the close. The company recorded a net profit of 17.5 million riyals ($4.8 million) for the first quarter, its first ever quarterly profit and rebounding from a net loss of 74.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Qatari stocks were down 1.1 percent, weighed down by financials. Qatar National Bank dropped 1.2 percent. Property firm Ezdan Holding plunged 6.9 percent after it reported a sharp drop in net profit a day earlier. The company reported a first-quarter profit of 103 million riyals  ($28.30 million), compared to 946 million riyals a year earlier, largely due to the sale of investment funds by some of its group subsidiaries.

2018-05-01,"(Recasts, adds Netanyahu quotes) WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday Israel  was not seeking war with Iran, one day after unveiling what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program. Netanyahu made his case as U.S. President Donald Trump considers whether to withdraw the United States from a 2015 deal between Iran and six major powers aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear program. Both Netanyahu and Trump have long criticized the agreement and in several U.S. television interviews on Tuesday, Netanyahu made his points directly to the American people. Trump himself is known to watch and tweet his reactions to early morning American programs. Asked if Israel is prepared to go to war against Iran over the issue, Netanyahu told CNN: “Nobody’s seeking that kind of development. Iran is the one that’s changing the rules in the region.” Iran, which has always said its nuclear program was for strictly peaceful means, dismissed Netanyahu’s presentation on Monday as propaganda. Trump faces a May 12 deadline to decide whether to pull the United States out of the 2015 agreement, which offered Tehran relief from international sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. “I trust his judgment,” Netanyahu told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” program, a show Trump has frequently praised. “He’ll do the right thing.” Netanyahu said the nuclear deal would need “a major overhaul,” but that Trump would have to make that decision. The prime minister also echoed Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal.” “This regime had a secret nuclear weapons program and they’re trying under a very bad deal to get a nuclear arsenal. They shouldn’t get it,” he told Fox, adding: “It really needs a new deal.” (Reporting by Susan Heavey Editing by Frances Kerry)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/israel-iran-netanyahu/update-1-netanyahu-says-not-seeking-iran-war-as-u-s-faces-deadline-idUKL1N1S80BX,01 May 2018,"Israeli Prime Minister

The nine-person committee will oversee day-to-day trading, commercial and operational functions as well as investments, according to an internal memo sent by Weir and seen by Reuters. It replaces the previous three person executive committee, which was comprised of the CEO, chief operating officer and global head of oil trading. Weir will also take on the role of executive chairman. As well as Weir, the committee will include Chief Financial Officer Christophe Salmon, Chief Operating Officer Mike Wainwright, the co-heads of market risk Ben Luckock and Rob Gillon, the head of mergers and acquisitions Jesus Fernandez, plus the heads of Trafigura’s key trading divisions.  These are the global head of oil trading Jose Larocca, the global head of refined metals and concentrates Amin Zahir and the global head of coal and iron ore Julien Rolland. Rob Gillon is also a board member of Trafigura’s down and midstream arm Puma Energy.

2018-05-01,"(Adds detail) VIENNA, May 1 (Reuters) - The U.N. atomic watchdog declined on Tuesday to directly address Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s accusations that Iran was breaching its landmark nuclear deal with major powers. Netanyahu on Monday stepped up pressure on the United States to pull out of the 2015 deal, presenting what he called evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme. Iran is known to have had a weapons programme until 2003; analysts and diplomats said he appeared to be recycling old accusations. “In line with standard IAEA practice, the IAEA evaluates all (nuclear) safeguards-relevant information available to it,” said a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is policing the deal. “However, it is not the practice of the IAEA to publicly discuss issues related to any such information.” In a report issued in December 2015, shortly before the pact went into effect, the IAEA said “a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device were conducted in Iran prior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated effort”. Those activities continued after 2003, though in a less coordinated manner, and there was no credible indication of any beyond 2009, the IAEA said at the time. The spokesman’s statement on Tuesday reiterated the 2015 report’s findings.

2018-05-01,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - A battle for access to seaports is underway in one of the world’s unlikeliest places: Somalia, now caught up in a regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on one side, with Qatar backed by Turkey on the other. At stake: not just the busy waters off the Somali coast but the future stability of the country itself.  Somalia has been at war for decades and until the last few years it has struggled to attract foreign investment. But rivalries in the nearby Arabian peninsula are resulting in serious inflows into Somalia.  A year ago, a company owned by the United Arab Emirates government signed a $336 million contract to expand the port of Bosaso, north of Mogadishu in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland. Less than a year before that, another UAE-owned firm took control of the Berbera port in the breakaway northern region of Somaliland and pledged up to $440 million to develop it. In March, Ethiopia took a stake in the port for an undisclosed sum. At the same time, Turkey, an ally of UAE rival Qatar, is ramping up a multi-billion dollar investment push in Somalia. A Turkish company has run the Mogadishu port since 2014, while other Turkish firms have built roads, schools, and hospitals. The rivalries have intensified since June, when the most powerful Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and including the UAE, cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Iran and Islamist militants. That Middle Eastern feud is driving the desire to control the Horn of Africa and its waters, according to diplomats, businessmen, scholars and Somali officials. Somalia is close to vital oil routes and its ports could also serve landlocked Ethiopia, which has a population of 100 million. Gulf nations have had trade and religious ties with Somalia for centuries, but those relationships are now up in the air as new rivalries emerge. “Somalia has been caught in the middle of this effort to try to expand influence, commercial and military, along the coast,” said Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. Saudi Arabia and the UAE increasingly view the Somali coastline - and Djibouti and Eritrea to the north - as their “western security flank”, according to a senior western diplomat in the Horn of Africa region. Qatar and Turkey, whose investments are almost all in Mogadishu, are focussed on supporting President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. He and his chief of staff are widely viewed in Somalia and by western diplomats as loyal to Doha after receiving funds for their 2017 election campaign. A Qatari official told Reuters Doha had provided $385 million in infrastructure, education and humanitarian assistance to the central Somali government. The official said making deals directly with regional governments in Somalia, as the UAE has done, undermined the central government. Somali finance minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh agreed. “The Gulf region has a lot of money and if they want to invest in Somalia we welcome them with open arms,” he told Reuters. “But it’s a question of going through the right doors.” The federal government in Mogadishu has long been at odds with the semi-autonomous regions of Puntland and Somaliland. The latter operates virtually as an independent state and has for years sought to secede from Somalia, but has not won international recognition. Less than a decade ago there was virtually no commercial interest in Somalia. That began to change in 2011 when al Qaeda-backed al Shabaab militants retreated from Mogadishu. Months later, Turkey launched famine relief operations, opening the door for projects that now make it Somalia’s biggest foreign investor. The government hopes new investment, especially in infrastructure, can help the country rebuild.  Better tax collection is boosting government revenues, but this only covers public sector salaries. Huge amounts of capital are needed for roads, schools and other basics. Middle Eastern companies and charities could provide some of it. However, the money could also destabilise the country further by deepening tensions between the central government, aligned with Turkey and Qatar, and Puntland and Somaliland, which both receive money from the UAE. “These investments are having a detrimental effect on our political stability and worsening the relationship between our federal government and the regions,” said former national security adviser Hussein Sheikh-Ali. “This could cause a constitutional crisis that only al Shabaab will benefit from.” The Gulf crisis has already deepened rifts in Somalia. The central government has stayed neutral, to the annoyance of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which Puntland and Somaliland have backed against Qatar. “Getting out of this mess is very difficult,” Sheikh-Ali said. “Without unity we cannot.” The Somali presidency and the UAE government did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Western nations fear the Gulf rivalries playing out in Somalia could sideline their multi-billion dollar, U.N.-led efforts to build a functional Somali army to fight Shabaab before the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers in 2020. Political crises between Mogadishu and the regional authorities are undermining government efforts to strengthen financial systems and embark on other core tasks of a state, diplomats say.  The Gulf rivalry is also being felt on the ground in Somalia. In mid-April, Somalia and the UAE ended military cooperation. Since 2014, the UAE had trained and paid the salaries of Somali troops in Mogadishu and built an anti-piracy force in Puntland. Hundreds of weapons were looted from the training centre in Mogadishu as it shut down. This came after Somali security forces seized nearly $10 million flown in from the UAE to pay soldiers and temporarily held the plane which brought the cash. The UAE also closed a hospital that offered free care. Last week Puntland officials travelled to Dubai to meet UAE counterparts and P&O, the state firm developing its port. “Investing millions of dollars in Somalia at this critical juncture in history is very important for us,” Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said. Similarly, Somaliland officials hosted UAE diplomats last week to discuss “enhancing bilateral ties”. “For Somalis themselves, this kind of geopolitical game of chess, where Somalia is solely a proxy conflict to the trouble in the Gulf, this is obviously bad news,” said Harry Verhoeven, professor at Georgetown University in Qatar.

2018-05-01,"(Adds quotes, context) PARIS, May 1 (Reuters) - France’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that an Israeli intelligence haul on Iran’s past nuclear weapons programme could form the basis of a push for long-term assurances on Tehran’s nuclear activities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled on Monday what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme that could encourage the United States to pull out this month of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. “This information should be studied and evaluated in detail,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a statement. “The new information presented by Israel could also confirm the need for longer-term assurances on the Iranian programme, as the president has proposed.” Since travelling to the United States last week, French leader Emmanuel Macron has spoken to leaders in Israel, Russia, Britain, Germany and Iran to propose a new negotiation on a wider agreement. That would tackle Iran’s nuclear activities post-2025 when the existing deal begins to expire, as well as Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its regional influence. Intelligence experts and diplomats said Netanyahu’s presentation, in a prime-time television presentation, did not seem to have a “smoking gun” showing a violation by Iran but it could strengthen the hand of advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump who want to scrap the nuclear agreement. Von der Muhll said the information presented by Netanyahu confirmed in part the non-civilian nature of the programme revealed by European powers in 2002, but that it merely proved the need to ensure the nuclear deal and U.N. inspections remained, given they were among the “most comprehensive and robust in the history of nuclear non-proliferation.” “It is essential that the IAEA can continue to verify Iran’s respect for JCPOA (nuclear deal) and the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme,” she said. She added that a commission of the countries that agreed the deal - China, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States and Iran - could review the Israeli information.

The Brent oil price, now nearly $75 a barrel, has averaged over $68 so far this year — a leap from last year’s average of just below $55. That is good news for the six wealthy oil-exporting countries of the region. “If prices stay at their current level that would translate into a $100 billion — 7 percent of gross domestic product — boost to the Gulf’s oil export revenues compared with last year,” London-based Capital Economics wrote in a client note. “Budget and current account positions would improve, providing governments with scope to ease back on austerity and lend some support to economic growth.” Many economists don’t think oil prices will stay as high as their current levels into next year. But they are nevertheless raising their forecasts for the Gulf’s external balances. Bigger surpluses — or in the case of the weakest economies, Oman and Bahrain, smaller deficits — would reduce pressure on countries’ foreign exchange reserves, which were hit by the plunge of oil prices after 2014. Saudi Arabia, for example, is now expected to run a current account surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP this year, according to the Reuters poll of 15 economists, instead of the 1.9 percent forecast in the previous poll last January. The median forecast for next year has been lifted to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent. Oman is now expected to run a current account deficit of 7.5 percent this year, instead of the previous forecast of 8.4 percent. Because of higher oil prices, Oman’s state budget deficit is now forecast at 8.4 percent of GDP this year and 6.5 percent next year — still unsustainably high in the long run, but better than the previous forecasts for deficits of 11.6 percent and 8.2 percent. While firm oil prices would bolster state coffers, however, they would not necessarily boost economic growth much. That’s because some economies will continue to labour under recent austerity policies, such as the imposition of 5 percent value-added tax in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in January. Many countries are taking advantage of higher oil prices to raise state spending and water down parts of their austerity programmes; for that reason, Saudi Arabia is now expected to run a state budget deficit of 7.8 percent of GDP in 2018 instead of 7.2 percent, and 6.7 percent in 2019 instead of 6.0 percent. That may not be enough to stimulate much new growth in the private sector, though. “GDP data showed that the downturn in Saudi Arabia’s economy deepened at the end of last year. A fading drag from the oil sector appears to have returned the economy to positive growth at the start of this year, but the non-oil sector seems to be suffering,” Capital Economics said. The median forecast for Saudi Arabia’s GDP growth this year remains unchanged at 1.5 percent, though next year’s prediction has been raised slightly to 2.4 percent from 2.0 percent.

2018-05-01,"May 1 (Reuters) - Nikol Pashinyan, the Armenian opposition figure who led mass protests against the ruling establishment, will seek parliamentary approval on Monday to become the ex-Soviet state’s new prime minister. Here are some details about him: * Pashinyan was born in Ijevan, northeastern Armenia, in 1975. * He worked as a journalist and produced work which was critical of Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sarksyan, the two men who have dominated political life in Armenia since the late 1990s. He rose to be editor of Armenian newspaper Haykakan Zhamanak. * During the 2008 presidential campaign, Pashinyan aligned himself with Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia’s first president since it became an independent state in 1991, who was making an unsuccessful comeback bid. * Pashinyan was imprisoned in June 2009 on charges of fomenting unrest during post-election protests that turned violent. Pashinyan was sentenced to four years in prison. He was released two years later under an amnesty. * In a 2017 parliamentary election, Pashinyan was elected a member of the national assembly. * Pashinyan emerged as the leader of a protest movement after Sarksyan, forced to step down as president because of constitutional term limits, announced he would seek to become prime minister instead. After days of mass protests, Sarksyan announced he was quitting the prime minister’s post. * Pashinyan has not questioned Armenia’s geopolitical alignment with Russia under Sarksyan and his criticism has focused on domestic issues such as corruption and poverty. * In public appearances, he often wears a camouflage T-shirt and cap, though he swapped that outfit for a jacket and tie on Tuesday when he asked parliament to choose him as the next prime minister.

2018-05-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) held out the prospect of a first dividend increase since 2014 on Tuesday, after first-quarter profits beat forecasts thanks to rising oil and gas prices and production. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the London-listed company might consider raising the dividend later this year if oil prices remain near current levels and debt declines.  In the first three months of 2018, however, BP’s debt rose to $40 billion (29.2 billion pounds) due to the settlement of more lawsuits over the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico which has cost it more than $65 billion. A nearly 25 percent rise in oil prices over the past year to over $70 a barrel has lifted revenue for oil companies, shifting investors’ focus to how much cash they can generate following years of cost cuts. First-quarter results in the sector have been a mixed bag, with Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) falling short of forecasts, while results from Chevron (CVX.N) and Total (TOTF.PA) were stronger than expected. BP’s cash flow from operating activities rose sharply from a year earlier to $3.6 billion, but declined from the previous quarter as a result of the Deepwater Horizon payments and one-off charges. Stripping those out, cash flow reached $7 billion in the quarter, the strongest since 2014. “Overall it was a very healthy set of results,” said Martijn Rats, analyst at Morgan Stanley, which has a “neutral” recommendation on BP stock. BP shares were 0.9 percent higher at 0930 GMT, compared with a 0.2 percent gain in the European oil and gas index .SXEP.  The surge in revenue led BP last October to become the first European oil major to resume share buybacks in order to offset the dilutive effect of so-called scrip dividend, where shareholders can opt to receive dividends via cash or shares. In the first quarter, BP bought back 18 million shares worth $120 million. Investors are now hoping for the company to announce its first dividend increase since the third quarter of 2014. “With these oil prices, we will now see net debt naturally start to decline and that will give an opportunity later this year for potential further distribution around buybacks or a conversation with the board around dividend,” Gilvary told analysts on a conference call. BP’s underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, rose 71 percent to $2.6 billion in the first quarter, exceeding the $2.2 billion forecast by analysts in a company-provided survey. The last time BP generated so much profit was in the third quarter of 2014, when oil prices averaged $104 a barrel. Brent crude is currently trading around $75 a barrel. [O/R] BP launched seven oil and gas fields in 2017, a record year, and is set to inaugurate six more projects this year including in Egypt, Azerbaijan and Britain’s North Sea, which will help it boost production by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2020, most of it gas. First-quarter production rose 6 percent to 3.7 million bpd. “It’s not only about the oil price, it is also about the performance of the kit,” Gilvary said. BP’s gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s equity market value, stood at 28.1 percent at the end of the quarter, up from 27.4 percent at the end of 2017. Net debt at the end of March was $40 billion, up from $37.8 billion at the end of 2017. The results were impacted by a $1.6 billion pretax payment for the settlement of the Deepwater Horizon spill. BP is expected to pay $3 billion in 2018. Morgan Stanley’s Rats said debt was expected to fall in the second half of the year after most of the Deepwater Horizon claims are settled and production continues to rise.

Spread-betters also expected Britain’s FTSE to creep ahead in opening trade. Still, uncertainty over an expanding trade dispute between the United States and China as well as worries that Washington may abandon a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran kept investors on edge. A high-level U.S. trade delegation will be in Beijing for meetings later this week. S&P mini futures ticked up 0.2 percent, erasing an earlier loss of 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.2 percent while Australian shares gained 0.6 percent, hitting their highest level since mid-March. MSCI’s dollar-denominated index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1 percent though only Australia and New Zealand are open. Many markets in Europe and Latin America will be closed on Tuesday as well for public holidays. U.S. shares lost steam late on Monday as worries about rising costs for companies kept investors on edge, despite solid corporate earnings and strong economic data. Analysts expect S&P500 companies to report 24.6 percent growth in profits in the January-March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Yet rising U.S. bond yields and commodity prices pointed to higher costs down the road, with concerns about trade frictions and rising tension in the Middle East seen as potentially amplifying the cost challenge. An earnings announcement due later on Tuesday from Apple , the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, is attracting close attention, given speculation the sales of its flagship iPhone X have been sluggish. “Earnings have been really strong so far. Microsoft and Amazon had a bumper quarter. The only concern has been Apple, which has been said to be lacklustre. Hopefully, unless they come up with downbeat guidance, the market may take it in stride,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. The market got a little relief when the United States decided to postpone the start date for steel and aluminium tariffs against the European Union, Canada and Mexico to June. The United States also reached agreements in principle on tariffs with some other countries, including Australia and Brazil. The news, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, lifted worries the exemptions would expire on Tuesday, easing investors’ worst fears. “Markets are kind of expecting the Trump way of negotiation to continue. So I do not think markets are overly concerned about them at this point,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. In the currency market, the euro traded at $1.2078, not far from 3 1/2-month low of $1.2055 touched on Friday, after weaker-than-expected German retail sales figures. Although the data is known to be volatile and is often revised, it added to recent signs that Germany’s economy could be losing some momentum after last year’s surprisingly strong growth. The dollar has been supported against many other currencies thanks to the relative strength of U.S. economy and its yield advantage. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates on hold at its two-day policy meeting starting later on Tuesday, with a June hike already priced in. The British pound stood at $1.3753, having hit a two-month low of $1.3715 on Monday, as recent data suggested a rate hike by the Bank of England this month, once almost seen as a certainty, could be delayed. The dollar changed hands at 109.25 yen, near Friday’s 2 1/2-month high of 109.54. The Australian dollar stood at $0.7540, near Monday’s 4 1/2-month low of $0.75255 after the Australian central bank kept its policy on hold as expected. Oil prices held firm near 3-1/2-year highs after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepped up pressure on the United States to pull out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, presenting what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme. Some intelligence experts and diplomats said he did not seem to have presented a “smoking gun” showing that Iran had violated the agreement and Iran dismissed Netanyahu’s accusations, calling them propaganda. But U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to pull the United States out of the international deal unless it is renegotiated by May 12, repeated his criticism of the deal after Netanyahu’s presentation, suggesting he backed the Israeli leader’s remarks. The White House said on Monday that the information provided by Israel on Iran’s nuclear programme provides “new and compelling details”. U.S. crude futures traded up slightly at $68.72 per barrel, not far from last month’s peak of $69.56, its highest level since late 2014. Brent crude futures were $74.84 per barrel, near the 3 1/2-year high of $75.47 a barrel set last week. Reporting by Hideyuki Sano

London-based BP reported first-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, of $2.6 billion, exceeding forecasts of $2.2 billion, according to a company-provided survey of analysts. That compared with a profit of $1.5 billion a year earlier and $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. First-quarter production rose to 3.7 million barrels per day, up 6 percent from a year earlier. “Moving through 2018, we’re determined to keep delivering our operational targets and maintaining capital discipline while growing cash flow and returns.” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement.

2018-05-01,"TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China offered the Dominican Republic a $3.1 billion package of investments and loans to get them to sever ties with Taiwan, a Taiwan official said on Tuesday, after the Caribbean nation switched allegiance to China in a diplomatic blow to the self-ruled island. China said there were no economic pre-conditions. Taiwan, claimed by China as its own, has formal relations now with only 19 countries, many of them poor nations in Central America and the Pacific like Belize and Nauru. China says Taiwan is simply a wayward province with no right to state-to-state ties. China and Taiwan have tried to poach each other’s allies over the years, often dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, though Taipei struggles to compete with an increasingly powerful China. Panama ended its long-standing relationship with Taiwan last year in a major diplomatic victory for China. The Vatican is possibly next on the list, as the Holy See and China edge closer to an accord on the appointment of bishops in China. The news on the Dominican Republic switch, announced in both Beijing and Santo Domingo, drew strong and swift condemnation from Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu. “President Danilo Medina of the Dominican Republic has ignored our long-term partnership, the wishes of the people of the Dominican Republic, and the years of development assistance provided by Taiwan, to accept false promises of investment and aid by China,” Wu told reporters. “(Taiwan) strongly condemns China’s objectionable decision to use dollar diplomacy to convert Taiwan’s diplomatic allies. Beijing’s attempts at foreign policy have only served to drive a wedge between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, erode mutual trust and further harm the feelings of the people of Taiwan.” A Taiwan Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that, according to initial calculations, China dangled at least a $3.1 billion package of investments, financial assistance and low-interest loans for the Dominican Republic, which shares an island with Haiti to the west. That included $400 million for a new freeway, $1.6 billion for infrastructure projects and $300 million for a new natural gas power plant.  “It was a cost that Taiwan could not match,” the official said.  China’s Foreign Ministry said the move was a political one with no economic pre-conditions, but that now they have established ties, China will “proactively promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas”. A person who answered the telephone at the Dominican Republic’s Beijing representative office said it did not know about the situation and declined further comment. China has stepped up the pressure on Taiwan since the 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, as president. Beijing fears she will push for Taiwan’s formal independence, but Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo.  The Dominican Republic had been a diplomatic ally of the Republic of China - Taiwan’s official name - for 77 years, including when the government ruled all of China before being forced to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists. Taiwan’s presidential office said that despite the severe challenges, the government would not bow its head in pressure to Beijing, and vowed to do all it could to protect Taiwan’s interests. The Taiwan official said the Dominican Republic move was not unexpected. “We’ve always known things were not looking rosy here,” the official said.  The Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, lauded the decision as in line with the trend of the times and history, in comments to reporters in Beijing at a hastily arranged news conference. “This important and correct decision by the Dominican Republic absolutely accords with the basic interests of the country and its people,” Wang said. “We highly appreciate this.” The Dominican Republic said it had taken the decision after a long process of consultation, taking its needs and potential into account, according to a statement on the president’s website.  It said that even without formal diplomatic ties, China was already its second largest supplier of imported products. “Of course we know that now we’re establishing diplomatic relations, the growth potential of our trade links is immense,” presidential legal adviser Flavio Dario Espinal said. Espinal said that the government was grateful to Taiwan. “We are deeply grateful for the cooperation we’ve shared for years,” he said. “However, history and the socioeconomic reality force us now to change direction.” In Taipei, Wu said China had failed to follow through on its promises to former Taiwan diplomatic allies, including $140 million in aid to the small West African country of Sao Tome and Principe in late 2016. “Developing nations should be aware of the danger of falling into a debt trap when engaging with China,” he said. Neither Wang, nor Dominican Republic Foreign Minister Miguel Vargas Maldonado, who stood by his side at the Beijing news conference, took questions from reporters. Speaking in March, Wang said it was in the best interests of Taiwan’s few remaining diplomatic allies to recognise an “irresistible trend” and ditch Taipei in favour “one China” ruled by Beijing.

2018-05-01,"MIDLAND, Texas (Reuters) - In West Texas, rising oil prices are fuelling a sharp economic upswing, lifting employment and pay to records, driving up spending at hotels, restaurants, and car dealerships, and raising the cost of housing and other essentials. This parched patch of land, under which lie the largest oil-producing rock formations in the United States, is used to growth binges as well as the busts that always follow. After a two-year crash, the price of crude CLc1 began to recover in 2016 and pierced $60 a barrel early this year. But oil is still far cheaper than at the peak of the previous eight-year boom that began in 2006 North Dakota’s Bakken oil patch and supercharged the city of Williston. In the Permian basin, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the latest boom is being helped by advances in technology that allow drillers to extract much more from each acre. “$60 is like the new $100,” said Dallas Fed economist Michael Plante in a mid-April interview.  Breakeven costs are now as little as $25 per barrel, according to the Dallas Fed’s most recent survey, so energy companies here no longer need $100 oil to make lots of money.  And Midland and its neighbour Odessa, the biggest towns for miles and the regional base for major oil producers in the Permian Basin, including Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Apache Corp (APA.N) and Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N), are feeling the surge. “It is a full-fledged boom,” says Dale Redman, chief executive of Propetro, a Midland, Texas, firm that supplies heavyduty horsepower to drill sites, where energy companies coax crude from the ground with sand and water. He has tripled his workforce since early 2016, drawing workers from towns and cities hundreds of miles away. Over half of his 1,200 employees make more than $100,000. “What it has done is raised wages for all these folks. But housing and the cost of living has gone up as well.”  To Midland Mayor Jerry Morales, “It’s a good story right now.” He says the city is trying to keep up with the drop in housing inventory and rise in rents by approving new apartment complexes and working with developers to put in water and sewer pipes.  But as owner of two restaurants in town, including Gerardo’s Casita, he sees the other side too. “The biggest problem I face is low unemployment - finding workers,” he said in a phone interview, adding that he is increasing pay every six months to keep staff from leaving for other jobs, and he is hiking his menu prices as well. Oil companies are drilling wells faster, and putting more wells on a single site, using technology to find the best angles and depths to get the most out of each layer of shale.  That has helped boost per-employee output by Texas oil and gas companies to an estimated $820,000, according to Waco, Texas-based economist Ray Perryman.  “Companies are making enough money to be able to afford to pay higher wages,” he said.  Unemployment was 3.2 percent in Odessa and 2.5 percent in Midland in February. Average weekly earnings in March hit records in both towns, which have a combined population of about 250,000. Sales tax receipts have soared.  “You have people that move in, you train them and then someone else offers them a job: there is constant raiding going on,” says Jeff Sparks, chief operating officer of family-owned Discovery Oil in Midland, who has only recently shifted to the more efficient and capital-intensive drilling techniques that have pushed per-barrel extraction costs down so steeply.  At the Odessa car dealership the Sewell family has run since 1935, Colin Sewell sold 1,073 trucks in the first three months of this year, up from 670 last year. He is building a brand new service center on the outskirts of town.  Jason Tarulli, senior project manager at general contractor UEB, is using an out-of-town crew to build a downtown Odessa construction project he is overseeing, because local hiring would have been impossible.  His costs are rising; rent for a one bedroom in his building rose by more than $1,000 in less than a year, to $3,630. Everyone who has lived here a while knows that the boom is not going to last, including Sondra Eoff, who is footing about half the $80 million bill for the downtown project, meant to help keep the town vibrant for the longrun and not just during boomtimes.   “When there’s an up, there’s a down,” she says.

Still, uncertainty over an expanding trade dispute between the United States and China as well as worries that Washington may abandon a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran kept investors on edge.

2018-05-01,"TOKYO, May 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices extended gains on Tuesday, supported by comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he was sure U.S. President Donald Trump would do “the right thing” in reviewing Iran’s nuclear deal with western powers. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery was up 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $68.68 a barrel by 0114 GMT, after settling up 47 cents on Monday. London Brent crude for new July delivery was up 11 cents at $74.80. The June contract expired on Monday, settling up 53 cents at $75.17. Oil prices jumped on Monday, reversing earlier losses, after Netanyahu said Israel has evidence that Iran lied about its nuclear programme after signing the 2015 agreement with global powers. Iran dismissed Netanyahu’s accusations, calling them “propaganda”. Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on key oil-producer Iran that were lifted after the international agreement. Oil prices rose to the highest since November, 2014 in late April, driven by concern over potential disruptions to Iranian crude flows. Analysts said the market is extremely sensitive to any developments on the nuclear deal and sanctions. Meanwhile, U.S. crude production jumped 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.26 million bpd in February, the highest on record, the Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday.

2018-05-01,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran has the technical capability to enrich uranium to a higher level than it could before a multinational nuclear deal was reached to curb its nuclear programme, state TV quoted the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, as saying. U.S. President Donald) Trump has given European signatories to the 2105 deal a May 12 deadline to “fix the terrible flaws” in the agreement, or he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran.  Salehi warned Trump against taking that course. “Iran is not bluffing. ... Technically, we are fully prepared to enrich uranium higher than we used to produce before the deal was reached. ... I hope Trump comes to his senses and stays in the deal.”  Under the deal, which led to the lifting of most international sanctions in 2016, Iran’s level of enrichment must remain around 3.6 percent.  Iran stopped producing 20 percent enriched uranium and gave up the majority of its stockpile as part of the agreement with the United States, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia.  Uranium refined to 20 percent fissile purity is well beyond the 5 percent normally required to fuel civilian nuclear power plants, although still well short of highly enriched, or 80 to 90 percent, purity needed for a nuclear bomb. Tehran has ruled out any possibility of negotiating over the country’s ballistic missile programme, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 and its international role in the Middle East, as demanded by Trump. Britain, France and Germany back the deal as the best way of stopping Tehran getting nuclear weapons, but have called on Iran to limit its regional influence and curb the missile programme.
