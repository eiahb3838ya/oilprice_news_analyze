2018-10-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories rose by much more than expected and exports fell, while the dollar added to gains after minutes showed Federal Reserve policy makers largely united on the need to raise borrowing costs further. A gauge of stocks across the world dipped, tracking Wall Street’s reaction to the Fed minutes, while the outlook on earnings soured after a warning on the European auto sector and a revenue miss from IBM. WTI crude touched its lowest price in a month after U.S. stockpiles rose by 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast. This happened even as U.S. crude production slipped last week, partly as offshore facilities closed temporarily for Hurricane Michael. WTI CLc1 fell 2.63 percent to $70.03 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $80.32, down 1.34 percent on the day. “A tick higher in refining activity and a drop in production due to hurricane activity in the Gulf was not enough to halt a fourth consecutive climb in (inventories)- and a solid one at that,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. Every Federal Reserve policy maker backed raising interest rates last month in a meeting where they also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further, according to the minutes from the meeting. The dollar index hit session highs after the Fed minutes were released, although the bulk of Wednesday’s leg up came before the news. “There was a pretty well-formed expectation that it would more likely showcase a Fed that’s more confident and assertive debating tighter policy,” said Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. The euro EUR= fell 0.64 percent to $1.1499 and Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3115, down 0.52 percent on the day. Lower-than-expected UK inflation data weighed on sterling, which gave up the previous day’s gains. The Japanese yen weakened 0.35 percent versus the greenback at 112.65 per dollar. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.63 percent. On Wall Street, IBM (IBM.N) fell 7.6 percent, dragging blue chips lower a day after the company missed revenue expectations. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 posted the biggest daily gain since late March. Stocks extended losses when oil prices fell further, but the S&P 500 shifted in and out of losses after the Fed minutes and ended down less than a point. “This is consistent with the Fed’s rhetoric that they will continue to gradually raise interest rates. A lot has to happen for the Fed not to move again in December,” said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “The stock market would have to go into a persistent, prolonged decline to change the Fed’s outlook on the economy.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 91.74 points, or 0.36 percent, to 25,706.68, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.71 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,809.21 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.79 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,642.70.

2018-10-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with U.S. futures settling below $70 a barrel for the first time in a month, after U.S. crude stockpiles rose 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast, while exports dropped. Oil had been rising this week on worries about Iranian sanctions and tensions between the United States and Saudi Arabia after the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  U.S. crude oil CLc1 slumped $2.17, or 3 percent, to settle at $69.75 a barrel. “Today’s price decline to below our expected support at the $70 level would appear to set the trade up for a weaker pricing environment than we had anticipated,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York, said some speculators may have interest in getting out when prices are below $70, which could accentuate the selloff.  Volume was above average on Wednesday, with more than 627,000 U.S. crude contracts changing hands, compared with a 10-month daily average of about 583,000 contracts. Brent crude LCOc1 also dipped below $80 a barrel but ended at $80.05, $1.36 or 1.7 percent lower. The global benchmark is trading nearly $7 below a four-year high of $86.74 reached on Oct. 3. U.S. crude stocks rose 6.5 million barrels last week, the fourth straight weekly build, as exports were down to 1.8 million barrels per day, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said, in a report analysts characterized as bearish. [EIA/S]  Inventories rose sharply even as U.S. crude production slipped 300,000 bpd to 10.9 million bpd last week, which analysts attributed to the effects of offshore facilities closing temporarily for Hurricane Michael.  “A tick higher in refining activity and a drop in production due to hurricane activity in the Gulf was not enough to halt a fourth consecutive climb in stocks,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. The scandal over the disappearance of prominent Saudi critic and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared two weeks ago after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, underpinned oil markets earlier in the week. U.S. lawmakers pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership, suggesting sanctions could be possible. Western pressure mounted on Riyadh to provide answers, but President Donald Trump’s comments suggested that White House may not take additional action against the Saudis, particularly after Saudi Arabia said it will conduct an investigation.  On Wednesday, Trump denied that he is giving cover to the Saudis, and that the results of the investigation into Khashoggi’s death should be known within a week.  Investors worry Saudi Arabia could use oil supply to retaliate against critics. Such a move would roil markets, as the Saudis have not used oil as a policy weapon since the oil embargo of the early 1970s, and the market is already anticipating reduced supply when sanctions on Iranian oil exports resume on Nov. 4. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of breaking an OPEC-led agreement on output cuts by producing more crude, which will thus hurt their market share.

2018-10-17,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday it has been in talks with Volvo over the last few weeks about an issue with catalytic converters causing some of its vehicles to exceed nitrogen oxide emission limits. Volvo warned a day earlier that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions due to an emissions control component it uses degrading more quickly than expected. The Swedish truckmaker said it could face material costs to deal with the issue largely affecting trucks and buses sold in North America and Europe, its two largest markets, and that it was working with authorities to find a solution. The EPA, in an emailed statement, told Reuters on Wednesday that the agency was aware of the situation, which it said involved Volvo heavy duty trucks. “Over the last few weeks, EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have been communicating with Volvo about the problem and are now continuing to meet with the company to develop plans to quickly address this situation,” the EPA statement said. A U.S. government official briefed on the matter said on Wednesday that regulators do not believe excess emissions are the result of a “defeat device” or intentional misconduct as in the case of Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) excess diesel emissions, but rather is believed to be the result of a faulty component and a recall is expected. Asked why Volvo had waited a couple of weeks before informing the market, a Volvo spokesman said the company needed to determine whether this would be a large issue and it was standard protocol to inform authorities first. “Authorities and legal bodies are normally informed prior to the markets because we inform them even if the problem is very, very small,” he said. Volvo did not say when the affected trucks were sold or how many are impacted. It said that all products equipped with the component met emissions limits at delivery. The company sold 51,693 trucks in North America last year and another 115,863 in Europe. EPA and CARB declined to comment about how many trucks were involved, while a spokesman for Volvo said it was too early to know. “We... are working with the company to more fully understand what’s going on,” a spokesman for CARB said in a brief separate comment, without giving more details.

2018-10-17,"ADDIS ABABA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - German mechanical engineering conglomerate Voith has signed an agreement to supply turbines for a $4 billion dam Ethiopia is building along the River Nile, state-affiliated media said on Wednesday. The 6,000 megawatt Grand Renaissance Dam is the centrepiece of the Horn of Africa country’s bid to become the continent’s biggest power exporter. The agreement with Voith, which has already supplied 13 out of the dam’s 16 turbines alongside France’s Alstom, was made after the government, due to delays, cancelled a contract with its military-run Metals and Engineering Corporation (METEC)to provide the remaining three turbines, sustaining losses. “The contract was awarded to Voith in a tender floated two weeks ago at a $5.9 million discount from each (of the three) turbine,” Fana Broadcasting Corporation quoted METEC’s commercial operations head Abdulaziz Mohammed as saying. Italian firm Salini Impregilo remains the main contractor building the dam, while METEC was the contractor for the electromechanical and hydraulic steel structure divisions of the project. In August, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed acknowledged that the dam would face a delay of several years having initially been expected to be completed by 2020. The government plans to restructure METEC, which is set to be renamed as the National Metal Engineering Corporation.

2018-10-17,"PARIS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Global carbon emissions will rise to a new record level in 2018, making the chances of reaching a target to keep temperature increases to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius remote, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday. IEA’s Fatih Birol told a conference in Paris that data for the first nine months of the years was already pointing to a record increase in carbon emissions. A United Nations report last week said society would have to make changes to how it consumes energy, travels and builds, to meet a lower global warming target. “Sorry, I have very bad news. My numbers are giving me some despair,” Birol told the conference at the Polish embassy in Paris. Poland will host United Nations COP24 talks in December, which will lay out a “rule book” to implement a historic accord reached in Paris in 2015. That agreement set goals to phase out fossil fuel use this century, shift towards cleaner energies and help limit a rise in temperatures. “Looking at data for the first nine months of this year, emissions this year will increase once again ... global emissions will reach a record historical high,” Birol said. “Therefore the chances of reaching such ambitious targets in my view, are becoming weaker and weaker every year, every month,” he said.

2018-10-17,"OSLO (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to sell its Danish upstream business to Norwegian Energy (Noreco) in a deal valuing the assets at $1.9 billion, as part of its wider divestment strategy, the company said on Wednesday. The sale brings Shell’s three-year $30 billon divestment plan close to its conclusion, having begun the process in 2015 after the acquisition of BG Group. Deals so far have included large portfolios in the British North Sea, Gabon, Thailand and Canada. “Today’s announcement is consistent with Shell’s strategy to simplify its portfolio through a $30 billion divestment program and contributes to our goal of reshaping the company into a world-class investment case,” Shell’s upstream director, Andy Brown, said in a statement. The payment from Noreco to Shell will be adjusted for the cash flow Shell has generated since the deal’s effective date, which will be set to Jan. 1, 2017. “We expect to pay around $1.2 billion,” Noreco’s Chairman Riulf Rustad confirmed to Reuters. He said Noreco and Shell started discussions about the deal around January 2017. Reuters reported in February 2017 that Shell was seeking to sell its upstream assets in Denmark.  However, Shell will transfer $1.1 billion of decommissioning liabilities associated with the assets to the buyer, analyst Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets noted. For Noreco, the transaction will add output of 67,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boed), making it the second-largest oil and gas producer in Denmark behind French oil major Total, the Norwegian company said. Noreco said the deal comprised proven and probable (2P) reserves of 209 million barrels of oil equivalents (mmboe) at the end of last year, 65 percent of which were liquids. Shares in Oslo-listed Noreco surged 90 percent to 288.50 Norwegian crowns ($35.30) on the announcement and closed 54 percent up on the day at 231.50 crowns. Shell’s shares eased by 0.4 percent. The deal gives Noreco a 36.8 percent stake in the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which has assets in 15 offshore fields.  Total, which holds 31.2 percent in DUC, agreed on Sept. 25 to buy an additional 12 percent stake from Chevron, while state-owned Danish company Nordsofonden has the remaining 20 percent. As part of the deal, Noreco will assume all of Shell’s existing commitments and obligations, including the Tyra field redevelopment.  “Noreco expects to maintain strong production in the years to come ... As the Tyra hub is being redeveloped, the portfolio will be revitalised and offer improved economics accompanied by prolonged field life,” Noreco added.    DUC partners decided in December to redevelop the Tyra gas field at a cost of 21 billion Danish crowns ($3.25 billion), prolonging its life and enabling production of more than 200 mmboe. Noreco said funding for the Shell deal would be provided by a private placement of new shares and a convertible bond, as well as a $900 million loan from BMO Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank and Natixis. Noreco’s largest shareholders — CQS, Kite Lake Capital Management, Taconic Capital Advisors and funds managed by York Capital Management — will subscribe to the $160 million convertible bond and 15.6 million new shares at $22.62 per share, it added.

2018-10-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency aims to release its draft rule allowing year-round sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends by February, and end deliberations on the proposal by May, according to a filing with the Office of Management and Budget. President Donald Trump last week announced his intention to lift the summertime ban on sales of so-called E15 gasoline, which was imposed by the EPA to reduce smog. The announcement marked a win for farmers eager to expand the market for corn-based ethanol, and was seen as a political victory for Trump ahead of congressional elections in November. The EPA’s notice was published late on Tuesday.  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said last week he was confident the rule would be ready for the driving season next year, although industry experts said such a timeline was too ambitious. Trump’s announcement capped a months-long effort by the White House to thread the needle between rival corn and oil industry interests, both of which are unhappy with the administration’s handling of the nation’s biofuels policy. The oil industry wants the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires refiners to add ethanol to their fuels, to be overhauled to reduce the burden on refiners, while the powerful corn lobby wants the policy to more aggressively promote the use of biofuels. The oil industry has threatened to take legal action over the administration’s E15 move. Industry participants say the EPA does not have the authority to change the rule on its own and that Trump needs an act of Congress, which could take years. [nL2N1WR1B3] The proposed rule will be coupled with restrictions on the multi-billion biofuel credit trading industry that is aimed at reducing speculation that has contributed to high prices for the credits in recent years. Refiners that are unable to blend biofuels into their fuels are required under the RFS to buy credits from rivals that do.

2018-10-17,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish authorities have rejected granting a building permit to Berkeley Energia (BKY.AX) to open the European Union’s only open-cast uranium mine near Salamanca, a confidential report seen by Reuters showed. A failure to move ahead with the mine would be a blow for the Australian mining company, which is listed in Britain, Spain and Australia and operates no other projects. The 12-page report, issued on July 16, is non binding but it makes it politically difficult for the small northwestern village of Retortillo, where the mine is projected to open, to issue the permit. If the municipality was to disregard the report, it may also pave the way for lawsuits. Local authorities told Retortillo in the report that the permit sought by Berkeley did not meet legal requirements because the company did not own all the land needed for the project, which also lacked key technical information and had to be first authorised by the central Spanish government. It was not clear when the report was shared with Berkeley or the municipality since being issued three months ago. Berkeley’s Chief Executive Paul Atherley declined to comment on the timing on a call with Reuters. He reiterated that there were “two outstanding items” that needed to be resolved before Retortillo could give its permission, and that the company had already responded to these. “We look forward to a response from the CSN (Spanish nuclear authority) and the government on the claims that have been made that they are going to deny the permits for the mine,” he said. Berkeley also said this week that the timing of the licence award remained uncertain, was outside of the company’s control and it was unlikely to be received imminently. Two sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters on Tuesday the Spanish government had decided not to deliver the permits necessary to open the mine. Berkeley shares fell nearly 29 percent before they were suspended from trading. [L8N1WX1DM] The price of uranium, used in nuclear power generation, fell heavily following Japan’s Fukushima disaster of 2011 and has  struggled to recover, but prices have rallied this year. One Asia-based investor in Berkeley who declined to be named said: “Permit risk on this project has been something that the company has always been upfront about to shareholders.” “Until such time as we hear official confirmation from quoted government sources, we view this as an opportunity to add to our positions to benefit the bull market developing in clean base load power supply.” Reporting by Belen Carreno, additional reporting by Melanie Burton, writing by Julien Toyer; Editing by Paul Day and Jane Merriman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/spain-uranium-berkeley-energia/exclusive-spain-rejects-berkeley-uranium-mine-in-confidential-report-idUKL8N1WX5SC,17 Oct 2018,"Spanish authorities have rejected

2018-10-17,"(Adds Salvini comments in Moscow) * Move coincides with Salvini’s visit to Russia * Diplomats: Rome urging EU funding for small Russian firms * Italy resists EU sanctions on states conducting cyber-attacks By Francesco Guarascio and Gabriela Baczynska BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Italy’s eurosceptic government is pushing for a reduction of tensions between the European Union and Russia but risks isolation in Brussels as EU partners seek instead stronger measures to deter Moscow from interfering in EU affairs. Russia has been subjected to EU sanctions since the 2014 Ukraine crisis and Rome has long urged a relaxation of the penalties on the grounds that they have hit Italian firms trading with Moscow. In a new pro-Russia thrust, Italy is now calling on EU partners to back a plan to channel EU money to small Russian firms that operate in sectors not covered by existing EU sanctions on banking, defence and the energy industry, three diplomats told Reuters. That initiative preceded a two-day summit of EU leaders due to start later on Wednesday in Brussels. Rome is also resisting EU proposals to impose sanctions on countries that carry out cyber-attacks, in another move seen as being in favour of Moscow. Diplomats said the new EU sanctions regime would be aimed mostly at Russia, which has been in recent months at the centre of allegations of election meddling via social media in various Western states, as well as cyber warfare and security breaches conducted through electronic means. Italy was the only EU member state that openly resisted the new sanctions regime, according to a confidential EU document seen by Reuters. The diplomatic push in Brussels coincides with a visit by Italy’s far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini to Russia on Wednesday, the second since he was sworn in four months ago. Salvini, who leads Italy’s co-ruling League party, is an admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has rejected allegations of Russian meddling in Western elections. “If we are asked to confirm (the sanctions), we will say no,” Salvini told a business conference in Moscow. “It’s clear that it makes no sense that they are in place.” But asked if Italy would veto a renewal, Salvini said: “We can only play the veto joker once in Europe.” Polls show the League has multiplied its supporters in recent months also thanks to hardline slogans against the European Union. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is likely to repeat calls for better relations with Russia at the EU summit. He is then planning to fly to Moscow next week. Rome’s calls for EU funding to Russian small firms are not expected to be reflected in the joint document that EU leaders will approve at the end of their meeting this week, diplomats said. But the EU Commission could be asked to explore the feasibility of such a plan. The move is likely to be opposed by Britain and eastern European countries who fear that existing sanctions could be by-passed, one diplomat said. A spokeswoman for the EU foreign affairs chief was not immediately available for comments. Italy’s opposition to cyber sanctions has contributed to a softening of the wording of the final joint summit document which in its last draft version says work “should be taken forward” on cyber defences “through EU restrictive measures”. Britain and other backers of the sanctions would have preferred clearer commitments.

2018-10-17,"LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Analysts at Berenberg have sharply raised their price forecasts for European carbon permits in 2019 and 2020, expecting prices to more than double from current levels. Europe’s benchmark carbon price has already more than doubled this year to around 19 euros a tonne, with utilities ramping up hedging ahead of supply cuts coming into effect from 2019 and as more speculative traders entered the market. Analysts at investment bank Berenberg said they now forecast a carbon price of 45 euros a tonne in 2019 and 65 euros a tonne in 2020, up from 25 euros and 30 euros respectively. “We now think we are in a market deficit this year,” Berenberg senior analyst Lawson Steele said at the Carbon Forward conference in London on Wednesday. He said carbon prices would also need to rise to encourage more fuel switching from coal power generation to gas as the European Union seeks to reduce its carbon emissions. “You need 45 euros a tonne (for carbon) for that (fuel switching) to happen,” Steele said.

2018-10-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Greenhouse gases emissions from the largest U.S. industrial plants fell 2.7 percent in 2017, the Trump administration said, as coal plants shut and as that industry competes with cheap natural gas and solar and wind power that emit less pollution. The drop was steeper than in 2016 when emissions fell 2 percent, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said. EPA acting administrator Andrew Wheeler said the data proves that federal regulations are not necessary to drive carbon dioxide reductions.  “Thanks to President Trump’s regulatory reform agenda, the economy is booming, energy production is surging, and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources,” Wheeler said in a release. While Wheeler gave the administration credit for the reductions, which mainly came from the power sector, the numbers also underscore that the administration has not been able to stop the rapid pace of coal plant shutdowns.  Voters in states that produce and burn coal form a large part of President Donald Trump’s base, but the administration has not been able to forge a path for subsidizing aging coal and nuclear plants, despite industrial players urging the administration to act. Trump has said that the climate is changing but he does not know the extent to which humans are causing it, and last year he announced his intention to pull the country out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.  Natural gas releases far less carbon dioxide when burned than coal and a domestic abundance of gas has driven a wave of closures of coal plants. In 2017 utilities shut or converted from coal-to-gas nearly 9,000 megawatts (MW) of coal plants.  Energy Secretary Rick Perry submitted a plan months ago to the White House to subsidize the plants using tools that would support industry when national security is at risk.  Perry told reporters in late September that his agency’s ideas were still being “bandied about” at the White House. A report in Politico this week said that White House officials have put the plan on the shelf, over questions over who would pay for the subsidies.   A coalition of natural gas drillers, consumer advocates, some grid operators, and renewable power interests have opposed subsidizing aging coal and nuclear plants. The trend of U.S. coal plant shutdowns is expected to pick up this year, with power companies expecting to shut 14,000 MW of coal plants in calendar year 2018.

2018-10-17,"PARIS (Reuters) - French utility Engie (ENGIE.PA) and retailer Casino (CASP.PA) launched a joint venture on Wednesday that will invest some 100 million euros ($115 million) a year to build solar panels on the rooftops of supermarkets, hotels and hospitals in France.  Engie will work with Casino to install solar units with generating capacities of up to 1 megawatt (MW) on retail, industrial and municipal buildings, while continuing to build rooftop solar independently for private homes and large ground-mounted utility-scale solar farms. The joint venture between Engie and Casino’s solar unit GreenYellow is called Reservoir Sun and hopes to install about 100 megawatts (MW) of rooftop solar capacity per year in France, at a rhythm of about one new installation per day. France currently has solar generating capacity of 7,660 MW. “The potential of decentralised solar on rooftops is enormous,” Engie chief executive Isabelle Kocher told reporters on Wednesday at a news conference to launch the venture.  Over the past decade Casino has installed rooftop solar on nearly all its own supermarkets, and in the past few years it has also started selling solar plants to third-party customers, including competing supermarket chains.  GreenYellow chief Otmane Hajji said the firm now has 1 million square metres of solar panels in operation, the equivalent of about 200 MW of generating capacity, of which about 80 percent is at Casino and the rest at customer sites.  He estimates that France has some 500 million square metres of rooftop space available for solar.  Excluding residential rooftop solar, GreenYellow estimates it has a 35 percent market share in France. Other players in industrial rooftop solar are Urbasolar, Quadran (TOTF.PA), Engie and the renewables units of EDF (EDF.PA) and Total.  In a business model similar to Tesla (TSLA.O) unit SolarCity, the new Engie-Casino venture will finance, build and operate the solar panels and sell its customers electricity under long-term contracts at rates 10 to 15 percent below regulated power tariffs.  At the end of the contract, customers will own the panels.  Reservoir Sun will target customers with large and steady power consumption, but a typical installation will only cover about 20-30 percent of a client’s power needs because storing power in batteries for nighttime use or selling excess power to the grid is not financially viable for now. The decentralised power plants will have surface areas of 500 to 5,000 square metres, the equivalent of 50 to 500 parking spaces.  Last week, French investment fund Tikehau Capital and state holding company Bpifrance said they had jointly paid 150 million euros for a 24 percent stake in GreenYellow.

2018-10-17,"* Congo says citizens’ rights abused * Angola says acted lawfully to protect sovereignty * Relations between former allies at a low (.) KINSHASA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has summoned the Angolan ambassador over the expulsion of thousands of Congolese migrants from Angola during a crackdown on artisanal diamond mining this month, Congo’s foreign minister said on Wednesday. Congolese migrants and officials have said dozens of people were killed during an operation by Angolan security forces and an allied ethnic group this month. Angola denies this and says many Congolese migrants left voluntarily. “The Government of the Republic of Congo urges...Angola to conduct a comprehensive investigation to establish who is responsible for these wrongful acts,” Foreign Minister Leonard She Okitundu said in a statement. Congo’s ambassador to Angola has been summoned on Wednesday by Angolan authorities to be briefed on the case, he said. The dispute comes at a time of worsening relations between the government of Congolese President Joseph Kabila and its erstwhile ally to the south. Two decades ago, Angola stepped in to rescue Kabila’s father, then president Laurent Kabila, from a Rwandan-backed rebel assault. But Angola has recently become frustrated by Kabila junior’s handling of several crises, including instability caused by his failure to step aside when his mandate ended in late 2016, and a conflict in Congo’s Kasai province that sent thousands of refugees over the border. Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende said about 28,000 Congolese had been “brutally” expelled in violation of an agreement between the two countries on freedom of movement. Angolan Police Commissioner Antonio Bernardo dismissed the accusations of violence on Wednesday, and said that the border agreement only allowed for visits up to 48 hours. “Angola is a sovereign country,” he told Reuters. “The defence of sovereignty necessarily includes the safeguarding of national security, the protection of its natural resources.” He said the Congolese migrants were residing in the country illegally, and had already received “selfless assistance” despite their status, and had left of their own free will. Angola has in recent weeks stepped up efforts to tackle diamond smuggling and raise more revenue from the lucrative sector.

2018-10-17,"STOCKHOLM, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday it has been in talks with Volvo over the last few weeks about an issue with their catalytic converters that was causing some vehicles to exceed nitrogen oxide emission limits. Volvo warned a day earlier that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions as an emissions control component it uses was degrading more quickly than expected. The Swedish truckmaker said it could face material costs to deal with the issue largely affecting trucks and buses sold in North America and Europe, its two largest markets, and that it was working with authorities to find a solution. A spokesperson for the EPA told Reuters via email on Wednesday that the body was aware of the situation, which it said involved Volvo heavy duty trucks. “Over the last few weeks, EPA and the California Air Resources Board have been communicating with Volvo about the problem and are now continuing to meet with the company to develop plans to quickly address this situation.” Asked why Volvo had waited a couple of weeks before informing the market, a Volvo spokesman said the company needed to see whether this would be a large issue and it was standard protocol to inform authorities first. “Authorities and legal bodies are normally informed prior to the markets because we inform them even if the problem is very, very small,” he said. Volvo has not detailed when the affected trucks were sold or how many trucks are impacted, but has said only that all products equipped with the component met emissions limits at delivery. The company sold 51,693 trucks in North America last year and another 115,863 in Europe. EPA and CARB declined to comment when asked how many trucks were involved, while a spokesman for Volvo said it was too early to know. “We... are working with the company to more fully understand what’s going on,” a spokesman for CARB said in a brief separate comment, without giving more details.

2018-10-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - A Nigerian politician who was jailed in Britain for laundering tens of millions of dollars in stolen public funds through British banks and properties lost an appeal against his conviction in London on Wednesday. The Court of Appeal’s ruling against James Ibori, a former governor of oil-producing Delta State in southern Nigeria, is a relief for the British authorities at a time when they are trying to stem the flow of dirty money from overseas through London. Ibori, who in his heyday was one of Nigeria’s richest and most powerful men, pleaded guilty in a London court in 2012 to 10 counts of fraud and money-laundering involving sums amounting to at least 50 million pounds ($66 million).  He received a 13-year jail sentence of which he served half, as is common in the British system, and is now back in Nigeria. Anti-corruption campaigners had hailed the case as a milestone for Nigeria, where no one of his stature had been successfully prosecuted, and for its former colonial ruler Britain, long seen as too complacent about the proceeds of Nigerian corruption being laundered in the UK. Ibori owned multi-million-pound homes in Britain, South Africa and United States, including an English country house near the private school where his children were being educated. He also owned a Jaguar and a Bentley and was buying a $20-million private jet at the time of his arrest. This contrasted sharply with the situation in Delta State, a maze of mangrove creeks criss-crossed by pipelines and plagued by violent conflict over access to oil money, where most people make do without electricity or clean water. Wednesday’s ruling will allow Britain to resume efforts to confiscate millions of dollars’ worth of assets and return them to Nigerian public coffers. The assets have been frozen for years while the case has been dragging through the courts. Despite his guilty pleas, Ibori appealed against his conviction alleging that one of the British police officers who investigated him had taken bribes from a private detective in return for inside tips about the probe. The officer denies this. Ibori also alleged that British prosecutors had covered up the corruption, tainting the judicial process. These allegations had threatened to turn the case into a major embarrassment for Britain. But three senior appeal judges said the bribery was not proven, and if it had happened, Ibori himself had instigated it as the private detective was working for him. “As Ibori was instrumental in (the officer’s) corruption, if corruption there was, he cannot, even arguably, rely upon it to escape his convictions,” the ruling said. Britain is currently trying to crack down on money-laundering by people involved in corrupt politics or business abroad. Police say about 100 billion pounds of dirty cash moves through or into Britain each year. The Ibori case, which pre-dated the current crackdown by over a decade, relied on evidence obtained in Britain and Nigeria during several years of close cooperation between the British police and Nigeria’s own anti-corruption force. Ibori has now resumed political activities in Delta State. He says he has no faith in British justice and that the case against him is politically motivated.

Crude futures fell for the first session in four after U.S. government data showed a much larger-than-expected build in crude inventories. The U.S. dollar rose as the market awaited the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting. Lower-than-expected UK inflation data weighed on sterling, which gave up the previous day’s gains. On Wall Street, IBM fell 7.4 percent, dragging blue-chips lower a day after the company missed revenue expectations. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 posted the biggest daily gain since late March. Stocks extended losses when oil prices fell further. “The (stock) indices are pulling back after yesterday’s blockbuster earnings rally that is likely to be challenged by the Fed’s FOMC minutes,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 266.91 points, or 1.03 percent, to 25,531.51, the S&P 500 lost 25.22 points, or 0.90 percent, to 2,784.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 76.18 points, or 1 percent, to 7,569.31. European stocks hit a one-week high in early trade, but then were pulled lower by a 2.5 percent fall in an index of auto stocks. Goldman Sachs said slow demand in China could hit earnings in the sector. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.71 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.71 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.34 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.64 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.29 percent. Oil traders took profits after a three day run-up in prices, with losses extending after data showed U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected. U.S. crude fell 2.74 percent to $69.95 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.55, down 2.28 percent on the day. The euro fell 0.38 percent to $1.1529 and Sterling was last trading at $1.3134, down 0.38 percent on the day. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.15 percent versus the greenback at 112.09 per dollar. The dollar index rose 0.34 percent. Minutes of the last Fed meeting, due Wednesday, should feed expectations of further tightening. The Brazilian real rose against the dollar after data showed economic activity rose more than expected in August. U.S. Treasury yields continued to trade range-bound after a massive runup last week.

Production of coking coal, also known as metallurgical coal, at the mines in Illawarra rose to 1.5 million tonnes in the first quarter of the 2019 fiscal year from 494,000 tonnes a year earlier. That handily beat a UBS estimate of 1.2 million tonnes. South32 had suspended operations at its Appin coal mine on the order of a government regulator last June due to concerns over high gas levels in the mine. “Illawarra Metallurgical Coal ... enjoyed a strong start to the year as an improvement in longwall productivity underpinned an annualised production rate of 7.6Mt in the quarter,” Chief Executive Graham Kerr said in a statement. The world’s largest manganese miner produced 1.4 million tonnes of the commodity during the quarter, about 11 percent higher over last year. However, in the July-September quarter, the company reported a 12 percent drop up in alumina sales from its Worsley Alumina refinery, hit by maintenance efforts. South32 maintained fiscal 2019 production guidance for all its operations.

2018-10-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to turn up sanctions pressure on Venezuela but sees less need to immediately target its energy sector, given sagging production from the OPEC member’s state-run oil company, a senior U.S. administration official said on Wednesday. The U.S. government has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Venezuelan military and political figures close to socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who it blames for trampling on human rights and triggering the country’s economic collapse. Earlier this year, the Trump administration had weighed escalating sanctions by targeting a Venezuelan military-run oil services company or restricting insurance coverage for oil shipments. The actions would have built upon last year’s ban for U.S. banks from any new debt deals with Venezuelan authorities or state-run oil giant PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]. Asked by reporters whether the U.S. government had slowed down on its push for sectoral sanctions, the senior official described them as some of the many “tools” it is keeping in reserve. “With regards to Venezuela, all options are on the table,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “The fact is that the greatest sanction on Venezuelan oil and oil production is called Nicolas Maduro, and PDVSA’s inefficiencies,” the official said. Venezuela’s crude oil production hit a 28-year low in 2017, a slump blamed on poor management and corruption. “At the end of the day, Nicolas Maduro has taken care of really running PDVSA to the ground, and essentially more and more making it a non-factor,” he said. Almost 2 million Venezuelans have fled since 2015, driven out by food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime. The exodus has overwhelmed neighboring countries. Maduro, who denies limiting political freedoms, has said he is the victim of an “economic war” led by U.S.-backed adversaries. The Trump administration also plans to ramp up economic pressure on Cuba’s military and intelligence services, the official said. In his speech last month to the United Nations, President Donald Trump linked Venezuela’s crises to “its Cuban sponsors.” “That is a message that we will continue to put out, but frankly its a message that the region needs to talk about,” the official said, noting John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, is expected to elaborate on the issue publicly soon. “The issue of Cuban involvement in Venezuela is a fact. It’s not a theory, it’s not a story,” the official said.

2018-10-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories rose by much more than expected and exports fell, while the dollar added to gains after minutes showed Federal Reserve policy makers largely united on the need to raise borrowing costs further. A gauge of stocks across the world dipped, tracking Wall Street’s reaction to the Fed minutes, while the outlook on earnings soured after a warning on the European auto sector and a revenue miss from IBM. WTI crude touched its lowest price in a month after U.S. stockpiles rose by 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast. This happened even as U.S. crude production slipped last week, partly as offshore facilities closed temporarily for Hurricane Michael. WTI CLc1 fell 2.63 percent to $70.03 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $80.32, down 1.34 percent on the day. “A tick higher in refining activity and a drop in production due to hurricane activity in the Gulf was not enough to halt a fourth consecutive climb in (inventories)- and a solid one at that,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. Every Federal Reserve policy maker backed raising interest rates last month in a meeting where they also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further, according to the minutes from the meeting. The dollar index hit session highs after the Fed minutes were released, although the bulk of Wednesday’s leg up came before the news. “There was a pretty well-formed expectation that it would more likely showcase a Fed that’s more confident and assertive debating tighter policy,” said Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. The euro EUR= fell 0.64 percent to $1.1499 and Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3115, down 0.52 percent on the day. Lower-than-expected UK inflation data weighed on sterling, which gave up the previous day’s gains. The Japanese yen weakened 0.35 percent versus the greenback at 112.65 per dollar. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.63 percent. On Wall Street, IBM (IBM.N) fell 7.6 percent, dragging blue chips lower a day after the company missed revenue expectations. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 posted the biggest daily gain since late March. Stocks extended losses when oil prices fell further, but the S&P 500 shifted in and out of losses after the Fed minutes and ended down less than a point. “This is consistent with the Fed’s rhetoric that they will continue to gradually raise interest rates. A lot has to happen for the Fed not to move again in December,” said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “The stock market would have to go into a persistent, prolonged decline to change the Fed’s outlook on the economy.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 91.74 points, or 0.36 percent, to 25,706.68, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.71 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,809.21 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.79 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,642.70.

2018-10-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with U.S. futures settling below $70 a barrel for the first time in a month, after U.S. crude stockpiles rose 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast, while exports dropped. Oil had been rising this week on worries about Iranian sanctions and tensions between the United States and Saudi Arabia after the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  U.S. crude oil CLc1 slumped $2.17, or 3 percent, to settle at $69.75 a barrel. “Today’s price decline to below our expected support at the $70 level would appear to set the trade up for a weaker pricing environment than we had anticipated,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York, said some speculators may have interest in getting out when prices are below $70, which could accentuate the selloff.  Volume was above average on Wednesday, with more than 627,000 U.S. crude contracts changing hands, compared with a 10-month daily average of about 583,000 contracts. Brent crude LCOc1 also dipped below $80 a barrel but ended at $80.05, $1.36 or 1.7 percent lower. The global benchmark is trading nearly $7 below a four-year high of $86.74 reached on Oct. 3. U.S. crude stocks rose 6.5 million barrels last week, the fourth straight weekly build, as exports were down to 1.8 million barrels per day, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said, in a report analysts characterized as bearish. [EIA/S]  Inventories rose sharply even as U.S. crude production slipped 300,000 bpd to 10.9 million bpd last week, which analysts attributed to the effects of offshore facilities closing temporarily for Hurricane Michael.  “A tick higher in refining activity and a drop in production due to hurricane activity in the Gulf was not enough to halt a fourth consecutive climb in stocks,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. The scandal over the disappearance of prominent Saudi critic and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared two weeks ago after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, underpinned oil markets earlier in the week. U.S. lawmakers pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership, suggesting sanctions could be possible. Western pressure mounted on Riyadh to provide answers, but President Donald Trump’s comments suggested that White House may not take additional action against the Saudis, particularly after Saudi Arabia said it will conduct an investigation.  On Wednesday, Trump denied that he is giving cover to the Saudis, and that the results of the investigation into Khashoggi’s death should be known within a week.  Investors worry Saudi Arabia could use oil supply to retaliate against critics. Such a move would roil markets, as the Saudis have not used oil as a policy weapon since the oil embargo of the early 1970s, and the market is already anticipating reduced supply when sanctions on Iranian oil exports resume on Nov. 4. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of breaking an OPEC-led agreement on output cuts by producing more crude, which will thus hurt their market share.

2018-10-17,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday it has been in talks with Volvo over the last few weeks about an issue with catalytic converters causing some of its vehicles to exceed nitrogen oxide emission limits. Volvo warned a day earlier that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions due to an emissions control component it uses degrading more quickly than expected. The Swedish truckmaker said it could face material costs to deal with the issue largely affecting trucks and buses sold in North America and Europe, its two largest markets, and that it was working with authorities to find a solution. The EPA, in an emailed statement, told Reuters on Wednesday that the agency was aware of the situation, which it said involved Volvo heavy duty trucks. “Over the last few weeks, EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have been communicating with Volvo about the problem and are now continuing to meet with the company to develop plans to quickly address this situation,” the EPA statement said. A U.S. government official briefed on the matter said on Wednesday that regulators do not believe excess emissions are the result of a “defeat device” or intentional misconduct as in the case of Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) excess diesel emissions, but rather is believed to be the result of a faulty component and a recall is expected. Asked why Volvo had waited a couple of weeks before informing the market, a Volvo spokesman said the company needed to determine whether this would be a large issue and it was standard protocol to inform authorities first. “Authorities and legal bodies are normally informed prior to the markets because we inform them even if the problem is very, very small,” he said. Volvo did not say when the affected trucks were sold or how many are impacted. It said that all products equipped with the component met emissions limits at delivery. The company sold 51,693 trucks in North America last year and another 115,863 in Europe. EPA and CARB declined to comment about how many trucks were involved, while a spokesman for Volvo said it was too early to know. “We... are working with the company to more fully understand what’s going on,” a spokesman for CARB said in a brief separate comment, without giving more details.

2018-10-17,"ADDIS ABABA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - German mechanical engineering conglomerate Voith has signed an agreement to supply turbines for a $4 billion dam Ethiopia is building along the River Nile, state-affiliated media said on Wednesday. The 6,000 megawatt Grand Renaissance Dam is the centrepiece of the Horn of Africa country’s bid to become the continent’s biggest power exporter. The agreement with Voith, which has already supplied 13 out of the dam’s 16 turbines alongside France’s Alstom, was made after the government, due to delays, cancelled a contract with its military-run Metals and Engineering Corporation (METEC)to provide the remaining three turbines, sustaining losses. “The contract was awarded to Voith in a tender floated two weeks ago at a $5.9 million discount from each (of the three) turbine,” Fana Broadcasting Corporation quoted METEC’s commercial operations head Abdulaziz Mohammed as saying. Italian firm Salini Impregilo remains the main contractor building the dam, while METEC was the contractor for the electromechanical and hydraulic steel structure divisions of the project. In August, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed acknowledged that the dam would face a delay of several years having initially been expected to be completed by 2020. The government plans to restructure METEC, which is set to be renamed as the National Metal Engineering Corporation.

A gauge of stocks across the world dipped, tracking Wall Street’s reaction to the Fed minutes, while the outlook on earnings soured after a warning on the European auto sector and a revenue miss from IBM. WTI crude touched its lowest price in a month after U.S. stockpiles rose by 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast. This happened even as U.S. crude production slipped last week, partly as offshore facilities closed temporarily for Hurricane Michael. WTI fell 2.81 percent to $69.90 per barrel and Brent was last at $80.08, down 1.63 percent on the day. “A tick higher in refining activity and a drop in production due to hurricane activity in the Gulf was not enough to halt a fourth consecutive climb in (inventories)- and a solid one at that,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. Every Federal Reserve policymaker backed raising interest rates last month in a meeting where they also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further, according to the minutes from the meeting. The dollar index hit session highs after the Fed minutes were released, although the bulk of Wednesday’s rally came before the news. “There was a pretty well-formed expectation that it would more likely showcase a Fed that’s more confident and assertive debating tighter policy,” said Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.1503 and Sterling was last trading at $1.3117, down 0.51 percent on the day. Lower-than-expected UK inflation data weighed on sterling, which gave up the previous day’s gains. The Japanese yen weakened 0.22 percent versus the greenback at 112.53 per dollar. The dollar index rose 0.57 percent. On Wall Street, IBM fell 7.7 percent, dragging blue-chips lower a day after the company missed revenue expectations. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 posted the biggest daily gain since late March.

2018-10-17,"PARIS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Global carbon emissions will rise to a new record level in 2018, making the chances of reaching a target to keep temperature increases to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius remote, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday. IEA’s Fatih Birol told a conference in Paris that data for the first nine months of the years was already pointing to a record increase in carbon emissions. A United Nations report last week said society would have to make changes to how it consumes energy, travels and builds, to meet a lower global warming target. “Sorry, I have very bad news. My numbers are giving me some despair,” Birol told the conference at the Polish embassy in Paris. Poland will host United Nations COP24 talks in December, which will lay out a “rule book” to implement a historic accord reached in Paris in 2015. That agreement set goals to phase out fossil fuel use this century, shift towards cleaner energies and help limit a rise in temperatures. “Looking at data for the first nine months of this year, emissions this year will increase once again ... global emissions will reach a record historical high,” Birol said. “Therefore the chances of reaching such ambitious targets in my view, are becoming weaker and weaker every year, every month,” he said.

2018-10-17,"OSLO (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to sell its Danish upstream business to Norwegian Energy (Noreco) in a deal valuing the assets at $1.9 billion, as part of its wider divestment strategy, the company said on Wednesday. The sale brings Shell’s three-year $30 billon divestment plan close to its conclusion, having begun the process in 2015 after the acquisition of BG Group. Deals so far have included large portfolios in the British North Sea, Gabon, Thailand and Canada. “Today’s announcement is consistent with Shell’s strategy to simplify its portfolio through a $30 billion divestment program and contributes to our goal of reshaping the company into a world-class investment case,” Shell’s upstream director, Andy Brown, said in a statement. The payment from Noreco to Shell will be adjusted for the cash flow Shell has generated since the deal’s effective date, which will be set to Jan. 1, 2017. “We expect to pay around $1.2 billion,” Noreco’s Chairman Riulf Rustad confirmed to Reuters. He said Noreco and Shell started discussions about the deal around January 2017. Reuters reported in February 2017 that Shell was seeking to sell its upstream assets in Denmark.  However, Shell will transfer $1.1 billion of decommissioning liabilities associated with the assets to the buyer, analyst Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets noted. For Noreco, the transaction will add output of 67,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boed), making it the second-largest oil and gas producer in Denmark behind French oil major Total, the Norwegian company said. Noreco said the deal comprised proven and probable (2P) reserves of 209 million barrels of oil equivalents (mmboe) at the end of last year, 65 percent of which were liquids. Shares in Oslo-listed Noreco surged 90 percent to 288.50 Norwegian crowns ($35.30) on the announcement and closed 54 percent up on the day at 231.50 crowns. Shell’s shares eased by 0.4 percent. The deal gives Noreco a 36.8 percent stake in the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which has assets in 15 offshore fields.  Total, which holds 31.2 percent in DUC, agreed on Sept. 25 to buy an additional 12 percent stake from Chevron, while state-owned Danish company Nordsofonden has the remaining 20 percent. As part of the deal, Noreco will assume all of Shell’s existing commitments and obligations, including the Tyra field redevelopment.  “Noreco expects to maintain strong production in the years to come ... As the Tyra hub is being redeveloped, the portfolio will be revitalised and offer improved economics accompanied by prolonged field life,” Noreco added.    DUC partners decided in December to redevelop the Tyra gas field at a cost of 21 billion Danish crowns ($3.25 billion), prolonging its life and enabling production of more than 200 mmboe. Noreco said funding for the Shell deal would be provided by a private placement of new shares and a convertible bond, as well as a $900 million loan from BMO Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank and Natixis. Noreco’s largest shareholders — CQS, Kite Lake Capital Management, Taconic Capital Advisors and funds managed by York Capital Management — will subscribe to the $160 million convertible bond and 15.6 million new shares at $22.62 per share, it added.

2018-10-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency aims to release its draft rule allowing year-round sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends by February, and end deliberations on the proposal by May, according to a filing with the Office of Management and Budget. President Donald Trump last week announced his intention to lift the summertime ban on sales of so-called E15 gasoline, which was imposed by the EPA to reduce smog. The announcement marked a win for farmers eager to expand the market for corn-based ethanol, and was seen as a political victory for Trump ahead of congressional elections in November. The EPA’s notice was published late on Tuesday.  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said last week he was confident the rule would be ready for the driving season next year, although industry experts said such a timeline was too ambitious. Trump’s announcement capped a months-long effort by the White House to thread the needle between rival corn and oil industry interests, both of which are unhappy with the administration’s handling of the nation’s biofuels policy. The oil industry wants the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires refiners to add ethanol to their fuels, to be overhauled to reduce the burden on refiners, while the powerful corn lobby wants the policy to more aggressively promote the use of biofuels. The oil industry has threatened to take legal action over the administration’s E15 move. Industry participants say the EPA does not have the authority to change the rule on its own and that Trump needs an act of Congress, which could take years. [nL2N1WR1B3] The proposed rule will be coupled with restrictions on the multi-billion biofuel credit trading industry that is aimed at reducing speculation that has contributed to high prices for the credits in recent years. Refiners that are unable to blend biofuels into their fuels are required under the RFS to buy credits from rivals that do.

2018-10-17,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish authorities have rejected granting a building permit to Berkeley Energia (BKY.AX) to open the European Union’s only open-cast uranium mine near Salamanca, a confidential report seen by Reuters showed. A failure to move ahead with the mine would be a blow for the Australian mining company, which is listed in Britain, Spain and Australia and operates no other projects. The 12-page report, issued on July 16, is non binding but it makes it politically difficult for the small northwestern village of Retortillo, where the mine is projected to open, to issue the permit. If the municipality was to disregard the report, it may also pave the way for lawsuits. Local authorities told Retortillo in the report that the permit sought by Berkeley did not meet legal requirements because the company did not own all the land needed for the project, which also lacked key technical information and had to be first authorised by the central Spanish government. It was not clear when the report was shared with Berkeley or the municipality since being issued three months ago. Berkeley’s Chief Executive Paul Atherley declined to comment on the timing on a call with Reuters. He reiterated that there were “two outstanding items” that needed to be resolved before Retortillo could give its permission, and that the company had already responded to these. “We look forward to a response from the CSN (Spanish nuclear authority) and the government on the claims that have been made that they are going to deny the permits for the mine,” he said. Berkeley also said this week that the timing of the licence award remained uncertain, was outside of the company’s control and it was unlikely to be received imminently. Two sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters on Tuesday the Spanish government had decided not to deliver the permits necessary to open the mine. Berkeley shares fell nearly 29 percent before they were suspended from trading. [L8N1WX1DM] The price of uranium, used in nuclear power generation, fell heavily following Japan’s Fukushima disaster of 2011 and has  struggled to recover, but prices have rallied this year. One Asia-based investor in Berkeley who declined to be named said: “Permit risk on this project has been something that the company has always been upfront about to shareholders.” “Until such time as we hear official confirmation from quoted government sources, we view this as an opportunity to add to our positions to benefit the bull market developing in clean base load power supply.” Reporting by Belen Carreno, additional reporting by Melanie Burton, writing by Julien Toyer; Editing by Paul Day and Jane Merriman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/spain-uranium-berkeley-energia/exclusive-spain-rejects-berkeley-uranium-mine-in-confidential-report-idUKL8N1WX5SC,17 Oct 2018,"Spanish authorities have rejected

2018-10-17,"(Adds Salvini comments in Moscow) * Move coincides with Salvini’s visit to Russia * Diplomats: Rome urging EU funding for small Russian firms * Italy resists EU sanctions on states conducting cyber-attacks By Francesco Guarascio and Gabriela Baczynska BRUSSELS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Italy’s eurosceptic government is pushing for a reduction of tensions between the European Union and Russia but risks isolation in Brussels as EU partners seek instead stronger measures to deter Moscow from interfering in EU affairs. Russia has been subjected to EU sanctions since the 2014 Ukraine crisis and Rome has long urged a relaxation of the penalties on the grounds that they have hit Italian firms trading with Moscow. In a new pro-Russia thrust, Italy is now calling on EU partners to back a plan to channel EU money to small Russian firms that operate in sectors not covered by existing EU sanctions on banking, defence and the energy industry, three diplomats told Reuters. That initiative preceded a two-day summit of EU leaders due to start later on Wednesday in Brussels. Rome is also resisting EU proposals to impose sanctions on countries that carry out cyber-attacks, in another move seen as being in favour of Moscow. Diplomats said the new EU sanctions regime would be aimed mostly at Russia, which has been in recent months at the centre of allegations of election meddling via social media in various Western states, as well as cyber warfare and security breaches conducted through electronic means. Italy was the only EU member state that openly resisted the new sanctions regime, according to a confidential EU document seen by Reuters. The diplomatic push in Brussels coincides with a visit by Italy’s far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini to Russia on Wednesday, the second since he was sworn in four months ago. Salvini, who leads Italy’s co-ruling League party, is an admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has rejected allegations of Russian meddling in Western elections. “If we are asked to confirm (the sanctions), we will say no,” Salvini told a business conference in Moscow. “It’s clear that it makes no sense that they are in place.” But asked if Italy would veto a renewal, Salvini said: “We can only play the veto joker once in Europe.” Polls show the League has multiplied its supporters in recent months also thanks to hardline slogans against the European Union. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is likely to repeat calls for better relations with Russia at the EU summit. He is then planning to fly to Moscow next week. Rome’s calls for EU funding to Russian small firms are not expected to be reflected in the joint document that EU leaders will approve at the end of their meeting this week, diplomats said. But the EU Commission could be asked to explore the feasibility of such a plan. The move is likely to be opposed by Britain and eastern European countries who fear that existing sanctions could be by-passed, one diplomat said. A spokeswoman for the EU foreign affairs chief was not immediately available for comments. Italy’s opposition to cyber sanctions has contributed to a softening of the wording of the final joint summit document which in its last draft version says work “should be taken forward” on cyber defences “through EU restrictive measures”. Britain and other backers of the sanctions would have preferred clearer commitments.

2018-10-17,"LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Analysts at Berenberg have sharply raised their price forecasts for European carbon permits in 2019 and 2020, expecting prices to more than double from current levels. Europe’s benchmark carbon price has already more than doubled this year to around 19 euros a tonne, with utilities ramping up hedging ahead of supply cuts coming into effect from 2019 and as more speculative traders entered the market. Analysts at investment bank Berenberg said they now forecast a carbon price of 45 euros a tonne in 2019 and 65 euros a tonne in 2020, up from 25 euros and 30 euros respectively. “We now think we are in a market deficit this year,” Berenberg senior analyst Lawson Steele said at the Carbon Forward conference in London on Wednesday. He said carbon prices would also need to rise to encourage more fuel switching from coal power generation to gas as the European Union seeks to reduce its carbon emissions. “You need 45 euros a tonne (for carbon) for that (fuel switching) to happen,” Steele said.

2018-10-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Greenhouse gases emissions from the largest U.S. industrial plants fell 2.7 percent in 2017, the Trump administration said, as coal plants shut and as that industry competes with cheap natural gas and solar and wind power that emit less pollution. The drop was steeper than in 2016 when emissions fell 2 percent, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said. EPA acting administrator Andrew Wheeler said the data proves that federal regulations are not necessary to drive carbon dioxide reductions.  “Thanks to President Trump’s regulatory reform agenda, the economy is booming, energy production is surging, and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources,” Wheeler said in a release. While Wheeler gave the administration credit for the reductions, which mainly came from the power sector, the numbers also underscore that the administration has not been able to stop the rapid pace of coal plant shutdowns.  Voters in states that produce and burn coal form a large part of President Donald Trump’s base, but the administration has not been able to forge a path for subsidizing aging coal and nuclear plants, despite industrial players urging the administration to act. Trump has said that the climate is changing but he does not know the extent to which humans are causing it, and last year he announced his intention to pull the country out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.  Natural gas releases far less carbon dioxide when burned than coal and a domestic abundance of gas has driven a wave of closures of coal plants. In 2017 utilities shut or converted from coal-to-gas nearly 9,000 megawatts (MW) of coal plants.  Energy Secretary Rick Perry submitted a plan months ago to the White House to subsidize the plants using tools that would support industry when national security is at risk.  Perry told reporters in late September that his agency’s ideas were still being “bandied about” at the White House. A report in Politico this week said that White House officials have put the plan on the shelf, over questions over who would pay for the subsidies.   A coalition of natural gas drillers, consumer advocates, some grid operators, and renewable power interests have opposed subsidizing aging coal and nuclear plants. The trend of U.S. coal plant shutdowns is expected to pick up this year, with power companies expecting to shut 14,000 MW of coal plants in calendar year 2018.

2018-10-17,"PARIS (Reuters) - French utility Engie (ENGIE.PA) and retailer Casino (CASP.PA) launched a joint venture on Wednesday that will invest some 100 million euros ($115 million) a year to build solar panels on the rooftops of supermarkets, hotels and hospitals in France.  Engie will work with Casino to install solar units with generating capacities of up to 1 megawatt (MW) on retail, industrial and municipal buildings, while continuing to build rooftop solar independently for private homes and large ground-mounted utility-scale solar farms. The joint venture between Engie and Casino’s solar unit GreenYellow is called Reservoir Sun and hopes to install about 100 megawatts (MW) of rooftop solar capacity per year in France, at a rhythm of about one new installation per day. France currently has solar generating capacity of 7,660 MW. “The potential of decentralised solar on rooftops is enormous,” Engie chief executive Isabelle Kocher told reporters on Wednesday at a news conference to launch the venture.  Over the past decade Casino has installed rooftop solar on nearly all its own supermarkets, and in the past few years it has also started selling solar plants to third-party customers, including competing supermarket chains.  GreenYellow chief Otmane Hajji said the firm now has 1 million square metres of solar panels in operation, the equivalent of about 200 MW of generating capacity, of which about 80 percent is at Casino and the rest at customer sites.  He estimates that France has some 500 million square metres of rooftop space available for solar.  Excluding residential rooftop solar, GreenYellow estimates it has a 35 percent market share in France. Other players in industrial rooftop solar are Urbasolar, Quadran (TOTF.PA), Engie and the renewables units of EDF (EDF.PA) and Total.  In a business model similar to Tesla (TSLA.O) unit SolarCity, the new Engie-Casino venture will finance, build and operate the solar panels and sell its customers electricity under long-term contracts at rates 10 to 15 percent below regulated power tariffs.  At the end of the contract, customers will own the panels.  Reservoir Sun will target customers with large and steady power consumption, but a typical installation will only cover about 20-30 percent of a client’s power needs because storing power in batteries for nighttime use or selling excess power to the grid is not financially viable for now. The decentralised power plants will have surface areas of 500 to 5,000 square metres, the equivalent of 50 to 500 parking spaces.  Last week, French investment fund Tikehau Capital and state holding company Bpifrance said they had jointly paid 150 million euros for a 24 percent stake in GreenYellow.

2018-10-17,"* Congo says citizens’ rights abused * Angola says acted lawfully to protect sovereignty * Relations between former allies at a low (.) KINSHASA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has summoned the Angolan ambassador over the expulsion of thousands of Congolese migrants from Angola during a crackdown on artisanal diamond mining this month, Congo’s foreign minister said on Wednesday. Congolese migrants and officials have said dozens of people were killed during an operation by Angolan security forces and an allied ethnic group this month. Angola denies this and says many Congolese migrants left voluntarily. “The Government of the Republic of Congo urges...Angola to conduct a comprehensive investigation to establish who is responsible for these wrongful acts,” Foreign Minister Leonard She Okitundu said in a statement. Congo’s ambassador to Angola has been summoned on Wednesday by Angolan authorities to be briefed on the case, he said. The dispute comes at a time of worsening relations between the government of Congolese President Joseph Kabila and its erstwhile ally to the south. Two decades ago, Angola stepped in to rescue Kabila’s father, then president Laurent Kabila, from a Rwandan-backed rebel assault. But Angola has recently become frustrated by Kabila junior’s handling of several crises, including instability caused by his failure to step aside when his mandate ended in late 2016, and a conflict in Congo’s Kasai province that sent thousands of refugees over the border. Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende said about 28,000 Congolese had been “brutally” expelled in violation of an agreement between the two countries on freedom of movement. Angolan Police Commissioner Antonio Bernardo dismissed the accusations of violence on Wednesday, and said that the border agreement only allowed for visits up to 48 hours. “Angola is a sovereign country,” he told Reuters. “The defence of sovereignty necessarily includes the safeguarding of national security, the protection of its natural resources.” He said the Congolese migrants were residing in the country illegally, and had already received “selfless assistance” despite their status, and had left of their own free will. Angola has in recent weeks stepped up efforts to tackle diamond smuggling and raise more revenue from the lucrative sector.

2018-10-17,"STOCKHOLM, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday it has been in talks with Volvo over the last few weeks about an issue with their catalytic converters that was causing some vehicles to exceed nitrogen oxide emission limits. Volvo warned a day earlier that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions as an emissions control component it uses was degrading more quickly than expected. The Swedish truckmaker said it could face material costs to deal with the issue largely affecting trucks and buses sold in North America and Europe, its two largest markets, and that it was working with authorities to find a solution. A spokesperson for the EPA told Reuters via email on Wednesday that the body was aware of the situation, which it said involved Volvo heavy duty trucks. “Over the last few weeks, EPA and the California Air Resources Board have been communicating with Volvo about the problem and are now continuing to meet with the company to develop plans to quickly address this situation.” Asked why Volvo had waited a couple of weeks before informing the market, a Volvo spokesman said the company needed to see whether this would be a large issue and it was standard protocol to inform authorities first. “Authorities and legal bodies are normally informed prior to the markets because we inform them even if the problem is very, very small,” he said. Volvo has not detailed when the affected trucks were sold or how many trucks are impacted, but has said only that all products equipped with the component met emissions limits at delivery. The company sold 51,693 trucks in North America last year and another 115,863 in Europe. EPA and CARB declined to comment when asked how many trucks were involved, while a spokesman for Volvo said it was too early to know. “We... are working with the company to more fully understand what’s going on,” a spokesman for CARB said in a brief separate comment, without giving more details.

2018-10-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - A Nigerian politician who was jailed in Britain for laundering tens of millions of dollars in stolen public funds through British banks and properties lost an appeal against his conviction in London on Wednesday. The Court of Appeal’s ruling against James Ibori, a former governor of oil-producing Delta State in southern Nigeria, is a relief for the British authorities at a time when they are trying to stem the flow of dirty money from overseas through London. Ibori, who in his heyday was one of Nigeria’s richest and most powerful men, pleaded guilty in a London court in 2012 to 10 counts of fraud and money-laundering involving sums amounting to at least 50 million pounds ($66 million).  He received a 13-year jail sentence of which he served half, as is common in the British system, and is now back in Nigeria. Anti-corruption campaigners had hailed the case as a milestone for Nigeria, where no one of his stature had been successfully prosecuted, and for its former colonial ruler Britain, long seen as too complacent about the proceeds of Nigerian corruption being laundered in the UK. Ibori owned multi-million-pound homes in Britain, South Africa and United States, including an English country house near the private school where his children were being educated. He also owned a Jaguar and a Bentley and was buying a $20-million private jet at the time of his arrest. This contrasted sharply with the situation in Delta State, a maze of mangrove creeks criss-crossed by pipelines and plagued by violent conflict over access to oil money, where most people make do without electricity or clean water. Wednesday’s ruling will allow Britain to resume efforts to confiscate millions of dollars’ worth of assets and return them to Nigerian public coffers. The assets have been frozen for years while the case has been dragging through the courts. Despite his guilty pleas, Ibori appealed against his conviction alleging that one of the British police officers who investigated him had taken bribes from a private detective in return for inside tips about the probe. The officer denies this. Ibori also alleged that British prosecutors had covered up the corruption, tainting the judicial process. These allegations had threatened to turn the case into a major embarrassment for Britain. But three senior appeal judges said the bribery was not proven, and if it had happened, Ibori himself had instigated it as the private detective was working for him. “As Ibori was instrumental in (the officer’s) corruption, if corruption there was, he cannot, even arguably, rely upon it to escape his convictions,” the ruling said. Britain is currently trying to crack down on money-laundering by people involved in corrupt politics or business abroad. Police say about 100 billion pounds of dirty cash moves through or into Britain each year. The Ibori case, which pre-dated the current crackdown by over a decade, relied on evidence obtained in Britain and Nigeria during several years of close cooperation between the British police and Nigeria’s own anti-corruption force. Ibori has now resumed political activities in Delta State. He says he has no faith in British justice and that the case against him is politically motivated.

Crude futures fell for the first session in four after U.S. government data showed a much larger-than-expected build in crude inventories. The U.S. dollar rose as the market awaited the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting. Lower-than-expected UK inflation data weighed on sterling, which gave up the previous day’s gains. On Wall Street, IBM fell 7.4 percent, dragging blue-chips lower a day after the company missed revenue expectations. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 posted the biggest daily gain since late March. Stocks extended losses when oil prices fell further. “The (stock) indices are pulling back after yesterday’s blockbuster earnings rally that is likely to be challenged by the Fed’s FOMC minutes,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 266.91 points, or 1.03 percent, to 25,531.51, the S&P 500 lost 25.22 points, or 0.90 percent, to 2,784.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 76.18 points, or 1 percent, to 7,569.31. European stocks hit a one-week high in early trade, but then were pulled lower by a 2.5 percent fall in an index of auto stocks. Goldman Sachs said slow demand in China could hit earnings in the sector. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.71 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.71 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.34 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.64 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.29 percent. Oil traders took profits after a three day run-up in prices, with losses extending after data showed U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected. U.S. crude fell 2.74 percent to $69.95 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.55, down 2.28 percent on the day. The euro fell 0.38 percent to $1.1529 and Sterling was last trading at $1.3134, down 0.38 percent on the day. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.15 percent versus the greenback at 112.09 per dollar. The dollar index rose 0.34 percent. Minutes of the last Fed meeting, due Wednesday, should feed expectations of further tightening. The Brazilian real rose against the dollar after data showed economic activity rose more than expected in August. U.S. Treasury yields continued to trade range-bound after a massive runup last week. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 3.1539 percent, from 3.156 percent late on Tuesday.

2018-10-17,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: DME Oman futures vs. Dubai swaps: tmsnrt.rs/2J1D2EF By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The crude oil price appears firmly in the hands of geopolitical concerns, with veiled Saudi threats over the disappearance of a journalist and the ramping up of U.S. sanctions against Iran getting most of the attention. However, it’s always worth looking at what is happening in the real world of physical oil flows and pricing, as this can often tell a somewhat different narrative to what is driving the paper market. The disappearance, and presumed murder, of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul and the ongoing fallout from the incident has raised fears of Riyadh using crude oil exports as some sort of weapon. The concern is that Saudi Arabia, which has so far denied having anything to do with the disappearance of Khashoggi, will restrict its oil exports if other nations take action against the kingdom in punishment for what is currently widely viewed as a likely state-sanctioned killing. The debate over this possibility is certain to get the market’s attention, as are the swings and roundabouts connected with the story, such as the apparent soft-pedalling of the possible murder by U.S. President Donald Trump. Add to the latest Saudi intrigue the November re-imposition of supposedly total sanctions against Iran’s exports by the Trump administration, and it’s easy to see why many market participants have geopolitical concerns front and centre. However, the physical side of the crude oil market tells a more relaxed story, with some signs that the loss of Iranian barrels is so far being adequately compensated. The latest vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv showed that exports from the Middle East reached a three-month high of 133.08 million barrels in the week to Oct. 14. This was up 9.94 million barrels from the prior week and was led by strong gains by Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Exports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq were down slightly last week compared to the prior week, but higher than in the preceding two weeks. Monitoring exports from Iran is becoming increasingly challenging given the Islamic Republic’s tankers are turning off their tracking transponders, presumably in a bid to thwart efforts to see where their cargoes are headed. Given the caveats now surrounding Iranian exports, it still appears that they are flowing, with Refinitiv data showing shipments of 10.07 million barrels last week, up 1.48 million from the previous week. Still, if exports from Iran are running at around 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), this is still well below their potential of closer to 2.2 million bpd. But for now it does seem the market for Middle Eastern crude is relatively well-supplied, and the pricing backs this view. Oman crude futures for December on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange closed at $79.42 a barrel on Tuesday, putting them at a premium of 51 cents to Dubai swaps for December . This premium has emerged in recent days as the imbroglio over the fate of Khashoggi has escalated, given that on Oct. 11 the swaps were commanding a premium of 10 cents a barrel over the futures. While both Oman futures and physical Dubai crudes have gained in recent days, the paper oil has done so at a faster pace, suggesting investors are more concerned than the traders, refiners and producers who buy and sell actual cargoes. Currently there isn’t a large disconnect between the paper and physical crude markets in the Middle East, but futures trading at a premium to physical does suggest the market may not be as tight as feared.

2018-10-17,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Even as crude prices hover near four-year highs, U.S. oilfield service firms’ third-quarter results due out in coming days will reflect a shaky recovery, as their customers face drilling constraints and pressure to hold down spending.  Oil producers are holding off finishing new wells, and cost pressures from tight labor markets and U.S. tariffs on imported steel are driving up service firms’ costs.  Meanwhile, shale producers including Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) and Oasis Petroleum Inc (OAS.N) are doing more work traditionally handled by service companies. The west Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution have overwhelmed the region’s infrastructure with oil production -driving up costs, depressing regional oil prices and slowing the pace of production growth.     “The risk for a number of (oilfield service) firms is to the downside,” said Brad Handler, a Jefferies equity analyst in New York who follows the oilfield service sector. Wall Street is trimming earnings forecasts for oilfield market leaders’ Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N), and for pressure pumper Keane Group Inc (FRAC.N) and sand provider U.S. Silica Holdings Inc (SLCA.N). Schlumberger kicks off third-quarter reporting by the sector on Friday.  The cuts are coming despite third-quarter oil prices CLc1 that are up more than 40 percent from a year earlier.  Schlumberger is expected to report a profit of 47 cents a share, up from 39 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Halliburton’s per share profit is expected to be 49 cents, compared with 42 cents a year ago.  (For a graphic of oilfield service shares compared with the U.S. crude benchmark, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2PAkhe3 )     Weakness in completing wells is worrisome because such services have carried the day for firms still waiting for offshore drilling to pick up.  Completing a well by fracking and tying it to pipelines represents about 60 percent of onshore well expenditures. With producers holding off completions until new pipelines start up next year, there is less demand for services. “The market for frac spreads is very soft, below even what we started in 2018,” Bill Thomas, chief executive of EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N), told investors at a New York conference last month.     The number of active hydraulic fracturing spreads or fleets in the Permian, the largest oilfield in the United States, has fallen to 172 from 192 earlier this year, and such fleets active across the U.S. have dropped to 460 from a peak of 480, according to data provider Primary Vision. “Lower utilization and increased completion efficiencies is creating more slack in the system, with pressure pumpers most at risk heading into year end,” Barclays said in a note this month.  Producers’ unwillingness to raise spending despite higher oil prices also is taking a toll. Analysts at Barclays estimate that more than 80 percent of producer upstream budgets soon will be tapped out if third quarter spending was similar to the second quarter’s.  Bernstein analysts estimate there could be a 15 percent further decline in fracking activity, but they expect the market to bottom early next year. “There is still risk of further declines as we approach winter and roll into the new E&P (exploration and production) budget cycle,” Colin Davies, a senior analyst for Bernstein wrote in a note.

2018-10-17,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Nikkei up more than 1 pct, but China stocks lag * Netflix surges on strong results, lifts FANG sector * Dollar mixed as risk sentiment favours emerging markets By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Asian equities got some welcome relief on Wednesday after upbeat U.S. earnings reports drove a rebound on Wall Street and helped restore a little faith in emerging market stocks and currencies. Japan’s Nikkei galloped out of the gates with a rise of 1.7 percent, but still has a long way to go to recoup the past week’s losses. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.7 percent and South Korea 1.2 percent. Chinese blue chips, however, lagged with a gain of only 0.2 percent. U.S. stocks had jumped more than 2 percent on Tuesday in reaction to upbeat earnings reports from major companies including UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs. “Analysts are looking at this reporting season in particular and the general data over the next couple of months for signs that the receding tailwinds of fiscal stimulus and the headwinds of tariffs are going to hit the U.S. market simultaneously,” said Rakuten Securities Australia COO, Nick Twidale. “On first viewing this doesn’t appear to be happening.” On Wall Street, the three major indexes tallied their biggest one-day percentage gains since March. The Dow jumped 2.17 percent, while the S&P 500 climbed 2.15 percent and the Nasdaq 2.89 percent. Netflix Inc shot 12 percent higher after the close as its results far outstripped market expectations with 7 million streaming customers added. The blockbuster outcome sent shares of Alphabet Inc , Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc up about 1 percent in extended trade. The four make up the so-called FANG group of high-growth companies that in recent months has lost some of its momentum following market-leading gains in recent years. The U.S. economic news was also robust, notably a sharp rise in job openings to a fresh all-time high. All this cheer favoured beaten-down currencies in emerging markets while taking some steam out of the safe-haven yen. The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index rose for a third straight session. The latest survey of global fund managers by BofA Merrill Lynch found they saw emerging market currencies as the most undervalued ever against the U.S. dollar. The dollar itself was up on the yen at 112.35 but flat on the euro at $1.1570. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar idled at 95.123 having touched a two-week trough overnight. Not helping the dollar was fresh criticism of the Federal Reserve from U.S. President Donald Trump, who told Fox Business Network: “My biggest threat is the Fed.” Trump has recently castigated the central bank for raising interest rates. “While such name calling shouldn’t mean anything in terms of what the Fed actually does, it is a factor which somewhat undermines sentiment towards the dollar,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. “It’s a contributory factor, albeit minor, to recent poor performance of the U.S. dollar.” Minutes of the last Fed meeting are due out later Wednesday are expected to show policy makers remain committed to further gradual tightening. In commodity markets, gold held near recent 11-week highs at $1,223.18. Oil prices edged up as industry data showed a surprise decline in U.S. crude inventories. There was also a risk that crude supply from the Middle East could be disrupted by looming U.S. sanctions on Iran and growing tensions with top exporter Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has been under pressure since prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

2018-10-17,"(Repeats Oct. 16 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2IY8Daj By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is unlikely to employ its so-called “oil weapon” in the diplomatic crisis over the disappearance of a journalist after visiting the country’s consulate in Istanbul. Experience from the last time Saudi Arabia tried to use oil sales as a diplomatic instrument in 1973/74 shows such action does not work and the kingdom itself would be the biggest victim. Despite some of the impassioned rhetoric in Saudi media, self-interest makes it improbable the government will retaliate by reducing oil sales or trying to drive up prices. That has not stopped some veiled threats to weaponise oil production and prices, but they should be interpreted as an urgent plea for support and understanding rather than a serious threat. “If U.S. sanctions are imposed on Saudi Arabia, we will be facing an economic disaster that would rock the entire world,” according to one heated editorial (“U.S. sanctions would mean Washington is stabbing itself”, Al Arabiya, Oct. 14). “Riyadh is the capital of (global) oil and touching this would affect oil production before any other vital commodity,” the editorial warned. If the price of oil reaching $80 a barrel angered U.S. President Donald Trump, “no one should rule out the price jumping to $100, or $200, or even double that figure”, the author said bluntly. The government’s official response has been more circumspect but it nonetheless warned that it would respond to any action with even greater retaliation and pointed to the kingdom’s “influential and vital role in the global economy”. In October 1973, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil producers announced that they would start cutting production by 5 percent per month until Israeli forces evacuated from occupied Arab territories. In addition, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab producers announced an embargo on oil sales to the United States and a number of other countries (“OPEC: 25 years of prices and politics”, Skeet, 1988). Global oil supplies had already become tight even before the decisions to cut production and embargo the United States, mostly as a result of low real prices during the 1950 and 1960s. Spare production capacity in the United States, which had been as much as 4 million barrels per day in 1968, had been used up by March 1972 (tmsnrt.rs/2IY8Daj). In this context, the production cuts and embargo made an already tight market worse, sent oil prices surging, and produced a huge, short-term revenue windfall for Saudi Arabia and other oil producers. But the policy was a failure in its own terms, was reversed a few months later, and caused immense long-term damage to Saudi Arabia and OPEC that took decades to reverse. At the most basic level, the policy failed to achieve its stated objective of changing U.S. support for Israel or forcing Israel to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories. More seriously for Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers, the surge in prices, which rose again after the Iranian revolution in 1979, resulted in permanent demand destruction and encouragement of alternative suppliers. Rising prices helped spur the development of new supplies in Alaska, the North Sea, the Soviet Union and China, which came onstream and flooded the oil market in the 1980s. Rising prices also encouraged a wholesale switch away from the use of crude oil and heavy fuel oil in residential and commercial heating boilers as well as in power generation. Homes and offices in the United States and many other advanced economies switched from heavy fuel oil to cheaper and more reliable heating using natural gas or electricity generated from coal or nuclear. Crude oil and fuel oil were replaced by a new generation of coal-fired power plants in the United States in the late 1970s and the 1980s (ironically the same coal plants that are now being closed and replaced by natural gas). The oil shock also provided the impetus to develop a new generation of nuclear power plants in the United States, France, Japan, Britain and other countries to reduce the reliance on imported crude. Cheap oil had been on the way to becoming the dominant fuel for power generation in the 1950s and 1960s, putting the coal industry under pressure. By the late 1980s, however, expensive and unreliable oil had been largely pushed out of the power sector by cheaper and more secure coal, gas and nuclear, a permanent loss of markets from which it has never recovered. Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Japan also enacted new fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles to reduce reliance on imports for the transport sector, taking another enduring bite out of demand. In the long term, the oil embargo created the conditions for the oil price slump that hit Saudi Arabia and other producers in the 1980s and 1990s, and from which they did not recover until the 2000s. The oil weapon does not work, which is why Saudi Arabia is unlikely to employ it in the dispute over the disappearance of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In the short term, Saudi Arabia might gain more revenue from a rise in prices than it lost from a reduction in sales. But rising prices would hit the global economy and consumption hard and threaten a renewed oil market slump within a year. The weapon cannot be wielded in a targeted way against specific consuming countries because the oil market is global and fully integrated. Restricting supplies to punish some countries pushes up oil prices for all consumers. Wielding the oil weapon to pressure the United States would impose bigger costs on China and India, which are the largest and fastest-growing oil importers and crucial markets for the future. Saudi Arabia has spent decades marketing itself as a reliable oil supplier, especially to customers in Asia, and any attempt to employ the oil weapon would destroy that carefully crafted reputation. Saudi Arabia’s refining customers would instead turn to Iran, Russia and the United States for additional supplies and likely reconsider their long-term dependence on the kingdom. If Saudi Arabia nonetheless attempted to weaponise oil production and sales, the resulting surge in prices would prompt another round of conservation measures cutting long-term demand for its main product. Sharp rises in oil prices would put a renewed focus on vehicle fuel economy standards as well as accelerating the deployment of electric vehicles. Rising prices and concerns about unreliable supplies would speed the diffusion of electric vehicles and push oil out of the transport market just as it was pushed out of heating and power generation in the 1980s. Saudi Arabia has spent years urging oil-consuming countries to remember it needs “security of demand” just as much as they need “security of supply”. But weaponising oil production would break that understanding and provoke a backlash from consuming countries with a concerted effort to reduce their oil imports. Finally, Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the United States for security (including the provision of advanced weapons systems, training, intelligence and thousands of U.S. personnel and aircraft stationed in and around the Gulf). There is no way to wield the oil weapon which would not shake the foundations of the U.S.-Saudi alliance on which the kingdom’s defence depends, leaving it vulnerable to regional rivals, including Iran. For all these reasons, the oil weapon is essentially useless, an unreliable blunderbuss more likely to blow up the user than its intended target, which is why Saudi Arabia is unlikely to deploy it.

2018-10-17,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Nikkei rallies more than 1 pct after Wall St bounce * Netflix surges on strong results, lifts FANG sector * Dollar mixed as risk sentiment favours emerging markets By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Asian equities got some much needed relief on Wednesday after upbeat U.S. earnings reports drove a rebound on Wall Street and helped restore a little confidence in emerging market stocks and currencies. Japan’s Nikkei leaped out of the gates with an early rise of 1.3 percent, but still has a long way to go to recoup the past week’s losses. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.5 percent and South Korea 1.5 percent. U.S. stocks had jumped more than 2 percent on Tuesday in reaction to upbeat earnings reports from major companies including UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs. “Analysts are looking at this reporting season in particular and the general data over the next couple of months for signs that the receding tailwinds of fiscal stimulus and the headwinds of tariffs are going to hit the U.S. market simultaneously,” said Rakuten Securities Australia COO, Nick Twidale. “On first viewing this doesn’t appear to be happening.” On Wall Street, the three major indexes tallied their biggest one-day percentage gains since March. The Dow jumped 2.17 percent, while the S&P 500 climbed 2.15 percent and the Nasdaq 2.89 percent. Netflix Inc shot 12 percent higher after the close as its results far outstripped market expectations with 7 million streaming customers added. The blockbuster outcome sent shares of Alphabet Inc , Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc up about 1 percent in extended trade. The four make up the so-called FANG group of high-growth companies that in recent months has lost some of its momentum following market-leading gains in recent years. The U.S. economic news was also robust, notably a sharp rise in job openings to a fresh all-time high. All this cheer favoured beaten-down currencies in emerging markets while taking some steam out of the safe-haven yen. The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index rose for a third straight session. The latest survey of global fund managers by BofA Merrill Lynch found they saw emerging market currencies as the most undervalued ever against the U.S. dollar. The dollar itself was up on the yen at 112.31 but flat on the euro at $1.1578. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar idled at 95.080 having touched a two-week trough overnight. Not helping the dollar was fresh criticism of the Federal Reserve from U.S. President Donald Trump, who told Fox Business Network: “My biggest threat is the Fed.” Trump has recently castigated the central bank for raising interest rates. “While such name calling shouldn’t mean anything in terms of what the Fed actually does, it is a factor which somewhat undermines sentiment towards the dollar,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. “It’s a contributory factor, albeit minor, to recent poor performance of the U.S. dollar.” In commodity markets, gold held near recent 11-week highs at $1,225.64.

2018-10-17,"WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said late on Tuesday it has withdrawn or delayed more than 2,200 regulatory actions since taking office in January 2017 as it vows to reduce the role of government.

2018-10-17,"HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Humming away in an industrial estate in the eastern Chinese resort city of Hangzhou, electric vehicle designer Automagic is one of hundreds of companies looking to ride the country’s wave of investment in clean transportation. The company wants to find a niche in a crowded sector that already includes renewable equipment manufacturers, battery makers and property developers like the Evergrande Group, as well as established auto giants. But not all of these electric vehicle hopefuls will make it to the finish line.  “This (large number of firms) is inevitable, because whenever there is an emerging technology or emerging industry, there must be a hundred schools of thought and a hundred flowers blooming,” said Zhou Xuan, Automagic’s general manager, referring to Chinese leader Mao Zedong’s ill-fated 1956 “Hundred Flowers” campaign aimed at encouraging new ideas. China is using preferential policies and brute manufacturing power to position itself at the forefront of global efforts to electrify transportation. By the end of 2017, ownership of new energy vehicles (NEV) - those powered by fuels other than petrol - reached 1.8 million in China, over half the world’s total.  With market expectations high, Chinese EV maker NIO, a rival to Tesla, launched a high-profile IPO in New York last month.                  In July, the industry ministry published a list of 428 recommended NEV designs built by 118 enterprises throughout the country. It included not only established carmakers like FAW Group and Geely Automobiles, but also small, new entrants with names like Greenwheel, Wuhu Bodge Automobiles and Jiangsu Friendly Cars. But regulators are already concerned about overcapacity and “blind development.” As subsidies are cut, smaller start-ups need to develop a competitive edge.  “After a period of intense competition, the rocks will appear, and the weak will be consolidated or eliminated,” Zhou said.        Overcapacity has been a persistent concern for many Chinese industries, with thousands of firms, backed by growth-hungry local governments and supported by risky loans, expanding quickly. Over the years, China has been forced to take action against price-sapping supply gluts in steel, coal and solar panels, among others. Electric vehicles could be next, as local governments feel pressure to create champions while following state instructions to “upgrade” their heavy industrial economies. Some executives say the market is already distorted by subsidies granted to inefficient and poorly performing firms. “Right now, the rapid growth of NEVs is not a market choice but government-guided behavior, with growth stimulated by subsidies,” said Li Lei, deputy director of the new energy department of Jiangxi Dacheng Autos, a new joint venture carmaker in eastern China’s Jiangxi province.        Though sales soared 88 percent in the first eight months of 2018, hitting 601,000 units, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has promised to tackle irrational growth in the sector.  In draft rules released this year, it said it would “plan and arrange the new energy vehicle industry scientifically,” and block new production capacity in regions where the utilization rate was less than 80 percent.     But China has often relied on “strategic” supply gluts to boost competitiveness. Excess production in solar power forced producers to reduce costs and compete, subsidy-free, with conventional energy sources. Liu Xiaolu, sales manager with ICONIQ Motors, a Tianjin-based luxury electric vehicle maker, said the large number of companies could be a “necessary stage” of development for the sector. “You cannot say that 20 enterprises will definitely be able to develop the entire industry by themselves, and it probably needs everyone to come together, and then gradually get eliminated afterwards,” he said. Established automakers told Reuters they’d already had plenty of time to prepare for the shift towards electric transportation.  Xu Hongfei, general manager with Zotye Automobile, a mid-sized Chinese automaker, said it had been preparing for China’s “exit schedule” from traditional vehicles for more than a decade and had developed core technologies such as batteries. With a staff of 20, Automagic was founded in 2015 by former engineers from IBM and Geely. It is talking with partners to bring its models to the market.     The company is focusing on small, short-distance family vehicles rather than large-scale cars built by the likes of BYD. It is also seeking better ways to produce, recharge and recycle batteries. “The most important point is that new energy vehicles need to be energy efficient, with low energy consumption, so we focus on cutting weight and making cars smaller so battery use can be reduced,” said Zhong Jin, Automagic’s co-founder and chief executive. GCL, one of China’s biggest renewable developers, plans to turn its “new energy town” at Jurong in Jiangsu province into a major manufacturing center with its expertise in batteries and recycling expertise, and even create a battery rental system. Although all the companies are trying to get an edge through innovation, Li of Jiangxi Dacheng said success could simply come down to market positioning. “Our company doesn’t have any very big advantages or very big disadvantages and competition is dependent first on branding, second on financing, and third on sales channels,” he said.

2018-10-17,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison could face a backlash in a by-election this weekend as voters in a once-safe seat weigh whether to strip the conservative government of its one-seat parliamentary majority. The Saturday by-election in Sydney’s diverse, affluent Wentworth constituency is the first major test of Morrison’s standing with voters, many of whom are angry over the ousting of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in August following a backbench revolt. Wentworth was Turnbull’s seat. He quit politics days after his removal. If the government were to lose the seat, Morrison would have to try to strike a deal with a handful of independents to govern with a minority, or be forced into an early general election.  Morrison’s Liberal Party won the seat by a 17.7 percent margin in the last election in 2016 but polls indicate it will be a tight race. “There are plenty of angry voters and there will be a significant protest vote over the treatment of Turnbull and the government’s climate polices, which is the dominant issue,” John Hewson, a former leader of the Liberal Party and a former MP for Wentworth, told Reuters. “It really is a 50-50 race.” Australians mark their ballot papers in order of their candidate preference. If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes given to the second preference candidate. This continues until one candidate wins. With the by-election too close to call, Morrison on Tuesday moved to win favour with the electorate’s large Jewish community by announcing he was considering moving Australia’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. According to census data, 13 percent of Wentworth’s electorate is Jewish, and Morrison said the idea had been advanced by Dave Sharma, a former Australian ambassador to Israel and now Liberal Party candidate for Wentworth. Sharma denied that the proposal to move the embassy was related to the by-election. He also said he strongly supported “the emergence of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state, living alongside Israel in peace”. Stretching from Bondi Beach to Sydney’s harbour, the Liberal Party’s economic credentials have traditionally been the dominant lure for most voters. While the scores of ocean view mansions provide evidence of the electorate’s wealth, it also belies Wentworth’s progressive voter base. More than 80 percent of the electorate voted for same-sex marriage last year, well ahead of the national average, while many in the area also want to reject fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy. While nearly two-thirds of voters backed Turnbull in 2016, this time, Wentworth looks set to be a referendum on Morrison, a staunch conservative and supporter of the coal industry. Should voters reject the government, Morrison will be left with a choice of either trying to form a minority government or calling an early election while trailing in the polls. Bob Katter, one of two former ruling party members who are now independents in parliament who the government will mostly likely have to rely on to get any legislation through, warned he would exact a high price for his support. “It’s not for me to call it a threat but when I don’t get a fair go, then it is mayhem time,” said Katter, who declined to specify what exactly he would demand.

2018-10-17,"(Repeats item issued earlier.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: DME Oman futures vs. Dubai swaps: tmsnrt.rs/2J1D2EF By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The crude oil price appears firmly in the hands of geopolitical concerns, with veiled Saudi threats over the disappearance of a journalist and the ramping up of U.S. sanctions against Iran getting most of the attention. However, it’s always worth looking at what is happening in the real world of physical oil flows and pricing, as this can often tell a somewhat different narrative to what is driving the paper market. The disappearance, and presumed murder, of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul and the ongoing fallout from the incident has raised fears of Riyadh using crude oil exports as some sort of weapon. The concern is that Saudi Arabia, which has so far denied having anything to do with the disappearance of Khashoggi, will restrict its oil exports if other nations take action against the kingdom in punishment for what is currently widely viewed as a likely state-sanctioned killing. The debate over this possibility is certain to get the market’s attention, as are the swings and roundabouts connected with the story, such as the apparent soft-pedalling of the possible murder by U.S. President Donald Trump. Add to the latest Saudi intrigue the November re-imposition of supposedly total sanctions against Iran’s exports by the Trump administration, and it’s easy to see why many market participants have geopolitical concerns front and centre. However, the physical side of the crude oil market tells a more relaxed story, with some signs that the loss of Iranian barrels is so far being adequately compensated. The latest vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv showed that exports from the Middle East reached a three-month high of 133.08 million barrels in the week to Oct. 14. This was up 9.94 million barrels from the prior week and was led by strong gains by Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Exports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq were down slightly last week compared to the prior week, but higher than in the preceding two weeks. Monitoring exports from Iran is becoming increasingly challenging given the Islamic Republic’s tankers are turning off their tracking transponders, presumably in a bid to thwart efforts to see where their cargoes are headed. Given the caveats now surrounding Iranian exports, it still appears that they are flowing, with Refinitiv data showing shipments of 10.07 million barrels last week, up 1.48 million from the previous week. Still, if exports from Iran are running at around 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), this is still well below their potential of closer to 2.2 million bpd. But for now it does seem the market for Middle Eastern crude is relatively well-supplied, and the pricing backs this view. Oman crude futures for December on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange closed at $79.42 a barrel on Tuesday, putting them at a premium of 51 cents to Dubai swaps for December . This premium has emerged in recent days as the imbroglio over the fate of Khashoggi has escalated, given that on Oct. 11 the swaps were commanding a premium of 10 cents a barrel over the futures.

Currently there isn’t a large disconnect between the paper and physical crude markets in the Middle East, but futures trading at a premium to physical does suggest the market may not be as tight as feared.

2018-10-17,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Power firm RWE (RWEG.DE) will seek damages if Germany decides to shut down coal-fired power plants right away, its chief executive told a weekly paper.  Germany has tasked a commission with creating a roadmap for phasing out coal as an energy source, similar to a previous landmark decision to exit nuclear energy in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Results are expected by the end of the year. A draft proposal seen by Reuters last week includes provision for 1.5 billion euros ($1.73 billion) in federal funds to bring new industries into coal-producing regions. “Should the government decide an abrupt exit I would claim back what is being done to us,” RWE CEO Rolf Martin Schmitz told Die Zeit in comments published on Wednesday. “The companies would be expropriated - as was the case with nuclear energy. And they would have to be compensated for that,” Schmitz said, adding he believed there were other ways to resolve the conflict. Shares in RWE, Germany’s largest power producer, fell sharply earlier this month when a court ruled that it could not start logging in an ancient forest, potentially delaying the start of lignite mining in the area until after 2020. The decision will shave more than 100 million euros off its core earnings (EBITDA) each year from 2019, the group said. Schmitz told Die Zeit that 4,600 jobs could be lost if it cannot continue mining activities in the Hambach forest. The commission, which includes academics, politicians, environmentalists and trade union representatives, will visit coal sites in the Rhineland on Oct. 24 and meet again the following day.  This year utilities including RWE received up to 1 billion euros after suing the government for a rushed exit from nuclear power in 2011, which they said was implemented by the government without adequate compensation.

2018-10-17,"* European auto sector leads stock markets lower * Wall Street set for lower open after Tuesday’s stormer * Strong dollar erodes emerging market currency gains * Nikkei up 1.3 pct; Asia ex-Japan rises 0.6 pct (Rewrites throughout to reflect change in stock markets) By Sujata Rao and Abhinav Ramnarayan LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - A recovery by global stocks proved short-lived as warnings over a slowing European auto sector soured an upbeat mood, while Wall Street was set for a slightly lower open after enjoying its best session in eight months the previous day. European stocks, having hit a one-week high in early trade, were back in the red by 1200 GMT, pulled lower by a 1.6 percent fall in an index of auto stocks. This came after Goldman Sachs analysts said slowing car demand in China and new regulations on emissions testing were hurting investors’ sentiment towards European autos stocks, and warned this results season could be challenging. Meanwhile, Wall Street futures were down about 0.3 percent, suggesting a lower open, with IBM shares down 4.4 percent in pre-market trading after a revenue miss. “Not too surprisingly the effervescent bounce back in Asia equity sentiment has given way,” Stephen Innes, a trader at OANDA, said in a note to clients. “Let’s not lose sight of the enormity of global risks which suggests the isolated US growth theme will come to a not so subtle end just like the synchronised global growth theme did, at least until US-China trade dispute is settled.” Earlier, Asian stocks shone after a forecast-beating set of U.S. company earnings improved the mood on world equity markets. MSCI’s ex-Japan share index added 0.6 percent while Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.3 percent. The gains followed a scintillating New York session where the three major indexes tallied their biggest one-day percentage gains since March, rising more than 2 percent each . But even that only marked a partial recovery from a recent pullback that saw the S&P 500 index post its biggest weekly drop since March. While the dollar’s mini-bounce off two-week lows checked emerging-market gains, they were supported by easing tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States, as well as signs that Turkey’s currency crisis had been laid to rest. “There are negative risks in the short term, but on the positive side we have good earnings and data from the United States,” said Christoph Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. “Last week’s correction was extreme, a lot of people became short (the market) so this is a bit of normalisation.” Overall, third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are seen growing 21.8 percent, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv. Tuesday’s gains were triggered by Netflix, which shot 12 percent higher after the close as its results beat market expectations. That sent shares of Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc up about 1 percent in extended trade. The four make up the so-called FANG group of high-growth companies, which in recent months has lost some of its momentum following market-leading gains in recent years. Banking giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also posted better-than-expected quarterly profits. And on the data front, U.S. industrial production rose for a fourth straight month in September, soothing fears the economy may be running out of steam. Barraud said the out-performance of U.S. equities was likely to continue. “People want to put money where there is best visibility ... In the U.S., you have growth visibility, strong earnings (as well as) buybacks and dividends ... So the U.S. is still attractive compared to peers,” he said. MSCI’s global equity index touched a one-week high , but was flat by 1200 GMT. A strengthening dollar meant that emerging-market currencies lost some steam as the session wore on. Turkey’s lira is came slightly off 2 1/2-month highs , having rallied 10 percent over the past week as the release of an imprisoned U.S. pastor fuelled hopes of a rapprochement with Washington. Ankara said investors had put in $6 billion in bids for $2 billion of bonds it sold on Tuesday, though it had to pay a substantial new-issue premium. Saudi Arabia’s stocks and currency also stabilised after U.S. President Donald Trump gave Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt in the disappearance of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. MSCI’s emerging currency index eased off 2 1/2-week highs, losing steam as the dollar firmed  . Emerging equities also eased off earlier session-highs. The dollar rose 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies after being undermined on Tuesday fresh criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve from Trump. He told Fox Business Network: “My biggest threat is the Fed.” “While such name calling shouldn’t mean anything in terms of what the Fed actually does, it is a factor which somewhat undermines sentiment towards the dollar,” Ray Attrill, head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank, said. Minutes of the last Fed meeting are due out later Wednesday and should show it committed to further tightening. On oil markets, Brent crude futures rose 0.4 percent for a fourth day of gains after data showed falling U.S. crude inventories. There are also risks of supply disruptions caused by sanctions on Iran and tensions with Saudi Arabia. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney, editing by Larry

2018-10-17,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will struggle to resume oil production from jointly operated fields any time soon due to operational differences and souring political ties between the previously close Gulf OPEC allies, sources familiar with the matter said. The two countries halted output from the jointly run oilfields - Khafji and Wafra - in the so-called Neutral Zone more than three years ago, cutting some 500,000 barrels per day or 0.5 percent of global oil supply. As oil prices LCOc1 rose to a four-year high above $85 per barrel this year, Washington has been pressing its top Gulf ally Riyadh to reduce crude prices by increasing production.  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Kuwait last month to discuss a resumption of oil output from the zone. But the sources, who asked not to be identified as they are prohibited from discussing the issue publicly, said the talks failed to move the two countries closer to a deal as Kuwait resisted Riyadh’s push for greater control of the fields. “It did not go well because Kuwaiti sovereignty is non-negotiable,” one source told Reuters.  Riyadh does not want Kuwaiti laws to apply to U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N), which operates the Wafra onshore field on behalf of the Saudi government, the source added.   Another source said Saudi Arabia wanted a bigger say and more control in running oil operations in the zone. Prince Mohammed met Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and Crown Prince Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah but the visit was cut short from the originally planned two days to just a few hours on the night of Sept. 30, the sources said.  Adding to the political friction were tensions between the two countries over the embargo of neighbouring Qatar and diverging views on relations with Saudi Arabia’s arch-foe Iran, the sources said. Kuwait is trying to mediate the embargo, which is being led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Doha last year, accusing it of financing terrorism. Qatar rejects the charges. Kuwait has sought to maintain neutrality, although the Emir’s efforts to mediate the rift have had little success so far. Kuwait, which has a sizeable Shi’ite Muslim minority, has also maintained dialogue with Shi’ite Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran back opposing sides in civil wars in Syria and Yemen.  In a move that may further complicate relations with Riyadh, Kuwait this month signed a defence cooperation plan with Turkey in what it said was meant to strengthen bilateral ties. Turkey has sided with Qatar in the Gulf row and its relations with Riyadh have been strained due to Ankara’s close ties with Iran. “The (regional) situation is not stable, so every country should think how to protect itself,” Saleh Ashour, a member of the Kuwaiti parliament, told Reuters. Oil output in the Neutral Zone, which dates back to 1920s treaties establishing regional borders, is divided equally between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The Wafra field is operated by state-run Kuwait Gulf Oil Co and Chevron on behalf of Saudi Arabia. The Khafji field is operated by state oil giant Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Gulf Oil. Tensions have been simmering since the last decade, when Kuwait was angered by a Saudi decision to prolong Chevron’s Wafra concession until 2039 without consulting Kuwait. In 2014, Saudi Arabia closed Khafji, citing environmental issues. In 2015, Chevron shut Wafra after failing to agree operating rights with Kuwait. Shutting output is expensive because it requires investments of tens of millions of dollars per year for maintenance, sources familiar with field operations said. The Neutral Zone “is the single biggest asset in the world which was deliberately stopped and hasn’t been producing for three years”, one of the sources said. “The more the restart is postponed the more it will cost to maintain it. And the more problematic it might be to restart the fields quickly and fully,” he added. Industry sources from both countries say that though Khafji and Wafra are not linked geographically, an agreement to bring one field back online would be tied to the other.

2018-10-17,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Statements by the United States that it would reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero are a “political bluff”, the head of state-run National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) said, according to a report published by Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. Iran’s Foreign Ministry also criticized U.S. sanctions imposed on Tuesday on several Iranian banks and other companies, saying they were part of Washington’s psychological war, state-run IRNA news agency reported. U.S. officials have said they aim to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero to force its leaders to change their behavior in the region. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports are scheduled to kick in on Nov. 4.  NIOC head Ali Kardor said U.S. President Donald Trump had been trying to reduce Iran’s oil exports for months. “The president of America has done whatever he can and he knows very well that getting Iran’s oil exports to zero was a political bluff,” Kardor said. The U.S. administration has been pushing its allies to cut Iranian oil imports and encouraging Saudi Arabia, other OPEC states and Russia to pump more oil to meet any shortfall. Kardor said Iran did not have any difficulties receiving payments for oil exports and said the Islamic Republic could accept payments in euros instead of dollars if necessary. “There is no problem on this issue,” Kardor said, Iran’s ISNA news agency reported. “With European support there will not be a problem.” European powers have been trying to salvage a nuclear accord with Iran after the United States withdrew in May. The European Union said last month it was considering setting up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate trade with Iran and said it could be in place before November. European diplomats have said the SPV would create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands. Kardor said Iran was scheduled to sign a new oil contract with a foreign company within two weeks, ISNA reported. He did not provide any additional information.  Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Washington was involved in a pscyhological war by imposing sanctions on Tuesday on Bank Mellat, Mehr Eqtesad Bank and a handful of other companies allegedly linked to Iran’s Basij militia, IRNA reported. “This action shows the spitefulness of the government of America toward the Iranian people and is a clear insult to legal and international mechanisms,” ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said.

2018-10-17,"(Repeats without change) By Diego Oré MEXICO CITY, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government will soon inherit a costly dilemma over an ethane supply contract between national oil company Pemex and a consortium led by a unit of Brazilian builder Odebrecht. Under the contract’s terms, Pemex has had to supply ethane well below current market prices. A hydrocarbon that comes from natural gas, ethane is used to make ethylene, which in turn is used to make the common plastic polyethylene at the Braskem-Idesa plant near the Gulf coast port of Coatzacoalcos. The plant is operated by the consortium in which Odebrecht’s unit Braskem has a 70 percent stake and Mexico’s Grupo Idesa holds the remainder. Energy aides to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez, who takes office Dec. 1, have said the contract is problematic, but have not yet said what the new government will do about it. “The contract with Braskem is very damaging to Mexico’s interests,” Sen. Armando Guadiana, of Lopez Obrador’s Morena party and heads the Senate energy commission, told Reuters last week. Pemex is fully owned by the government. The Braskem-Idesa consortium told Reuters last week it has no plans to void the contract. If President-elect Lopez Obrador were to direct Pemex to cancel the contract, it would be forced to purchase from the consortium the sprawling Etileno XXI petrochemical facility currently valued at $1.26 billion, according to a contract annex seen by Reuters. Neither Pemex or Braskem responded to questions about the valuation. Conversely, if the new government opted to stick to the deal, it could only hope for more favorable ethane prices that might reduce its losses. Under the terms of the 20-year-long contract, Pemex committed to selling ethane to Braskem-Idesa for 16 cents per gallon. When the contract was signed in 2010 market prices for ethane were three times that, at 50 cents per gallon. Current ethane prices hover around 40 cents per gallon. A Pemex spokesman said the contract, which took effect in 2016, “responded to the market conditions of that time.” Before the facility began operations in 2016, Pemex produced more ethane than it needed, forcing it to inject excess supply back into its natural gas pipelines. Pemex’s production of ethane this year averages 88,000 bpd, but this is now insufficient to supply its own Morelos and Cangrejera petrochemical facilities that require a combined 66,900 bpd, plus the Baskem-Idesa contract obligation of 66,000 bpd. As a result Pemex was forced to turn to ethane imports this year for the first time as domestic oil and gas production continues to fall, costing Pemex some $50 million during the first half of 2018, according to Reuters calculations, due to the cost of imported ethane at market rates compared to the cheaper fixed price in the contract with the Braskem-Idesa consortium. If Pemex is left without enough ethane, it would have to shut down the so-called cracking plants at its two petrochemical facilities, and the cost of re-starting them after being idled one week would be some $2.6 million, according to comments from the head of Pemex’s ethylene unit, Alejandro Cruz, at a board meeting in December. In June, pricing agency Platts reported that Pemex entered into a $237.6 million contract with Swiss commodities trader Vitol to supply 720,000 tonnes of ethane to Pemex through 2020. Both Pemex and Vitol declined to confirm the deal. In 2016, Mexico’s federal auditor determined that Pemex ethane exports during a 10-month stretch of that year could have yielded the company more than $100 million had it not been for the Braskem-Idesa contract. Using official data, Reuters calculated a similar $100 million opportunity cost in 2017. Both Pemex and Braskem declined to comment on the calculations. Braskem said the contract was mutually beneficial, arguing that it helps cut Mexico’s reliance on foreign plastics. “We are not planning on undoing a positive contractual relationship that we’ve been building with Pemex and that brings benefits to all,” said Sergio Plata, head of institutional relations for the Braskem-Idesa consortium. Rocio Nahle, Lopez Obrador’s pick to be Mexico’s new energy minister, has said the incoming government will review the Braskem-Idesa contract for possible signs of corruption, part of a broader energy contract review. The consortium’s Plata said he was confident the contract will not be modified. According to a transcript of a recent session of the board of directors of Pemex’s ethane unit, acting director Rodulfo Figueroa, admitted that supplying the gas is “the most serious problem” it faces. Lopez Obrador’s incoming transportation minister, Javier Jimenez Espriu, is an alternate member of the Grupo Idesa board of directors but told Reuters the contract was reviewed by the separate board of the Braskem-Idesa joint venture. Luis Miguel Labardini, a Mexico City-based energy consultant, said an even bigger problem for Pemex lies with whoever agreed to the contract’s terms in the first place. “We should give the benefit of the doubt to whoever negotiated this contract that they didn’t act in bad faith,” he said. “But they were negligent.” (Additional reporting by Marianna Parraga and Ana Isabel Martinez; Writing by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Clive McKeef)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-pemex-odebrecht/rpt-mexicos-next-government-faces-bind-in-pemex-ethane-deal-idUKL2N1WW27T,17 Oct 2018,"Mexico's incoming government

2018-10-17,"PARIS (Reuters) - French utility EDF (EDF.PA) said on Wednesday that protests could hit its coal power plants in France until the end of June 2019, due to the legislative process that would lead to the adoption of France’s long-term energy policy. The French government is expected to present a draft of the plan at the end of the month.  The plan will likely lay out when France will phase out its remaining coal power generators, reduce its dependence on nuclear power and boost renewable sources in its energy mix. President Emmanuel Macron has promised to shut down France’s coal power plants by the end of 2021.     EDF said the protests could hit its Cordemais 4 and Cordemais 5 coal-fired plants, which each have 580 megawatts (MW) capacity, and the 580 MW Le Havre 4 unit until the end of the first half of 2019. France, which depends on nuclear power for over 75 percent of its electricity needs, has shut down most of its coal power plants. Only five units with an installed capacity of around 3,000 MW are currently online. Francois Brottes, head of French electricity grid operator RTE, reiterated separately during a wind energy conference on Wednesday that France faces supply risks if the government pushed ahead with the shutdown without adding new nuclear generators or increasing renewables capacity. France’s oldest nuclear power plant in Fessenheim is expected to halt production by 2022, while the start-up of a new generation EPR nuclear reactor in Flamanville, has been plagued by technical delays and is now expected to start production in the second quarter of 2020. RTE warned last November that France risks power supply shortages after 2020 if it moved ahead with plans to simultaneously shut down four 40-year-old nuclear reactors and all its coal-fired plants.  “What we now have as solar and wind power generation capacity, does not compensate for the potential loss of the coal power plants,” Brottes said. “We are not there yet,” he added.

2018-10-17,"LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has hinted to at least six coastal states that he will keep their waters out of a looming plan to expand U.S. offshore drilling, telling some they lack enough oil to be included anyway, according to state officials and transcripts from public hearings. Zinke’s comments are the clearest indication to date that the Trump administration’s initial proposal to open nearly all U.S. waters to drilling, announced in January, will be significantly pared back by the time it is finalized. The proposal is expected later this year. The administration had billed its initial plan as a good way to boost domestic energy production, but officials from nearly every Atlantic and Pacific coastal state opposed it on the grounds a spill would damage their multibillion-dollar tourism and fishing industries.  About 17 percent of U.S. oil and gas production now comes from offshore production, but that output is concentrated almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Shortly after announcing the initial proposal, Zinke exempted Florida, sparking an outcry from more than a dozen other states that want to be spared too, and criticism from an oil industry keen to access new parts of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Zinke has since told officials from at least six states they will be “pleased” or “happy” with the final plan, that the waters off their coastlines do not have enough resources to make investment worthwhile, or both, according to the states contacted by Reuters and the hearing transcripts.  They include New Hampshire, Maryland, North Carolina, Maine, Oregon and Washington. Remaining Atlantic and Pacific coastal states have either received no assurance or did not specify to Reuters what they had been told by the Department of Interior.  In New Jersey, Democratic Governor Phil Murphy has asked for a meeting on drilling several times with Zinke  but has received no response, according to a person familiar with the matter. California and Delaware have passed laws banning offshore drilling to pre-empt the Interior Department’s final plan.  Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift told Reuters Zinke was incorporating feedback from all states into his final proposal. She said the department did not have any new information on the timing. In late January, Zinke met with New Hampshire’s Republican Governor Chris Sununu to discuss his fears of drilling off his state’s tiny 18-mile coastline. “Based on that conversation, Governor Sununu is confident that drilling off New Hampshire’s coast is very unlikely,” Jayne Millerick, Sununu’s chief of staff, told Reuters in an email. Of neighboring Maine, Zinke said “there isn’t any oil and gas really of significance,” and “I’m sure Maine is going to be very happy with the draft proposal.” He made those comments while under questioning during a committee hearing in April by Representative Chellie Pingree, a Democrat who opposes drilling along with Maine’s three other federally elected officials — including two Republicans and one Independent. Maine’s Republican Governor Paul LePage had initially expressed support for offshore drilling, but has not followed up with Zinke on the issue, his spokeswoman Julie Rabinowitz said. Zinke has also told anti-drilling states farther south - specifically Maryland and North Carolina - that he expects they will be pleased with his proposal. At a Feb. 3 meeting with North Carolina Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, Zinke said it is more expensive to develop oil and gas offshore and that North Carolina lacks pipelines and ports to make it worthwhile. He said he expects North Carolina and other states “will be pleased” when the revised plan comes out, but did not offer details, Cooper’s office said. To Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen during a Senate hearing in May, Zinke said: “I think you are going to be very happy with our planning process as we go through.”  He added Maryland had “no known resources,” a phrase he has also used under questioning by Washington Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell to describe the coastlines of Washington, Oregon and “most of California.” The Interior Department is also in discussions with the Pentagon, which has deemed large offshore areas near Florida, Georgia and Virginia incompatible with drilling because they are used for military testing.  Defense officials told Reuters discussions about drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico are ongoing. Environmental group Sierra Club, which opposes offshore drilling, said it believed the bipartisan opposition to Zinke’s initial plan would keep the East and West Coasts “off limits” in the final plan.

2018-10-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is looking at four options for carbon pricing once it leaves the European Union, including launching its own emissions trading system, a government official said on Wednesday. Britain could remain in the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS); launch a UK ETS which links to the European scheme; set up a stand-alone UK ETS, or revert to a carbon tax,  Emily Briggs, deputy head of emissions trading at Britain’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said.  Which option is chosen will partly depend on whether Britain can secure a divorce deal with the EU on the terms of its exit from the bloc. The British government has said that if it secures a Brexit deal with the EU, it intends to remain in the ETS until at least the end of the current trading phase running from 2013-2020, but has not said what it plans to do after that. “We are looking at four options ... whatever we do on carbon pricing will be at least as ambitious as the current scheme,” Briggs said at the Carbon Forward conference in London.   If Britain departs the EU with no divorce deal, it would automatically leave the EU’s Emissions Trading System and its carbon pricing system would default to a tax, the government said in a no-deal Brexit advisory paper issued last week. Britain is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in Europe and its utilities and industry are among the largest buyers of permits in the ETS, which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit. Companies from these sectors have urged Britain to stay in the ETS until the end of the current trading phase to avoid disruption, but are divided over Britain’s longer-term participation in the scheme. Britain’s carbon price is currently made up of two levies, a domestic carbon tax set at 18 pounds ($24) per tonne, paid on top of obligations under the ETS, which forces companies to surrender one carbon permit for every tonne of CO2 they emit. As Britain is such a big buyer of permits in the ETS, carbon analysts have said Britain’s exit from the scheme would likely have a bearish impact on prices. Setting a price on carbon dioxide emissions is aimed at curbing pollution and helping Britain meet its target to cut emissions by 80 percent on 1990 levels by 2050.   The UK government will publish more details of how it will initially apply a carbon price in a ‘no deal’ scenario in its annual budget statement on Oct. 29 and legislation will be included in the Finance Bill 2018-19, it said in last week’s no deal paper.

Shares in Flybe, whose routes include London to Cornwall as well as connections between smaller UK cities and French regional cities, slumped 38 percent to 19.8 pence at 0917 GMT on Wednesday.   Flybe, which has in recent years tried to reduce its fleet size and cut costs, forecast a pretax loss of around 22 million pounds for the current 12 month period, substantially worse than a current company-supplied consensus for a loss of 3.5 million pounds.  However, a 10 million pound benefit from the ending of an onerous lease will help cushion the blow, putting the 78-aircraft strong company on track to post a loss of 12 million pounds over its financial year which runs to March 31 2019.  Flybe said that in recent weeks, consumer demand for travel in Britain and Europe had weakened, and that would combine with higher fuel prices and weaker sterling to drag on its performance in the second half period.  The winter season is always tougher for airlines as fewer Europeans take flights to go on holiday, and that comes at a time when the oil price is hovering at a near four-year high.  Flybe will announce half-year results on Nov. 14th, when it is expected to detail further cost cutting plans.  “Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs,” Flybe CEO Christine Ourmieres-Widener said in a statement.   Liberum analysts cut their target price on the shares, which have halved in value over the last three months, to 33 pence from 43 pence but kept their “hold” rating on the stock.  “The opportunities for self-help improvements remain, but they are being more than offset by the challenging external environment,” Liberum said.

2018-10-17,"* Stocks extend gains after biggest daily jump since June 2016 * Europe, US futures up * Nikkei up 1.3 pct; Asia ex-Japan rises 0.6 pct * Netflix surges on strong results, lifts FANGs * Dollar off two-week lows, emerging markets still positive (Updates throughout, changes byline, dateline) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Forecast-beating U.S. company earnings improved the mood on world equity markets on Wednesday, as Asian and European shares put aside concerns on global growth and trade and took their cue from Wall Street’s best one-day rise in eight months. While the dollar’s mini-bounce off two-week lows checked emerging-market gains, they were supported by easing tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States, as well as signs that Turkey’s currency crisis had been laid to rest. A pan-European equity index rose 0.15 percent to a one-week high. Earlier, MSCI’s ex-Japan share index added 0.6 percent while Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.3 percent. The gains follow a scintillating New York session where the three major indexes tallied their biggest one-day percentage gains since March, rising more than 2 percent each .. They are set for another strong session, equity futures signalled. All this marks a partial recovery from a recent pullback that saw the S&P 500 index post its biggest weekly drop since March. While many investors are sceptical the recent volatility is over, they also hope another strong quarter of corporate profits will calm nerves jangled by trade tensions and rising bond yields. Third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are seen growing 21.8 percent, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv. “There are negative risks in the short term, but on the positive side we have good earnings and data from the United States,” said Christoph Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. “Last week’s correction was extreme, a lot of people became short (the market) so this is a bit of normalisation.” The latest gains were triggered by Netflix, which shot 12 percent higher after the close as its results beat market expectations. That sent shares of Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc up about 1 percent in extended trade. The four make up the so-called FANG group of high-growth companies, which in recent months has lost some of its momentum following market-leading gains in recent years. Banking giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also posted better-than-expected quarterly profits. And on the data front, U.S. industrial production rose for a fourth straight month in September, soothing fears the economy may be running out of steam. Barraud said the out-performance of U.S. equities was likely to continue. “People want to put money where there is best visibility ... In the U.S., you have growth visibility, strong earnings (as well as) buybacks and dividends ... So the U.S. is still attractive compared to peers,” he said. MSCI’s global equity index touched a one-week high . The 47-country benchmark rose a quarter percent after enjoying its biggest one-day gain since mid-2016 on Tuesday, with a rise of 1.7 percent. The more cheerful mood also favoured emerging-market currencies and took some steam out of the safe-haven yen. The latest investor survey by BofA Merrill Lynch found fund managers now considered emerging-market currencies the most undervalued ever against the U.S. dollar. Turkey’s lira is trading just off 2 1/2-month highs , having rallied 10 percent over the past week as the release of an imprisoned U.S. pastor fuelled hopes of a rapprochement with Washington. Ankara said investors had put in $6 billion in bids for $2 billion of bonds it sold on Tuesday, though it had to pay a substantial new-issue premium. Saudi stocks and currency also stabilised after U.S. President Donald Trump gave Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt in the disappearance of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But MSCI’s emerging currency index eased off 2 1/2-week highs, losing steam as the dollar firmed . Emerging equities also eased off earlier session-highs. The dollar rose 0.15 percent against a basket of currencies after being undermined on Tuesday fresh criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve from Trump. He told Fox Business Network: “My biggest threat is the Fed.” “While such name calling shouldn’t mean anything in terms of what the Fed actually does, it is a factor which somewhat undermines sentiment towards the dollar,” Ray Attrill, head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank, said. Minutes of the last Fed meeting are due out later Wednesday and should show it committed to further tightening. On oil markets, Brent crude futures rose 0.4 percent for a fourth day of gains after data showed falling U.S. crude inventories. There are also risks of supply disruptions caused by sanctions on Iran and tensions with Saudi Arabia. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney, editing by Larry

2018-10-17,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC has urged its members not to mention oil prices when discussing policy in a break from the past, as the oil producing group seeks to avoid the risk of U.S. legal action for manipulating the market, sources close to OPEC said. Proposed U.S. legislation known as “NOPEC”, which could open the group up to anti-trust lawsuits, has long lain dormant, with previous American presidents signaling that they would veto any move to make it law. But U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, blaming it for high oil prices and urging it to increase output to relieve pressure on a market hovering around four-year highs. That has made OPEC and its unofficial leader, Saudi Arabia, nervous about what it might mean for NOPEC, or No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act. The decision to refrain from discussing a preferred oil price level — one way the group can guide market expectations — underlines how Trump’s aggressive stance on the oil market is unsettling OPEC and testing ties between allies Riyadh and Washington. In July, senior OPEC officials attended a workshop in Vienna with international law firm White & Case to discuss the NOPEC bill, and the lawyers advised avoiding public discussion of oil prices and rather talk about the stability of the oil market, two sources familiar with the matter said. OPEC officials were also advised to explore diplomatic lobbying channels to try and prevent the NOPEC bill from becoming law, one of the sources said. On Aug. 1, the OPEC secretariat sent a letter to the ministers making a similar recommendation. “We solemnly believe that market stability, and not prices, is the common objective of our actions,” UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazroui, who holds the rotating OPEC presidency this year, wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters. “I would like to call upon OPEC Member Countries, as well as our participating Non-OPEC colleagues, to refrain from any reference to prices in their commentary about our collective efforts or oil market condition,” he added. White & Case did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Specifying oil prices is not the only way OPEC tries to guide the market. By cutting production it can support prices and by raising supplies it can do the opposite, for example. But the private coordination of how to communicate OPEC’s message to the market represents a departure from past practice, when Saudi Arabia would often signal a preferred price level when speaking about OPEC policy and seek to push through actions to achieve that. While chances of the law passing this year appear slim, concerns among OPEC members and other oil producers are growing that it may ultimately get the support of Trump, given his open criticism of OPEC and high oil prices. The OPEC letter came two months before U.S.-Saudi relations were further strained when a Saudi journalist disappeared during a visit to the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials say they believe Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi policies, was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has strongly denied killing Khashoggi. Some members of the U.S. Congress, which has long had a testy relationship with Saudi Arabia, have criticized the kingdom over the case. A Senate source familiar with the bill said renewed interest in NOPEC was likely, as lawmakers weigh any actions in response to Khashoggi’s disappearance. The source, who declined to be named, said that with lawmakers out of town for the next several weeks, it was difficult to measure current sentiment. Over much of the last year, Saudi Arabia irked Washington by pushing OPEC to adopt measures to boost oil prices in a shift from its previous, more moderate stance. Industry sources have linked that shift to a desire to maximize revenues and raise the valuation of state energy giant Saudi Aramco ahead of a planned IPO, a key part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reforms aimed at diversifying the economy. The share float, expected by some to be worth up to $100 billion, has been put on hold, sources have told Reuters. Prince Mohammed said this month the float was postponed to 2021, and several industry sources say the delay was partly because of litigation risks if Aramco was listed in New York, a preferred venue by the Saudi crown prince. “There is a major fear NOPEC could turn into another JASTA,” one of the sources familiar with Aramco IPO preparations said, referring to the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act which allows victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Riyadh. Saudi Arabia, which denies involvement in the attacks, had long had broad immunity from the lawsuits. That changed in 2016, when the U.S. Congress overrode then-President Barack Obama’s veto of JASTA. With close to $1 trillion in investments in the United States, including assets owned by Aramco, Riyadh has a lot to lose if the NOPEC bill was passed into law. It would revoke the sovereign immunity which oil producers, including OPEC members, currently enjoy from U.S. legal action. Washington-based legal firm Gibson Dunn and the Saudi embassy there signed a contract in late August, according to a copy of the contract filed to the U.S. Department of Justice.  The contract outlines that among its other responsibilities, Gibson Dunn would be “opposing NOPEC”. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has also raised concerns over NOPEC with senior U.S. officials including U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry during private meetings, two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.

2018-10-17,"SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - India’s H-Energy on Wednesday said it expected to delay the start-up of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the west of the country until the first quarter of next year. The terminal had been slated to start full commercial operations by the final quarter of 2018, but that was likely to be pushed back after heavy monsoon rains affected the laying of a pipeline, said Rahul Tiwari, senior LNG trader at the company. The 60-km (37-mile) pipeline connects the 4 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) terminal at the port of Jaigarh to the national gas grid at Dabhol.

2018-10-17,"* Malaysia 2018 biodiesel output could rise 25 pct on-year -assoc * Exports for 2018 set to double to a record of 475,000 T -assoc * Says Malaysia could produce 1.2 mln T of biodiesel in 2019 * Country uses palm oil as biofuel ingredient By Emily Chow KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Malaysian biodiesel production is likely to hit record levels this year and next, with 2018 exports on track to double from 2017, pushed up as higher oil prices boost the appeal of biofuels, the head of an industry association said on Wednesday. The Southeast Asian nation is the world’s No.2 producer of palm oil, which can be used as feedstock to make the bio components of biodiesel. “I believe Malaysian (biodiesel) production might hit 900,000 tonnes and exports 475,000 tonnes if the current price differential between crude palm oil and gasoil remains,” U.R. Unnithan, president of the Malaysian Biodiesel Association, told Reuters by text message. “These would be record high (output and export) levels for Malaysia,” he said. Malaysia churned out 720,410 tonnes of biodiesel in 2017 and exported 235,291 tonnes, according to local data. The country said in July that it would raise its so-called biodiesel mandate next year to 10 percent from the current 7 percent. The mandate refers to the percentage of bio-content that must be contained in biodiesel. If the government goes through with that plan and crude prices hold, Malaysia could produce up to 1.2 million tonnes of biodiesel in 2019, said Unnithan. Diesel’s premium over palm oil has widened in recent months amid stronger crude prices and weaker palm markets. Its spread over palm hit $219 per tonne in early October, its widest in four years, and was around $178 on Wednesday. Unnithan’s latest outlook marks an upward revision to estimates he made in April, when he said Malaysian biodiesel production could decline to 500,000 tonnes in the face of competitive shipments from Indonesia. Diesel’s spread over palm was about $20 a tonne at that time.
