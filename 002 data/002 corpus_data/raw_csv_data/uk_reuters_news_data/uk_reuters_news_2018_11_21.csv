2018-11-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets rose on Wednesday, with Wall Street tipping higher on gains in technology and energy shares, while oil rebounded from a steep sell-off as U.S. government data pointed to strong demand. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX ended higher after falling 3.5 percent over the previous two sessions, but a strong rebound gave way to a selloff late in the session that left gains in modest territory. The Dow Industrials .DJI ended little changed in thin trading volume a day ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) rose more than 1 percent. Energy advanced with a rise in oil prices. Crude oil prices climbed after U.S. government data showed strong demand for gasoline and diesel, though concerns over rising crude supply remained. U.S. crude prices on Tuesday sank to one-year lows. “It’s a cautious, measured recovery to recapture some of the lost share price from the past few days,” said John Carey, managing director and portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. “Oil is a big part of it. ... It’s brought about an improvement in cyclical stocks,” Carey said, referring to gains in shares of energy and materials companies. U.S. stocks also found support on speculation that the Federal Reserve could ease up on its path of interest-rate hikes, said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. A report from MNI suggested that the Fed may pause its rate hiking cycle as early as spring 2019. U.S. stock and bond markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and open for a half-day on Friday.

2018-11-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about $1 a barrel a barrel on Wednesday, bouncing from the lowest levels in months, after U.S. government data showed strong demand for refined fuel, but concerns remained over rising global crude supply. Brent crude LCOc1 futures gained 95 cents to settle at $63.48 a barrel, up 1.52 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose $1.20 to settle at $54.63 a barrel, a 2.25 percent gain. U.S. crude stocks USOILC=ECI rose 4.9 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, a larger-than-expected increase. Crude inventories have risen for nine straight weeks, the longest streak since March 2017. [EIA/S] Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI USOICC=ECI fell 116,000 barrels, the first drop in nine weeks, EIA said. Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell 1.3 million barrels to the lowest level since December 2017, while distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI dropped by 77,000 barrels, the EIA data showed. “Cushing posted the first decline in a couple of months, a possible portent of some leveling that could drive some support into the WTI curve,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, in a note. The overall market remained weak after crude fell more than 6 percent the previous session, while world equities tumbled on worries about economic prospects. Brent has fallen by more than 25 percent since reaching a four-year high of $86.74 on Oct. 3, reflecting forecasts of slowing demand and ample supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States. Worried by the prospect of a new supply glut, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is talking about reducing output just months after increasing production. OPEC, Russia and other producers are considering a supply cut of between 1 million barrels per day (bpd) and 1.4 million bpd at a Dec. 6 meeting, sources familiar with the issue have said. However, Saudi Arabia may find it harder to act to support prices, analysts said, after U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised Saudi Arabia for helping to lower oil prices. Riyadh could feel more inclined to heed U.S. demands after Trump promised on Tuesday to be a “steadfast partner” of Saudi Arabia despite saying Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have known about a plan to murder journalist Jamal Khashoggi. U.S. energy firms cut three oil rigs in the week to Nov. 21, bringing the total down to 885, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. “It’s fair to say that the price of oil is going to continue to be pretty volatile between now and Dec. 6 when OPEC meets,” said Brian Kessens, managing director at Tortoise. “There’s going to be a lot of different rhetoric and anticipation of what will actually transpire.” Additional reporting by Alex Lawler and Henning Gloystein; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-12-oil-rebounds-after-prior-sessions-slide-glut-worries-persist-idUKL4N1XW062,21 Nov 2018,"* Trump praises Saudi Arabia for helping to lower oil prices

2018-11-21,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week cut oil rigs for the first time in the three weeks as crude prices have fallen to their lowest in over a year. Drillers cut three oil rigs in the week to Nov. 21, bringing the total count down to 885, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Wednesday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI After the rig additions stalled at five during the third quarter, drillers have added 22 rigs so far this quarter. Baker Hughes released the weekly report two days early due to the U.S. Thanksgiving day holiday. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 747 rigs were active because energy companies have spent more this year to ramp up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian Basin, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there held steady this week at 493, the most since January 2015. U.S. crude futures were trading above $55 a barrel on Wednesday after falling to their lowest since October 2017 earlier in the week on concerns the global market is over supplied. [O/R] Looking ahead, crude futures for calendar 2019 CLYstc1 and calendar 2020 CLYstc2 were both trading below $56 a barrel. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 25 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $90.0 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Cowen said early 2019 capital spending budgets were mixed. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,027. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

2018-11-21,"(Updates prices for natural gas, highest since January) Nov 21 (Reuters) - U.S. spot power and natural gas prices for Wednesday soared in New England to their highest since last winter, with temperatures forecast to turn frigid in the Northeast over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. When the weather turns extremely cold in New England, power and gas prices can spike quickly because most consumers use gas to heat their homes and businesses and most of the region’s electricity usually comes from gas-fired power plants. The region lacks sufficient gas pipeline capacity to supply fuel for both heat and power generation on the coldest days, so many gas-fired plants have to burn more expensive oil when temperatures drop. Next-day power prices in New England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL rose to $129 per megawatt hour (MWh) for Wednesday from $102 for Tuesday, their highest since January. That compares with an average of $47.86/MWh so far this year, $38.29 in calendar 2017 and a five-year average (2013-17) of $52.29. Gas prices at the New England Algonquin hub NG-CG-BS-SNL rose to $13.70 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for Wednesday from $11.34 for Tuesday, the highest since January. That compares with an average of $4.67/mmBtu so far this year, $3.80 in calendar 2017 and a five-year average of $5.33. High temperatures in Boston, the biggest city in New England, are forecast to drop to the mid 20s Fahrenheit (-5 Celsius) on Thursday and the low 30s on Friday, from the mid 40s on Wednesday, according to AccuWeather. The normal high in Boston is 50 degrees at this time of year. So far on Wednesday, power generators were still able to get the gas they needed. The fuel mix in the morning was 51 percent gas, 27 percent nuclear, 10 percent hydro, 10 percent renewables and 1 percent coal, according to the regional power grid operator ISO New England. Pipeline companies have tried to build more pipes across New York to New England from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale fields in recent years, but some officials in New York and New England have blocked those efforts, preferring to invest more in energy efficiency and renewable sources of power. Gas utilities have said more pipelines are needed because consumers are switching from oil to gas to heat homes since it is cheaper and cleaner, and the region is becoming increasingly dependent on gas-fired power plants as more coal and nuclear units shut.

The recovery in U.S. tech and other momentum stocks boosted the benchmark S&P 500 stock index after it fell 3.5 percent over the previous two sessions. Strong earnings from Foot Locker Inc and Gap Inc boosted consumer discretionary stocks. The small-cap Russell 2000 index rallied nearly 2 percent. The European STOXX 600 index also rose 1.1 percent as beaten-down stocks in the tech and banking sectors recovered. Wednesday’s stock market activity showed signs of investors recovering their risk appetite, albeit in thin volume in U.S. markets going into Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. “There’s outperformance in tech stock and small caps. That’s normally viewed as a risk-on move,” Phipps said. “But volume equals validity, and I don’t expect to get lots of volume.” U.S. stock and bond markets will be closed on Thursday and open for a half-day on Friday. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.78 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 159.93 points, or 0.65 percent, to 24,625.57, the S&P 500 gained 25.65 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,667.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 101.08 points, or 1.46 percent, to 7,009.91. Also reflecting positive investor sentiment, the euro rose on hopes that the Italian budget dispute would be resolved even as the European Commission took its first step toward disciplining Italy over its deficit. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.2 percent after having advanced in Tuesday’s risk-off session. Italian bonds rallied, pushing two-year yields down as much as 20 basis points. Oil prices climbed after U.S. government data showed strong demand for gasoline and diesel, though gains were limited by concern over rising crude supply. U.S. crude prices had sunk to one-year lows after Tuesday’s selloff. U.S. crude surged 4.25 percent to $55.70 per barrel. Brent crude futures rose to $64.02 a barrel, a 2.4 percent gain. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 10/32 in price to yield 3.0846 percent, from 3.048 percent late on Tuesday. Despite the improved sentiment, market participants have been preparing for a loss of momentum in global growth as China takes a hit from Washington’s trade tariffs and the United States comes off the high of President Donald Trump’s tax cuts. Jonas David, a strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said a G20 meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month could determine the course of bond markets and euro/dollar rates. “If we don’t get a relaxation of trade tensions after the G20, markets may start questioning the prospect of another Fed rate hike in December,” he said.

2018-11-21,"(Adds price reaction) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose more than expected last week, building for the ninth consecutive week, while gasoline and distillate inventories fell, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories rose 4.9 million barrels in the week to Nov. 16, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.9 million barrels. Total inventories were 446.91 million barrels, the highest level since December 2017. The last time crude stocks grew for nine straight weeks was between Jan. 6, 2017 to March 3, 2017. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell by 116,000 barrels, EIA said. “The report was somewhat bearish due to the large crude oil inventory build,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Still, he said the drawdown in refined product inventories and jump in refinery activity could signal the end of the recent string of mostly bearish reports. “Gasoline demand remains strong, and it will only strengthen as we get into the holiday shopping season,” he said. Crude pulled back immediately after the report but then strengthened, with U.S. crude up nearly 3 percent and Brent futures up 1.6 percent by 11:30 EST (1630 GMT) as attention turned to more bullish data on refined products. Refinery crude runs rose by 423,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 2.6 percentage points to 92.7 percent of total capacity. Gasoline stocks fell by 1.3 million barrels to 225.32 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 198,000-barrel drop. The level was the lowest since December 2017. In the Midwest, gasoline stocks fell to the lowest since November 2017. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 77,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 2.8 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2018-11-21,"ALWAR, India, Nov 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Buffalo trampled over it? Rain drenched it? Child dropped it? No problem! This solar flashlight can endure it all, said Bassi in a pitch to her neighbours in rural India to convince them to power their homes with clean energy instead of polluting fuels. Bassi is one of 2,500 “Solar Sahelis”, or solar women friends, who fan out to different villages and persuade families to use solar energy in the western desert state of Rajasthan, which sees about 300 days of sunshine every year. With unreliable electricity and hours-long power cuts every day, many rural families in Rajasthan are often forced to rely on candles, kerosene oil lanterns or burning wood, which emit soot and noxious fumes. They not only can lead to premature death due to disease, but can also cause fire accidents and burn injuries. That is why solar is the way to go, 26-year-old Bassi, who goes by one name, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in her village of Moonpur, about 130 km (80 miles) from state capital Jaipur, where buffalos and cows wander the dusty streets. “They just makes more sense - affordable, long-lasting, durable and safe,” said Bassi, who has sold up to 32 solar flashlights since becoming a Solar Saheli last year. Even then, Bassi said it can be a challenge to win over villagers who are usually wary of the initial higher costs and distrust solar products due to experience with some flimsy products from China. The most popular product, the “Solar Rakshak”, or solar protector, flashlight costs between $10 and $20, while a regular battery-run one would be about $5. But once doubts are cleared, almost every customer is satisfied, said Bassi. Kamlesh Devi, a mother of two, bought the Solar Rakshak in June after Bassi assured her that it would save her frequent trips to the market for new batteries and lights, and help her children study without any irritation to their eyes. “I used to buy flashlights for 300-400 rupees (about $5) that would malfunction within six months. Sometimes it would fall here or there. The batteries would die quickly. But this is a great thing,” said Devi, her head veiled with her sari. “The kids are studying well. Until 10, 11 at night, even if there is no electricity, they study very comfortably,” she said. Jaipur-based Frontier Markets, the social enterprise behind the project, said its mission is to provide over 10 million clean energy products to 30 million households in India by 2020. But the project is not just about going green. It also aims to empower women in the male-dominated, conservative state, where child marriage is rife and girls are routinely denied an education and live a life largely confined to home. Bassi’s life was headed there too. Forced to marry at 17, she was regularly beaten up by her husband before she ran away and moved back in with her parents. When she insisted on studying further, her elders refused, saying she brought shame to the family. That is when Frontier Markets found Bassi in a self-help group for women and trained her to spread awareness and sell solar lights in remote areas of Rajasthan. “If not for this... I would have just stayed at home, tended the buffalos and done household work. That is all I would have been good for,” said Bassi. Having never ventured out much or spoken in public before, Bassi said she was jittery at first, unsure whether she would be taken seriously or be able to sell anything. “But now I feel like I have no fear,” said Bassi, who unlike most rural women travels miles out of her village, interacts with men and earns an income - up to 2,000 rupees ($28) every month. “Women are not weaker than men. At least I do not have to depend on anybody for money,” she said. “On days when I feel like buying something or wearing something new, then I know I have my own money and I can do whatever I want.” The Solar Sahelis have collectively earned more than $2.5 million by lighting over 500,000 homes, according to Frontier Markets. “In order to drive true women empowerment, they need to be economically secure. The second you put money into women’s hands, everything changes,” said Ajaita Shah, the 34-year-old founder of Frontier Markets. The rise in family incomes has made the Sahelis confident and more involved in household decisions, she said. “The fire we saw in some of these women, it is like they were finally recognising that their voice has value,” said Shah. Repeated studies show that when women control the family’s finances, they invest more in their children’s education, healthcare, businesses and communities, which can be a step out of poverty. While such programmes seek to boost women’s rights, experts warn they can backfire at times as they upset traditional norms and spark conflict, especially in conservative pockets of India. Rajasthan is known as much for its beautiful palaces, camel-back desert safaris and colourful apparel as for its age-old customs like purdah, or veiling, of women. It is home to some of India’s poorest villages where politically powerful councils, mostly comprising elderly men, have an iron grip over social and moral life. Women are often expected to conform to established gender roles such as being the main caregivers who look after the home and children despite modern, urbanising times, experts say. That is why it is essential to sensitise villagers about changing dynamics, said Shashank Bibhu of CARE India, a charity that works for women from poor, marginalised communities. “Otherwise, in the past, we have seen that it has led to domestic violence,” he said. He urged organisations to counsel communities about gender equality and promote supportive men as role models who share household responsibilities. For Radha Devi, working as a Solar Saheli has not been very easy due to the lack of help from the men in her family. “I struggle to balance household work and this work,” said the 37-year-old, who became a Saheli last year. “Men do not have to worry about household work ... so they progress in life. But women have to think a lot about how they will take out time for their jobs,” she said. Still, that does not dim her hopes of making it big one day. “The plan is to open up my own store ... and make a name for myself,” she said, wearing a bright yellow Solar Sahelis vest.

2018-11-21,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Google will invest almost $700 million (544.24 million pounds) in a Danish data centre powered by the abundant green energy that underpins power- intensive companies’ interest in the Nordic region.     Google also said it would sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) for the new Danish data centre to ensure it is powered by renewable energy. The Nordic countries, which can generate electricity relatively cheaply from renewable sources such as hydropower and wind, have long been a magnet for heavy power-using industries, but are now attracting power-hungry data centres. Annual investment in Nordic data centres could double to more than 4 billion euros (3.6 billion pounds) by 2025, a new study published by the Nordic Council of Ministers, the official body for regional cooperation, said on Tuesday. Big companies have rushed to secure cheap renewable energy to manage costs and reduce their carbon footprint through corporate PPAs which allow firms such as Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) to buy directly from energy generators. Nordic countries are competing for the multi-billion-euro investments with the more established FLAP-D markets, an acronym for Frankfurt-London-Amsterdam-Paris-Dublin.      While the Nordics are still perceived as less connected than these markets, the region is likely to gain market share, the Council of Ministers’ study said.  This is partly due to the region’s plentiful renewable energy and political stability while the planned installation of major fibre optic links to North America and Asia will improve connectivity. Google said it is also evaluating investments in a number of onshore and offshore wind and solar energy projects in Denmark.  In September, Google signed a 10-year deal to buy renewable energy from three new wind farms being built in Finland that will power one of its data centres. Last year, the number of new corporate PPAs, primarily wind and solar, reached a record with more than 5 gigawatt contracted, up almost a third from the 2016 level, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The new data centre in the small city of Fredericia will cost 4.5 billion Danish crowns (536.6 million pounds) and employ 150 to 200 staff once completed in 2021, according to the plans.     Besides Fredericia, Google bought another plot last year in Aabenraa, Denmark, next to a planned Apple Inc (AAPL.O) data centre. Facebook (FB.O) has also planned a data centre in Denmark. Denmark is home to a large wind energy sector including turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems (VWS.CO) and offshore wind farm developer Orsted (ORSTED.CO).

2018-11-21,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A group of European Union governments and companies have called for the bloc to set a path for net-zero emissions by 2050 in its long-term climate strategy next week.   In two separate letters seen by Reuters this week, ministers from 10 EU nations and business leaders wrote to the EU’s climate Commissioner urging a more ambitious policy to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “By setting this long-term target, the EU will set the direction of travel for all European businesses,” the letter signed by the head of Unilever, Virgin Group, French energy firms Engie and EDF, among others. “Allowing us to grasp the tremendous economic opportunities that this transition presents.” The European Commission will propose a strategy on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions next week ahead of U.N. climate talks in Katowice, Poland, next month. The draft plan will offer member states eight pathways toward meeting the bloc’s Paris climate goals of cutting emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fueled concerns that climate change is gathering pace, leading some countries to call for tougher action. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned the world would have to make unprecedented changes to meet the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

Equity futures for all three U.S. indexes were up 0.4 to 0.7 percent  , after two days of losses that wiped out the S&P500’s gains for the year and left the tech-heavy Nasdaq benchmark teetering on the brink of falling into the red  . Tuesday’s losses were led by the technology sector, as investors lightened holdings of FAANG shares — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google — the group that had propelled the Wall Street’s decade-long bull market. But sentiment appeared to recover slightly as Brent crude rebounded almost 2 percent after a six percent slide, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan index closed flat and the main all-country equity benchmark attempted to snap two days of falls. Apple and Amazon shares rose 1.0-1.5 percent in pre-market trades . European equities rose 0.4 percent, with the battered tech and bank sectors both up around 0.8 percent . The dollar, which had jumped 0.7 percent on Tuesday, slipped 0.2 percent. David Vickers, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments, noted however that gloom has tended to deepen in volatile markets as the Wall Street session progresses and more company earnings emerge. “High-flying momentum stocks have come off in a fairly spectacular fashion. At one point Apple and Amazon accounted for 40 percent of U.S. equity gains and people were just recycling money into the winners,” Vickers said. “That’s come off the boil and set the cat among the pigeons... We’ve seen a lot of reflexivity, when selling begets selling, the market starts to turn over, people take profits, it leads to another leg down and so on.” Markets also appear to be preparing for a loss of momentum in global economic growth as China takes a hit from Washington’s trade tariffs and the United States comes off the sugar-high of President Donald Trump’s tax cuts. Vickers said that after 20 percent-plus earnings growth at U.S. companies, some investors were disappointed with signs this would slow to single digits as the stimulus effect wore off. “If you have a market like the S&P500, which is two standard deviations expensive, it becomes difficult if you don’t think you will get the same kinds of earnings growth in future,” he added. Growth worries have also been revived by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials who suggested economic outlook concerns could slow the pace of its monetary policy tightening cycle, or even end it. The comments knocked U.S. 10-year bond yields to near two-month lows around 3.03 percent, down from 3.25 percent in early- November, but yields rose around 3 bps on Wednesday to around 3.07 percent. Jonas David, a strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said a G20 meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month could determine the course of bond markets and euro/dollar rates. “If we don’t get a relaxation of trade tensions after the G20, markets may start questioning the prospect of another Fed rate hike in December,” he said. The euro rose 0.3 percent after a 0.75 percent drop on Tuesday, buoyed by promises of reform from Italy’s prime minister and hopes that Rome and the European Commission would reach a compromise in a dispute over the deficit in the draft 2019 Italian budget. Italy’s two-year bond yield fell 17 bps at 1.22 percent while 10-year yields tumbled as much as nine bps to 3.53 percent, and were set for their biggest daily drop in over three weeks. The European Commission has rejected the draft plan but UBS Wealth’s David said markets were right to be optimistic about the eventual outcome of the row between Brussels and Rome. “We have to keep an eye on these dynamics but factors related to economic momentum in the euro zone and the Fed (interest rate) outlook are far more important (for the euro),” he added.

2018-11-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has moved to disrupt an Iranian-Russian network that it said had sent millions of barrels of oil to Syria and hundreds of millions of dollars to indirectly fund militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.  The complicated arrangement, described by the U.S. Treasury in a statement on Tuesday, involved a Syrian citizen allegedly using his Russia-based company to ship Iranian oil to Syria with the aid of a Russian state-owned company. Syria then helped transfer hundreds of millions of dollars in cash to Hezbollah, which functions as a political party that is part of the Lebanese government and as a militia, as well as to Hamas, the Palestinian group that rules the Gaza Strip. The U.S. Treasury Department alleged that since 2014, vessels carrying Iranian oil have switched off transponders to conceal deliveries to Syria.  The Treasury, the State Department and the U.S. Coast Guard have issued an advisory to the maritime community about the sanctions risks of shipping oil to Syria’s government. Russia will continue supplying oil to Syria in line with its agreement with Damascus despite pressure from the United States, RIA news agency quoted Oleg Morozov, a member of the Russian Federation Council, as saying late on Tuesday. “The political defeat in Syria apparently prompts the United States to return to the idea of regime change in Damascus. Therefore, economic pressure through oil supply shutdown becomes a tool of the new economic war with (Syrian President) Bashar al-Assad and indirectly with Moscow and Iran,” he said.  Morozov said Russia acts and will act “absolutely legally”. “We have an agreement with Syria and therefore it’s up to us to decide what we supply and to whom. This will be our answer, (it is) much more effective than counter-sanctions,” he added. The Russian Energy Ministry declined immediate comment.    An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman called the sanctions “fruitless, illogical and inefficient”. Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA on Wednesday: “Those who designed and implemented these sanctions will understand sooner or later that they will not achieve their goals.”  The alleged arrangement shows how Russia has sought to undercut U.S. policy toward Syria, where Washington and Moscow back opposite sides of a civil war that began in 2011, as well as toward Iran, which the United States wants to curb its nuclear and missile programs and support for militant proxies. “Today we are acting against a complex scheme Iran and Russia have used to bolster the Assad regime and generate funds for Iranian malign activity,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement announcing sanctions on those it said were tied to the network. “Central Bank of Iran officials continue to exploit the international financial system,” he added.  Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert at Columbia University, said: “The arrangement exposes Russia’s efforts to support Assad for their own interests, which has the function of thwarting the U.S. desire to no longer have Assad in power.” Those targeted include Syrian Mohammad Amer Alchwiki and his Russia-based company Global Vision Group, which were central to the delivery of Iranian oil to Syria and the transfer of funds to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force’s “lethal proxies”, the Treasury Department said in a statement. Other targets include Syrian national Hajji Abd Al-Nasir, Lebanese national Muhammad Qasim Al-Bazzal and Russian national Andrey Dogaev, as well as Iranian nationals Rasoul Sajjad and  Hossein Yaghoubi Miab, the statement said. Sajjad and Yaghoubi, Central Bank of Iran officials, worked to facilitate Alchwiki’s transfers, it said. Others sanctioned include state-owned Russian company Promsyrioimport, a subsidiary of the Russian Energy Ministry, which the U.S. Treasury alleges had facilitated shipments of Iranian oil to Syria, as well as Mir Business Bank and Iran-based Tadbir Kish Medical and Pharmaceutical Company. The Treasury’s “designation” of the individuals and entities effectively cuts them off from the global financial system by blocking any of their assets under U.S. jurisdiction and in effect warning non-U.S. institutions against dealing with them. The United States is at odds with Britain, France and Germany as well as with Russia and China over U.S. President Donald Trump’s May 8 decision to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, negotiated with the other world powers during Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration. That agreement removed many U.S. and other economic sanctions from Iran in return for Tehran’s commitment to curtail its nuclear program. Trump restored U.S. sanctions on Nov. 5 and has threatened more action to stop its “outlaw” policies. Iran, in turn, called Trump’s actions economic warfare and vowed to defy the sanctions. European powers that continue to back the nuclear deal said they opposed the reapplication of sanctions.

2018-11-21,"PARIS, Nov 21 (Reuters) - France could shut down up to six nuclear reactors by 2028 among other options, French media reported, as part of its medium-term energy policy to be presented next week. “I can confirm that there are three scenarios on the table that we are looking at, we are making final adjustments and all will be presented next week,” French Environment Minister Francois de Rugy told France Inter radio, without specifying a date. The so-called PPE energy plan will lay out France’s energy goals over the next 10 years with the aim of reducing the share of nuclear power in its energy mix to 50 percent from 75 percent by 2035, curb carbon emissions and boost renewables. French news agency AFP reported on Tuesday, citing government working documents, that the government could shut down up to six nuclear reactors by 2028, including the planned closure of France’s oldest Fessenheim nuclear plant which is scheduled to stop production in 2021, according to one scenario. It said another six reactors could close by 2035, which could set France on the path to curb nuclear generation by 50 percent. The second intermediate scenario does not foresee any additional closures beside Fessenheim until 2028, and then 12 reactors would be shutdown between 2028 and 2035, AFP quoted the document saying. The final option would also see no additional closures until 2028 after which, only nine reactors would be halted by 2035, which could miss the 50 percent nuclear target. Jefferies analysts, who have a “buy” rating on the shares of state-controlled utility EDF, said in a research note that two out of the three options seem to favour EDF, which operates all of France’s 58 nuclear reactors. Even the accelerated nuclear phase-out option appears to offer some protection, via compensation, wrote Jefferies.

U.S. shares were set to open sharply firmer, futures indicated , after two days of losses that wiped out the S&P500’s gains for the year and left the tech-heavy Nasdaq index teetering on the brink of falling into the red. Losses have been concentrated in the technology sector, as investors lightened holdings of FAANG shares — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google — the group that had propelled the Wall Street’s decade-long bull market. The falls saw the Nasdaq index touch seven-month lows and energy shares too had dropped in line with a 6 percent oil price slump S&P 500 . That fed through to Asia on Wednesday, taking MSCI’s index of ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares almost half a percent lower, but it clawed back some of those falls to trade flat by 0900 GMT. MSCI’s all-country benchmark was flat too, attempting to snap two days of falls. That, alongside a 1.5 percent bounce in Brent crude futures and some optimism over Italy’s budget stance, helped European equities open 0.4 percent higher, with a tech index up half a percent.

But the recovery in global sentiment allowed yields to rise around three bps to 3.08 percent while the dollar’s index, which had jumped 0.7 percent on Tuesday, slipped 0.2 percent. The euro rose after a 0.75 percent drop on Tuesday , buoyed by reports that Italy may be open to reviewing its draft budget for 2019, possibly easing a confrontation with the European Union. The League party, part of the ruling coalition, later denied the report. Italians bond yields fell up to 16 basis points initially, putting 10-year yields on track for their biggest daily drop in almost a month but the market gave up some of its gains after the denials. Italian bank shares too eased off session highs but were still up 2 percent on the day after sinking to two-year lows on Tuesday. Focus is now on the European Commission which should take the first step on Wednesday towards disciplining Italy over its draft fiscal plan. “This procedure will take several months, but stands to keep (government bonds) and the Italian banking sector under pressure.

2018-11-21,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government is threatening to cut existing solar power project subsidies angering the power producers and investors that say the cuts will undermine their profitability and violate earlier agreements.  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) last month proposed that companies granted permits for solar projects between the fiscal years of 2012 to 2014 under so-called Feed-In-Tariffs that guarantee minimum power prices submit applications by March 2019 to connect to the grid. Companies that miss the deadline will see their price guarantees under the tariffs of 32 to 40 yen ($0.28 to $0.36) per kilowatt hour (kWh) cut to 21 yen per kWh. Public comments for the proposal are due by Wednesday.  Japan introduced the FIT to spur solar developments to fill the power gap after the country closed its nuclear power plants following the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Japan’s FIT levels are among the highest in the world, compared to $0.19 per kWh in Germany and at least as much as those in Spain. METI has said the cuts are necessary to reduce the public burden of the FIT subsidies, which are added to consumers bills. At the same time, METI is likely unhappy with the amount of unfilled permits. Data from the ministry shows 23 percent of the total capacity approved in fiscal year 2012 is not operating, with 49 percent approved in 2013 and 59 percent approved in 2014 also not operating.  Investors and operators in solar projects are angry with the proposals, threatening lawsuits against the government for breaching the earlier contracts. A similar decision by Spain in 2013 led to compensation payments to investors. “Litigation will inevitably ensue from Japan and abroad, and it will be difficult to convince the public that there is no risk of the government losing when the proposed changes so blatantly disregard the foundations of the FIT scheme,” according to a note to clients from law firm Orrick reviewed by Reuters. Orrick confirmed the authenticity of the document. METI estimates show the subsidy cut could affect 23.5 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, or nearly 44 percent of the amount the government approved in the three-year period after the FIT scheme was created in 2012. Japan’s total installed power capacity is around 250 GW, with 44 GW coming from solar. “The suddenness of the proposal, its almost immediate implementation, and ambiguity around implementation could put future and existing investments at risk,” said a group of business lobbying groups in Japan from the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada in a statement on Friday.  The changes could also “undermine market participants’ confidence in the security, stability, and predictability of Japanese market rules,” the groups said. Beyond Japanese investors, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs group’s (GS.N) Japan Renewable Energy are among the biggest investors in the solar sector in Japan. BlackRock declined to comment, and Japan Renewable Energy could not immediately comment. GRAPHIC - Japan's energy mix - reut.rs/2f6XOIT An official who declined to be identified from a Japanese renewable power producer that submitted comments to METI said that some operators with bad intent have deliberately delayed projects. However, she argued that large-scale solar projects do take a significant amount of time to push forward because of environmental mitigation measures and discussions with nearby landowners.  The company told METI a unilateral schedule for automatic cuts is hard to deal with.  Several investors and lawyers involved said the changes will likely see many projects canceled. Banks that have built up project finance teams to handle the billions of dollars of investment that has flowed into renewables in Japan have stopped or cut funding for projects, one investor said. The investor spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Japanese Bankers Association requested that projects which already have signed loan contracts be exempted from the new rule, saying that a significant reduction in FIT price would threaten default on payments, it said in its comments to METI.

2018-11-21,"(Adds net profit growth forecast, background) MADRID, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Spanish energy group Endesa plans to raise investment in renewables over the next three years and trim the proportion of profits it will pay in dividends, it said on Wednesday. In an update to its strategic plan, Endesa laid out proposals for 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) in net capital expenditure, with investments in renewables like wind and hydropower taking the lion’s share each year. It committed to continuing an existing policy of paying 100 percent of net profit to shareholders until 2020, but set an 80 percent limit for payments in 2021. Setting new forecasts for earnings in the period, Endesa said it expected annual net profit growth to pick up to around 7 percent - versus around 6 percent in its previous plan - with the total hitting 1.8 billion euros in 2021. Endesa’s parent, Italian utility Enel, pledged on Tuesday to invest more in its green energy and network businesses to boost earnings and meet growing demand for electricity and new digital services. Spurred by stricter government targets to contain climate change, Europe’s power sector is increasingly turning to renewable energy as new technology helps drive down costs. In Spain, investors are coming back to green power some six years after the government cut subsidies to balance a tariff deficit, leading many to flee the sector. $1 = 0.8776 euros

Oil markets clawed back some ground on Wednesday after tumbling more than 6 percent the day previous day in heavy trading volumes. [O/R] “It will take a fundamental catalyst for prices to stabilise and eventually trade higher,” Goldman said in the note, adding that such a catalyst would include physical evidence that OPEC production is “sequentially” declining and further proof of demand resilience.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is pushing allied producers including Russia to join in output cuts of 1 million to 1.4 million barrels per day.     Goldman said the renewed price collapse reflected “concerns over excess supply in 2019 ... (and) a broader cross-commodity and cross-asset sell-off as growth concerns continue to mount.”  The investment bank said a sharp collapse in demand or the absence of an OPEC production cut would be the two main risk to a recovery in prices from current levels,  “While both are unlikely, we are more concerned about the latter, with such a shift leading to sustainably lower prices,” Goldman said.

2018-11-21,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore authorities are investigating Noble Group Ltd (NOBG.SI) for suspected false and misleading statements, just days before the Singapore-listed company was to complete its $3.5 billion debt restructuring deal to prevent its collapse. Noble, once Asia’s top commodity trader, has seen its market value all but wiped out from $6 billion in February 2015 after its accounting was questioned by Iceberg Research. To rescue itself, Noble has shrunk its business by selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs, while defending its accounting. The company, whose shares were suspended from trading from Monday due to the restructuring, is seeking to transform into an Asia-focused coal-trading business and list the overhauled business. In a statement on Wednesday, Noble said its proposed restructuring was in the best interests of all stakeholders, including creditors and shareholders. The company said it will “continue to work towards implementing its proposed restructuring within the previously disclosed timelines.” In a statement on Tuesday, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank, and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) said they were jointly investigating Noble for suspected violations of securities and company laws. Noble said the company had received a letter from the Singapore authorities requiring it to provide access to documents relating to the accounting treatment, consolidation and reporting of certain contracts of the company and its subsidiaries for the last few years. Noble said it intends to co-operate fully with the authorities in their investigation. In addition to the suspected false statements, the probe also covers potential non-compliance with accounting standards by Noble Resources International Pte Ltd (NRI), a fully-owned Singapore-based subsidiary of Noble, the authorities said in Tuesday’s announcement. “CAD and MAS have directed Noble Group Ltd and NRI to produce documents relating to the preparation of Noble Group’s financial statements,” the authorities said. They said this follows a thorough review of other relevant information, including information referred to authorities by the Singapore Exchange’s regulatory arm and other third parties. The Singapore Exchange’s regulatory unit said it will review if the investigations will impact the financial statements already disclosed by Noble Group related to its restructuring, it said a separate statement. “Trading can only start after restructuring has been completed and this is in turn dependent on our review,” it said. However, Mak Yuen Teen, an associate professor of accounting at the National University of Singapore, said he did not expect the investigation by authorities to impact the restructuring. “There’s going to be a new entity with a largely new board, and the investigations will be focussing on the previous board and management,” Mak said. The CAD, the MAS and ACRA also said they were looking into breaches of disclosure requirements by Noble. Last week, Noble reported halving its quarterly net loss from continuing operations to $43.3 million.

2018-11-21,"(Repeats Nov. 20 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2PHrexW By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Global oil markets are adjusting to relatively strong demand for diesel and jet fuel compared to gasoline, coupled with the introduction of new bunker fuel regulations at the start of 2020. Rising diesel and jet fuel prices, at least relative to crude and gasoline, are forcing adjustments that should lessen the chance of a severe shortage at the end of next year. Futures prices for ultra-low-sulphur diesel delivered at New York Harbor have moved to a premium of more than $21 per barrel over futures prices for gasoline delivered at the same location. The diesel premium has doubled since the end of September. It is trading at the highest level since 2011 and before that 2008, both of which were years when diesel consumption was growing much faster than gasoline. Refiners have a strong incentive to maximise the production of diesel and jet fuel while minimising output of gasoline, and many are adjusting production plans in response. In the United States, for example, refiners cut gasoline yields by 1 percentage point while boosting yields of jet fuel by 0.7 point and distillate fuel oil by 0.5 point in August compared with a year earlier. U.S. refiners produced a near-record 40 barrels of middle distillates (mostly diesel and jet fuel) from every 100 barrels of crude in August, the most recent month for which data is available. U.S. refiners have rarely squeezed more middle distillate from each barrel of crude they process, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) (tmsnrt.rs/2PHrexW). At the same time, refiners produced fewer than 45 barrels of gasoline per 100 barrels of crude, close to multi-year lows (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, October 2018). As a result, the ratio of distillate to gasoline production is at the highest level since the summer of 2008, when oil prices were spiking before the global financial crisis. Global diesel consumption has generally been rising faster than gasoline for the last quarter of a century. Diesel consumption increased by 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd) between 1992 and 2017 while gasoline was up by just 8.4 million bpd (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2018). Refiners have responded by squeezing more diesel and jet fuel from every barrel, mostly at the expense of lower-value products such as heavy fuel oil, bitumen and asphalt. U.S. refiners made almost 39 barrels of diesel and jet fuel from every 100 barrels of crude in 2017, up from 31 barrels in 1993, according to the EIA. Over the same period, production of residual fuel oil and asphalt declined from nine barrels to fewer than five barrels per 100 (“Petroleum Supply Annual”, EIA, August 2018). The International Maritime Organization’s new regulations on bunker fuels are likely to accelerate the transition to distillate fuel oil and away from heavy fuel oil. From the start of 2020, the regulations will require ship owners to start using lower-sulphur distillate fuel oil unless they start buying lower-sulphur heavy fuel oil or install exhaust gas cleaning systems (“scrubbers”). Some analysts have expressed concern that the regulations will create an acute shortage of middle distillates resulting in a surge in diesel and jet fuel prices and pulling up crude oil prices with them. But with prices already starting to adjust, there is probably enough flexibility in the system to enable it to meet the rise in middle distillate demand over the next 12-15 months. Experience shows U.S. refiners have flexibility to adjust the gasoline/distillate mix by two to four barrels per 100 barrels of crude, and in some cases more, in the short term by making straightforward operational changes. For example, fluid catalytic cracking units can be operated at reduced severity to cut the production of light hydrocarbons in the gasoline range and increase the number of heavier hydrocarbons in the diesel and jet range. FCC units play a critical role in giving refiners the flexibility to adjust their output mix in response to short-term changes in gasoline/diesel demand over a matter of months. Over longer time horizons, refiners have multiple routes to increase the output of diesel by investing in new processing units (“Refinery configurations for maximum conversion to middle distillates”, Chevron, 2011). Most refiners have been planning to increase their yield of middle distillates for nearly a decade in response to projections of increased diesel demand. The new mega-refineries in the Middle East and Asia have all been planned to maximise the production of middle distillates for the transport market in anticipation of new IMO rules and projected increases in freight demand. On the consumption side, price changes will help smooth the adjustment to IMO rules, with higher diesel prices forcing more fuel efficiency in the freight transportation sector. And the sharp rise in diesel prices relative to gasoline is likely to accelerate the shift away from diesel among European motorists, making more fuel available to the shipping sector. By encouraging maximum refinery production and restraining consumption over the next six to nine months, the rise in diesel prices should help build stocks and reduce the risk of a price spike in late 2019 and 2020.

2018-11-21,"* Global economy going through “very difficult time” -IEA * Fearing a glut, OPEC pushes for supply cuts By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Oil prices stabilised on Wednesday after slumping more than 6 percent the previous day, with some support coming from a report of an unexpected drop in U.S. commercial crude inventories. But investors remained on edge, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) warning of unprecedented uncertainty in oil markets due to a difficult economic environment and political risk. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were at $53.57 per barrel at 0028 GMT, up 14 cents from their last settlement. Front-month Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Wednesday’s more stable prices came following a report by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday that U.S. commercial crude oil inventories had fallen unexpectedly by 1.5 million barrels, to 439.2 million barrels, in the week to Nov. 16. Yet the slight increase in WTI could not cover up general market weakness, with oil and stock markets both plunging the previous session. “The global economy is still going through a very difficult time and is very fragile,” IEA chief Fatih Birol told Reuters on Tuesday. Fearing a glut like in 2014, when high global output and a slowdown in demand growth triggered a price crash, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is pushing for a supply cut of between 1 million and 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd). Despite the expectation of OPEC-led cuts, Brent and WTI prices have slumped by 28 and 30 percent respectively since early October. “Investors are becoming increasingly concerned that any potential production cuts by OPEC will be insufficient to cover the surplus in the market,” ANZ bank said on Wednesday. “The list of reasons for the decline are pretty specific ... too much supply and a risk of slowing demand growth,” said James Mick, Energy Portfolio Manager with U.S. investment firm Tortoise. “Part of the supply issue has been surging U.S. production,” he added, referring to an output increase of almost a quarter in the United States C-OUT-T-EIA, to a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd).
