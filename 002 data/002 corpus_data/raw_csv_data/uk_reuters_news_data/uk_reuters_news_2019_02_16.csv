2019-02-16,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - A Canadian National Railway Co train derailed early on Saturday in Western Canada, leaking an undetermined volume of crude oil, the company said. Thirty-seven tank cars derailed near St-Lazare, Manitoba. The leak has been contained and has not entered the nearby Assiniboine River, CN spokesman Jonathan Abecassis said in a statement.  There were no injuries or fires, he said, adding that CN was preparing to clean up the spill and remediate the environment. The derailment comes as crude oil shipments by rail in Canada reached a record high late last year, after oil production expanded in the western province of Alberta and plugged up pipelines.  Crude transport by rail is generally considered less safe than pipelines, although there was also a leak this month in TransCanada Corp’s Keystone pipeline in Missouri. Also this month, a parked Canadian Pacific Railway grain train rolled down a steep embankment in British Columbia, killing three crew members. Canada’s Transportation Safety Board, which regulates the rail industry, said it was deploying investigators to the site of the Manitoba train derailment.

2019-02-16,"TIRANA (Reuters) - Protesters in Albania attacked the prime minister’s office with iron bars and petrol bombs on Saturday, demanding his resignation over a scandal-plagued plan to build a ring-road around the capital. Several people, including journalists, were hurt as police fired tear gas to push back the protesters, some of whom were residents angry over the planned demolition of homes to make way for the highway around Tirana. During four hours of unrest, they attacked two large art installations outside the office of Prime Minister Edi Rama, an artist and former basketball player elected in 2013. Saturday’s unrest erupted after a group of protesters broke away from a rally by several thousand opposition demonstrators who had gathered earlier in the day to demand Rama step down and call an election. The European Union and its member states called on all sides “to do their utmost to avoid violence and further unrest”.    Rama has faced mounting pressure in recent months. The ring-road scheme has been halted due to allegations of corruption in the awarding of contracts, leading him to sack the transport minister. Prosecutors are investigating how a company using falsified documents, whose manager is now a fugitive, received 18 million euros (£15.7 million) in state funds to be build a section of the road. “The government was caught stealing, and should go” said opposition Democratic Party leader Lulzim Basha, accusing the government of inciting Saturday’s violence by allowing protesters to break through a police cordon. He vowed to resume the protest on Thursday. Rama accused opposition leaders of stirring up the unrest because they feared an ongoing overhaul of the judiciary would hold many of them accountable for alleged wrongdoing. The scandal over the road scheme followed protests by students calling for cheaper tuition fees in December. Rama’s Socialist Party government has steered the economy back to growth, with an expansion of about four percent in 2018, and the Balkan NATO-member country could start accession talks with the EU in mid-2019. However, the benefits of economic growth are not reaching everyone and many Albanians continue to leave the country in search of jobs. The perception of corruption is on the rise, especially from public private partnerships also seen as a threat to public debt.

2019-02-16,"MUNICH (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence rebuked European powers over Iran and Venezuela on Saturday in a renewed attack on Washington’s traditional allies, rejecting a call by Germany’s chancellor to include Russia in global cooperation efforts. In speeches and in private talks at the Munich Security Conference, Pence and Chancellor Angela Merkel laid out competing visions for how the West should address world crises. “America is stronger than ever before and America is leading on the world stage once again,” Pence told European and Asian officials in Munich, listing what he described as U.S. foreign policy successes from Afghanistan to North Korea, and urging support from American allies. “America First does not mean America alone,” he said, hailing the results of Donald Trump’s presidency as “remarkable” and “extraordinary”, and calling on the EU to follow Washington in quitting the Iran nuclear deal and recognising the head of Venezuela’s congress, Juan Guaido, as the country’s president. Addressing an audience that included Trump’s daughter Ivanka, Pence’s speech was the latest attempt by a Trump administration official to put the president’s “America First” agenda into a coherent policy plan. European leaders are troubled by Trump’s rhetoric, which they say is erratic and disruptive, citing his decision to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal as undermining an arms control agreement that prevented Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb. But Pence — who last week accused Britain, Germany and France of undermining U.S. sanctions on Iran — repeated his demand for European powers to withdraw from the deal. “The time has come for our European partners to withdraw from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal,” he said, and later pressed Merkel over the issue in bilateral talks. He also reiterated to her Washington’s opposition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under construction between Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea. “We cannot strengthen the West by becoming dependent on the East,” Pence said.  Merkel, who made a robust defence of Germany’s foreign trade relations and ties with Russia during her speech, said later it was unreasonable to assume that Russia would be an unreliable energy supplier. Speaking before Pence, Merkel questioned whether the U.S. decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal and withdrawal from Syria was the best way to tackle Tehran in the region.  During a question-and-answer session, she added that it would be wrong to exclude Russia politically, but Pence said Washington was “holding Russia accountable” for its 2014 seizure of Ukraine and what the West says are efforts to destabilise it through cyber attacks, disinformation and covert operations. “Geostrategically, Europe can’t have an interest in cutting off all relations with Russia,” Merkel said. Pence, who used his trip to Europe to push Trump’s policy of favouring sovereign states as opposed to alliances and blocs, took aim at the EU over Venezuela’s political crisis. “Today we call on the European Union to step forward for freedom and recognise Juan Guaido as the only legitimate president of Venezuela,” he said, calling President Nicolas Maduro a dictator who must step down. In his roving address, Pence also stepped up U.S. pressure on Chinese telecoms gear companies such as Huawei Technologies Co, urging allies to avoid the firms and saying Chinese law requires them to give Beijing access to networks and data.  China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi rejected Pence’s comments. “Chinese law doesn’t require companies to install back doors to collect intelligence,” Yang told the conference. Yang, one of the architects of Chinese foreign policy, echoed Merkel’s vision, saying the world should “pull together” to address global challenges, while former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden got a standing ovation for a speech in which he said that after Trump, close traditional U.S.-EU would resume. “America will be back,” he said.

2019-02-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz plans to extend tax incentives for electric company cars, he told a newspaper on Saturday, the government’s latest attempt to boost demand for clean vehicles. Germany is trying to increase electric car sales in the wake of a diesel emissions cheating scandal that has engulfed its auto industry in the last three years. “Half of all cars sold in Germany are company cars,” Scholz told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.  “So I have decided that we will not end tax support for electric cars and plug-in hybrid company cars in 2021 but  extend them maybe over the whole decade,” he said, adding that would help improve air quality and meet climate goals. He added, however, that the rules for plug-in hybrids would be tightened, so that only cars that can travel on electric power further than they do today would be eligible.  Since January, drivers of electric company cars which they also use for private journeys pay less tax than they would for a vehicle with a combustion engine. Government subsidy schemes have helped boost sales but even with rising demand, electric cars made up only 1 percent of new car registrations last year, according to the KBA motor vehicle authority. The government has acknowledged it will miss its target of having 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2020 by two years.

2019-02-16,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is likely to meet Afghan Taliban representatives during his visit to Pakistan starting on Sunday, Pakistani government sources said, part of efforts to broker an end to Afghanistan’s 17-year-old civil war. Pakistan has been playing an increasingly vital role in the Afghanistan peace talks, which have been gathering momentum in recent months amid a growing U.S. desire to pull out its troops. Along with other Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia has been part of the peace negotiations and is seen to have some sway over the Afghan Taliban militants due to Riyadh’s historical ties with the hardline Islamist group and the kingdom’s religious clout as the birthplace of Islam.  Two senior Pakistani officials said the crown prince was likely to meet Afghan Taliban representatives in Islamabad, where the militants, fighting to restore strict Islamic rule in Afghanistan after their 2001 ouster, say they are due to meet U.S. representatives and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. “Though it is top secret so far, there are strong indications representatives of the Afghan Taliban will meet Prince Salman during their visit of Pakistan on February 18,” one of the Pakistani officials in Islamabad said.  A senior Taliban leader in Qatar said no decision had been made on whether they would meet the crown prince.  “Actually meeting Prince Salman is not in the plan so far but we can discuss it when we are in Islamabad,” said the Taliban representative. Pakistan’s Foreign Office and Saudi Arabia’s government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The crown prince is expected to stay to leave Pakistan on Monday after signing a raft of investment agreements in the energy sector for more than $10 billion. But his trip, which Islamabad is treating as the biggest state visit in years, risks being overshadowed by escalating tensions between India and Pakistan following a militant attack on Indian security forces in the disputed Kashmir region.  New Delhi says Pakistan had a hand in the attack by a militant group which is based on Pakistani soil, something Islamabad denies.

2019-02-16,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Saturday expressed cautious optimism over trade talks between the United States and China, a day after President Xi Jinping said a week of discussions had produced “step-by-step” progress. Xi made the comments at a meeting on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing, after a week of senior- and deputy-level talks. The People’s Daily, the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary that Xi’s meeting with U.S. negotiators had affirmed progress made in previous talks and “injected new impetus into the next stage of the development of Sino-U.S. trade relations.” The talks “have made important progress” for the next round of negotiations in Washington next week, the paper said in its domestic edition. “It is hoped that the two sides will maintain the good momentum of the current consultations and strive to reach an agreement within the set time limit,” it said. U.S. duties on $200 billion (155 billion pounds) in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if there is no deal by March 1 to address U.S. demands that China curb forced technology transfers and better enforce intellectual property rights. In its overseas edition, the People’s Daily said “zero-sum thinking and games where you lose and I win can only create losses for both. Only on a basis of mutual respect and equal treatment, through dialogue and consultation, can we find a solution acceptable to both sides.” An English-language editorial in the Global Times, which is published by the People’s Daily, said news that China had consulted on the text of a memorandum of understanding “shows the two sides have made unprecedented progress.” “The MOU and next week’s talks both show that the seemingly endless China-U.S. trade negotiations, like a marathon, are making a final sprint,” it said. The newspapers cautioned that any agreement would have to be in the interests of both the United States and China. “There are still obstacles to be overcome, and no one should underestimate how daunting a task the two sides face trying to resolve all the differences that have long existed between them in one clean sweep,” the official English-language China Daily said in an editorial.

2019-02-16,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will inject $3.9 billion into ailing state oil company Pemex, officials said on Friday, promising to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade, although investors saw the plan as only a short-term fix. Falling oil output, corruption and high labor costs have contributed to the decline of the company that was once a symbol of national pride. It now holds roughly $106 billion in financial debt, the highest of any national oil company in Latin America. Fitch and Moody’s rate its credit one notch above junk. Fitch said on Friday that the plan, which includes additional tax cuts, more government spending on the company and debt refinancing, would likely not be enough to prevent “continued deterioration” in Pemex’s credit quality. The agency cited an ongoing “significant level of underinvestment” for Pemex.  Pemex will receive $1.8 billion in pension liability monetization as part of the new plan and finances will be helped by a corruption clampdown, officials said in a presentation that was short on details. They vowed the Mexican government will not take on new debt in 2019. Pemex must make more than $27 billion in debt payments over the next three years.  Investors said they had expected stronger measures, and while encouraged by government vows of support, they said the plan offered only short-term relief.      “The measures are not a long term fix and won’t be enough to stabilize oil output,” said Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics. If oil prices and output decline further, he estimated yields on Pemex bonds could rise by around 1 percent this year.   The price fell after the announcement for Pemex’s most heavily traded bond on Friday, maturing in 2047, as its yield rose 14 basis points, according to MarketAxess data.      The price on a Pemex bond maturing in 2024 also dropped, with its yield up 32 basis points, reflecting bondholder skepticism of the plan. What’s more, the measures will do little to shore up Pemex’s standing with the ratings agencies, said Julie Murphy, a Latin America analyst at JP Morgan. “We are extremely disappointed with the measures,” she said.  The Mexican peso weakened by more than half a percent against the dollar after the announcement, before recovering later on Friday.  Over time, Pemex taxes will go down and the capital injection will allow debt refinancing over the year, Finance Minister Carlos Urzua told a press conference.  If Pemex requires more help, the government will do whatever it takes to keep Pemex’s finances healthy, he added. Fitch downgraded debt issued by Pemex by two steps last month, making it the second agency after Moody’s to put the company just barely within its investment grade category.  The move stoked fears that further credit downgrades could significantly raise Pemex’s financing costs and result in dire fiscal consequences for the government. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December and ran on a promise of strengthening Pemex, did not fully detail in his comments at the news conference how the government would finance the company’s lower tax bill and capital injection. He said efforts since late December to battle rampant fuel theft would result in savings of about $1.6 billion, however, while a plan to increase production will generate more resources.  “It’s injecting resources, it’s lowering the tax obligation,” Lopez Obrador said. “But above all, it’s cleaning out corruption from Pemex.”     Investors had expected a stronger response, said Luis Gonzali, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments. Even so, he praised the administration’s “unconditional support” to double down on relief measures if necessary.     Wilbur Matthews, founder of Vaquero Global Investment, also saw the announcement as positive. “It is a good sign that the Lopez Obrador administration recognizes that Pemex needs to change profoundly,” he said. The company is in talks with lenders to potentially raise up to $7 billion this year, Refinitiv IFR reported on Friday. The company has previously said it would refinance around $6.6 billion in 2019.
