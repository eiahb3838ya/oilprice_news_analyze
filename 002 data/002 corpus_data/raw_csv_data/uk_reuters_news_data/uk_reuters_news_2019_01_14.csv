2019-01-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock indexes fell on Monday after a surprise contraction in Chinese trade reignited fears of a sharper slowdown in global growth and caused investors to sell riskier assets. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent and the safe-haven yen rose against the dollar following the China news, which added to worries that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were taking a toll on the world’s second-largest economy. “The biggest theme (in the market today) is risk-off,” said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus, Inc. Data from China showed imports fell 7.6 percent year-on-year in December while analysts had predicted a 5-percent rise. Exports dropped 4.4 percent, confounding expectations for a 3-percent gain.

GRAPHIC: China trade shock png - tmsnrt.rs/2SYCUu9 The United States and China - the world’s two largest economies - have been in talks for months to try to resolve their bitter trade war, with no signs of substantial progress. Adding to the gloom were weak industrial output numbers from the euro zone, which showed the largest fall in nearly three years.  Softening demand has been felt around the world, with sales of goods ranging from iPhones to automobiles slowing, prompting profit warnings from Apple (AAPL.O) among others. Trade-sensitive shares eased, including Boeing Co (BA.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), though U.S. stock investors also were on edge as the U.S. corporate earnings season kicked off. “It will be a big thing to see if the Chinese slowdown is real, or if it is an excuse for some companies not to hit the high growth seen last quarter,” said Craig Birk, chief investment officer at Personal Capital in San Francisco. “If things are really slowing down, you’ll start to see it show up this quarter in earnings.” Citigroup Inc (C.N) shares rose after the bank beat profit estimates as lower expenses offset a drop in quarterly revenue. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) are set to report earnings on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 86.11 points, or 0.36 percent, to 23,909.84, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 13.65 points, or 0.53 percent, to 2,582.61 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 65.56 points, or 0.94 percent, to 6,905.92. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.48 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.51 percent. U.S. Treasury yields rose as risk sentiment improved after President Donald Trump said he was not looking to declare a national emergency amid a partial government shutdown. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.7024 percent, from 2.699 percent late on Friday. In the foreign exchange market, the Japanese yen JPY=, a safe-haven currency that benefits in times of geopolitical turmoil, rose against the U.S. dollar. The yen was last up 0.3 percent against the greenback. The prospect of slowing global growth also roiled some commodity markets. Industrial metals copper CMCU3 and aluminium lost ground in London and Shanghai. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange ended down 0.8 percent at $5,897 a tonne, its lowest in more than a week. Oil prices ended down more than 2 percent on the global slowdown concerns.  Brent crude LCOc1 futures lost $1.49, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $58.99 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.08 to settle at $50.51 a barrel, a 2.1 percent loss.

2019-01-14,"LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - President Ali Bongo returned to Gabon on Monday after a three-month medical leave during which a coup attempt was thwarted, two government sources told Reuters.  His return comes a week after a small military group took over the state radio station. The move to grab power was quickly halted but exposed growing frustration in the oil-producing country over Bongo’s secretive absence.  Bongo suffered the stroke during a conference in Saudi Arabia in October and was flown to Morocco in November for treatment.  He has appeared in closely choreographed television clips in recent weeks, including a New Year’s address in which he slurred his speech and appeared unable to move his right arm. It is not clear if he can walk.  Bongo appointed a new government on Saturday in an apparent effort to shore up his political base, including the nomination of Julien Nkoghe Bekale as prime minister. The new government will be sworn in Bongo’s presence on Tuesday, the two sources said. The media will not be allowed to attend.  The Bongo family has ruled Gabon for over 50 years. Ali Bongo took over upon his father Omar’s death in 2009. Ali Bongo won re-election in 2016 by fewer than 6,000 votes amid widespread accusations of fraud, sparking deadly clashes between protesters and police during which the parliament was torched.

2019-01-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Monday, pressured by data showing weakening imports and exports in China that raised new worries about a global economic slowdown hurting crude demand. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 61 cents to $59.87 a barrel by 12:54 p.m. EST (1754 GMT), trading as low as $59.27 intraday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 36 cents to $51.23 a barrel, after sinking to a session low earlier of $50.43. Data out of China spurred fresh concerns about weakness in the global economy. China’s exports fell by the most in two years in December while imports contracted, official figures showed. “Oil prices are getting weighted down by the prospects of weaker economic growth in China,” Stephen Innes of futures brokerage Oanda said in a report.  “This data drives home just how negative of an impact trade war is having on the Chinese and perhaps global economy.” Despite concern about the outlook, there is little sign that Chinese oil demand has weakened yet. China’s crude imports in December surged nearly 30 percent from a year earlier, Reuters calculations of customs data showed. Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday that he is not worried about a global slowdown hurting oil demand as of yet.  “The global economy is strong enough, I’m not too concerned. If a slowdown happens, it will be mild, shallow and short,” he told reporters in Abu Dhabi. Crude futures have rallied recently after sinking to one-and-a-half year lows reached in late December.  “There’s a close proximity to $50 (for WTI),” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York. “There’s a significant amount of new length in the market in crude oil and interest in keeping the market above that number.” With the recent rally, OPEC officials appear more confident that prices will be supported by output declines in January as producers implement the deal agreed to by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies, including Russia, in December to cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day. Al-Falih said on Sunday the oil market was “on the right track” and there was no need for an extraordinary OPEC meeting before its next planned gathering in April.

2019-01-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - Antarctica’s annual ice losses have accelerated six-fold in the past 40 years in a trend that could push sea levels metres higher in coming centuries amid man-made global warming, scientists said on Monday. They said the East Antarctic ice sheet is thawing at the fringes and adding to rising seas, unlike many past reports which have concluded that the eastern sheet has so far resisted a melt seen on the western side. Ice losses from the frozen continent surged to a net 252 billion tonnes a year in the period 2009-17 from an average 40 billion tonnes from 1979-90, according to the study in the U.S. journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Overall, the scientists said that the melt of Antarctica added water equivalent to 13.2 millimetres (0.5 inch) of sea level rise over the past four decades. “That’s just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak,” said Eric Rignot, a professor of Earth system science at the University of California, Irvine, who led other scientists in France, the Netherlands and the United States. “As the Antarctic ice sheet continues to melt away, we expect multi-metre sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries” with continued man-made global warming, he wrote in a statement. Global sea levels have risen about 20 centimetres (8 inches) in the past century and many other studies have shown a faster thaw from Greenland to Antarctica, threatening coasts from Bangladesh to Florida and cities from London to Shanghai. The PNAS study estimated that Antarctica lost 169 billion tonnes of ice from 1992-2017, above the 109 billion tonnes in the same period estimated last year by a large international team of researchers. The gap was mainly because the PNAS study estimated that East Antarctica lost 57 billion tonnes over the period compared to a 5 billion tonne gain in last year’s estimates. Ice sheets can gain mass if snowfall exceeds losses of ice. Co-author Michiel van den Broeke, a professor of Polar Meteorology at Utrecht University, said the thaw of Wilkes Land in East Antarctica was an emerging area of science. “It’s extremely important to find out what is happening there,” he told Reuters.  Antarctica contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by 57 metres if it ever all melted, a process that would require far higher temperatures than now and thousands of years.

2019-01-14,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Conceived as a bold plan to attack corruption, a crackdown by Mexico’s new president on rampant fuel theft has turned into a battle to prevent economic chaos after state governments, businesses and consumers were caught out by the decision. Eager to purge a prominent stain on Mexico’s reputation, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Dec. 27 unveiled a plan to increase military protection of oil installations and began cutting supply from pipelines that have been bled for years by thieves. So far, the result has been more than a week of severe fuel shortages, shuttered gas stations and lines of motorists snaking around city blocks waiting hours to fill their tanks.  The 65-year-old leftist, who took office on Dec. 1, will score a major victory if he can eradicate the parallel fuel distribution network which the government says has been run largely with the connivance of corrupt employees inside state oil firm Pemex [PEMX.UL]. Last year alone, the theft was worth $3 billion, according to government figures. But the pipeline shutdowns, which Lopez Obrador says were drawn up in his early morning security cabinet meetings during December, blindsided Mexicans when gas stations started to run dry in some of the country’s largest cities. Officials in three affected states told Reuters they were not warned in advance about the supply cuts. “There was zero coordination,” said Alejandro Guzman, head of economic development in the government of Jalisco, home to the country’s second-biggest city, Guadalajara. “We started to notice when the gas stations began closing.” He estimated only a quarter of gas stations in the western half of Guadalajara had fuel during the past week. Still, once the shortages became apparent, Pemex’s new management started to work well with the state to try to address the problem, he said. The government spent most of its regular news conference on Monday morning discussing the fuel plan. Pemex Chief Executive Octavio Romero said sales were recovering in affected areas. “We’ll be back to normal soon,” Lopez Obrador said. Government officials said three senior Pemex executives in charge of pipelines were under investigation over the fuel thefts, and that more than a dozen people had had their bank accounts blocked. None of the suspects were named. The haphazard roll-out of the plan, in which millions of liters of fuel are delivered each day by tanker truck instead of by pipeline, is a new test of investor confidence in Lopez Obrador, who rocked markets by cancelling a partly-built $13 billion airport five weeks before taking office. A successful crackdown on theft would be welcome news for Pemex, which as the most indebted oil firm in Latin America faces the threat of a credit rating downgrade. For now, however, Pemex is absorbing the higher cost of moving fuel by road. If distribution problems persist, industry groups say manufacturing facilities like auto plants could soon idle. The central bank has warned that fuel bottlenecks could stoke inflation and crimp growth in an already slowing economy. Already, a new black market is emerging for gasoline resold at a premium by people willing to spend the time standing in line. Usually bustling food markets in Mexico City have quietened down as shoppers and suppliers stay home to conserve fuel. Facing reporters every weekday at 7 a.m., Lopez Obrador has taken ownership of the theft crackdown. But his officials have not always agreed on how quickly the crunch will be resolved. Calling it the “first real domestic crisis” of the new administration, Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister, said the fuel controversy had added to previous question marks about Lopez Obrador’s style of governing. “There’s not enough communication and not enough coherence in the strategy,” said Rozental, a longtime diplomat turned business consultant. Given the complexity and cost of protecting thousands of miles of pipeline, some analysts believe Lopez Obrador will have to back down before the theft is fully under control. He says he will only reopen the pipelines when they are secured. Polls suggest Lopez Obrador’s base still has his back. A Jan. 9-11 survey of 1,000 voters by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky said 50 percent backed his plan, while some 40 percent wanted fuel supply returned to normal immediately. Lopez Obrador won office with just over 53 percent of the vote. Some of the worst shortages have been in opposition-run states. In one, the carmaking hub of Guanajuato, governor Diego Sinhue told local radio all but 7 of nearly 200 gas stations in Leon, the biggest city, were closed at one point. Once a largely peaceful region, annual murders in Guanajuato leapt more than ten-fold between 2007 and last year to over 2,300, spurred by turf wars between gangs battling over the pipelines that crisscross the central state. So the government’s decision to go after the fuel thieves was welcome, said Jose Arturo Sanchez, head of the Leon chapter of Mexico’s CCE business lobby. But the planning that left drivers stranded, he said, was “totally irresponsible.” “They didn’t consider the consequences,” he said. “In the 50 years I’ve lived in Leon, there’s been nothing like it.” As with Jalisco, Sinhue said Guanajuato was not warned by the federal government the pipelines would be closed. Nor was the city of Queretaro, capital of the neighboring state of the same name, mayor Luis Bernardo Nava told Reuters.

2019-01-14,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) is reviewing its investment plan for Italy after the country approved taxes on the purchase of larger gasoline and diesel cars, Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said on Monday.  The carmaker said in late November it would spend more than 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) on new models and engines in Italy over the next three years to try to make better use of factories and boost jobs and margins. In December, however, Italy approved measures to offer subsidies of up to 6,000 euros to buyers of new low-emission vehicles while introducing taxes on the larger gasoline and diesel cars. “It certainly means it needs to be reviewed again. It’s being reviewed at this moment,” Manley told journalists on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show. “Until that review is finished I can’t comment any further.” FCA’s Italian plans were intended to deliver on a strategy outlined by late boss Sergio Marchionne in June, when he committed to keep converting Italian plants to churn out higher-margin Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Maseratis, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles, to protect jobs and lift profit. Manley said tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on steel and aluminum imports would add between $300 million and $350 million in extra costs for FCA in 2019. He said the partial U.S. government shutdown over spending for a wall sought by Republican Trump on the U.S.-Mexican border has delayed final certification of one of FCA’s heavy-duty pickup trucks.  Pickup trucks are the one of most profitable segments in the auto industry and are a major profit driver for FCA as it battles for market share against General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N). “So I am concerned, clearly. Very concerned,” Manley said. “If it (the shutdown) continues it will have an impact on the launch of heavy duty.” “The earlier it can be resolved, clearly the better,” he added. Manley, who took the helm at the world’s seventh-largest carmaker last year after Marchionne’s sudden death, also said that FCA’s robotics business, Comau, and castings unit, Teksid, were not for sale at the moment.  “I’m focused on building value in those businesses. If I’m able to do that, that’s going to give me options in the future,” he said.  FCA last year agreed to sell its biggest parts maker, Magneti Marelli, to Japan’s Calsonic Kansei - owned by U.S. private equity firm KKR (KKR.N) - for 6.2 billion euros. That sparked renewed speculation that the smaller Comau and Teksid businesses could also go, especially after attracting interest from potential buyers in the past.   “One thing I learned in 2018: you should never say never,” Manley said. “Those businesses have value, there have been people that have talked to us about those businesses and I’ve been interested to hear what they have to say.” Reporting by Nick Carey in Detroit; Writing by Agnieszka Flak; Editing by David Goodman and Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autoshow-detroit-fiat-chrysler-italy/update-2-fca-reviewing-italy-plan-after-new-taxes-for-polluting-cars-idUKL8N1ZE5WE,14 Jan 2019,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV

2019-01-14,"(Adds details, background) By Aidan Lewis CAIRO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Israel will begin exporting natural gas to Egypt in a few months’ time, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Monday, a key step in the country’s plans to sell its expanding gas production abroad and bolster diplomatic ties. Steinitz did not give a specific target for initial exports, but said shipments would double after the huge Leviathan field in the eastern Mediterranean comes fully online in November. Steinitz said Israeli exports to Egypt were expected to reach 7 billion cubic meters annually over 10 years. About half the exports were expected to be used for Egypt’s domestic market and half to be liquefied for re-export, he said. Israel has discovered vast amounts of gas since the early 2000s, signing deals to export to Egypt and Jordan. Its production, currently around 10.5 billion cubic meters (bcm), is expected to more than double in 2020, rising to 27 bcm in 2021. In an interview on the sidelines of a regional gas forum in Cairo, Steinitz said Israel and Egypt had discussed how to extend cooperation on natural gas, including through exports. He also said Israel was hoping to sign a deal for the construction of the 2,000-kilometre (1,243-mile) East Med pipeline, which will cross from Israel and Cyprus into Greece and Italy, “in a few weeks’ time”. “Israel exporting natural gas to the Arab world and also to Europe — this is something that sounded like a dream or a fantasy just 10 or 15 years ago,” said Steinitz, the first energy minister to visit Egypt since the 2011 uprising there. The exports from Israel to Egypt will be made under a landmark $15 billion natural gas export deal announced in February 2018. In September, Israeli and Egyptian companies bought a 39 percent stake in the EMG pipeline, paving the way for the deal to begin. Partners in Israel’s Tamar and Leviathan offshore gas fields had said they would supply the private Egyptian company Dolphinus Holdings with around 64 billion cubic meters of gas over a decade as part of the deal. The agreement has stirred controversy in Egypt, which until a few years ago exported gas to Israel. Egypt is hoping to leverage its strategic location bridging Africa and Asia and its well-developed infrastructure to become a key trading and distribution centre for gas in the region and beyond. It has made a series of its own big discoveries in recent years, including Zohr, the largest gas field in the Mediterranean, but also needs to meet rapidly increasing domestic demand.

2019-01-14,"(Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp said on Monday it would buy smaller rival Goldcorp Inc for $10 billion, creating the world’s biggest gold producer in the face of dwindling easy-to-find reserves of the precious metal. The transaction, the biggest ever takeover in the gold sector according to Refinitiv, follows Barrick Gold Corp’s  agreement in September to buy Randgold Resources Ltd in a deal valued at $6.1 billion. “Combining forces will give us the sector’s best project pipeline and exploration portfolio,” Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said on a conference call with analysts. “These prospects translate to the gold sector’s largest reserve and resource base.” Vancouver-based Goldcorp’s Toronto-listed shares rose 7 percent to C$13.75 at 12:03 p.m. ET (1703 GMT). Newmont Mining’s shares were down about 8.8 percent at $31.83 in New York. In recent years, investor criticism over inadequate management of capital had largely kept gold companies focused on costs while dampening enthusiasm for acquisitions. But the need to bolster shrinking reserves and production and a rising gold price are now serving as catalysts for increased dealmaking. Spot gold prices are up 11.3 percent since an August trough, when they had declined 15 percent from a January 2018 peak. Newmont’s acquisition of Goldcorp could spark further consolidation in the industry, where too many gold companies are chasing too few assets, Michael Siperco from Macquarie Research said. He did not specify which companies are most likely to follow suit. The new company, to be called Newmont Goldcorp, is set to overtake current leader Barrick Gold’s annual production and will have mines in the Americas, Australia and Ghana. “This transaction is positive for Newmont, because it establishes it as the world’s leading gold producer with a deal that is accretive on nearly all key metrics,” analysts at Scotiabank wrote in a note.  The new company will be led by Newmont’s Goldberg. He will retire at the end of 2019, when Tom Palmer, Newmont’s chief operating officer, will take over as the CEO, the companies said. Denver, Colorado-based Newmont expects savings of $100 million a year. The combined company will sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion worth of assets over the next two years as part of the deal, mirroring a similar move by Barrick when it announced the Rangold acquisition. The new company is expected to produce 6-7 million ounces of gold annually over the next 10 years and beyond versus Barrick’s 2018 forecast of between 4.5 million and 5 million ounces. Newmont will offer 0.3280 of its share and $0.02 for each Goldcorp share. Based on Newmont’s Friday close, that translates to $11.46 per share, a premium of about 18 percent to Goldcorp’s Friday close on the New York Stock Exchange. nBw4JX5tpa] That remains below premiums paid in the last decade for gold deals, Credit Suisse analysts said in a note.

2019-01-14,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is willing to accept a deal with producers of Argentine biodiesel to settle a long-running trade dispute over imports of the product into Europe. The Commission, which oversees trade policy in the 28-member European Union, said it had communicated to interested parties last week that it was willing to accept undertakings from producers that they would sell at a minimum price. “This would exclude these producers from possible anti-subsidy duties to be imposed by the European Commission, while restoring the level playing field for European producers,” a Commission spokesperson said by email on Monday. Those interested parties have until Friday Jan. 18 to comment on the proposal, with EU countries due to be consulted on the issue on Jan. 30. The deadline for definite duties, which are typically in place for five years, is Feb. 28. A lawyer representing one of the parties in the case said the Commission had not made clear what the minimum price would be, nor what potential volume would be allowed in. The scheme with a minimum price would mirror that used to allow Chinese solar panel producers to export to the bloc after a major dispute over alleged dumping that threatened to spiral into a trade war. For Argentine biodiesel, the Commission has proposed duties of between 25.0 and 33.4 percent depending on the companies, a document seen by Reuters in December showed. Exporters include the Argentine arms of Bunge Ltd (BG.N), Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Corp [LOUDR.UL], as well as Molinos Rio de la Plata SA (MOLI.BA). “We would be willing to settle for a minimum value,” said Luis Zubizarreta, president of the Argentine Chamber of Biofuels (CARBIO). “There is a good dialogue (with the EU) and it seems like the way to benefit everyone,” Zubizarreta added. An Argentine industry source with knowledge of the relationships told Reuters that, if successful, the agreement would be implemented from February and last for “several years.”  The Commission began investigating Argentine, as well as Indonesian, biodiesel imports in 2012 following a request by EU producers of fuels made from vegetable and recycled oil. The EU case was based on export duties both countries impose on the raw material, soybeans for Argentina and palm oil for Indonesia. The EU view was that this gave an unfair advantage to biodiesel producers there, allowing them to sell at unfairly low prices. It imposed anti-dumping duties in 2013, but then had to remove most in March 2018 after successful challenges at the World Trade Organization and the European Court of Justice. The Commission opened its current anti-subsidy investigation a year ago.

Copper prices fell and the Australian and New Zealand dollars also declined following the China news, which added to worries that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were taking a toll on the world’s second-largest economy. “The biggest theme (in the market today) is risk-off,” said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus, Inc. Data from China showed imports fell 7.6 percent year-on-year in December while analysts had predicted a 5-percent rise. Exports dropped 4.4 percent, confounding expectations for a 3-percent gain. For an interactive version of the following chart, click here tmsnrt.rs/2SRopIf. The United States and China - the world’s two largest economies - have been in talks for months to try and resolve their bitter trade war, with no signs of substantial progress. Adding to the gloom were weak industrial output numbers from the euro zone, which showed the largest fall in nearly three years. Softening demand has been felt around the world with sales of goods ranging from iPhones to automobiles slowing, prompting profit warnings from Apple among others. Trade-sensitive shares fell, including Boeing Co Caterpillar Inc, though U.S. stock investors also were on edge as the U.S. earnings season kicked off. “We’re seeing some cautiousness heading into the beginning of earnings season as people are worried about guidance and what companies are going to say, especially in relation to trade,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 139.63 points, or 0.58 percent, to 23,856.32, the S&P 500 lost 16.99 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,579.27 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 63.27 points, or 0.91 percent, to 6,908.21. Citigroup Inc shares were higher after the bank beat profit estimates as lower expenses offset a drop in quarterly revenue. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.38 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.62 percent. U.S. Treasuries tracked the European bond market, but were little changed in late-morning U.S. trading. In the foreign exchange market, the Japanese yen, a safe-haven currency that benefits in times of geopolitical turmoil, strengthened against the U.S. dollar by 0.33 percent. The Australian dollar, which was down 0.24 percent, and kiwi dollar, which was down 0.12 percent. China is Australia’s largest trade partner. The prospect of slowing global growth also roiled some commodity markets. Industrial metals copper and aluminium lost ground in London and Shanghai. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was bid down 0.9 percent at $5,888 a tonne after failing to trade in official rings, its lowest level in more than a week. Oil prices were down slightly. U.S. crude fell 0.54 percent to $51.31 per barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 46 cents to $60.02 a barrel.

The decision to sell Eneco in an auction ended a heated battle between its board and shareholders, who wanted to cash in on their stakes.

2019-01-14,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Scott DiSavino Jan 14 (Reuters) - More U.S. coal-fired power plants were shut in President Donald Trump’s first two years than were retired in the whole of Barack Obama’s first term, despite the Republican’s efforts to prop up the industry to keep a campaign promise to coal-mining states. In total, more than 23,400 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation were shut in 2017-2018 versus 14,900 MW in 2009-2012, according to data from Reuters and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Trump has tried to roll back rules on climate change and the environment adopted during the Obama administration to fulfill pledges to voters in states like West Virginia and Wyoming. But the second highest year for coal shutdowns was in Trump’s second year, 2018, at around 14,500 megawatts, following a peak at about 17,700 megawatts in 2015 under Obama. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. The number of U.S. coal plants has continued to decline every year since coal capacity peaked at just over 317,400 MW in 2011, and is expected to keep falling as consumers demand power from cleaner and less expensive sources of energy. Cheap natural gas and the rising use of renewable power like solar and wind have kept electric prices relatively low for years, making it uneconomic for generators to keep investing in older coal and nuclear plants. Generators said they plan to shut around 8,422 MW of coal-fired power and 1,500 MW of nuclear in 2019, while adding 10,900 MW of wind, 8,200 MW of solar and 7,500 MW of gas, according to Reuters and EIA data. The predictions come from estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters and U.S. Energy Information Administration data. For a graphic on U.S. coal shutdowns, see: tmsnrt.rs/2H1GQIO. Since taking office in January 2017, the Trump administration has announced its intention to leave the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change and is relaxing Obama-era rules on emissions from power plants as it seeks to boost domestic production of oil, gas and coal. U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, spiked in 2018 after falling for the previous three years as cold weather spurred gas demand for heating and the booming economy pushed planes and trucks to guzzle fuel, according to a study by Rhodium Group, an independent research group. After falling to 5,144 million tonnes in 2017, the lowest since 1992, the EIA projected U.S. energy-related carbon emissions will rise to 5,299 million tonnes in 2018. “There will be a limit to what increasingly cheap renewable power and continuously cheap natural gas can deliver with respect to emissions reductions,” said John Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group who leads the firm’s power sector research, noting the rising use of gas to produce power as coal plants shut. Natural gas emits about half the carbon as coal. The Trump administration has also tried to slow the retirement of coal and nuclear plants through a directive in 2017 from Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize the aging units because they make the electric grid more resilient. That plan was bashed by advocates for gas, renewable power and consumers and unanimously rejected by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), led by former Chairman Kevin McIntyre. The plan could resurface now that Trump has a chance to replace McIntyre, who died on Jan. 2. Reporting by Scott DiSavino and Stephanie Kelly in New York

2019-01-14,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s agriculture minister on Monday criticized supermodel Gisele Bundchen for saying Brazil is a deforester and said she will invite the supermodel to be an ambassador for the country’s efforts to supply the world with food while preserving nature. Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said on Twitter that Bundchen would receive the invitation soon, after striking out at her in a radio interview. “Sorry, Gisele Bundchen, you should be our ambassador, to say that your country preserves, that your country is on the global vanguard of preservation, and don’t come here saying bad things about Brazil without knowledge of the facts,” Dias told Sao Paulo’s Jovem Pan radio station earlier on Monday. Press representatives for Bundchen did not immediately respond to request for comment. Recruiting the supermodel as a spokeswoman for sustainability would be a major public relations coup for the government of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, which took power Jan. 1, by bringing onboard a critic of his predecessor’s moves to loosen environmental protections. Bundchen, who is married to U.S. football star Tom Brady,  twice squared off with former President Michel Temer on social media over policies to shrink or eliminate protected areas of the Amazon. Temer ultimately reversed himself in both cases, responding directly to her by Twitter in one instance after vetoing rules that would have reduced the size of the Jamanxim national forest in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest. Environmentalists have blasted the new Bolsonaro government, warning that it may broadly roll back environmental protections.  Bolsonaro has said he wants to end an “industry” of environmental fines, which activists say is a major tool for ensuring rules are followed. He has also suggested Brazil could exit the Paris Agreement on climate change. Dias’ tweet followed on the radio interview in which she cited government statistics that Brazil has preserved roughly two-thirds of its native vegetation as evidence of the country’s accomplishments in conservation.

2019-01-14,"* U.S. talks with Doha to supply Germany with LNG -official * Qatar to invest $20 bln in U.S. LNG terminal, energy assets * U.S. warns German firms of sanctions over Russian pipeline * Talks with Riyadh, Kuwait over Neutral Zone oil resumption By Rania El Gamal and Eric Knecht DUBAI/DOHA, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The United States wants Qatar, the world’s top liquefied natural gas supplier, to challenge Russia’s gas dominance in Europe, a U.S. administration official said on Monday. Deputy U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told Reuters that the United States is talking with Doha about supplying Europe with LNG as it wants Germany and other countries to import Qatari and U.S. gas rather than from Russia, which now accounts for 60 percent of German gas imports. The United States has warned German companies about possible sanctions over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline under construction which will double Russia’s export capacity to Germany via the Baltic Sea.. Germany is Europe’s biggest energy consumer. Brouillette, speaking in Doha, said he had discussed the issue with Qatar’s Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad al-Kaabi, who is also chief executive of Qatar Petroleum (QP). “We are talking to Minister Kaabi here about other markets, specifically Europe, to the extent that we can talk to the Qataris about supplying European markets with natural gas,” he said in an interview. “They are very much interested in that and so are we – it’s very connected to deliberations with others we have around Nord Stream 2.” He said Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would increase the dependency of Germany and Europe on Russian gas, but that Germany had recently decided to help fund LNG import facilities that could offset that dependence. Kaabi told Reuters last month that QP is looking to invest at least $20 billion in the United States over the coming few years and he expected to make a final decision on its investment in the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas soon. QP is majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal, with Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips holding smaller stakes. “The Qatari investments in the Golden Pass, and in the U.S. export facilities are very important to allow us to get that natural gas to Europe,” Brouillette said. U.S. President Donald Trump in July accused Germany of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance and urged it to halt work on the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Germany rejects this charge and says it is open to diversifying its energy sources but that sales will ultimately be determined on economic grounds. Brouillette acknowledged that LNG would cost more than piped gas but said that LNG supplies from Qatar and other countries would help diversify supply sources to Europe. “It is good for the national security of Europe,” he said. “Cheap gas comes at a high price of freedom.” In September, Qatar said it would invest 10 billion euros ($11.6 billion) to strengthen its ties with Germany over the next five years, including the possible creation of a LNG terminal. Brouilette also said that the U.S. is talking with both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to encourage both Gulf allies to resolve a lingering issue over resuming oil production at jointly operated oilfields. The two OPEC countries halted output from the jointly run oilfields - Khafji and Wafra - in the so-called Neutral Zone more than three years ago, cutting some 500,000 barrels per day or 0.5 percent of global oil supply. “We have had some conversations with the Kuwaitis and the Saudis about this. My understanding is they made some progress on the offshore fields,” he said. “They were getting closer to resolving the matter.” (Editing by Jason Neely)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-energy-gulf/u-s-wants-qatar-to-challenge-russian-gas-in-europe-u-s-official-idUKL8N1ZE1XG,14 Jan 2019,"* Qatar to invest $20 bln in U.S. LNG terminal, energy

Data from China showed imports fell 7.6 percent year-on-year in December while analysts had predicted a 5 percent rise. Exports dropped 4.4 percent, confounding expectations for a 3 percent gain. For an interactive version of the following chart, click here tmsnrt.rs/2SRopIf. The data reinforced fears U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were starting to hit China’s cooling economy, while softening demand has been felt around the world with sales of goods ranging from iPhones to automobiles slowing, prompting profit warnings from Apple among others. Adding to the gloom were weak industrial output numbers from the euro zone, which posted their largest fall in nearly three years. The index of Europe’s leading 300 shares fell 0.9 percent by noon in London. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC were down over half a percent and 0.9 percent respectively, with shares in European luxury goods companies and the automotive sector suffering some of the biggest declines. The falls in Europe followed hefty declines in Asia where MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific ex-Japan shares lost around 1 percent from Friday’s 1-1/2 month high - its biggest single-day percentage drop since Jan. 2. Chinese and Hong Kong shares suffered the worst hits. “December’s (China) trade data were soft, but the data for the preceding months were surprisingly strong and show exports to the US growing at a decent pace, which may reflect producers trying to front-run any future escalation in tariffs,” wrote Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics in a note to clients. U.S. futures showed no let-up on the horizon, with Nasdaq e-mini futures pointing to falls over 1 percent for tech stocks while industrials looked set to open 0.9 percent softer. The prospect of slowing global growth also roiled commodity markets, with oil prices slipping over 1 percent . Industrial metals copper and aluminium lost ground in London and Shanghai. Safe-haven trades benefited from the equity pullback with U.S. 10-year Treasury yields falling to as low as 2.6690 percent - their lowest level in a week - while gold prices gained. The world’s two largest economies have been in talks for months to try and resolve their bitter trade war, with no signs of substantial progress. Some analysts expect China’s latest data to provide impetus to Beijing to resolve the trade dispute with Washington. Though Citi analysts said even with the rising probability for both sides to reach an agreement, the tariff and trade disruption appears to have already rippled through the global economy. “Regional trade growth appears to have slowed substantially after front-loading effect diminished,” they said. In light of the trade dispute, China’s policymakers have already pledged to step up support this year, following a raft of measures in 2018 including fast tracking infrastructure projects and cuts in banks’ reserve requirements and taxes. In currency markets, the yuan gave up some recent gains in both onshore and offshore trading. The Chinese currency had recorded its best week in more than a decade last week. However, this could change, said Tim Graf, head of macro strategy EMEA at State Street. “The weakness in the Chinese data is calling into question the recent strength of the renminbi,” said Graf. “The downside for dollar/Chinese yuan is limited and that has implications for the euro and the Aussie dollar.” The dollar index as measured against a basket of currencies nudged 0.1 percent lower to 95.558. The Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar - both gauges of global risk appetite - were both last down 0.3 percent. The euro was flat at $1.14710. Britain’s pound hit a seven-week high as Prime Minister Theresa May made last-ditch efforts to garner lawmakers’ support for her Brexit divorce deal, which looks almost certain to fail when it is put to a vote on Tuesday. For the U.S. trading day, banks will be in sharp focus as they kick off the earnings season. Quarterly results from Citigroup are due on Monday followed by JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley later this week. Expectations are downbeat with profits for U.S. companies forecast to rise 6.4 percent, down from an Oct. 1 estimate of 10.2 percent and a big drop from 2018’s tax cut-fuelled gain of more than 20 percent. Investor attention was also on the U.S. government shutdown, in its 24th day with no resolution in sight. Reporting by Karin Strohecker, additional reporting by Swati

2019-01-14,"ABUJA (Reuters) - A court hearing to consider allegations that the head of Nigeria’s judiciary breached asset declaration rules was adjourned on Monday until Jan. 22, weeks ahead of a presidential election in which he could play a crucial role. Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen did not appear at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) hearing.   Nigeria’s judiciary plays a key role in election matters and has helped resolve disputes in past votes. That means Onnoghen or his successor could help decide the victor if results of the Feb. 16 poll are disputed in court. President Muhammadu Buhari, who was a military ruler in the early 1980s, is seeking a second term and is campaigning on his anti-corruption record. The conduct tribunal, which tries asset declaration misdemeanours, said in a statement on Saturday that Onnoghen would face six separate charges, but did not give further details. Onnoghen could not be reached for comment. Under Nigerian law, state officials must declare their assets before taking office and after they leave.  The court agreed that the chief justice was not properly served with a court summons because papers were served to his personal assistant and not Onnoghen himself.  “The case is adjourned to Tuesday 22nd January. Before then, the defendant would have been properly served,” said Danladi Umar, chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal. The charges stem from allegations made by Dennis Aghanya, who served as Buhari’s media aide between 2009 and 2011 and worked with the president in his now defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) party.   The opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said Buhari’s ruling party was plotting to destabilise the judiciary ahead of elections by seeking to remove Onnoghen, which they say could cause a constitutional crisis.  Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party said it was committed to addressing corruption allegations and that the opposition’s claims were a “baseless conspiracy theory”.

Zhejiang Wuchan Zhongda, a venture between government fund Zhousan Communications Investment Group and Wuchang Zhongda Group, is the first privately owned company to receive a crude import licence from the ministry. The move could be an effort by the Chinese government to support the Shanghai crude futures contract that started up last year and attract institutional investors, according to Zhong Jian, chief analyst with consultancy JLC. “The approval showed China is further opening up its crude market. More importantly, a trading firm can deliver crude oil to refineries against the Shanghai crude futures contracts,” Zhong said. Zhejiang Wuchan Zhongda was set up in May 2018 with a registered capital of 1 billion yuan ($147.97 million), according to a filing from its parent company Wuchan Zhongda Group to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The company has not yet been granted a quota from the state planner, which will set the amount the trading firm can buy each year. China first granted quotas to an independent refiner in July 2015. While the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) approves the qualifications, the Ministry of Commerce releases the allowances. The ministry last month issued the first batch of crude oil quotas 58 so-called “non-state trade”, including mostly these independents. The actual allotments can be lower than the initial NDRC approvals, based on the plants’ import records. Under rules issued in February 2015 by the NDRC, smaller refiners can gain permission to use imported crude oil if they meet certain environmental conditions, including closing old and polluting refining capacity. $1 = 6.7582 Chinese yuan renminbi

2019-01-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers show signs of having completed their recent sale of crude and refined fuels, with positions edging up slightly in the first week of the new year, amid hopes a recession can be averted. Oil prices have bounced off their recent lows, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most other major currencies and expectations of a trade deal between the United States and China are rising. Portfolio managers raised their net long position in ICE Brent crude futures and options by 6 million barrels to 158 million barrels in the week to Jan. 8. Funds also boosted their net long position in European gasoil by 3 million barrels to a total of 5 million barrels, according to exchange data. Net long positions in Brent and gasoil remain close to multi-year lows and increases since the start of the year have been very small. But the heavy fund selling in crude and refined fuels reported during the fourth quarter appears to have ended, at least for now. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HcppoW) The completion of fund sales has been enough to help oil prices bounce off their recent lows as at least a few short positions have been covered. Fund managers have essentially squared their positions in crude and fuels and are remaining on the sidelines until the economic outlook becomes clearer. There are three main scenarios for the global economy this year: resumption of strong growth; an extended soft patch; or a slump into recession. In the first scenario, crude and fuel prices will likely rise, while in the second and third they are likely to remain around current levels or fall further. Fund managers’ cautious positioning in oil suggests they see roughly equal probabilities for all three outcomes at present. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.

CNBC TV18, citing sources, reported on Monday that Jet was likely to finalise a resolution plan with its lenders this week, and that Goyal would trim his 51 percent stake to 20-25 percent and agree to voting rights on his stake being capped at 10 percent, in a bid to save the debt-laden carrier. The report also said Etihad may infuse capital into Jet and raise its stake from the 24 percent it currently owns. Jet and Goyal did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Cash-strapped Jet early in the month said it had defaulted on debt payments to a consortium of Indian banks and that it was in talks with the consortium led by State Bank of India . The 25-year-old airline is facing financial difficulties and owes money to pilots, lessors and vendors. Intense pricing competition, a weak rupee and rising fuel costs weighed on Indian airlines in 2018.

2019-01-14,"* China’s Dec exports, imports tumble, miss forecasts * Europe stocks fall with auto stocks, luxury goods suffering * Fears of slowing global growth weighs on oil, copper * U.S. stock futures point to falls as earnings kick off By Karin Strohecker LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - World stock markets stumbled and commodities took a hit on Monday after a shock contraction in Chinese trade pointed to deepening cracks in the world’s second-biggest economy and sparked fresh fears of a sharper slowdown in global growth. Latest data from China showed imports fell 7.6 percent year-on-year in December when analysts had predicted a 5 percent rise, while exports dropped 4.4 percent, confounding expectations for a 3 percent gain. The data reinforced fears U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were starting to hit China’s cooling economy, while softening demand has been felt around the world with sales of goods ranging from iPhones to automobiles slowing, prompting profit warnings from the likes of Apple and Jaguar Land Rover. The index of Europe’s leading 300 shares slipped 0.7 percent in early trade to 1,365 points. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC fell around 0.6 percent, with shares in European luxury goods companies and the automotive sector suffering some of the biggest declines. “We believe trade growth next year will slow significantly on huge uncertainty and high base,” Citi analysts wrote in a note, predicting China’s exports and imports to fall 5.1 percent and 6.8 percent respectively this year. “Significant uncertainty remains as to whether there could be a ‘deal’ after March 1,” they added. The falls in Europe followed hefty declines in Asia where MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific ex-Japan shares lost around 1 percent from Friday’s 1-1/2 month high - its biggest single-day percentage drop since Jan. 2. Chinese and Hong Kong shares suffered the worst hits. U.S. futures showed no let-up on the horizon, with Nasdaq e-mini futures pointing to a near-1 percent fall for U.S. tech stocks while industrials looked to open 0.8 percent softer. The prospect of slowing global growth also roiled commodity markets, with oil prices slipping 1 percent and industrial metals copper and aluminium losing ground in both London and Shanghai. Meanwhile safe havens trades benefited from the equity pullback with U.S. 10-year Treasury yields falling to as low as 2.6690 percent - their lowest level in a week - while gold prices gained. The world’s two largest economies have been in talks for months now to try and resolve their bitter trade war, with no signs so far of any substantial progress in negotiations. Some analysts expect China’s latest data to provide impetus to Beijing to resolve the trade dispute with Washington. Though Citi analysts said even with the rising probability for both sides to reach an agreement, the tariff and trade disruption appears to have already rippled through the global economy. “The regional trade growth appears to have slowed substantially after front-loading effect diminished,” they said. In the wake of the trade dispute, China’s policymakers have already pledged to step up support this year, following a raft of measures in 2018 including fast tracking infrastructure projects and cuts in banks’ reserve requirements and taxes. In currency markets, the yuan held broadly onto recent gains in both onshore and offshore trading. The Chinese currency had recorded its best week in more than a decade last week. However, this could change, said Tim Graf, head of macro strategy EMEA at State Street. “The weakness in the Chinese data is calling into question the recent strength of the renminbi,” said Graf. “The downside for dollar/Chinese yuan is limited and that has implications for the euro and the Aussie dollar.” The dollar index as measured against a basket of currencies nudged 0.1 percent lower to 95.598 percent. However, the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar - both gauges of global risk appetite - softened more than 0.4 percent in early trading. The euro was subdued as it hit key technical levels after data from Italy on Friday showed the euro zone’s third-largest economy was at risk of recession. The single currency was last at $1.1474. Britain’s pound was marginally lower at $1.2826 at the start of what is expected to be a tumultuous week as Prime Minister Theresa May seeks to win a vote in parliament on Tuesday to get her Brexit deal approved.

2019-01-14,"(Reuters) - Britain’s Premier Oil Plc said on Monday it was looking to buy UK North Sea assets, after the Sunday Times reported that it was preparing to tap shareholders for cash to help it buy about $1.5 billion worth of oil fields. The company’s shares fell as much as 12.5 percent following the report and was the top loser on the UK midcap index. Premier Oil was in the running to pick up fields being sold by US oil giant Chevron Corp and is considering a rights issue or share placing to help pay for them should it win the auction, according to the Sunday Times report. (bit.ly/2RKKtHq) The British oil and gas company said on Monday it was looking at opportunities to buy UK North Sea assets, but no decision had been taken to bid for assets currently being marketed by Chevron and how any deal would be financed. Premier Oil could sell all or part of its Latin American business to help pay for the deal — and minimize the size of any share sale, the Sunday Times said, citing industry sources.

2019-01-14,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German conservative leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer on Monday accused environmental organizations of mounting “crusades”  against diesel vehicles and said that driving bans threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs. Referring to the non-government environmental organization DUH, which has launched legal battles to ban the most polluting diesel cars from cities, she said: “DUH is doing a good job, but there is a growing impression that crusades are being led against diesel.” Kramp-Karrenbauer, who in December won the race to succeed Angela Merkel as chairwoman of the Christian Democrats (CDU), told n-tv broadcaster: “That hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on the (automotive) industry is an aspect that is often lost.” The government last month cleared away legal hurdles for carmakers to upgrade exhaust emissions filtering systems on older diesel cars as a way to avoid vehicle bans. Carmakers have been forced to consider upgrading exhaust treatment systems on older cars after German cities started banning heavily polluting diesel vehicles to cut pollution from fine particulate matter and toxic nitrogen oxides. The fight over refits is the latest fallout from an emissions cheating scandal triggered by Volkswagen in 2015 after it admitted systematically hiding illegal pollution levels from regulators. German politicians have been criticized for being too slow to react to the diesel scandal, which threatens the future of an industry that accounts for about 800,000 jobs.

2019-01-14,"(Reuters) - The deadly winter storm that clobbered a swath of the U.S. Midwest and East Coast over the weekend is blowing out to sea, but leaves as much as 13 inches of snow in Washington, D.C. and Virginia, and frigid arctic air parked over New England. All Washington D.C. federal offices would be closed on Monday, but train and bus service in the metro D.C. area would resume after being shut down on Sunday, officials said. “There’s some digging out to do,” Jim Hayes, a forecaster with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said early Monday. “In Virginia, D.C. and Maryland, 6-to-12 inches of snow fell with some places getting 13 inches,” he said. The good news is that around noon on Monday the clouds should start clearing and temperatures will rise into the low 40’s Fahrenheit, Hayes said. The snowstorm is blamed for the deaths of at least eight people in road accidents across the U.S. Midwest and possibly also the death of an Illinois state police officer who was killed on Saturday during a traffic stop, officials said.  Air traffic at Ronald Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport was returning to normal. Early on Monday, fewer than 400 flights were canceled in affected areas and about 1,600 were delayed, according the online flight tracking site Flightaware. At the height of the storm, more than 1,600 flights were canceled in and out of U.S. airports on Sunday, the bulk of them at Washington’s Reagan and Dulles, the website reported. Winter storm warnings for millions of Americans in 10 states and Washington, D.C., were being lifted early Monday in a swath of the United States from Colorado to the East Coast, Hayes said. “But up north it’s going to stay cold,” Hayes said. Boston temperatures will creep up from the teens (Farhenheit) into the low 20s. Temperatures in Portland, Maine will top-out at 11 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 Celsius) as a core of Arctic air stays parked over New England, Hayes said. “The worst is in Big Black River, Maine,” said Hayes. “It hit minus 20 (minus 29 Celsius) overnight.” Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-weather/worst-is-over-for-winter-storm-that-clobbered-u-s-midwest-d-c-and-new-england-idUKL1N1ZE035,14 Jan 2019,"The deadly winter storm that clobbered a

2019-01-14,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - An undersea cable and pipe-laying ship, the Vanuatu-flagged MV Star Centurion, capsized in the Indonesian waters of the Singapore Straits after a collision with a tanker on Sunday, with no fatalities, authorities said on Monday. The Singapore Straits are one of the world’s busiest shipping zones with hundreds of container ships, oil and fuel tankers and dry bulk carriers daily traversing the waters that connect east Asia to Europe, India and Africa. The collision happened just north of Bintan, an Indonesian island in the Riau Islands province that sits opposite the city-state of Singapore. “It’s already capsized,” Samsul Nizar, the head of operations at the Indonesian coast guard base at Tanjung Uban on Bintan, told Reuters by telephone, “but it hasn’t sunk completely.” Coast guard vessels were monitoring the ship, Nizar said, and all crew were in a safe condition and had been rescued by Singaporean authorities. Refinitiv Eikon shipping data showed the Centurion, a 13,000 deadweight tonne ship specialising in laying cables and pipes on the ocean floor, was anchored in the Horsburgh OPL zone, an area in which ships take on marine fuel, on the eastern edge of the Singapore Straits. Meanwhile, the Antea, a 40,000-deadweight-tonne oil product tanker, was steaming past it. The Antea’s registered owner is Pertamina. A spokesman for the company could not immediately be reached for comment on the matter. It was not immediately clear who owns the Star Centurion, which also goes by the name of Lewek Centurian.

2019-01-14,"* Brent crude oil falls back below $60 per barrel * China reports slump in import-export data * Despite weak trade data, China oil imports hold above 10 mln bpd * OPEC-led supply cuts also provide oil with some support (Updates prices) By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell by 1 percent on Monday, with Brent crude slipping below $60 per barrel, after Chinese data showed weakening imports and exports in the world’s biggest trading nation and second-largest crude oil consumer. International Brent crude oil futures were at $59.88 per barrel at 0816 GMT, down 60 cents, or 1 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 59 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $51 a barrel. China’s overall exports fell by 4.4 percent in December from a year earlier, the biggest monthly drop in two years, official data showed on Monday, pointing to further weakening in the world’s second-largest economy. Imports also contracted, falling 7.6 percent, the biggest decline since July 2016. “Crude futures were back in the red as trading began for a fresh week in Asia, in tandem with most of the region’s stock markets ... (as) China early Monday reported a $351.76 billion trade surplus in dollar terms for 2018, the lowest since 2013,” said energy consultant Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights in a note. The weak data confirms a raft of indicators that have been pointing to an economic slowdown since the second half of 2018. “Producer price inflation has decelerated for six consecutive months, adding to other signs of cooling industrial activity (in China) amid weakening global demand,” ratings agency Moody’s said in a note. Traders said the data pulled down crude oil futures and Asian stock markets alike, which had both posted modest gains earlier on Monday. Economic research firm TS Lombard said oil prices were capped as “the world economy is now slowing ... limiting the scope for positive surprises in oil demand and hampering inventory reduction.” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank, said “the deterioration seen recently in forward-looking economic data from the U.S. to Europe and China” meant that the upside for crude oil futures was likely limited to $64 per barrel for Brent and for $55 for WTI. Despite the weak Chinese trade data, the country’s oil imports remained near record levels in December at 10.31 million barrels per day (bpd), holding above the 10 million bpd mark for the second month in a row, on stockbuilding by small independent refiners who were trying to use up annual quotas. Amid this strong demand from the world’s top oil importer, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC allies, including Russia, have been cutting supply since late 2018, providing crude prices some support.

E-minis for the S&P 500 declined 0.8 percent, in an indication of heightened risk aversion. Spreadbetters also pointed to a weak start for Europe while FTSE futures slipped 0.4 percent. Latest data from China showed imports fell 7.6 percent year-on-year in December when analysts had predicted a 5 percent rise while exports unexpectedly dropped 4.4 percent, confounding expectations for a 3 percent gain. The disappointing numbers reinforced fears U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were starting to take a heavy toll on China’s cooling economy. Softening demand in China is already being felt around the world, with slowing sales of goods ranging from iPhones to automobiles, prompting profit warnings from the likes of Apple and Jaguar Land Rover. The Australian dollar, a key gauge of global risk sentiment and a liquid proxy for the Chinese yuan, toppled from Friday’s one-month peak of $0.7235 to $0.7186 after the dismal data. “We believe trade growth next year will slow significantly on huge uncertainty and high base,” Citi analysts wrote in a note, predicting China’s exports and imports to fall 5.1 percent and 6.8 percent respectively this year. “Significant uncertainty remains as to whether there could be a ‘deal’ after March 1,” they added. Those concerns sent MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sliding 1 percent from Friday’s 1-1/2 month top for its biggest single-day percentage drop since Jan. 2, with Chinese and Hong Kong shares the worst hit. Liquidity was generally light during Asian hours as Japan was on public holiday. Chinese shares were in the red, with the blue-chip index down 0.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 1.5 percent while Australian shares reversed early gains to end mostly flat. Some analysts expect Monday’s trade data to provide impetus to Chinese authorities to resolve the trade dispute with Washington. “You could argue that the worse the numbers are the more incentive it provides to resolve the dispute,” Ray Attrill, forex strategist at National Australia Bank, told Reuters. “It also amplifies the extent to which they (Chinese policymakers) have to provide stimulus for the domestic economy,” Attrill added. The world’s two largest economies have been in talks for months now to try and resolve their bitter trade war, with no signs so far of any substantial progress in negotiations. Citi analysts said even with the rising probability for both sides to reach an agreement, the tariff and trade disruption appears to have already rippled through the global economy. “The regional trade growth appears to have slowed substantially after front-loading effect diminished,” they said. In the wake of the trade dispute, China’s policymakers have already pledged to step up support this year, following a raft of measures in 2018 including fast tracking infrastructure projects and cuts in banks’ reserve requirements and taxes. On the earnings front, U.S. banks are in sharp focus with quarterly results from Citigroup due Monday followed by JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley later in the week. Expectations are dour with profits for U.S. companies forecast to rise 6.4 percent, down from an Oct. 1 estimate of 10.2 percent and a big drop from 2018’s tax cut-fueled gain of more than 20 percent.

The surge was bolstered by year-end stockbuilding by small independent refiners trying to use up annual quotas and crude cargoes imported for tests on two new private refineries. December shipments into China, the world’s top crude oil buyer, were at 43.78 million tonnes, or 10.31 million barrels per day (bpd), holding above the 10 million bpd mark for the second straight month, and just a touch below the record of 10.43 million bpd in November, according to the data released by the General Administration of Chinese Customs. For the whole of 2018, China’s crude oil imports rose 10.1 percent versus the previous year to a record 461.9 million tonnes, or 9.24 million bpd. This makes China the top crude oil importer for the second year running, after it first overtook the United States on an annual basis in 2017. The 2018 growth represents an increase of 846,600 bpd - more than 2017’s net growth of 770,000 bpd - and roughly the size of consumption by the Netherlands or Turkey. Peak operations at giant state refiners during most of the first three quarters accounted for the bulk of the import growth, joined later by new purchasing from two privately-run mega refineries ahead of trial runs, said Seng-Yick Tee of consultancy SIA Energy. Strategic stockpiling at several state reserve sites that have just started up, such as Jinzhou in the north and Huizhou on China’s southern coast, also contributed to more shipments during the last few months of 2018 as China took advantage of steep falls in benchmark prices from mid-November, said Tee. Independent oil processors, sometimes called “teapots”, played a smaller role in 2018 than in previous years due to marginal increases in their import quotas and a new tax policy that pinched their appetite for overseas crude. “Unlike the previous two years when teapots led the incremental growth, state giants became the main drivers for last year’s growth,” said Tee. China also exported a record amount of refined fuel products last year at 58.64 million tonnes, up 12 percent from 2017, aided by a larger amount of government export quotas to relieve a growing domestic fuel surplus. Gas imports, including piped gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipped in tankers, hit a record last month at 9.23 million tonnes, up 17 percent from the same month in 2017. The previous monthly record of 9.15 million tonnes came in November. The hefty imports were spurred by another year of strong demand growth for the cleaner-burning fuel as Beijing extended a campaign against smog by switching another 3 million of homes to gas from coal for winter heating. Imports for the year expanded 31.9 percent over 2017 to 90.39 million tonnes, holding the top spot among gas importers globally after overtaking that position from Japan as recently as October. For LNG alone, China retains its spot for the second year as the world’s No.2 buyer, behind Japan, after leapfrogging South Korea in 2017. In an effort to avert the supply crunch experienced in the 2017/18 winter, state energy firms stepped up their imports of LNG and build up stocks in underground storage.

Coal imports were 3.4 percent above 2017, data from the General Administration of Customs showed, even as December’s imports tumbled nearly 47 percent to 10.23 million tonnes. Traders and utilities cut back sharply on purchases at the end of the year following government signals, with utilities sitting on record coal stocks, pushing down domestic prices. Utilities had been told they needed to keep imports in 2018 below the prior year’s level, amid abundant domestic supplies and slowing electricity demand growth. China has also switched another 3.29 million households to gas heating this winter, according to Reuters calculations, more than last year, as Beijing continues to push the use of cleaner fuels to curb pollution. Traders expect imports of coal, used in China for power generation, heating and steelmaking, to remain low in January as the country continues to curb imports in order to boost domestic coal prices.

2019-01-14,"MO CAY, Vietnam (Reuters) - In the dead of night, the entire front half of shopkeeper Ta Thi Kim Anh’s house collapsed. Perched on the sandy banks of the Mekong River, it took just a few minutes for one half of everything she owned to plunge into its murky depths. “Our kitchen, our laundry room, our two bedrooms, all gone,” said Kim Anh, speaking amongst the twisted metal and rubble of her house, from which she still sells eggs, soap and instant noodles to villagers in Ben Tre, a province in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta region. “We’d be better off living in a cave instead,” said Kim Anh, who has used coconut husks and old tires to reinforce the riverbank under her home. Upstream damming and extensive mining of the Mekong’s riverbed for sand is causing the land between the sprawling network of rivers and channels near the mouth of one of the world’s great rivers to sink at a pace of around 2 cm (0.75 inches) a year, experts and officials said. The 4,350 km (2,700-mile) river, known as the Lancang in its upper reaches, flows from China’s Tibetan Plateau along the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand, through Cambodia and finally Vietnam, where it forms the delta known in Vietnam as the “Nine Dragons”. Reuters visited three provinces straddling different branches of the delta, where it has supported farming and fishing communities for millennia. Across the region, local authorities are struggling with a rapid pace of erosion that is destroying homes and threatening livelihoods in the Southeast Asian country’s largest rice-growing region. A key cause is the years of upstream damming in Cambodia, Laos and China that has removed crucial sediment, local officials and experts said. That sediment, vital for checking the mighty Mekong’s currents, has also been lost due to an insatiable demand for sand - a key ingredient in concrete and other construction materials in fast-developing Vietnam - that has created a market both at home and abroad for unregulated mining. “It’s not a problem of the lack of water, it’s the lack of sediment,” said Duong Van Ni, an expert on the Mekong River at the College of Natural Resources Management of Can Tho University, the largest city in the Mekong Delta region. At this time of year the waters of the Mekong used to flow into Vietnam as a milky-brown crawl, locals and officials said.  Now, the river runs clear. And without fresh sediment from upstream, the deeper riverbed creates stronger currents, which in turn eat away at the banks of the Mekong, where those who rely on the river for their livelihoods have their homes. The problems began when China built its first hydropower plants in the Upper Mekong Basin, said Ni at Can Tho University. That left Laos, Cambodia and Thailand as the main source of sediment for the Mekong in Vietnam, he said. Sand mining in Cambodia boomed over the last 10 years, fueled in part by demand from wealthy but cramped Singapore, where it is used to reclaim land along its coast, and culminating in a government ban of all Cambodian sand exports in 2017 under pressure from environmental groups. Hydroelectric projects have continued, however. Earlier this month, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen opened a $816 million hydroelectric dam in Stung Treng province, near the border with Laos, built by companies from China, Cambodia and Vietnam. The new dam is the southeast Asian country’s biggest hydroelectric project to date and will have a catastrophic impact on fisheries and biodiversity in the Mekong river, environmental groups have said. Hun Sen has dismissed criticism of the project, which he says benefits Cambodia and its people. “Since China built hydropower plants, new sand almost never reaches us,” said Ni. “If we use up the sand we have here, there will be no more”. China’s Foreign Ministry said in response to Reuters’ questions that it “pays great attention to the concerns and needs of downstream countries on the Mekong”, adding that its regulation of water flows from hydro dams “has already become an important instrument in preventing floods and droughts”. Singapore’s Ministry of National Development said in a statement emailed to Reuters the city state imports sand on a commercial basis from various countries. “We have stringent controls to ensure that suppliers obtain sand in accordance with the source country’s laws and regulations,” it said. Regional officials in southwest China’s Yunnan province have defended the building of dams on the Mekong there as “fully legally compliant”. Downstream, however, the problem is made worse by thieves who illegally mine for sand, usually at night. “The unlicensed sand miners are very quick and devious,” Nguyen Quang Thuong, vice head of Ben Tre province’s agriculture department, told Reuters in a recent interview.  “They escape very fast, so having groups of local people helping out the authorities is very helpful.” One such group in Ben Tre, some of whom are as old as 67, have been using homemade weapons such as slingshots and rudimentary catapults to drive the sand thieves away. “We patrol 24/7, and in the first few months we managed to get rid of 90 percent of the thieves,” said Nam Lai, one of the group. “Since 2018, none of them dare to go near our shore”. Still, activists and environmental groups worry that on the Mekong, which runs through six countries with competing needs to exploit the river’s hydroelectric potential, the damage has already been done. Pianporn Deetes, at the International Rivers campaign group, who has worked on the Mekong for two decades, said there was a lack of political will among the countries that share the river to acknowledge the cross-border impact of such projects. “Without the recognition of the existing problems, I don’t think there is any hope,” she said.

2019-01-14,"(Repeats column that ran on Friday, with no changes) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HjMiXV By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - By the end of last year, hedge fund positions in diesel had fallen to a level normally associated with a sharp slowdown in economic growth if not an outright recession. Most middle distillate fuels such as diesel, gasoil and jet fuel are consumed in freight transport (ships, trucks, railroads and air cargo) as well as manufacturing and mining. Middle distillate consumption and prices are therefore more closely tied to the state of the economy than other refined fuels such as gasoline. (tmsnrt.rs/2HjMiXV) For the last 25 years, hedge funds and other speculators, collectively termed “non-commercial traders”, have mostly held a net long or bullish position in distillate futures and options. The typical net long position reflects the overall expansion of the U.S. and global economies (expansions have been long while recessions have been relatively short). In most cases, when non-commercial traders have switched to a substantial net short or bearish position the economy has been experiencing a sharp slowdown or is already in recession. Large net short positions in 1995, 1998, 2002, 2010 and 2015 were all associated with slowdowns or recessions according to contemporary statements or minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee. The exception was the net short position at the end of 2004, which came six months after the Fed noted a “soft patch” in the expansion, by which time the economy was improving enough for the Fed to raise interest rates again. Crucially, not all these episodes ended in a recession; some were transient slowdowns in an uninterrupted expansion. But given this history, the large liquidation of speculative long positions in diesel futures during the fourth quarter of 2018 was consistent with a substantial deterioration in the economic outlook. Non-commercial traders started 2018 with a record bullish position in U.S. diesel futures equivalent to 64 million barrels of fuel, with more bullish positions held in options and European derivatives such as gasoil. At the start of the fourth quarter, they still held a very large net long position equivalent to almost 48 million barrels, suggesting most speculators continued to anticipate a strong economic expansion. But the net long position had disappeared by the end of November and turned into a net short of 8 million barrels by the middle of December, coinciding with the slump in equity markets and fears about the economic outlook. Unfortunately, there is no more recent data on non-commercial positions because of the partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government. By the middle of December, the net short position was not yet at a level signalling a slowdown or recession, but the trend was clear. The fall in non-commercial diesel positions was consistent with other indicators of slackening economic activity including the decline in equity prices, yield curve inversion, business surveys and slowing freight growth. At the end of 2018, the distillate market, like other financial markets and the economy, was balanced uncertainly on the brink of a slowdown. What happens next depends critically on whether the U.S. and global economies accelerate again, settle into an extended soft patch, or slump into recession. If the rate of economic expansion quickens again, hedge funds and other speculators will close some of their short positions and rebuild a significant net long position, exerting upward pressure on diesel and crude prices. The process may already have started in recent days as traders become more optimistic the United States and China will reach an agreement, or at least a truce, in their trade war. But if the economy settles into a more sluggish phase, or stalls and slips into recession, further hedge fund selling will put renewed downward pressure on diesel and crude.

2019-01-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Monday pledged to fight air pollution and introduce new legislation this year on air quality to save lives and billions of pounds for the economy. The government said Britain would become the first major economy to adopt air quality goals based on World Health Organization recommendations regarding people’s exposure to particulate matter. “Air pollution continues to shorten lives, harm our children and reduce quality of life. We must take strong, urgent action,” environment minister Michael Gove said in a statement. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it aimed to reduce the costs of air pollution to society by 1.7 billion pounds every year by 2020, increasing to 5.3 billion pounds every year from 2030. Last year, the government published plans to reduce emissions from cars and planes. In addition to cars, diesel-only trains will also be phased out by 2040. The strategy, which also looks to tackle home, farming and industrial pollutants, commits Britain to halving the number of people who live in areas breaching WHO guidelines on pollution as poor air quality in British cities comes under scrutiny. On Friday, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave consent for a new inquest to be opened into the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old asthma sufferer who died in 2013, after her family argued that the initial inquest ignored the role air pollution might have played in her death. A petition to Cox by the family said there was evidence Kissi-Debrah’s hospital visits were linked to illegal levels on air pollution near her home in South London. Cox said that the evidence meant the family could apply for a new inquest at the High Court. She would be the first person in Britain to have her death legally linked to air pollution as charities and pressure groups bid to raise awareness of the impact poor air quality has on health. “Thousands of lives are lost every year in the UK because the air we breathe contains dangerous particles,” said Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation, adding the strategy need matching with legislative action. “We urgently need these guidelines adopted into national law, to accelerate coordinated, bold and ambitious action that will protect people’s heart and circulatory health wherever they live in the UK.” Reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Hugh Lawson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-pollution/britain-pledges-legislation-in-2019-to-combat-deadly-air-pollution-idUKL8N1ZC0I7,14 Jan 2019,"Britain on Monday pledged to
