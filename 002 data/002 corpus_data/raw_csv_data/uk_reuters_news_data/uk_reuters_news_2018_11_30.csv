2018-11-30,"WASHINGTON/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department will conduct another environmental review of TransCanada Corp’s long-pending Keystone XL oil pipeline, a U.S. official said on Friday, a move that could lead to additional delays of the project. The so-called supplemental environmental impact statement was ordered by Judge Brian Morris of the U.S. District Court in Montana in his ruling on Nov. 8 that blocked construction of the pipeline planned to bring heavy crude from Canada’s oil sands to the United States.   Morris said in his ruling that previous environmental analysis of Keystone XL fell short of a “hard look” at the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on Native American land resources. The $8 billion pipeline, which is supported by Canadian oil interests and U.S. refiners, but opposed by landowners and environmentalists, has been pending for a decade.  President Donald Trump announced a permit for the project soon after he took office. Former President Barack Obama nixed the pipeline, saying it would do little to help U.S. consumers and would add greenhouse gases.  TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said that the State Department’s announcement of an additional review was expected after the judge’s ruling.  Earlier this week, TransCanada asked Morris, the District Court judge, to allow it to resume some U.S.-based pre-construction activities blocked by the initial ruling.  Morris’ decision on Thursday gave the Calgary, Alberta-based company permission to resume some activity on the pipeline project, including project development work and stakeholder meetings. It is not allowed to resume physical field work like moving pipe and equipment, preparing work camp sites or undertaking road upgrades at this time, Cunha said. Morris is set to rule on that work after Dec. 5. “It is too soon to say what the injunction will mean to the timeline of the Keystone XL pipeline but we remain confident the project will be built,” Cunha said.

2018-11-30,"SAO PAULO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Paulo Roberto de Souza, chief executive of Brazil’s Copersucar SA, one of the world’s largest sugar and ethanol companies, is stepping down, the company said on Friday. Copersucar, a partner of Cargill Inc in the world’s largest sugar trader Alvean, said Souza was leaving due to personal reasons and that João Roberto Teixeira, who led Brazilian bank Votorantim for several years, will be the new CEO starting on Monday. Souza led Copersucar for nine years and was a key person behind the deal with Cargill in 2014 to create Alvean, a company controlling one third of the global sugar export market. Copersucar said Souza will continue to take part on the boards of some ventures, including Alvean, which also had a major management change in September when its head of operations, Soren Jensen, left the firm. Copersucar is in charge of selling sugar and ethanol produced by 35 associated mills in Brazil. It sold 4.5 million tonnes of sugar and 4.3 billion liters of ethanol in the 2017/18 crop year, with net revenue of 28.6 billion reais ($7.40 billion). The company also owns 100 percent of U.S.-based fuel distributor and ethanol trader Eco-Energy. $1 = 3.8662 reais

2018-11-30,"LIMA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Canada’s Frontera Energy Corp could be forced to halt operations in Peru’s largest oil block if a key pipeline ruptured amid indigenous protests is not promptly repaired, state oil company Petroperu said on Friday. The pipeline, in a remote corner of Peru’s Amazon, was attacked earlier this week in protests over municipal election results, causing it to spew thousands of gallons, Petroperu said. The rupture has already forced Frontera to slash production by 12,000 barrels of crude daily, Manuel Ugaz, manager for Petroperu subsidiary Oleoducto Peru, told reporters. “If the problem isn’t immediately solved, either with a provisional repair or a permanent one, Frontera will need to shut down production at all its wells,” Ugaz said. Frontera did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Frontera operates Block 192, an oil-rich concession in the Amazon with reserves of 100 million barrels of petroleum. The company’s contract expires in 2019. Vandals have repeatedly attacked the 1,106 km (687 mile) pipeline over the past several years, wreaking havoc on production and spooking investors. The pipe transports crude from jungle oil blocks tapped by Frontera to Petroperu’s refinery on the Pacific coast. Ugaz said the Canadian oil company could lose $200,000 daily if it is forced to halt production. Petroperu estimates that 8,000 barrels of oil spilled following the attack on the pipeline, although it says none of that oil has reached waterways. The state oil company has since stopped pumping crude through the pipe. Beatriz Alva Hart, a Petroperu manager for relations with communities near the pipeline, said villagers from the Morona district confessed to the attack. But law enforcement has been unable to stop the ongoing protest, contain the spill or fix the pipe, she said. “To date, they are not allowing us to fix the pipe,” she said. “It’s an environmental attack that affects all Peruvians.” Representatives from the indigenous community could not be immediately located for comment.

2018-11-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices retreated on Friday amid a global glut, racking up a 20 percent drop for November, while world equity markets were mixed ahead of weekend talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. U.S. shares, however, turned positive midday after a Chinese official said at the Group of 20 industrialized nations summit in Argentina that the United States and China were making progress on trade talks. “Consensus is steadily increasing,” Wang Xiaolong, director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s department of international economic affairs, told Reuters on the sidelines of the summit. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly percentage gains in nearly seven years on trade hopes and after the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted this week at a more dovish approach to interest rate hikes. [.N] In Europe, Frankfurt’s DAX had its worst run since late 2008, weighed by Deutsche Bank shares falling to an all-time low as police searched the bank’s headquarters for a second day in a money laundering scandal linked to the Panama Papers.

OPEC and its allies are meeting in Vienna next week to discuss oil output.  U.S. crude fell 1.69 percent to $50.58 per barrel and Brent was last at $58.68, down 1.39 percent on the day. Markets could have a wild December if Trump and Xi fail to de-escalate their trade rhetoric during talks at this weekend’s G20 meeting in Argentina. “The three key issues that people are really focusing on are how dovish is the Fed going to be going forward, how are trade relations with China going to play out, and what’s going on in the oil markets,” said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. “But as we get better news, that’s helped lift the markets,” Ripley added. “That’s why we’re seeing a week like this week.” Trump pointed to positive signs in trade talks, saying on Friday, “We’re working very hard. If we could make a deal, that would be good. I think they want to. I think we’d like to.” Still, the dollar rose as investors prepared for fallout from the talks, which are expected to increase volatility across markets. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.46 percent, with the euro down 0.66 percent to $1.1316.

2018-11-30,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in California has granted preliminary approval to a $48 million settlement for investors who said Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) made false and misleading statements over its excess diesel emissions. Lawyers for the investors, who include police and other municipal pension funds, had estimated that the maximum they could have recovered was $147 million. But Judge Charles Breyer said the settlement agreed in August appeared “fair, adequate and reasonable.” VW, in a statement, said on Friday that the “proposed settlement agreement eliminates the uncertainty and considerable costs of protracted litigation in the United States and is in the best interests of the company.” The ruling was issued late Wednesday. In total, Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The buybacks will continue through 2019. The German automaker admitted in September 2015 to secretly installing software in nearly 500,000 U.S. cars to cheat government exhaust emissions tests. The vehicles had emitted up to 40 times the legally allowable pollutants.  In 2017, VW also pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements in a U.S. court. Under the plea deal, the automaker agreed to sweeping reforms, new audits and oversight by an independent monitor for three years. Federal prosecutors in Detroit unsealed criminal charges in May against former VW Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn, who remains in Germany. Two other former VW executives have pleaded guilty in the investigation and are in prison. In total, nine people have been charged in the United States.

2018-11-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Friday due to concerns of oversupply and a strong dollar but losses were limited by expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia would agree some form of production cut next week. The two benchmarks, North Sea Brent LCOc1 and U.S. crude CLc1, still have had their weakest month in more than 10 years in November, losing more than 20 percent as global supply has outstripped demand. Front-month Brent futures fell 80 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $58.71 a barrel, ahead of expiry. The more active February Brent crude futures LCOG9 lost 45 cents to settle at $59.46 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 dropped 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $50.93 a barrel. Oil prices also came under pressure as the dollar rose against a basket of currencies .DXY as investors hoped that the United States and China would come to an agreement over trade talks. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies. Prices pared losses from session lows after Bloomberg reported OPEC’s advisory committee suggested decreasing production by 1.3 million barrels per day from last month’s levels, traders said. “Oil prices bounced back late in the day on Friday on reports that the OPEC committee had suggested a 1.3 million barrel per day cut from the October level,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com.  “The pressure has certainly been building as prices continued to fall amid ongoing concerns over excessive supply and lower demand growth ... If no action is taken, oil prices could certainly drop further, while a production cut should lead to a sizeable rebound for these severely oversold levels.” Before the OPEC meeting in Vienna, the world’s top three producers - the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia - will be part of a meeting this weekend of the Group of 20 industrialized nations in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak will meet his Saudi counterpart at the G20 summit in Argentina and discuss an oil output reduction in 2019, RIA news agency cited Novak as saying. He was also reported to have said that Russia’s 2019 oil output is expected at the same level as this year but could be adjusted, depending on a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC members. Surging oil production in the United States, Russia and by members of the Middle East-dominated OPEC has helped fill global inventories and create a glut in some markets. U.S. crude oil production rose about 129,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September to a fresh record of about 11.5 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report. A slowdown in oil demand growth is compounding the emerging oversupply. (Graphic: Russian, U.S. & Saudi crude oil production - tmsnrt.rs/2CTwqaq) “At the heart of the malaise are concerns that OPEC+ will not do enough to address the current oversupply,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil. The weakness in sentiment is visible in the Brent forward price curve, which now has prices for future delivery above those for immediate dispatch, a structure known as “contango”, which can make it attractive to put oil into storage. Brent crude speculators cut their net long positions to the lowest level since 2015 in the week through Tuesday. Brent net longs fell 14,057 contracts to 168,512 according to data from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). (Graphic: Brent crude oil curve falls into contango - tmsnrt.rs/2Q7oKbO) A monthly Reuters survey indicates that output in November from the 12 OPEC members with supply reduction targets under a previous production agreement fell 110,000 bpd from October, while total OPEC output decreased by 160,000 bpd. A CME group indicator suggested that expectations of a production cut were weakening. The tool, known as OpecWatch, uses West Texas Intermediate crude oil options markets to calculate the probabilities of certain outcomes of OPEC meetings. The market sentiment has shifted from a 70 percent expectation of a small production cut earlier this week to about a 56 percent chance on Friday, CME Group said.  Oil inventories are rising fast in the United States, where crude stocks C-STK-T-EIA have risen for 10 straight weeks to 450.5 million barrels, the most in a year, as production remains at an all-time high of 11.7 million bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). U.S. energy firms this week added oil rigs for a third week in four and increased the rig count for the fifth month in a row, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report.

2018-11-30,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday gave five companies initial permission to conduct surveys of oil and gas deposits beneath a vast region off the U.S. East Coast using sound-wave blasts that conservationists say put whales and dolphins at risk. The fisheries office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued permits to WesternGeco LLC, a subsidiary of Schlumberger Ltd, and CGG to harass but not kill marine mammals with air gun blasts in a region of the Atlantic from Delaware to Cape Canaveral, Florida. The permits, that also went to ION GeoVentures, Spectrum Geo Inc and TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company, are likely to increase tensions between the administration, which wants to open up offshore drilling, with governors from the East Coast who oppose it. President Donald Trump has espoused an “energy dominance” agenda to boost oil output for U.S. consumption and for exports.  Conservationists worry that marine mammals including the endangered North Atlantic right whale could be harmed and that the practice could lead to beachings of the species. “Trump is essentially giving these companies permission to harass, harm and possibly even kill marine life ... all in the pursuit of dirty and dangerous offshore oil,” said Diane Hoskins, a campaign director at the Oceana environmental group.  “This is the first step toward offshore drilling in the Atlantic.” NOAA said impacts on marine mammal populations would be limited. “We’ve been assured that the effects of the authorizations do not result in jeopardy to endangered or threatened species,” Donna Wieting, director of the NOAA fisheries office of protected resources, told reporters in a teleconference. Benjamin Laws, a NOAA fisheries biologist, said the permits require protections for right whales in places they are expected to be present. The companies cannot conduct surveys within about 56 miles (90 km) from shore between Nov. 1 and April 30 in such areas, Laws said. If any right whales are spotted within just under a mile of a survey ship, the tests must be shut down, he added. The administration of former President Barack Obama denied six permits two weeks before Trump became president, saying that the value of information from the air gun surveys would not outweigh potential risks to marine life.    If, as expected, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issues the companies further permitting, they will be able to conduct air gun surveys in the Atlantic for the first time since the 1980s.

2018-11-30,"LONDON, Nov 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Skipping school, marching on the streets and suing governments, children who are too young to vote are demanding more action on climate change, as world leaders gather at a major U.N. summit in Poland this week. “We will be the main victims of climate change. It will be our generation who suffer the consequences,” said Sydney student Aisheeya Huq, 16, who skipped school on Friday to protest, along with tens of thousands of children across Australia. The nationwide strikes were inspired by 15-year-old Stockholm student Greta Thunberg, who misses school every Friday to demonstrate outside Sweden’s parliament. She plans to do so until the country reaches its ambitious goals to curb carbon emissions. “It’s amazing that kids are protesting and they are making their voices heard. This is our last chance, we can’t mess this up,” Thunberg told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Youth-led climate organisations and actions are springing up around the globe. Their desire for change stems from personal experience of and worry about climate change, as well as a desire to hold their governments to account, their members say. Half the world’s population is now under 30 years old, and are increasingly vocal on political and social issues, with climate change the biggest concern for youths from 180 countries, according to a 2017 World Economic Forum survey. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement pledged countries to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels and limit the rise in global temperatures to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species. The United States has since said it will withdraw from the deal. Global leaders will meet in Poland from Dec. 2 to Dec. 14 to produce a “rule book” on how to reach these targets and implement the 2015 Paris deal agreed by nearly 200 nations. Australia, one of the largest carbon emitters per capita, has vowed to lower emissions by 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, a figure that new prime minister Scott Morrison said his administration would not revise. Rebuking the school walkouts, Morrison said in parliament on Monday that there should be “more learning in schools and less activism” on climate change. Global temperatures are on course for a rise of 3 degrees to 5 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, far overshooting a global target of limiting the increase to 2C or less, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said Thursday. Scientists say meeting a 1.5C target would keep the global sea level rise 0.1 metre (3.9 inches) lower by 2100 than a 2C target, which could give people living on the world’s coasts and islands time to adapt to climate change. The climate projections have prompted some young people to sue their governments. “Not taking action on something that you recognise is dangerous is a violation of our rights, because we have the right to live,” said 17-year-old student Bernadette Veilleux-Trinh, part of a group that is suing the Canadian government. Official data regularly shows that Canada has little chance of meeting its climate change goals of reducing emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. ENvironnement JEUnesse, the organisation that launched the class action on behalf of under-35s in Quebec province on Monday, said the Canadian government must do more. “I really feel like this is an emergency for all of us. Words are really not enough when it comes to climate change,” said Catherine Gauthier, head of the Montreal-based youth climate advocacy group. Across the border in the United States, the second largest contributor of carbon emissions after China, 21 children and young adults are also taking the government to court. The group, aged between 8 and 19 when the lawsuit was filed in 2015, accused federal officials and oil industry executives of violating their due process rights by knowing for decades that carbon pollution poisons the environment but doing nothing about it. “These are people who are put in office to work for the general public, but they keep taking actions that are directly linked to worsening climate change,” said Oregonian Avery McRae, 13, who is one of the plaintiffs. U.S. President Donald Trump, who vowed to withdraw from the Paris deal, has argued the accord would hurt his nation’s economy and provide little tangible environmental benefit. Trump and some cabinet members have repeatedly cast doubt on climate change science, despite a recent government report projecting that climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century. “I am worried about my future. The future is what I’m fighting for. This is a global movement, and we need everyone on board,” McRae said.

Markets could have a wild December if Trump and Xi fail to de-escalate their trade rhetoric during talks at this weekend’s G20 meeting in Argentina. “People don’t want to get too optimistic heading into a meeting, because the (U.S.) president is kind of a wild card,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “You don’t know how tough he’ll be with this meeting and these negotiations.” Data on Friday added to the anticipation, showing that growth in China’s vast manufacturing sector stalled this month for the first time in more than two years. Trump has sent mixed signals, saying, “I think we’re very close to doing something with China, but I don’t know that I want to do it,” because the money coming in from the tariffs he has imposed has been so lucrative. The dollar rose as investors prepared for fallout from the talks, which are expected to increase volatility across markets.

2018-11-30,"* Libyan oil output at highest level for five years * Risks loom as oil workers complain about high inflation * Militias and protesters have blocked ports and fields * Production remains below 2011 levels (Adds NOC comment, details, edits) By Ayman al-Warfalli, Ulf Laessing and Ahmad Ghaddar BENGHAZI/TRIPOLI/LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Libya’s oil output is at a five-year high and rare exploration deals with foreign majors are being won but worker dissent and ever-present armed groups risk a repeat of disruptions that have choked off other production surges since the 2011 civil war. Staff at state oil firm NOC told Reuters that small protests had erupted at nine oil and gas fields and some ports in recent months, mainly among workers left waiting for promised pay rises as inflation and a weak currency erode living standards. “We are the anonymous soldiers whose rights have been stolen,” said a worker at the al-Intisar oil field, asking not to be named as NOC has banned workers from talking to the media. “We should be the best paid workers in Libya but we suffer from poor accommodation and medical treatment in the fields and delays in salary payments.” Other staff made similar comments. The most stable period of production in the North African country since 2013 has pushed output as high as 1.3 million barrels per day. NOC has restarted wells shut for years as security has improved in some areas, while oil majors like BP have said they will revive long-delayed exploration plans. But approaching or exceeding output of 1 million bpd has tended to be a psychological trigger for demands from workers and militia groups that also want a share of oil earnings. In autumn 2014, blockades of oilfields and ports rapidly cut production after it had climbed to more than 800,000 bpd. In May, disruptions slashed output to around 150,000 bpd, its lowest since the war. Before 2011 Libya was producing around 1.6 million bpd. Seven years after Muammar Gaddafi was toppled, the OPEC member also remains mired in conflict between rival governments and armed groups. NOC said in a statement it had called on the government to approve a pay rise and “would continue to mediate on behalf of the sector for the improved financial rewards and conditions that employees deserve”. But years of underfunding and destruction by militias had forced it to focus on damaged infrastructure. “NOC is constantly having to redeploy budget to restore critical infrastructure; funds that could otherwise be spent on facilities and improving working conditions,” it said. “The threat to Libyan oil and gas production is not from staff but from blockaders, fuel smugglers and others seeking to extort from the state.” Libya was once one of Africa’s richest countries but living standards for ordinary citizens have declined as the local currency has lost value. The dinar has dived on the parallel market against the dollar since 2014. Since even basic foodstuffs like milk have to be imported, inflation has soared, hurting oil workers whose salaries have not risen since 2013. Authorities then agreed a 67 percent pay increase but volatile oil revenues meant it was never implemented. Priced for its proximity to key European markets and crude quality, Libyan oil has recently been in demand as a substitute for Iranian crude hit by U.S. sanctions. Part of the technical work needed to keep oil and gas fields going is done by NOC’s foreign partners and specialist services firms, an oil executive said. But NOC staff need to be kept happy as they make up the bulk of the industry’s workforce, operate oil export ports, and are often alone at remote fields where poor security makes oil majors wary of sending their own staff. Oil workers’ protests have been small and shortlived. But in Libya with its dysfunctional state, pipelines have sometimes been blocked by 20 or fewer people, industry sources said. Many Libyans see NOC, which generates billions of dollars annually, as a cash cow that is potentially more responsive to their grievances than the largely absent state. Armed groups have also enjoyed an oil bonanza. By forcing the weak state to hire their men, they gain access to cheap central bank dollars to sell on the black market at a premium. One such group, the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG), is in charge of securing facilities. In September some PFG members halted air transport to the Wafa oil field in what NOC said was an attempt to extract a “corrupt” contract. NOC workers make between 800 dinars ($205) and 3,000 dinars a month — more than the average public servant. But frustration has been building up over a lack of investment in living quarters or medical units. In September, oil workers at NOC’s eastern Zueitina port demanded health insurance in a letter to management. NOC said it had approved medical coverage for all staff last year and instructed subsidiaries to proceed with the policy, after the audit bureau suspended health insurance in 2015. Other staff are tired of having to work in dangerous places such as the El Sharara oilfield, deep in the south, where gunmen have kidnapped or robbed workers. “The security situation on the El Sharara field is very dangerous,” said one frightened engineer. Tribesmen have threatened to close the field unless they get a share of oil revenues, a recurring theme while Libya is divided between rival governments relying on armed groups and tribes. “Libya needs a comprehensive political settlement before situations like the one we have at Sharara can be resolved,” a Libyan oil source said. NOC hopes to increase production further if security improves but analysts remain sceptical. “With production at a five-year high, the production risks are more on the downside ... considering the ongoing political instability in the country and the challenging security situation,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at UBS in Zurich.

2018-11-30,"(Updates with demand figures) NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil output hit a new all-time high of 11.5 million barrels per day in September, according to the government on Friday, the latest indicator of a wave of onshore U.S. production that has weighed on global markets. U.S. crude production rose 129,000 bpd in September to 11.475 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report.  At the same time, demand for gasoline fell and demand for diesel and other distillate heating fuels rose from a year earlier. Oil production, which was up nearly 21 percent year-on-year, broke its 1970 record of 10.04 million bpd in November 2017, and has set monthly record highs for four straight months since June. The increase from August reflected rising onshore output that outstripped production cuts in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. Production rose 106,000 bpd in Texas, 64,000 bpd in North Dakota and 24,000 bpd in New Mexico. Production in the offshore Gulf fell by 147,000 bpd in the month, as storms including Hurricane Gordon prompted producers to shut in production . Meanwhile, gross natural gas production in the lower 48 U.S. states rose to an all-time high of 95.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in September, up from the prior record of 94.8 bcfd in August, according to EIA’s 914 production report. In Texas, the nation’s largest gas producer, production increased to a record high 25.1 bcfd in September, up 0.7 percent from August. That compares with output of 22.1 bcfd in September 2017. In Pennsylvania, the second biggest gas producing state, production rose to a record high 17.7 bcfd in September, up 2.7 percent from August. That compares with output of 14.8 bcfd in September 2017. Gasoline demand fell from a year earlier, dropping 260,000 bpd to 9.1 million bpd. Demand for distillate fuel, which includes both diesel and heating oil, increased 86,000 bpd to 4 million bpd.

2018-11-30,"(Adds Permian rig count data) By Scott DiSavino Nov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week added oil rigs for a third week in four and increased the rig count for the fifth consecutive month, even though oil prices this week fell to their lowest since October 2017. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Nov. 30, bringing the total count to 887, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the rig count was up 12 in November, matching last month and its fifth monthly increase in a row. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 749 rigs were active. Energy companies have spent more this year to ramp up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian Basin, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there held steady for a third straight week at 493, the most since January 2015. U.S. crude futures were trading around $51 a barrel on Friday after falling below $50 earlier this week to their lowest since October 2017 on swelling inventories. Looking ahead, crude futures for calendar 2019 and 2020 were trading around $52 a barrel. U.S. crude oil output hit a new all-time high of 11.5 million barrels per day in September, the fourth consecutive month of record highs, according to the government on Friday, as production in Texas and North Dakota climbed to fresh peaks. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 23 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $89.1 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Cowen said early 2019 capital spending budgets were mixed. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,028. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-11-30,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection agency on Friday lifted its annual blending mandate for advanced biofuels, drawing praise from the U.S. biofuels industry, but disappointment that the government had not done more to protect the agricultural market. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do.  The EPA on Friday lifted its requirement for advanced biofuels by 15 percent for 2019, while keeping the volume for conventional biofuels like corn-based ethanol steady. The figures were the same as reported by Reuters on Thursday ahead of the official release, in an article citing an internal agency document. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley from farm state Iowa welcomed the increase in the advanced biofuels requirement, but slammed the EPA for its refusal to reallocate biofuel volumes that had been previously waived under the small refinery exemptions program, one of the most controversial issues dividing the U.S. corn lobby and the oil industry. “I’m disappointed the rule didn’t reallocate waived volumes to make up for the damage done by former Administrator Pruitt,” Grassley said in a statement. Small refineries can be exempted from the RFS if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain. Since President Donald Trump’s election and under the former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who stepped down in July, the EPA has vastly expanded the number of waivers it has handed out to small refineries, in a bid to reduce the refining industry’s regulatory compliance costs.  The move has infuriated the U.S. farmbelt, which argues the program erodes demand for biofuels. “The latest EPA rule is ... a missed opportunity to correctly account for billions of gallons of ethanol lost to refinery exemptions,” Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said in a statement. “Until these are addressed properly, we’re still taking two steps back for every step forward.” But recently, signs have emerged of a potential shift.  The Trump administration has temporarily put on hold the processing of current waiver applications as the EPA and the Department of Energy review the scoring system used to evaluate them, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. Senator Grassley said he was glad the EPA could revisit the practice, citing a meeting with Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Thursday over the issue.  “The handling of these applications is ripe for review. There’s no good reason oil companies making billions of dollars in profits should be exempted from following the law as passed and intended by Congress,” he said. The 2019 mandate here includes 4.92 billion gallons for advanced biofuels, up from the EPA's initial proposal in June of 4.88 billion and above the 4.29 billion that had been set for 2018, the EPA said. The requirement for conventional biofuels remains at 15 billion gallons for 2019, on par with 2018, and the same as proposed by the agency in June, it said.

2018-11-30,"(Adds oil price and revenue forecasts) By Rod Nickel Nov 30 (Reuters) - The Alberta government on Friday trimmed its 2018-2019 budget deficit estimate, but downgraded the 2019 economic growth forecast in the Canadian province due to faltering crude oil prices. The deficit looks to reach C$7.5 billion ($5.7 billion), compared with C$7.8 billion projected in August, the government said in a statement. The left-leaning New Democrat government led by Premier Rachel Notley had budgeted in April for an C$8.8 billion deficit. She faces a provincial election in spring. Low Canadian oil prices compared to the U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark (WTI) reflect full pipelines that have stranded crude supplies in Alberta, away from the U.S. refineries that buy the oil. “This is a crisis,” Finance Minister Joe Ceci said in a statement, referring to the price discount known as the differential. “If the differential is not addressed, our entire country could be plunged into a downturn.” The province downgraded its forecast for 2019 economic growth to 2 percent from a budgeted 2.5 percent, due to oil production curtailments amounting to 150,000 barrels per day and expected weaker corporate profits. It continues to forecast a return to fiscal balance in 2023-24. Discounts on Canadian crude hit record highs in October, compared with WTI prices. WTI has tumbled sharply since October. Even so, Alberta expects non-renewable resource revenue, mainly from oil and gas, to rise in 2018-19 to C$5.3 billion, exceeding the C$3.8 billion that it had budgeted. The higher revenue estimate reflects more favorable oil prices between spring, when the budget was set, and autumn, government officials said. The government assumes an average discount of $29.25 per barrel for Canadian heavy crude in 2018-19, against an expected WTI price averaging $64 a barrel. Alberta is the No. 1 crude exporter to the United States. Low oil prices are so damaging to Alberta’s economy that the provincial government plans to buy trains to transport an additional 120,000 barrels per day of crude, hoping to improve prices by smoothing transport to buyers. It is also considering calls from some oil producers, including Cenovus Energy and Canadian Natural Resources , to impose mandatory oil production cuts on producers. Alberta expects to spend C$56.6 billion in 2018-19 and collect C$49.6 billion in revenue. The budget includes a C$500 million cushion for risk. The 2018-19 fiscal year ends on March 31. $1 = 1.3281 Canadian dollars

2018-11-30,"BUENOS AIRES, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman exchanged a high-five and laughed heartily together on Friday as they took seats next to each other at a plenary session of the Group of 20 summit. Putin’s friendly behaviour towards the crown prince contrasted sharply with that of other leaders at the Buenos Aires summit, amid suspicions of his possible involvement in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder, which has sorely tested the kingdom’s relations with the United States, other Western nations and Turkey. Earlier, Prince Mohammed was sidelined during the official “family photo” of world leaders at Friday’s gathering and was largely ignored. He then quickly exited the stage without shaking hands or talking with the other leaders. Russia has refrained from criticising Saudi Arabia or the crown prince over the killing. Putin said in October he lacked information about the matter and said Russia would not tear up its relations with Saudi Arabia because of it. However, Moscow has also fostered strong ties with Saudi Arabia’s regional arch foe Iran. Russia and Iran back President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war, while Saudi Arabia along with Western countries have backed some rebel groups. Putin and Prince Mohammed are due to hold bilateral talks on Saturday, according to Kremlin documents seen by Reuters. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia and other leading oil producers will meet in Vienna on Dec 6-7 to discuss further steps on the oil market as prices have been declining due to oversupply.

2018-11-30,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian police fired water cannon and teargas in central Brussels on Friday to drive back protesters inspired by France’s “yellow vest” anti-tax movement who hurled rocks at the prime minister’s office. Police made dozens of arrests and protesters destroyed at least two police vans as what started as a peaceful but unauthorised demonstration, lacking clear leadership and largely promoted on social media, descended into violence when people, many masked or hooded, tried to breach police lines. For three hours, crowds complaining about fuel prices and a squeeze on living standards had disrupted traffic and walked the streets. Police said they had arrested about 60 people before the violence, mostly for blocking roads or carrying large fireworks. Several hundred people wearing the fluorescent safety vests drivers must carry in their vehicles eventually converged on the office of Prime Minister Charles Michel. Dozens, many of them masked, threw rocks, firecrackers and road signs at police who doused them with high-pressure water jets and fired gas rounds. The disturbances lasted over an hour before riot police surrounded and then arrested some demonstrators while the rest of the crowd dispersed. Police put the total number of protesters at about 500. Three individuals were kept in detention after the protests, police said in a statement, adding that other judicial decisions could be made in the following hours. Michel tweeted: “No impunity for unacceptable violence in Brussels. Those who came to smash and loot must be punished.” Protests in Belgium, notably around fuel depots in the French-speaking south, have been inspired by the yellow vest — or “gilet jaune” — actions in France against increases in fuel duty imposed by President Emmanuel Macron’s government as part of efforts to reduce emissions causing global warming. “Michel, resign!” people chanted on Friday. Michel, a liberal ally of Macron, voiced sympathy for people’s troubles on Thursday, but added: “Money doesn’t fall from the sky.” His centre-right coalition faces an election in May.

2018-11-30,"MADRID (Reuters) - Madrid banned most petrol and diesel cars from the heart of the city on Friday as it tries to improve the air quality in one of Europe’s most polluted capitals. Police patrolled dozens of access points to the almost 5 sq km (2 sq miles) area - including the Gran Via avenue and Puerta del Sol square teeming with tourists - to block all cars expect those with exemptions, or that were electric or hybrid-powered. Grinding traffic jams and a lot of older or diesel vehicles - plus a frequently windless dry climate - have contributed to the high levels of nitrogen dioxide in Madrid that have been in violation of European regulations since 2010. Madrid authorities hope to catch up with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Berlin or Oslo that are already imposing traffic restrictions to improve the air quality. However, the plan may fall apart before it is fully implemented if the conservative opposition Popular Party, which argues that the administrative procedure of adopting the new rules was flawed, has its way after challenging it in court. Ines Sabanes, in charge of ​​Environment and Mobility at the Madrid City Hall, said the city would press ahead with anti-pollution measures.  “We can’t afford it (inversion of environment policies), neither can the cities, nor the health of the planet,” she said. Traffic was heavy on Friday around the perimeter of the new exclusion zone, with cars honking loudly, but it was little different from any other day as cars without the permits appeared to steer clear of the area.  Critics say the rules have multiple, complex exceptions that could undermine the plan’s efficiency.  For instance, residents of the central area can drive any kind of cars, including older diesel cars, and so can property owners even if they are not residents. All motorcycles are allowed during day-time.  Police will enforce the restrictions for the first few months without applying fines, but in March a computer system is due to fully assume control and fine potential violators. “I am very happy with these measures because I think they are going to clean the air in the centre of the city,” said Adrian Beaton, a student in his 20s, who usually uses public transport to access the area.

The two global oil benchmarks, North Sea Brent and U.S. crude, have had their weakest month for more than 10 years in November, losing more than 20 percent as global supply has outstripped demand. Brent futures fell 98 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $58.53 a barrel by 11:26 a.m. EDT (1626 GMT). U.S. crude dropped $1.16, or 2.2 percent, to $50.29 a barrel. Brent was set to end the week little changed and U.S. crude was on track to be up nearly 1.5 percent. Before the OPEC meeting, the world’s top three producers - the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia - will be part of a meeting this weekend of the Group of 20 industrialised nations in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Early next week, markets are likely to be driven by sentiment on trade talks between the U.S. and China at the G20 meeting, before attention shifts to OPEC, said analysts from Capital Economics in a note to clients. “By the end of the week, markets will be firmly focussed on the biannual OPEC meeting on Thursday and Friday and oil prices could fall sharply if OPEC leaves output unchanged,” the analysts said. “We expect OPEC to announce a small cut in production, in conjunction with Russia.” Surging oil production in the United States, Russia and by members of the Middle East-dominated OPEC has helped fill global inventories and create a glut in some markets. A slowdown in oil demand growth is compounding the emerging oversupply. “At the heart of the malaise are concerns that OPEC+ will not do enough to address the current oversupply,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil. The weakness in sentiment is visible in the Brent forward price curve, which now has prices for future delivery above those for immediate dispatch, a structure known as “contango”, which can make it attractive to put oil into storage. A monthly Reuters survey indicates that output in November from the 12 OPEC members with supply reduction targets under a previous production agreement fell 110,000 barrels per day from October, while total OPEC output decreased by 160,000 bpd. To rein in the glut, OPEC and its main partner Russia are discussing supply cuts and are due to meet in Vienna on Dec. 6 and 7 to agree production strategy. “The next OPEC meeting is going to prove a pivotal moment for the direction of oil prices in 2019,” BNP Paribas strategist Harry Tchilinguirian told Reuters Global Oil Forum. “A decision will have to be made against a background of strong U.S. shale oil supply growth, and for now, weaker expectations on global oil demand growth.” On Friday, a CME group indicator suggested that expectations of a production cut were weakening. The tool, known as OpecWatch, uses West Texas Intermediate crude oil options markets to calculate the probabilities of certain outcomes of OPEC meetings. The market sentiment has shifted from a 32 percent expectation of unchanged production targets on Wednesday to about a 50 percent chance of unchanged targets on Friday, CME Group said. Oil inventories are rising fast in the United States, where crude stocks C-STK-T-EIA have risen for 10 straight weeks to 450.5 million barrels, the most in a year, as production remains at an all-time high of 11.7 million bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Meanwhile, U.S. oil reserves in 2017 exceeded a 47-year-old record when they increased 6.4 billion barrels, or 19.5 percent, to 39.2 billion barrels, the EIA said this week. Weekly data on the U.S. drilling rig count, an indicator of future production, will be released at 1 p.m.. Reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and Henning

In Europe, Frankfurt’s export-heavy DAX stock index and Britain’s domestic-focused FTSE 250 both faced a fourth consecutive month of declines. The German index saw its worst run since late 2008, weighed by Deutsche Bank shares falling to an all-time low as police searched its headquarters for a second day in a money laundering scandal linked to the Panama Papers. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.10 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.17 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 15.34 points, or 0.06 percent, to 25,323.5, the S&P 500 gained 5.69 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,743.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.14 points, or 0.35 percent, to 7,298.22. November’s real humdingers have been oil and shares of Apple which have plunged 21 percent and 18 percent respectively, the biggest declines for both since the financial crisis a decade ago. Swelling inventories depressed sentiment and oil prices, despite widespread expectations that OPEC and Russia would agree on some form of production cut next week. U.S. crude fell 0.6 percent to $51.14 per barrel and Brent was last at $58.68, down 1.39 percent on the day. Markets could have a wild December if Trump and Xi fail to de-escalate their trade rhetoric during talks at this weekend’s G20 meeting in Argentina. “People don’t want to get too optimistic heading into a meeting, because the (U.S.) president is kind of a wild card,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “You don’t know how tough he’ll be with this meeting and these negotiations.” Data on Friday added to the anticipation, showing that growth in China’s vast manufacturing sector had stalled this month for the first time in more than two years. Trump has sent mixed signals saying, “I think we’re very close to doing something with China but I don’t know that I want to do it,” because the money coming in from the tariffs he has imposed has been so lucrative. The dollar rose as investors prepared for fallout from the talks, which are expected to increase volatility across markets. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, rose 0.39 percent, with the euro down 0.61 percent to $1.1321. Additional reporting by Marc Jones and Christopher Johnson in

2018-11-30,"(Recasts with comments on energy reform, adds background) MEXICO CITY, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming leftist president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said an oil reform that allowed for the sale of oil rights to private investors will not continue during his term, according to an interview published on Friday. Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, told the left-leaning daily La Jornada that the landmark energy overhaul passed by outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto had been “a big scam” and that he would focus on boosting state investment. “They stopped investing, assuming that foreign investment was going to arrive and that public investment was not going to be required. Foreign investment did not come, that was a big scam,” Lopez Obrador said. “The energy plan designed in the neoliberal period is not going to be carried out,” he said, and added “there will be no more rounds,” suggesting his administration would end the process of auctioning oil fields to private companies. However, he did not give details. In the past he has said that private auctions were suspended until more than 100 oil contracts issued by the outgoing government had been reviewed for signs of corruption. Lopez Obrador has pledged to boost investment in state-run oil company Pemex and plans to start building a new oil refinery next year in his home state of Tabasco. Mexican financial markets have been rattled since Lopez Obrador said he would scrap a partly built new Mexico City airport and members of his party proposed unexpected bills to cut bank fees and limit mining rights. Earlier this month, ratings agency Fitch revised its outlook on Mexico’s debt to negative, citing the uncertainty caused by the airport cancellation as well the risks from rising debt at Pemex. Lopez Obrador told La Jornada that he aimed to boost crude production to 2.4 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of his term in 2024. Previously he had targeted 2.6 million bpd. He said he expects Mexico’s decline in oil output to hit bottom next year at around 1.5 million bpd.

2018-11-30,"NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Brenham Capital Management LP, an energy equities fund manager with about $800 million in assets under management, will shut after two years of losses, its founder said in a letter to investors on Friday. The Dallas-based fund will be liquidated and investor capital will be returned at the end of the year, according to the letter which was reviewed by Reuters. While oil prices  rallied to near four-year highs in October, those gains have not extended to energy equities, hurting firms such as Brenham. The Russell 2000 Energy index is down more than 20 percent this year after falling 17 percent in 2017. That index, the fund’s closest benchmark, has lost more than 60 percent since the fund’s inception in 2012. Brenham Capital founder John Labanowski said in the letter that the firm’s net long investment strategy was no longer working, even as oil prices surged to four-year highs by October. The fund held positions in small and mid-cap shale companies including Oasis Petroleum and WPX Energy Inc, according to regulatory filings. Labanowski also said he was “tripped up by inconsistent OPEC policy.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided, with other top producers, to cut production in late 2016, but its lead member, Saudi Arabia, reversed course this year, with production hitting record highs. “This ‘make it up as you go’ policy from the world’s oil cartel created a new set of risks and made it difficult to invest in the sector with a longer-term timeframe,” Labanowski said. The fund was down 10.5 percent in 2017 and down 14.7 percent in 2018 through October, said Dawn Blankenship, a director at the firm. “I’ve been bullish energy stocks since 2016 and this constructive posture just hasn’t paid off over the last two years,” Labanowski wrote.

2018-11-30,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany intends to increase energy production from wind and solar farms by a further 8 gigawatts (GW) over the next three years as the government tries to compensate for its decision to abandon strict emissions targets. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) junior coalition partners this year dropped plans to lower carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020. The decision was based on expectations that Germany would miss its national emissions target for 2020 without any additional measures because of strong economic growth and higher than expected immigration. The Bundestag lower house on Friday approved government plans to boost green energy production. For the past few years, Germany has been increasing power capacity from wind and solar by 5 gigawatts each year. The 8 gigawatt increase between 2019-2021 is additional to that. The government has set a new goal of increasing the share of renewable energy in Germany’s electricity consumption to 65 percent by 2030 from roughly a third last year. The new plan includes also cutting the subsidy for solar energy production from 11.09 euro cents ($0.1256) per kWh to 8.9 euro cents.

2018-11-30,"(Adds detail, analyst comment) SOFIA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Bulgaria will go ahead with plans to spend 1.4 billion euros ($1.59 billion) to build a new gas link to transport Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to Europe, bypassing Ukraine to the south. Bulgarian lawmakers on Friday gave the green light to state gas company Bulgartransgaz to launch tenders to build a new 484-km gas pipeline from its border with Turkey to Serbia by 2020 that will carry mainly Russian natural gas. TurkStream is part of the Kremlin’s plans to bypass Ukraine, currently the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe, and strengthen its position in the European market. Its two lines will each have an annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic metres. Russian energy giant Gazprom has completed the first line of pipeline to Turkey for local gas consumption. Gazprom said on Friday it was considering booking capacity in the Bulgarian gas system. That would effectively ensure that the gas Russia plans to send to Europe through the second line of its Black Sea pipeline will pass through the country, the Bulgarian energy minister said. Bulgartransgaz has already tested market interest to expand its gas infrastructure and expects final bids by shippers by the end of December. The approval of the project comes at a time of increased tension between Russia and Ukraine, raising concerns in Sofia that the conflict may once again put the brakes on Russia’s plans to ship gas through Bulgaria. “What follows from now on is strict observation of European Union rules and procedures, so that we can eliminate all eventual mistakes that in the past have led to the cancellation of South Stream,” Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said. Bulgaria is still smarting from the 2014 cancellation of Russia’s plan to bring gas to its shores with its South Stream pipeline. The project, which had promised the Balkan country on the European Union’s periphery money and clout, was dropped by Russia after it blamed opposition from Brussels. At present, Gazprom transports about 14 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year to Turkey via Bulgaria through a contract that runs through 2030. Bulgaria is ready to give up on its take-or-pay option in the current contract if it gets a new 20-year deal to transport Russian gas through the new pipeline, saying its net profit for the period could be as much as 2.2 billion euros. Brussels is concerned that Bulgaria may opt to simply send Russian gas onto Europe to earn transit fees rather than allowing it to be traded at its planned Balkan Gas Hub, cementing its almost complete dependence on Gazprom. Some energy experts have also voiced concerns that Bulgaria is moving too quickly with projects linked to Russian gas and dragging its feet over plans to develop links that would allow diversification. “The aim seems to be to fuel money to build new gas infrastructure, rather than focus on liberalising the gas market and on diversifying gas supplies,” said Martin Vladimirov with independent think-tank Center for the Study of Democracy. In a bid to ease such concerns, Sofia says the new pipeline will be built in line with EU energy rules. Bulgaria’s parliament voted that Bulgartransgaz should set up a gas trading bourse and take a 20 percent stake in a liquefied natural gas terminal off the coast in northern Greece. $1 = 0.8792 euros

2018-11-30,"(Adds quotes, details) WARSAW/OSLO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The Polish and Danish gas grid operators have taken a final investment decision to build a gas pipeline linking Poland to Norwegian fields via Danish territory and the Baltic Sea, Poland’s state-owned Gaz-System said on Friday. The 900-km (560-mile) pipeline, known as the Baltic Pipe, aims to reduce Poland’s reliance on Russian gas. The Baltic Pipe is expected to be ready in 2022 when Poland’s long-term deal with Russian gas company Gazprom expires. “Construction of the section under the Baltic Sea will start in Spring 2020,” Piotr Naimski, the Polish government official responsible for power and gas infrastructure, told a news conference to announce the decision by the state company. He said environment and other permits from the authorities were still required before construction could start. The pipeline’s capacity will be 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, with almost all of it booked by Polish state-run gas firm PGNiG. The company plans to produce 2.5 bcm a year of gas from holdings in Norwegian deposits. Polish Energy Minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski told the news conference that Baltic Pipe was part of the North-South Gas Corridor a project to link Poland to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Croatia, via the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The Baltic Pipe, costing about 1.6 billion to 2.1 billion euros ($1.8 billion to $2.4 billion), will run from the north of Poland through Swedish waters in the Baltic Sea and Danish territory where it would be linked to a North Sea pipeline. Sten Arve Eide from Gassco, Norway’s gas system operator, said the new link to Denmark would offer “one more exit point available for gas deliveries.” “Gassco will deliver the gas in accordance with the gas owners nominations. This will not affect the total gas exports from Norway,” he said. Norway meets about a quarter of Europe’s natural gas needs and is the second largest supplier after Russia. Most of its deliveries are via a network of offshore pipelines to Britain, Germany, France and Belgium. In 2015, Poland opened its first LNG terminal on the Baltic Sea as part of its efforts to diversify its sources of supply. Poland aims to expand the facility. $1 = 0.8832 euros

2018-11-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil supply has fallen in November from a two-year high due to U.S. sanctions on Iran, a Reuters survey found, although most of the output gap left by Iran was plugged by Saudi Arabia and the UAE in response to calls from U.S. President Donald Trump. The 15-member Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 33.11 million barrels per day this month, the survey on Friday found, down 160,000 bpd from October, which was the highest by OPEC as a group since December 2016. The survey adds to indications that OPEC output remains ample despite U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran this month. Oil prices have slid 30 percent since early October on worries a new glut may emerge. OPEC and its allies including Russia meet on Dec. 6-7 in Vienna to discuss cutting supply. With Saudi Arabia and Russia pumping at record rates, U.S.  output surging and forecasts pointing to lower demand in 2019 due to a slowing economy, some analysts are sceptical the producers will avoid generating a surplus. “The most likely outcome of next week’s OPEC meeting is a fudge,” said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM. “Russia and Saudi Arabia will agree to curb production but by less than is needed to prevent a supply imbalance in early 2019.” OPEC, Russia and other non-members agreed in June to return to 100 percent compliance with output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction in Venezuela and Angola that had pushed adherence above 160 percent. In November, the 12 OPEC members bound by the supply-limiting agreement boosted compliance to 120 percent as production fell in Iran, from a revised 110 percent in October, the survey found. The biggest drop in OPEC supply this month has come from Iran, according to the survey. Exports fell at times below 1 million bpd as returning U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying Iranian oil, although volumes rose later in the month, sources in the survey said. Sanctions waivers granted to eight buyers could lead to higher exports in December, analysts have said. The second-biggest decline was in Iraq, where exports from southern Iraqi terminals were curbed by bad weather, despite the resumption of some Kirkuk exports in the north after a one year halt. There were small falls in production in Libya and Nigeria, both exempt from the supply pact. OPEC is discussing including one or both of the African producers in a 2019 supply deal.  The biggest rise was in Saudi Arabia, where supply hit a record 11 million bpd. Trump has been urging Saudi Arabia and other producers to pump more oil to curb rising prices and make up for losses from Iran. UAE output rose following a jump in October, reaching 3.35 million bpd. The UAE says its oil-production capacity will reach 3.5 million bpd by the year-end. Supply to market unexpectedly rose in Venezuela as two tanker-trackers reported a rise in exports, which have been declining for months due to the country’s economic crisis.   Before Congo joined OPEC this year, the group had an implied production target for 2018 of 32.78 million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output.  OPEC excluding Congo pumped almost exactly that amount in November, according to the survey. The Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-11-30,"PARIS (Reuters) - Workmen erected metal barriers and plywood boards on the glass-fronted facades of restaurants and boutiques lining the Champs Elysees on Friday ahead of a second demonstration in the French capital by protesters angry at high fuel prices. For more than two weeks, the “yellow vests” have blocked roads across France in a spontaneous, popular rebellion against diesel tax hikes and the high cost of living. It has grown into one of the largest and most stubborn challenges Emmanuel Macron has faced in his 18-month-old presidency. A week ago thousands of protesters, who have no leader and  have largely organised themselves online, converged on Paris for the first time, turning the Champs Elysees into a battlezone as they clashed with police firing tear gas and water canon.  For now, the “yellow vests” — who take their name from the high-visibility jackets all motorists in France must carry in their vehicles — enjoy widespread public support. “I completely agree with the protesters,” said one shopper on the Champs Elysees who identified herself only as Brigitte. “It’s regrettable to see measures being taken against possible damage, but I support the movement.” When they began, the protests caught Macron off-guard just as he was trying to counter a plunge in popularity, with his approval at barely 20 percent. His unyielding response has exposed him to charges of being out of touch with common folk. The outburst of anti-establishment anger is strongest in rural villages, provincial towns and sprawling city outskirts, and mirrors the disconnect between urban elites and alienated voters that has spurred the rise of populist forces across Europe, in the United States and in Britain’s Brexit vote. Meeting French expatriates in Buenos Aires ahead of a G20 summit, Macron said he understood the “legitimate anger, impatience and suffering of people who wanted to live better” but said there would be no about-turn in policy direction. “It will fall on me to take additional steps in the weeks and months to come, but they will never be a step backwards,”  said the 40-year-old former investment banker. The “yellow vests” have also inspired protests next door in Belgium, where on Friday demonstrators hurled rocks at the prime minister’s office. France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the Champs Elysees would be closed to traffic, and pedestrians would be funnelled through checkpoints. Several thousand police officers will be deployed along the two-kilometre avenue.

2018-11-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Strong gusts on Wednesday evening helped Britain’s wind farms to produce a record amount of electricity, trade group Renewable UK said on Friday. Britain aims to increase its renewable output and close its coal-fired power plants by 2025 as part of efforts to meet climate targets.  “Britain’s onshore and offshore wind farms hit a new high of 14.9 gigawatts (GW) between 6 and 6.30pm on Wednesday evening,” the industry group said in a statement. Overall on Wednesday wind generated 32.2 percent of the country’s electricity more than any other electricity source. The figure beat the previous record of 14.5 GW set on Nov. 9. The country’s renewable electricity capacity overtook that of fossil fuel generators such as gas and coal for the first time this year. The world’s largest offshore wind farm, Orsted’s Walney Extension, opened off the northwest coast of England in September.

2018-11-30,"* Yamal Arctic LNG cargoes are transferred to normal ships * Transfers taking place in Norwegian waters since last week * Move allows for more frequent LNG cargoes from Yamal (Adds Russian reaction) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Allowing ship-to-ship transfers in Norwegian waters from Yamal in Arctic Russia, one of the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, undercuts Europe’s energy diversification efforts, the U.S. State Department said on Friday. By transferring LNG to more conventional tankers in Norway, the Arctic vessels cut in half the distance they would cover to deliver gas to Europe, enabling more frequent shipments from the Novatek terminal and increasing Russia’s gas exports. Last week, the first such transfer took place off the Norwegian Arctic port of Honningsvag. Asked what was the U.S. position on the activity in Norwegian waters, the U.S. State Department told Reuters: “At a time when Russian gas comprises a growing proportion of Europe’s energy imports, additional volumes of Russian gas will undercut Europe’s energy diversification efforts. “We are working closely with our European partners to increase their energy security by promoting diversification of energy fuel types, energy routes, and energy source countries.” Russia condemned the U.S. position. “Such statements are a definitive example of resorting to political instruments for the sake of unfair competition, (and) direct infringement of trade freedom principles,” the Russian embassy in Oslo said in a statement. The United States has been pressing Europe to cut its reliance on cheap Russian gas and buy much more expensive U.S. LNG instead, which many European countries, including industrial heavyweight Germany, have so far resisted. It has called on European countries to reject Russian gas pipelines, which Washington says are being used to cement Moscow’s grip on Central and Eastern Europe.. In particular, the United States has said it could impose new sanctions on Russia to try to block the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline across the Baltic Sea to the European Union. Norway, Europe’s second-largest supplier of gas after Russia, said it was not “concerned” by the ship-to-ship transfers. “Europe has a well-functioning gas market. The planned ship-to-ship transfers of Russian LNG in northern Norway are a commercial project,” the Norwegian Ministry for Oil and Energy told Reuters. “The fact that LNG is brought to the market via such transfers is not a concern for the ministry.” Thanks to the ship-to-ship transfers off Norway, Yamal is expected to export as much as 11.7 million tonnes of LNG in the next seven months, according to the port hosting its ship-to-ship operations and Reuters calculations. The ramp-up in output puts the Novatek terminal, in operation for less than a year, in excess of its nameplate capacity, with the Norwegian transfers the only way it can deliver the additional LNG to the market. Yamal uses Arctic-class LNG tankers to carry the gas through the Barents Sea; these vessels then transfer the cargo to more conventional tankers in Europe, enabling them to return sooner to the facility and pick up more supplies.

2018-11-30,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s economic growth slowed in the third quarter on declines in motor vehicle purchases and housing investment, underpinning market expectations that the Bank of Canada will not hike interest rates next week. Statistics Canada said on Friday that annualized growth between July and September was 2.0 percent, down from 2.9 percent in the second quarter. The pace of growth matched expectations of analysts in a Reuters poll. In October, the Bank of Canada - which has hiked rates five times since July 2017 - boosted its estimate of third quarter annualized growth to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent.    The central bank says interest rates still need to continue rising, given the strength of the economy. Market analysts though see little chance of improvement in the fourth quarter, given the falling price of oil, one of Canada’s main exports. “I’d be shocked if the bank did anything with the rates next week,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. Market expectations of an interest rate hike on Dec. 5, as reflected in the overnight index swaps market, stayed steady at 11.24 percent. Earlier this month, that figure was above 30 percent. Although the index showed most market operators believe the bank will tighten again on Jan 9, Porter said in an interview he believed “it’s a closer call than the market is priced for. Today’s news reinforces that message.” Adding to the uncertainty was Statscan data showing the economy shrank 0.1 percent in September from August following seven consecutive months of growth. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a 0.1 percent increase. “You do have to start asking questions about if the Bank of Canada is going to be able to throw caution to the wind a bit and lift rates in January,” said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. The Canadian dollar weakened slightly to C$1.3308, or 75.14 U.S. cents, on the data. Statscan said that on a non-annualized basis, household spending in the third quarter grew 0.3 percent, down from 0.6 percent in the second, as sales of motor vehicles dropped by 1.6 percent. Total residential investment dipped by 1.5 percent. Strength in mining and petroleum refineries, boosted by higher prices and foreign demand, helped underpin growth.  Separately, Statscan said producer prices rose by 0.2 percent in October from September, thanks largely to increased demand for meat, fish and dairy products.

2018-11-30,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A flammable gas leak at a plant owned by ChemChina subsidiary Hebei Shenghua Chemical Industry Co caused a blast that killed 23 people and injured 22 this week in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, ChemChina said in a statement on Friday.  PVC producer Hebei Shenghua had leaked vinyl chloride during production, and it caught fire and caused a chain explosion that burned trucks and buildings, parent company ChemChina said. In the statement posted on its website, ChemChina apologised for the accident and said it reflected serious problems in its safety management systems. Zhangjiakou, about 156 km (96 miles) northwest of Beijing, is set to host the 2022 Winter Olympics along with the capital. The National Administration for Work Safety Emergency Response said it will launch an inspection of all large-scale chemical plant plants in the wake of the last explosion, the official Xinhua news Agency reported.  Public anger over safety standards has grown in China in recent years after three decades of swift economic growth have been marred by accidents ranging from mining disasters to factory fires. In August 2015, 165 people were killed in a chemical warehouse explosion in the port city of Tianjin. The government found that the disaster was causes by improperly or illegally stored hazardous materials. China has vowed to improve industrial standards, but environmentalists say they fear oversight weaknesses persist, including an opaque production process for hazardous chemicals.

2018-11-30,"BAKU, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan’s parliament on Friday passed a budget for 2019 based on an oil price estimate of $60 per barrel and gross domestic product (GDP) growth next year of 3.6 percent. A recovery in the price of oil, which together with gas accounts for about 75 percent of state revenue and 45 percent of GDP, has improved the economic prospects for the ex-Soviet country. The government expects the economy to expand 2 percent this year and its budget for 2018 is based on an oil price of $55 per barrel. The budget sees annual inflation slowing to 3-4 percent in 2019 from 6.1 percent anticipated this year. Azerbaijan’s budget deficit is expected to widen to 2.022 billion manats ($1.2 billion) in 2019, or 2.5 percent of GDP, up from 951 million manats or 1.3 percent of GDP projected for this year. Revenues are seen at 23.2 billion manats in 2019, up from 22.2 billion projected for this year. Spending is expected at 25.2 billion manats, up from 23.1 billion in 2018.

Europe’s main share indexes in London, Frankfurt and Paris all sank, and Wall Street futures were pointing down too after the latest batch of disappointing Chinese data had made for another twitchy Asian session. Frankfurt’s export-heavy DAX and Britain’s domestic-focused FTSE 250 were both staring at their fourth consecutive month of falls. For the DAX it is the worst run since the back end of 2008 and was made worse again as Deutsche Bank shares fell to an all-time low as police searched its headquarters for a second day in a money laundering scandal linked to the Panama Papers. November’s real humdingers though have been oil and Apple which have plunged 21 percent and 18 percent respectively, the worst month for either since the financial crisis a decade ago. “Expectations at the start of the fourth quarter were for a melt-up in risky assets, but two of the biggest trends have been a reversal of some of the few returns we have seen this year, which have been in oil and in tech,” said head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets’ Michael Metcalfe. “Also the market seems to be going into the G20 meeting with very low expectations of a ceasefire in the trade war. That may very well be correct but politics has proved very hard to predict this year.” Anticipation ahead of that meeting ensured cautious moves in the currency and bond markets. The dollar index was a touch firmer at 96.86 .DXY — having slipped this back this week after Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell left investors wondering whether the U.S. central bank may be nearing the end of its current rate-hike cycle. In early afternoon London trade, the euro fetched $1.1360 , down 0.25 percent as euro zone inflation data came in softer than forecast. The dollar was flat at 113.52 yen while sterling shuffled around at just under $1.28 having been lifted slightly this month by UK Prime Minister Theresa May securing a Brexit transition deal with the EU. “We believe that Powell has not turned dovish but is simply toning down his hawkish tilt,” said Philip Wee, a currency strategist at DBS, forecasting another hike in December and as many as four next year. U.S. money markets though, where the real money sits, are now pricing in only one rise next year, and the yield on two-year U.S. Treasury notes, sensitive to Fed shifts, is at 2.81 percent from almost 3 percent earlier in the month. Markets could well be in for a volatile December if Trump and Xi fail to de-escalate their trade war at talks at this weekend’s G20 meeting in Argentina. Data on Friday added to the anticipation, showing that growth in China’s vast manufacturing sector had stalled this month for the first time in more than two years. “This is not a good year for multilateralism,” a German government source told Reuters about the prospects for a G20 statement at the end of the meeting on Saturday. The negotiations are “very, very difficult.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.2 percent with Korean shares one of the main drivers after the country’s central bank lifted its interest rates in a widely expected decision. In Japan, the Nikkei ended 0.4 percent higher, while Chinese blue-chips, which have had a relatively steady month all considered, also advanced 1 percent. U.S. S&P e-mini futures ticked down 0.3 percent, pointing to a weaker Wall Street session on Friday after a mixed overnight performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25 percent on Thursday. Boeing Inc, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, dropped 0.9 percent in premarket trading. Other trade-sensitive stocks including General Electric Co declined 2.6 percent and Caterpillar Inc 0.2 percent. Adding to apprehension ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, a U.S. official said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who has advocated a tougher trade stance with China, would attend. Trump himself had sent mixed signals saying: “I think we’re very close to doing something with China but I don’t know that I want to do it,” as the money coming in from his tariffs was so lucrative. Back in the oil markets, crude was starting to slip again having tried to steady on news that Russia is increasingly convinced it needs to reduce oil output along with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC and its allies are meeting in Vienna on Dec. 6-7. Brent and U.S. WTI crude were both down around 0.6 percent at $59.51 per barrel and $51.38 a barrel.

2018-11-30,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA, the world’s biggest furniture group, pledged on Friday to cut greenhouse gas emissions from its production by 80 percent in absolute terms by 2030 from their levels two years ago. The commitment applies to IKEA’s own factories and most of its direct suppliers, brand owner Inter IKEA said in a statement. It comes days before world leaders gather in Katowice, Poland for the most important U.N. climate meeting since the 2015 Paris summit, where 195 countries pledged to work to limit a rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius. “I hope for a leadership that steps up, sets clear targets and dares to nail a number of commitments without us having all the solutions,” Inter IKEA CEO Torbjorn Loof told Reuters.  “That goes for governments, businesses and other players,” he said, adding it was vital that emission targets are set in absolute terms.  The U.N. on Thursday warned global temperatures are on course for a 3-5C rise this century. In 2016, IKEA’s direct suppliers and own factories emitted 3.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. IKEA produces around 10 percent of its range itself and sources the rest from suppliers. Efficiency across production and shifts to renewable energy, such as biomass-based for the energy-intensive particle-board production, will help reach the new target, CEO Loof and sustainability chief Lena Pripp-Kovac said in an interview. Other key elements are a shift towards more lightweight materials, and tests of a new glue, a switch to which could cut as much as 6 percent off its emissions level.      More than 400 firms including H&M, Coca-Cola and Sony have committed to a U.N.-backed initiative to help limit global warming to below 2C.

2018-11-30,"(Repeats story published on Thursday with no change to text) By Rod Nickel and John Tilak WINNIPEG/TORONTO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Depressed Canadian oil prices are forcing energy companies to use their shares as a currency to fund acquisitions, but investors have been hard to win over to the strategy. Unusually large price discounts for Canadian crude, due to clogged pipelines, and faltering global prices have made growth hard to realize. Some producers have reduced output and lower cash flow has left consolidation using stock as the main option. Shares of Encana Corp, Baytex Energy Corp and International Petroleum Corp, for examples, each plummeted by double-digits on the days they announced deals to buy rivals with shares. The TSX energy index performed better on those days, although it has been in steep decline since early October. “We’ve been getting shocked with bad news all year, and investors don’t necessarily believe that consolidation is a big enough catalyst to offset all the macro headwinds,” said Kevin Brent, vice-president of investment for BlueSky Equities, which owns shares in Seven Generations Energy and Crescent Point Energy Corp. Canadian oil producers face a dwindling amount of capital willing to invest in the sector, leaving many with a stark choice, said Eric Nuttal, senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners, which owns shares in MEG Energy, Baytex and Athabasca Oil. “Do you increase in scale and get your market cap above $1 billion to get on the radar screen? Or do you just throw in the towel?” Many are scaling up. The result, Nuttall said, will likely be more deals into early 2019, and a shrinking number of small-cap Canadian oil producers in the long term. The Canadian oil patch has made 29 deals so far in the second half, worth $9.5 billion, the busiest half-year period for deals since the first half of 2017, according to Cormark Securities data. Further deals may have to rely on shares and private equity, said Andy Mah, CEO of Advantage Oil & Gas. “When you get into a period of such volatility, I think any kind of M&A is very difficult because revenues are certainly challenged.” Shareholders are mainly interested in companies that pay dividends or buy back shares, said Cormark analyst Amir Arif. “It’s almost like you can’t win if you’re a Canadian energy company,” said Janan Paskaran, a partner at Torys LLP who provides M&A advice to energy companies. “It’s hard to invest within Canada, and it’s tough to get investor support when you expand outside.” “People are saying, ‘let’s not spend any capital.’” On Tuesday, Trinidad Drilling shareholders rejected a friendly stock deal to sell to Precision Drilling Corp , choosing instead the certainty of a cash offer from Ensign Energy Services. Swiss-based IPC’s shares have traded more in line with the industry since the steep sell-off last month when it announced its purchase of BlackPearl Resources, and investors generally support the deal, said CEO Mike Nicholson. “We’re now well positioned for the recovery over the next two to three years,” Nicholson said in an interview from Geneva. “Should we start to see (Canadian) pipelines and crude-by-rail improve, I think there’s a huge amount of upside now in our share price.” (Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba and John Tilak in Toronto Editing by Phil Berlowitz)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-crude-ma/rpt-canadian-oil-producers-trade-shares-for-growth-but-investors-hard-to-impress-idUKL2N1Y41TD,30 Nov 2018,"Depressed Canadian oil

2018-11-30,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s En+ Group (ENPLq.L), hit by U.S. sanctions in April, has proposed to shareholders that it move its registered office to Russia’s Kaliningrad region from Britain’s Jersey.  London-listed EN+, which is in talks with the United States to have sanctions against it eased, put forward the plan in a document prepared for a shareholder meeting on Dec. 20. The firm controlled by sanctioned billionaire Oleg Deripaska said the move could lead to a suspension or cancellation of the listing and trading of the company’s global depository receipts (GDRs).  “While the GDRs are currently traded on the LSE and are expected to remain traded on the LSE following the migration, there is no guarantee that the migration will not have an adverse impact on the trading market for the GDRs,” En+ said. EN+ proposes moving to Oktyabrsky Island in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave bordering Poland and Lithuania. Oktyabrsky Island is one of two new regions set up this year by the Russian government that offer tax breaks. The United States imposed sanctions on EN+ and Deripaska in April, as well as several other companies he controls, citing what it described as Russia’s malign activities.  However, the sanctions have been postponed several times since then as Washington considers removing En+ from the U.S. blacklist if Deripaska drops his control over the company.

2018-11-30,"(Reuters) - Oil analysts are increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of a price rally next year, when the outlook for demand is uncertain and supply is growing at breakneck speed, even though the market expects OPEC to cut output, a Reuters poll showed. A survey of 38 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude LCOc1 to average $74.50 a barrel in 2019, lower than the $76.88 outlook last month. The poll predicted Brent would average $73.20 in 2018, mostly in line with the $73 average for the global benchmark so far this year. “In the first half of next year we expect upward price pressure resulting from OPEC production cuts,” said Adrià  Morron Salmeron, economist at CaixaBank Research.  “Then, we expect downward price pressures from an uptick in U.S. shale production in the second half, as bottlenecks will disappear, and a deceleration of global growth.” Of the 32 contributors who participated in both the October and November polls, 16 cut their 2019 average price forecast for Brent. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia and other producers meet in Vienna on Dec. 6/7 in an attempt to support crude prices, which have fallen by over 30 percent from early October’s four-year high of $86.74. The group could announce cuts of anywhere between 1 and 1.4 million barrels per day, analysts said. “The oil market is definitely oversupplied at the moment. Therefore, OPEC will decide to cut output in December,” said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW. “The recent drop in prices was so strong that I think the non-OPEC members will either agree to freeze production or join in the cut.” A slowing global economy could erode oil demand growth next year, when supply from non-OPEC countries is forecast to expand at a record pace. Citi had the lowest 2019 forecast for Brent at $57 a barrel, while ABN Amro and Raymond James had the highest, at $90. The U.S. decision to grant waivers to countries that buy crude from Iran, hit by sanctions on its energy exports, has changed the dynamics in a market already under pressure from soaring output from the world’s top three oil producers, the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia, analysts said. “Uncertainty over U.S. sanctions against Iran had made the market fixated with supply. The waivers changed the arithmetic, raising the possibility of a supply glut developing in 2019,” said Konstantinos Venetis, senior economist at TSL Research. Non-OPEC output could rise by 1.5 to 2.2 million bpd in 2019, led by U.S. shale, a few of the analysts said. “Sharp increases in U.S. production will be a key impediment in upside potential for oil prices in 2019,” said Benjamin Lu,  commodities analyst at Phillip Futures. The poll forecast U.S. light crude CLc1 to average $67.45 a barrel in 2019, down from $70.15 predicted in the previous poll. The contract has averaged about $66.40 so far in 2018. Adding to the possible glut was a recovery in output from Nigeria and Libya, excluded from previous cuts because of production declines caused by unrest. On the other hand, oil demand was seen growing by between 0.9 and 1.5 million bpd in 2019, compared with 1.1 to 1.5 million bpd projected in the previous month’s poll. “On the demand side, the main driver is the question how far worldwide economic growth will slow in 2019 and how far this will lead to lower dynamics of oil demand next year,” LBBW’s Schallenberger said.

2018-11-30,"(Repeats to expand distribution) By Sheky Espejo and Noe Torres SAN JOSÉ TIPCEH, Mexico, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The Yucatan peninsula, dividing the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean, is among Mexico’s top destinations for renewable energy firms thanks to its strong winds and sunny climate. Home to bustling tourist resorts such as Cancun, the area is also a big energy consumer. But some of its Mayan indigenous communities are resisting rapid development of $1.1 billion of renewable energy projects and preparing to fight a plan to build a railway across the peninsula. President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, wants to fast track the construction of the tourist and freight line. “In the communities, there is concern that their opinion will not be taken into account once again with this project,” said Carlos Escoffié, lawyer for the Collective of Mayan Communities in the Chenes region. In San Jose Tipceh, a town of 500 people surrounded by jungles, indigenous leaders delayed by 18 months a multi-million dollar renewable energy project by U.S.-based solar company SunPower Corp, which planned to begin operations in August. “We are practically selling our families for a little bit of money,” said resident Damián Mugarte, threatening to take the battle to Mexico’s highest court. Indigenous resistance capitalizes on a law passed in the wake of the 1994 Zapatista uprising in southern Mexico that compels the government to consult with indigenous people for projects on their land. But the rules are ambiguous for investors and communities alike. Some experts warn that unless the new government puts in place clear guidelines all sides agree on, the issue has the potential to stall railways, ports, mines and other infrastructure projects. “If not fixed, the problem can become the main obstacle for economic growth,” said Hector Garza of international law firm Ritch Mueller who has advised the current government in developing the legal framework for this process. Rodolfo Salazar, who heads the consultation department for the current government at the Ministry of Energy, said rules put in place had helped resolve some conflicts but acknowledged they were not adequate to win the trust of indigenous populations. Left-leaning Lopez Obrador has pledged to amend the constitution to further reflect the indigenous rights, a move that will force the government and companies to pay more heed to their concerns. That may make it harder to build the Mayan Train, a 1,525-km (948-mile) railway planned in the states of Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Tabasco and Chiapas, connecting the rainforest and the beach. It could also spell difficulties for another railway to connect the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, which Lopez Obrador hopes could boost the economy of the poor southern state of Oaxaca. In an effort to win popular backing for the project, Lopez Obrador last week held a national referendum on the Mayan Train and nine other policy initiatives - including an oil refinery in the Gulf of Mexico - as part of his pledge to allow greater popular say in government decision-making during his six-year term. But the referendums have stirred controversy because of low participation rates and opaque monitoring of results. Only around 950,000 people voted in the Nov. 24-25 consultation, representing just 1.1 percent of eligible voters. His first consultation last month called for canceling the construction of a partially built $13 billion airport for Mexico City - sending the peso currency and the stock market sharply lower as investors fretted over how he would manage the economy. Although Lopez Obrador vowed to respect the opinion of towns and villages affected by the Mayan Train, he has also pledged to launch a tender to find a private sector partner for the project soon after he takes office. In Yucatan, activists say that none of the 163 communities through which the train will pass have been provided with information about the project. The fear is that “they will find people close to the government to simulate popular support, something which has happened repeatedly on the peninsula,” said Escoffié, of the Collective of Mayan Communities. Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have highlighted the need for consultations on projects that will drive through some pristine natural habitats and indigenous lands. Lopez Obrador has said that the train project, which he expects to take four years to complete and to cost between $6 billion and $8 billion, will provide a boost to the economy of the five southern states, which remain less developed than the more industrialized north. The train will provide easier access to key tourist sites, like the Mayan coastal ruins at Tulum and the famed complex at Chichen Itza. Lopez Obrador has said much of the project would be paid for with revenues from tourism taxes in coming years. Indigenous communities already oppose almost a dozen projects across Mexico’s southern states awarded in 2016 as part of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s bid to generate more than a third of Mexico’s electricity from renewable energy by 2024. Under existing law, projects are put to a vote which the majority must support for projects to go ahead. But regulations are vague, and communities and international organizations including the United Nations argue that in many cases indigenous peoples have not been consulted properly. The process has caused frustrations for investors. On the Oaxacan coast, an indigenous Zapotec community won a court order to suspend the construction of a wind farm by French state company EDF since April. EDF said the delays jeopardize its investments in Mexico. “How much can we stand?” said Víctor Tamayo, EDF’s regional director in Mexico. “Much of the difficulty we are experiencing is because there are no rules and the federal government is responsible.” In San José Tipceh, SunPower’s investment finally won approval in a consultation. The launch of the massive solar park has been postponed until September 2020. “Every day that passes, there are costs associated,” said Adrien Mallet, director of business development at SunPower in Mexico. However, he said the company was not frustrated by the delay and was focused on strengthening its links with the local community. Many in the impoverished town - where most inhabitants work in agriculture, growing corn, lemons and tangerines - say the park will bring much-needed jobs. “We are barely surviving here,” complained Anastacio Ake, a 62-year-old evangelical pastor, saying he would welcome the money and the solar panels the company has promised to install in homes.

2018-11-30,"* Libyan oil output at highest level for five years * Risks loom as oil workers complain about high inflation * Militias and protesters have blocked ports and fields * Production remains below 2011 levels By Ayman al-Warfalli, Ulf Laessing and Ahmad Ghaddar BENGHAZI/TRIPOLI/LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Libya’s oil output is at a five-year high and rare exploration deals with foreign majors are being won but worker dissent and ever-present armed groups risk a repeat of disruptions that have choked off other production surges since the 2011 civil war. Staff at state oil firm NOC told Reuters that small protests had erupted at nine oil and gas fields and some ports in recent months, mainly among workers left waiting for promised pay rises as inflation and a weak currency erode living standards. “We are the anonymous soldiers whose rights have been stolen,” said a worker at the al-Intisar oil field, asking not to be named as NOC has banned workers from talking to the media. “We should be the best paid workers in Libya but we suffer from poor accommodation and medical treatment in the fields and delays in salary payments.” Other staff made similar comments. The most stable period of production in the North African country since 2013 has pushed output as high as 1.3 million barrels per day. State oil firm NOC has restarted wells shut for years as security has improved in some areas, while oil majors like BP have said they will revive long-delayed exploration plans. But approaching or exceeding output of 1 million bpd has tended to be a psychological trigger for demands from workers and militia groups that also want a share of oil earnings. In autumn 2014, blockades of oilfields and ports rapidly cut production after it had climbed to more than 800,000 bpd. In May, disruptions slashed output to around 150,000 bpd, its lowest since the war. Before 2011 Libya was producing around 1.6 million bpd. Seven years after Muammar Gaddafi was toppled, the OPEC member also remains mired in conflict between rival governments and armed groups. NOC said in a statement it was always looking to improve conditions for its workforce and called on the government to approve a pay rise. But years of underfunding and destruction by militias had forced it to focus on damaged infrastructure. “NOC is constantly having to redeploy budget to restore critical infrastructure; funds that could otherwise be spent on facilities and improving working conditions,” NOC said. Libya was once one of Africa’s richest countries but living standards for ordinary citizens have declined as the local currency has lost value. The dinar has fallen on the parallel market by as much as 400 percent against the dollar since 2014. Since even basic foodstuffs like milk have to be imported, inflation has soared, hurting oil workers whose salaries have not risen since 2013. Authorities then agreed a 67 percent pay hike but volatile oil revenues meant it was never implemented. Priced for its proximity to key European markets and crude quality, Libyan oil has recently been in demand as a substitute for Iranian crude hit by U.S. sanctions. Part of the technical work needed to keep oil and gas fields going is done by NOC’s foreign partners and specialist services firms, an oil executive said. But NOC staff need to be kept happy as they make up the bulk of the industry’s workforce, operate oil export ports, and are often alone at remote fields where poor security makes oil majors wary of sending their own staff. Oil workers’ protests have been small and shortlived. But in Libya with its dysfunctional state, pipelines have sometimes been blocked by 20 workers or fewer, industry sources said. Many Libyans see NOC, which generates billions of dollars annually, as a cash cow that is potentially more responsive to their grievances than the largely absent state. Armed groups have also enjoyed an oil bonanza. By forcing the weak state to hire their men, they gain access to cheap central bank dollars to sell on the black market at a premium. One such group, the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG), is in charge of securing facilities. In September some PFG members halted air transport to the Wafa oil field in what NOC said was an attempt to extract a “corrupt” contract. NOC workers make between 800 dinars ($205) and 3,000 dinars a month — more than the average public servant. But frustration has been building up over a lack of investment in living quarters or medical units. In September, oil workers at NOC’s eastern Zueitina port demanded health insurance in a letter to management. NOC said it had approved medical coverage for all staff last year and instructed subsidiaries to proceed with the policy, after the audit bureau suspended health insurance in 2015. Other staff are tired of having to work in dangerous places such as the El Sharara oilfield, deep in the south, where gunmen have kidnapped or robbed workers. “The security situation on the El Sharara field is very dangerous,” said one frightened engineer. Tribesmen have threatened to close the field unless they get a share of oil revenues, a recurring theme while Libya is divided between rival governments relying on armed groups and tribes. “Libya needs a comprehensive political settlement before situations like the one we have at Sharara can be resolved,” a Libyan oil source said. NOC hopes to increase production further if security improves but analysts remain sceptical. “With production at a five-year high, the production risks are more on the downside ... considering the ongoing political instability in the country and the challenging security situation,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at UBS in Zurich.

2018-11-30,"(Adds euro zone inflation, chart and U.S. Treasury moves) * Brent sits below $60 a barrel after worst month in a decade * Europe lower, DAX heads for fourth straight month of losses * Negative Trump-Xi meeting outcome could spark volatility * China factory growth flat for first time in 2+ years in November * Oil slipping again, Russia considers output curbs * Dollar a tad higher after monthly dip * Apple heads for worst month since financial crisis * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Oil toiled at a more than one-year low after its worst month in a decade on Friday, while most major markets were keeping moves tight ahead of a weekend meeting between U.S. and Chinese presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. Europe’s main share indexes in London, Frankfurt and Paris all started their day lower after the latest batch of disappointing Chinese data had made for another twitchy Asian session overnight. Frankfurt’s export-heavy DAX and Britain’s mainly domestic-focused FTSE 250 were both staring at their fourth consecutive month of falls. For the DAX it is its worst run since the back end of 2008. The real humdingers though have been oil and Apple which have plunged 21 percent and 18 percent respectively in November, the worst month for either since the financial crisis a decade ago. “Expectations at the start of the fourth quarter were for a melt-up in risky assets, but two of the biggest trends have been a reversal of some of the few returns we have seen this year, which have been in oil and in tech,” said head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets’ Michael Metcalfe. “Also the market seems to be going into the G20 meeting with very low expectations of a ceasefire in the trade war. That may very well be correct but politics has proved very hard to predict this year.” Anticipation ahead of that meeting ensured cautious moves in the currency and bond markets. The dollar index was a touch firmer at 96.86 .DXY — having slipped this back this week after Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell left investors wondering whether the U.S. central bank may be nearing the end of its current rate-hike cycle. In early London trade, the euro fetched $1.1360, down 0.55 percent as euro zone inflation data came in softer than forecast. The dollar was flat at 113.52 yen while sterling shuffled around at just under $1.28 having been lifted slightly this month by UK Prime Minister Theresa May securing a Brexit transition deal with the EU. “We believe that Powell has not turned dovish but is simply toning down his hawkish tilt,” said Philip Wee, a currency strategist at DBS, forecasting another hike in December and as many as four next year. U.S. money markets though, where the real money sits, are now pricing in only one rise next year, and the yield on two-year U.S. Treasury notes, sensitive to Fed shifts, is at 2.81 percent from almost 3 percent earlier in the month. Markets could well be in for a volatile December if Trump and Xi fail to de-escalate their trade war at talks at this weekend’s G20 meeting in Argentina. Data on Friday added to the anticipation, showing that growth in China’s vast manufacturing sector had stalled this month for the first time in more than two years. “This is not a good year for multilateralism,” a German government source told Reuters about the prospects for a G20 statement at the end of the meeting on Saturday. The negotiations are “very, very difficult.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.2 percent with Korean shares one of the main drivers after the country’s central bank lifted its interest rates in a widely expected decision. In Japan, the Nikkei ended 0.4 percent higher, while Chinese blue-chips, which have had a relatively steady month all considered, also advanced 1 percent. U.S. S&P e-mini futures ticked down 0.3 percent, pointing to a weaker Wall Street session on Friday after a mixed overnight performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25 percent on Thursday. Adding to apprehension ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, a U.S. official said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who has advocated a tougher trade stance with China, would attend. Trump himself had sent mixed signals saying: “I think we’re very close to doing something with China but I don’t know that I want to do it,” as the money coming in from his tariffs was so lucrative. Back in the oil markets, crude was starting to slip again having tried to steady on news that Russia is increasingly convinced it needs to reduce oil output along with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC and its allies are meeting in Vienna on Dec. 6-7. Brent and U.S. WTI crude were both down around 0.6 percent at $59.51 per barrel and $51.38 a barrel.

2018-11-30,"BUENOS AIRES, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A summit of the world’s top economies will open on Friday with leaders struggling over fallout from a U.S.-China trade war that has roiled global markets and bracing for the kind of divisive geopolitical drama that President Donald Trump often brings to the international stage. The two-day annual gathering will be a major test for the Group of 20 industrialized nations, whose leaders first met in 2008 to help rescue the global economy from the worst financial crisis in seven decades, but which now faces questions over its relevance to deal with the latest round of crises. Overhanging the summit in Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, is a bitter trade dispute between the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, which have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s imports. All eyes will be on a planned meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday to see whether they can find a way to calm the waters and make progress toward resolving differences that threaten the global economy. On the eve of the summit, G20 member nations were still racing to reach agreement on major issues including trade, migration and climate change that in past years have been worked out well in advance. Those divisions have highlighted the fractures in the grouping. In fact, Trump’s skepticism that global warming is caused by human activity has even raised questions about whether the countries will be able to reach enough consensus on the issue to include it in the summit’s final communique. Further clouding the summit is the escalation of conflict between Russia and Ukraine – a topic that will be on many leaders’ minds when they see Russian President Vladimir Putin. There are also questions about how to handle the awkward presence of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler arrived under swirling controversy over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Uncertainty prevailed about how Trump, known for his unpredictability, would behave at what was shaping up as one of the group’s most consequential summits. Earlier this month, officials from countries attending a major Asia-Pacific summit failed to agree on a joint statement for the first time as the U.S. delegation, led by Vice President Mike Pence, clashed with China over trade and security. In May, Trump rejected a statement by fellow leaders of the G7 industrialized economies after a tense gathering ended in acrimony, again over tariffs and trade. Before heading for Buenos Aires on Thursday, Trump said he was open to a trade deal with China, but added, “I don’t know that I want to do it.” After initial plans for him to stay away from the summit, Trump’s hardline trade adviser, Peter Navarro, was added to the U.S. delegation at the last minute and is expected to attend the meeting between Trump and Xi, a U.S. official and a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. The official said it was meant to send a message to China of U.S. resolve on trade. China, for its part, is hoping for “positive results” in resolving the trade dispute with the United States, the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday. A slowdown in the global economy will worsen if Trump presses ahead with plans to further increase tariffs on some $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent, OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria told Reuters. While Trump’s meeting with Xi is all but certain to go ahead, the U.S. president on Thursday abruptly scrapped his planned talks with Putin, citing Russia’s recent seizure of Ukrainian vessels. Trump has often voiced a desire for better relations with Putin, and many critics at home slammed him in July for appearing to disregard U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, while giving credence to the Russian president’s assertion that it did not. One potential bright spot at the summit could be the signing of a revised U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact. But a day before the three neighbors were due to formalize the agreement on Friday, negotiators were still thrashing out what exactly they will be putting their names to, officials said on Thursday. The three countries agreed a deal in principle to govern their trillion dollars of mutual trade after a year and a half of contentious talks concluded with a late-night bargain just an hour before a deadline on Sept. 30.

2018-11-30,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s Maritime Port Authority (MPA) will ban the discharge of “wash water” used in ships to scrub engine exhaust from Jan. 1, 2020, the MPA said on Friday.  The ban of so-called open-loop scrubbers is part of an effort to prepare one of the world’s busiest ports for International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules that come into force in 2020 and oblige ships to use cleaner fuels.  “To protect the marine environment and ensure that the port waters are clean, the discharge of wash water from open-loop exhaust gas scrubbers in Singapore port waters will be prohibited,” said Andrew Tan, Chief Executive Officer of the MPA during an event in Singapore.  “Ships fitted with hybrid scrubbers will be required to switch to the closed-loop mode of operation,” Tan said.  Singapore is the world’s biggest hub for ship refueling, also known as bunkering.  Tan said Singapore would provide facilities for the collection of residue generated from the operation of scrubbers.  The MPA said the ban would be enforced from Jan. 1, 2020.  Under future IMO rules, ships will have to reduce the sulfur content in their fuel to below 0.5 percent from 2020, compared with 3.5 percent now.  To do so, shippers can switch to burning cleaner oil, shift to alternative fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG), or invest in exhaust gas cleaning systems, or scrubbers.  The MPA’s move could be a setback for shippers bunkering in Singapore that have invested in scrubbers.  Open-loop scrubbers use seawater to capture sulfur from engine exhausts before discharging this “wash water” back into the ocean after treatment. In closed-loop systems, scrubbing is performed using water treated with additives, recycling the liquid internally. Hybrid scrubbers are a combination of both.  The cheapest of the scrubbing options, open-loop systems, have been the most popular with shippers, shipping sources say.  Some anticipate Singapore’s move could cost the city-state business in the bunkering industry.  “Singapore’s bunker market could lose out to competitive bunkering locations emerging in surrounding locations ... provided they allow open-loop scrubbers to operate,” said Ashok Sharma, managing director of shipbroker BRS Baxi in Singapore.  Others are less concerned since most shippers are opting for low sulfur fuels as a means for compliance, and the benefits of scrubbers are largely realized in open water and not within port limits.  “Prudent tanker owners will have likely factored in the possibility of limits on the use of open-loop scrubbers,” said Tim Wilkins, Asia-Pacific manager for Intertanko, an association of independent tanker owners and operators.  While recent interest in scrubbers has increased, the cost of installing them and uncertainty around emissions regulations has meant that a switch to low-sulfur fuels remains the most practical form of compliance with IMO 2020 rules, according to industry participants.

2018-11-30,"OSLO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Allowing ship-to-ship transfers in Norwegian waters from Yamal in Arctic Russia, one of the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, undercuts Europe’s energy diversification efforts, the U.S. State Department said on Friday. By transferring LNG to more conventional tankers in Norway, the Arctic vessels cut in half the distance they would cover to deliver gas to Europe, enabling more frequent shipments from the Novatek terminal and increasing Russia’s gas exports. Last week, the first such transfer took place off the Norwegian Arctic port of Honningsvag. Asked what the U.S. position was on the activity taking place in Norwegian waters, the U.S. State Department told Reuters: “At a time when Russian gas comprises a growing proportion of Europe’s energy imports, additional volumes of Russian gas will undercut Europe’s energy diversification efforts. “We are working closely with our European partners to increase their energy security by promoting diversification of energy fuel types, energy routes, and energy source countries,” the department added. The United States has been pressing Europe to cut its reliance on cheap Russian gas and buy much more expensive U.S. LNG instead, which many European countries, including industrial heavyweight Germany, have so far resisted. Norway is Europe’s second-largest supplier of gas after Russia.

Victor Huang, head of investment strategy at Guotai Junan International in Hong Kong, said markets would be “much more volatile” next week if the two leaders failed to de-escalate their tariff war in talks due to take place on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentian this weekend. By afternoon trade, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent, as an official survey pointed to a slowdown in China’s manufacturing sector. The index was still set for its best month since January as it bounced from a bruising October. Shares in Europe looked set for a shaky start. Spreadbetters CMC Markets expect the FTSE 100 to open 0.04 percent lower at 7,035, but the DAX is seen opening 0.2 percent higher at 11,325 and the CAC 40 up 0.3 percent at 5,020. In Japan, the Nikkei ended 0.4 percent higher, while Korean shares dropped 0.8 percent after the country’s central bank lifted its policy interest rate in a widely expected decision. Chinese blue-chips advanced 1 percent despite a survey showing China’s factory growth stalled for the first time in more than two years in November. The weak manufacturing growth reinforced expectations that Beijing will roll out more economic support measures - a factor that has helped to prop up battered Chinese stocks recently. U.S. S&P e-mini futures ticked down 0.13 percent, pointing to a weaker Wall Street session on Friday after a mixed overnight performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25 percent on Thursday. Adding to apprehension ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting , a U.S. official said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who has advocated a tougher trade stance with China, would attend. The mixed signals from Washington about the prospects for a rapprochement with China on trade kept investors on the sidelines. “Rather than jump at headlines, the market has taken a laid-back approach and prices are treading water until we see the outcome,” analysts at National Australia Bank said in a morning note. Australian shares underperformed regional peers, falling 1.6 percent as beverage maker Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd , dropped 14.5 percent on a weak outlook for 2019. “They billed it as another transformational year, which fund managers think means profit growth is not going to be that good,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities in Sydney. Global investors also remain hesitant to shift positions significantly as they seek clarity on Federal Reserve policy direction. Minutes of the latest Fed policy meeting showed that almost all officials agreed another interest rate increase was “likely to be warranted fairly soon,” but opened debate on when to pause further hikes and how to relay those plans to the public. The minutes follow comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week that some took as indicating a dovish shift. The yield on two-year U.S. Treasury notes, seen as sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.8048 percent on Friday, down from a U.S. close of 2.813 percent. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yielded 3.0242 percent, compared with a U.S. close of 3.035 percent on Thursday. The dollar lost 0.07 percent against the yen to 113.39 , while the euro weakened to $1.1388. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major rivals, was barely lower at 96.766.

2018-11-30,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Attempts by Chinese companies and local governments to conceal pollution violations are “extremely stupid” and will not succeed, China’s environment ministry said on Friday after a spate of cover-ups in the country. Now in the fifth year of its war on pollution, China has struggled to enforce its environmental laws and Beijing wants market regulators, graft watchdogs, police and the courts to play a bigger role in punishing polluters.    The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) has named and shamed several local jurisdictions and companies over the past month for deliberate acts of deception designed to hide compliance failures.  This month, one firm deliberately misreported the spilling of nearly 70 tonnes of petrochemicals into the sea at the Quanzhou port in southeast Fujian province, the local government said in a statement, adding that seven company workers have been arrested and several officials dismissed. “Any attempt to conceal the truth is extremely stupid and in vain,” environment ministry spokesman Liu Youbin said at a news briefing in Beijing when asked about the port incident. “The relevant company is directly responsible for the incident, but the local government also didn’t do a good job dealing with the emergency, especially in disclosing relevant information,” he added. China is in the middle of a new campaign to curb winter smog, and forced at least 46 cities this week to adopt emergency measures to cut emissions after air quality deteriorated across northern and eastern regions. Despite pressure from Beijing, many growth-obsessed local governments turn a blind eye to polluting enterprises they consider vital sources of jobs and economic growth. This month, state media reported that officials in eastern China’s Shandong province were caught throwing chemicals worth 46 million yuan ($6.63 million) into a river to disguise pollution levels.  In Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, officials were accused of trying to cover a one-kilometer (0.62 mile) section of a river with tarpaulin to hide water pollution from inspectors, according to a state media report last month.  Liu said environmental inspections enable local governments to promote “high-quality economic development” and the scrutiny will continue. “We will not ease supervision and will continue to carry out inspections,” he said.

2018-11-30,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thousands of children walked out of school across Australia on Friday in protest against government inaction on climate change, prompting a rebuke from a minister who said they were setting themselves up for “failure”. Children, parents and teachers gathered in Sydney’s central business district in the lunch hour, chanting “ScoMo’s got to go”, referring to Prime Minister Scott Morrison. There were similar protests in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and elsewhere after students in the national capital of Canberra held a protest earlier in the week. “This is just the beginning. This is our first strike, our first movement altogether... We will keep leading more campaigns until something is done,” one of the protest leaders told the  screaming, uniform-wearing crowd. Australia is one of the largest carbon emitters per capita, in part because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants. Earlier this year, the conservative government also weakened its commitment to the U.N. Paris climate accord.     Energy policy has created deep fissures in the conservative coalition and climate change skeptics were a key force in deposing Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister in August.  Morrison has criticized the protests, saying he wanted more learning and less activism in schools, and Resources Minister Matt Canavan said the action was setting the children up for failure. “Walking off school and protesting, you don’t learn anything from that,” Canavan said in a radio interview. “The best thing you learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue because that’s what your future life will look like.” But teachers and parents at the protest said they believed the protests was significant for children’s learning.  “This is as good an education as being in a classroom... I think this is a good way for kids to learn to be involved, to be active and to take some action for something that affects them directly,” said Maria, a 39-year-old Sydney mother who accompanied her nine year-old son to the protest.

2018-11-30,"* Backwardated structure makes storage non-profitable * Chinese demand tepid amid industrial slowdown * Storage in North Asia still full By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) continued their downward spiral this week, falling to a four-month low as demand from top buyers Japan and China failed to materialise amid ample inventory. Spot prices for January delivery in North Asia LNG-AS were estimated at about $9.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 20 cents from the previous week, while spot prices for cargoes delivered in February were estimated at about $9.70 to 9.80 per mmBtu, according to trade sources. The market structure has flipped into a backwardated one, where prices for cargoes loading in the current month are higher than those loading in the forward months, making storage of the super-chilled fuel uneconomical. Several of the tankers storing LNG off Singapore and Malaysia waters recently appear to be on the move, likely prompted by the change in market structure, traders said. Demand from China, the world’s second-largest LNG importer, appears to be tepid with top supplier China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) offering to sell cargoes for January, traders added. “The three oil majors’ storage tanks are very full and so far, north China is not cold,” a China-based LNG trader said referring to natural gas storage tanks of CNOOC, Sinopec and CNPC. Industrial gas demand in North China is showing signs of a sharp slowdown as small manufacturers shut their doors or buy less gas, unable to cope with a drop-off in export orders and costs related to Beijing’s pollution control and reform measures, Reuters reported earlier this month. Natural gas inventory levels in Japan and South Korea are still high, trade sources said. “There is lots of LNG in Europe too. I expect prices to fall further,” an European trader said. “China and South Korea have taken more cargoes than they expected they would need. Singapore stocks are also full.” Indian Oil Corp likely bought two LNG cargoes on a delivered ex-ship basis into Gujarat between Jan. 7 and Jan. 14, and from Jan. 21 to Jan. 28 from trader Glencore at close to $9 per mmBtu, traders said, though the deal could not immediately be confirmed. Gail India is proposing to swap three LNG cargoes across the first quarter of next year, trade sources said. Gail is offering a cargo a month from Cove Point for loading in the first quarter of next year in exchange for corresponding deliveries to India, one of the traders said. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), Angola LNG and Nigeria LNG offered cargoes this week, adding to the glut. Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan, additional reporting by

2018-11-30,"NEW DELHI/CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and told him about plans to scale up investments in India’s tech, farm and energy sectors, an Indian official and the Saudi news agency (SPA) said on Friday. The two leaders, who are in Argentina for the G20 summit, met in the prince’s residence in Buenos Aires and discussed Saudi Arabia’s readiness to supply India with oil and petroleum products. The G20 summit in Buenos Aires is the first major international event the Saudi prince has attended since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. The Saudi prince told Modi he would soon be finalizing an initial investment in India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, a quasi-sovereign wealth fund, to help accelerate the building of ports, highways and other projects, a top Indian diplomat said. “The crown prince also referred to future projects for investments, in sectors such as tech, energy and farm,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale, who is accompanying Modi to the G20, said in a readout of the meeting. Ways in which Saudi Arabia could replace its agricultural imports from other countries with Indian agricultural produce were also discussed, the Saudi news agency said.  Since he took office in 2014 at the head of a Hindu-nationalist government, Modi has sought to expand ties with Saudi Arabia and other Islamic nations to deny arch foe Pakistan an advantage and to leverage India’s fast-growing economy as an attractive investment. The meeting with the Saudi crown prince was Modi’s first in a set of “bilaterals” on the sidelines of the G20 that will be followed by meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. “We expect that in the next two to three years there will be significant scaling up of Saudi investments in India,” Gokhale said. The two leaders also talked about cooperation in arms manufacturing and Saudi Arabia’s efforts to develop a domestic arms industry, SPA said. Modi stressed the importance of stable energy prices and the two leaders discussed ways in which Saudi Arabia, a top crude oil supplier, could help stabilize prices, particularly for India, Gokhale said. India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer, has been grappling with a combination of soaring prices and a falling currency, which makes imports of dollar-denominated oil more expensive, until a recent fall in oil prices. Saudi Arabia has told India it is committed to meeting its rising oil demand and is the “shock absorber” for supply disruptions in the oil market. The crown prince also discussed with Modi Saudi oil giant Aramco’s investment in refineries in India, including the company’s project to build a large refinery on the western coast of India, SPA said. The two leaders also explored investing in solar energy through Softbank’s Saudi-backed Vision Fund and opportunities to export Saudi non-oil products to India.

2018-11-30,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan up less than 0.1 pct, Nikkei +0.4 pct * China factory growth flat for first time in 2+ years in November * Coca-Cola Amatil outlook drags on Aussie shares * Markets seen rangebound ahead of outcome of G20 talks By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Asian shares wavered on Friday as investors were on edge before a crucial weekend meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents that could determine the course of a heated trade war over the next year. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan wobbled between positive and negative territory in early trade, as more evidence of a slowdown in China dampened sentiment. It was last up less than 0.1 percent and has risen 2.7 percent for the week so far, largely reflecting a rebound from a recent steep sell-off. In Japan, the Nikkei was up 0.4 percent, while Korean shares dropped 0.2 percent after the country’s central bank lifted its policy interest rate in a widely expected decision. Chinese blue-chips advanced 0.5 percent despite a survey showing China’s factory growth stalled for the first time in more than two years in November. The weak manufacturing growth reinforced expectations that Beijing will roll out more economic support measures - a factor that has helped to prop up battered Chinese stocks recently. Investor attention is now squarely focussed on planned talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart over the weekend on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina. Victor Huang, head of investment strategy at Guotai Junan International in Hong Kong, said a no-deal outcome could lead to “much more volatile” markets next week. U.S. S&P e-mini futures ticked down 0.06 percent, pointing to a weaker Wall Street session on Friday after a mixed overnight performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25 percent on Thursday. Adding to apprehension ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting were comments from a U.S. official, who said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who has advocated a tougher trade stance with China, would attend. The mixed signals from Washington about the prospects for a rapprochement with China on trade kept investors on the sidelines. “Rather than jump at headlines, the market has taken a laid-back approach and prices are treading water until we see the outcome,” analysts at National Australia Bank said in a morning note. Australian shares underperformed regional peers, falling 1.3 percent as beverage maker Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd , dropped 14.2 percent on a weak outlook for 2019. “They billed it as another transformational year, which fund managers think means profit growth is not going to be that good,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities in Sydney. Global investors also remain hesitant to shift positions significantly as they seek clarity on Federal Reserve policy direction. Minutes of the latest Fed policy meeting showed that almost all officials agreed another interest rate increase was “likely to be warranted fairly soon,” but opened debate on when to pause further hikes and how to relay those plans to the public. The minutes follow comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week that some took as indicating a dovish shift. The yield on two-year U.S. Treasury notes, seen as sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.8066 percent on Friday, down from a U.S. close of 2.813 percent. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yielded 3.0243 percent, compared with a U.S. close of 3.035 percent on Thursday. The dollar dropped 0.07 percent against the yen to 113.39 , while the euro was flat at $1.1392. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major rivals, was also flat at 96.769. In commodities markets, crude prices extended gains on news that Russia is increasingly convinced it needs to reduce oil output along with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC and its allies are meeting in Vienna on Dec. 6-7. U.S. crude gained 0.37 percent to $51.64 a barrel, and Brent crude was up 0.42 percent at $59.76 per barrel.

2018-11-30,"CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - For two dozen third-graders who survived the massive wildfire that largely obliterated Paradise, California, school is now the small home of their teacher, Sheri Eichar: Reading center on the couch, math in the kitchen nook, language in the corner.  When it’s time for recess, the pupils jog around the block of Eichar’s suburban neighborhood in Chico, a 20-minute drive from Paradise.  Of the 24 kids in Eichar’s class at Children’s Community Charter School, 20 lost their homes in the Camp Fire, which broke out near Paradise on November 8 and swept through the small mountain community, killing at least 88 people. The blaze, which is now fully contained, is already the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, with 158 people still unaccounted for as search and rescue teams comb through the rubble and ash for human remains. Many of Paradise’s 27,000 residents are now settled in and around Chico after the firestorm that consumed the town and destroyed the elementary school. Within days of the evacuation, Eichar notified her students that classes would resume in her three-bedroom home and she and her husband moved the couches around so the children can sit on the floor of their living room. On the first day, “The kids walked in like they did it every day of their lives,” Eichar said, and lined up side by side on the couches. Ten to 12 students come most days, although 18 turned up on Tuesday. “They just needed each other so bad. This fire has created such isolation for the families and these children. They just need to be together,” she said. Eleanor Weddig, 8, says the home is more fun than a schoolhouse. “Well, I love it. It’s like more comfortable than our classroom, the chairs are cushy,” Weddig said. “And anyway it’s a house so it’s like more fancy and stuff, and she cooks us great lunches.” All told, 5,000 students have been displaced from Paradise schools. Eight of nine schools in the Paradise Unified School District are damaged or destroyed.     Students left homeless are eligible under federal law to re-enroll in a school wherever they temporarily reside, said Tom DeLapp of the Butte County Office of Education.  Officials are scrambling to identify commercial buildings, available real estate, mobile classrooms and partnerships with other agencies to keep classrooms and kids together.  “It could be years,” before schools are rebuilt in Paradise, DeLapp said. “While the place burned down in 24 hours, we can’t rebuild it in 24 hours.” Families and staff at Children’s Community Charter School gathered at the Grace Community Church in Chico on Tuesday to hear about plans for recovery.  Starting Monday, the school’s 220 students will begin holding classes at a church gym in Chico. On Friday, a second charter school will squeeze into the same space. Principal Steve Hitchko says it will be tricky. There is only one restroom, and students have missed a lot of classes. “Will our test scores suffer? Yeah. I’m just going to be honest with you. We’re going through trauma,” Hitchko said. At the meeting, parents voiced concerns about long commutes from new or temporary homes, counseling services and after-school programs. Children wondered whether there would be books and computers.  For many, the meeting was an emotional reunion. Some parents and children were seeing each other for the first time since the fire.  Staff members there included Jessica Hamack, the school’s office manager, who was applauded by parents for canceling classes when the fire rapidly overtook Paradise. Some credit her cancellation notice for alerting them to the flames. Hamack said she issued the alert after seeing flames behind the school when she arrived for work, adding: “There were already kids in my office and that made me nervous.”  (This story has been refiled to fix byline; no other changes to text) Reporting by Lee van der Voo in Chico, California; Writing by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Sonya Hepinstall",https://uk.reuters.com/article/california-wildfires-schools/refile-feature-schools-work-to-restore-routine-to-children-of-lost-paradise-idUKL2N1Y31ZQ,30 Nov 2018,"For two dozen

2018-11-30,"TOKYO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Japan’s greenhouse gas emissions dropped 1 percent to an eight-year low in the financial year ended March, government figures showed on Friday, as the country shifts focus to renewable energy and higher utilisation of nuclear plants. Emissions in the 2017 financial year fell for a fourth straight year to 1.294 billion metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent from 1.307 billion tonnes in the previous year, hitting their lowest since fiscal 2009, according to preliminary data from the environment ministry. Japan, the world’s fifth-biggest carbon emitter, has set a goal to cut its emissions by 26 percent from 2013 levels to 1.042 billion tonnes by 2030. The latest figure represents an 8.2 percent reduction from 2013 levels, data showed. The country has come under fierce criticism from environmentalists and more subtle pressure from allies as it is one of the few industrialised countries to heavily promote coal power both at home and abroad, including advanced technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Emissions had surged after the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima that led to the closure of atomic power plants and an increased reliance on fossil fuel-fired energy, but have now turned lower after hitting a peak of 1.409 billion tonnes in the 2013 financial year.

2018-11-30,"(Adds details on arrangement of deal, establishment of trust, context from Justice Ministry) By Marco Aquino LIMA, Nov 29 (Reuters) - A state-owned Chinese consortium has struck a deal to buy Peru’s Chaglla hydroelectric plant from scandal-plagued Brazilian builder Odebrecht SA for at least $618 million, Peru’s Justice Ministry said on Thursday. Justice Minister Vicente Zeballos told reporters that Odebrecht would turn over half the sale price agreed upon with the Chinese consortium, led by Three Gorges Corp, to cover reparations in a long-running corruption case. The Chinese consortium would also agree to pay off Odebrecht’s debt to the firms that originally financed the construction of the hydroelectric plant, bringing the total investment to $1.39 billion, the minister’s spokeswoman told Reuters. Zeballos said Odebrecht would be required to deposit half the $618 million it nets from the sale into a “trust overseen by Peru’s Banco de la Nacion to be used exclusively to pay suppliers and debt.” The minister added that negotiations were still underway on the specifics of the deal, including the sale price. Odebrecht declined to comment on the matter. The Brazilian builder has been at the center of Latin America’s biggest graft scandal after admitting to paying bribes from Peru to Panama. It is selling assets to shrink its debt as it faces billions in fines and bans on bidding for government contracts throughout the region. After Brazil, Peru is the country where the Odebrecht scandal has been most disruptive. Peru’s four most recent presidents are under investigation in connection with alleged bribes paid by Odebrecht. The sale of the 456-megawatt hydropower facility, Peru’s third largest, must still be approved by the Economy Ministry and the Energy and Mining Ministry, as well as the state-run power company Electroperu. The deal is China Three Gorges’ first venture in Peru as the presence of Chinese companies grows in Latin America. The Chaglla hydro project is a critical supply of power for Peru’s mining industry in the country´s northern Andean mountain region. Reporting by Marco Aquino

2018-11-30,"(Repeats Nov. 29 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2RjBrxq By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, must play a bad hand of cards as well as he can at next week’s meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers in Vienna. Falih’s challenge is to get other countries on board with output cuts to avert another crash in oil prices next year while disguising the kingdom’s diminishing leverage in the oil market. Front-month Brent futures have fallen by a third since the start of October while the six-month calendar spread is in contango, indicating most traders expect the market to be oversupplied in 2019. The market outlook is strikingly similar to 2014, with production from U.S. shale surging while consumption growth slows as the global economy falters (tmsnrt.rs/2RjBrxq). But in one respect the situation is even more uncomfortable because Saudi Arabia’s official foreign reserves are down to just over $500 billion, from almost $750 billion in June 2014. The kingdom probably needs to keep several hundred billion dollars’ worth of reserve assets on hand to maintain confidence in its fixed exchange-rate peg to the U.S. dollar and prevent a run on the currency. The kingdom can ill-afford another slump in oil revenues so soon after the last one, which suggests it will have to cut production, while trying to cajole other OPEC and non-OPEC countries to share the burden. At the same time, any cuts must avoid provoking a political reaction from the United States, where the president has continued to press for even lower oil prices. Saudi Arabia faces a familiar but uncomfortable choice: cut production to defend prices or allow prices to fall to protect market share. In November 2014, Saudi Arabia chose to maintain production and allow prices to fall, which temporarily halted the U.S. shale boom but wrecked the kingdom’s finances and pushed its economy into recession. In December 2016, Saudi Arabia opted to cut production, which boosted prices and stabilised the kingdom’s finances and economy but also revived the shale boom and cost it oil-market share. The 2014 market-share strategy, associated with Falih’s predecessor as oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, is often characterised as a failure, though it did manage to restrain U.S. shale production for a time. By contrast, the price-defence strategy of 2016, involving coordinated output cuts with other OPEC and non-OPEC countries, has been hailed as a triumph, even though it reinvigorated the shale boom. But Naimi warned repeatedly that the burden of OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts would fall most heavily on Saudi Arabia and the main beneficiaries would be U.S. shale producers, and time has proved him correct. Saudi Arabia shouldered a disproportionate share of the cuts in 2017/18, just as it had done during earlier cuts in 2008/09 and 2003/04. Russia’s production was broadly unchanged or increased during all three episodes. By August 2018, Saudi Arabia’s production was up by 630,000 barrels per day compared with June 2014 and Russia’s output had climbed by 525,000 bpd. U.S. output was up by more than 2.6 million bpd. In the current environment, the kingdom must do everything possible to prevent another price crash, which means it has little option but to cut its own production significantly. Saudi Arabia cannot afford another slump in oil prices. It needs to keep revenues high to help its economy climb out of recession and finance ambitious social and economic transformation programmes. Now the kingdom is trying to assemble some diplomatic cover for cutbacks it will almost certainly have to make anyway. In the run-up to next week’s meetings in Vienna, Falih has indicated Saudi Arabia is ready to cut output again but only in conjunction with other producers (“Saudi Arabia wants united front on oil output”, Reuters, Nov. 28). “We are going to ... do whatever is necessary, but only if we act together as a group of 25,” Falih told reporters, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. “As Saudi Arabia we cannot do it alone, we will not do it alone. “Everybody is longing (to) reach a decision that brings stability back to the market ... I think people know that leaving the market to its own devices with no clarity and no collective decision to balance the market is not helping.” If the past is any guide, however, Saudi Arabia will do most of the cutting, Russia’s output will end up little changed, and the main beneficiaries will be U.S. shale firms. Saudi Arabia’s fundamental problem is structural rather than diplomatic: every time the kingdom tries to raise prices by restricting its output, it only encourages more increases in U.S. shale production.

2018-11-30,"* U.S. crude stocks rise for 10th straight week - EIA * U.S. output remains at record 11.7 mln bpd - EIA * OPEC, Russia expected to agree supply cuts next week By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices slpped on Friday after the United States reported a 10th straight weekly gain in commercial crude reserves amid record output. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.30 per barrel at 0023 GMT, down 15 cents, or 0.3 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA rose by 3.6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 23 to 450.49 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said this week. Production C-OUT-T-EIA remained at a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd). Crude reserves increased 6.4 billion barrels, or 19.5 percent, to 39.2 billion barrels at year-end 2017, marginally higher than the previous record of 39 billion barrels set in 1970, the EIA said. The surge in U.S. supply is part of an emerging oil glut following production increases also in Russia and by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), including from its two biggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The supply overhang has triggered a price slump of more than 30 percent in crude since early October. To rein in the glut, ANZ bank said on Friday that OPEC and its main partner Russia were “moving closer to an agreement around further production cuts”. OPEC and Russia will gather on Dec. 6 and 7 in Vienna to discuss output policy. Before that, the world’s top three producers - the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia - will be part of a meeting of the Group of 20 industrialised nations in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this weekend. “With fears over excessive supply and worries about falling demand the primary themes weighing on oil markets, the outlook for Brent Crude and WTI remains bearish,” said Lukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM.

2018-11-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - More than 40 percent of the world’s coal plants are operating at a loss due to high fuel costs and that proportion could to rise to nearly 75 percent by 2040, a report by environmental think-tank Carbon Tracker showed on Friday. Institutional investors are increasingly divesting from fossil fuel companies due to the risk their assets will become stranded as tougher emissions cut targets discourage their use and renewable energy becomes even cheaper.  London-based Carbon Tracker analysed the profitability of 6,685 coal plants around the world, representing 95 percent of operating capacity and 90 percent of capacity under construction. It found that 42 percent of global coal capacity is already unprofitable. From 2019 onwards, it expects falling renewable energy costs, air pollution regulations and carbon pricing to result in further cost pressures and make around 72 percent of the fleet cashflow negative by 2040.  In addition, by 2030, new wind and solar will be cheaper than continuing to operate 96 percent of today’s existing and planned coal plants, the report said. “Our analysis shows a least-cost power system without coal should be seen as an economic inevitability rather than a clean and green nicety,” said Sebastian Ljungwaldh, energy analyst at Carbon Tracker and co-author of the report. On Sunday, almost 195 countries will meet Katowice, Poland - one of the most polluted coal-mining regions in Europe - to agree on the rules for implementing a landmark deal to cut carbon emissions called the Paris Agreement. Efforts are underway across the world to curb global warming by using more renewable energy and burning less fossil fuels such as coal and oil to produce power but emissions are still rising. A U.N. report in October said the share of coal-fired power in the global energy mix would need to be cut to under 2 percent by 2050 to keep global temperature rises within safe limits. In several coal-reliant economies, governments will have to choose between closing plants; subsidising coal generation and power prices or increasing power prices to make coal viable, which will hurt consumers and undermine competitiveness, Carbon Tracker said. By phasing out coal globally by 2040, stranded asset risk worth $267 billion (209 billion pounds) could be avoided, the report added.
