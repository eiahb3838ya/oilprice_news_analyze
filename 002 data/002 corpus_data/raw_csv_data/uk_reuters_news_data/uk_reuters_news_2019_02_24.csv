2019-02-24,"MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan, Feb 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  As Pakistan faces worsening water scarcity - and trouble sourcing international cash for hydropower dams it says it needs - it has turned to an unlikely source of cash: A fundraising campaign backed by the country’s top court judges. Last year Mian Saqib Nisar - then the country’s chief supreme court judge - donated a million Pakistani rupees ($7,400) of his own money to start the drive, calling water shortages a major national threat. The drive aims to raise as much as a staggering $14 billion toward the cost of installing water reservoirs and other equipment for two major dams. Nisar retired in January from the court, but the current panel of top judges have taken over the push. Some politicians from government opposition parties have dismissed the effort, calling it inappropriate and doomed to fail. “Building dams is not the responsibility of the court,” said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, chairman of party Pakistan Peoples Party. But efforts to solicit donations from as far away as the United States and Britain, largely from expatriate Pakistanis, have raised $70 million as of mid-February toward the “Chief Justice Dam Fund”, according to the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s website. The country’s green-leaning Prime Minister Imran Khan backs the effort. “Water (scarcity) has been Pakistan’s number one issue and the country may face shortages by 2025 if dams are not built,” Khan warned in a state television address last September. He has urged Pakistanis living overseas to donate generously to the effort, comparing the battle to combat water scarcity to a holy war. “Pakistanis, do take part in this jihad,” the prime minister urged. Nisar has said he took up Pakistan’s water worries as a personal campaign after Syed Mehar Ali, commissioner of the country’s Indus water treaty, testified in a court hearing last July about worsening water scarcity risks in the country. Ali told the court that the country’s three western rivers - the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - carry nearly 140 million acre feet (MAF) of water but the country has water storage capacity for less than 14 MAF. Much of the water flowing down the river ends up in irrigation channels, but at least 29 MAF simply flows to sea, he said. Pakistan needs to store 25 MAF of water each year to help shore up water security, the commissioner said - and that would require a series of new large dams, he said. But building them has proved difficult. An effort to construct a large-scale hydropower dam in Gilgit Baltistan, a Kashmir border region disputed with India, for instance, has had trouble attracting multinational funding. The proposed Diamer Basha also has proved controversial within the country, facing opposition from some environmental and farmer groups. Development experts, as well, say charity won’t be enough to build the volume of dams Pakistan needs. Sardar Riaz Ahmed Khan, a former development secretary in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, said donations can give citizens a sense of ownership in solving the water crisis, but “it’s useless to say that dams will be built by contribution”. Muzammal Hussain, chairman of Pakista’s Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), however, has said work on the Daimer Basha dam, which could store more than 9 MAF of water and generate clean electricity, will begin in May. Initial work on a second, less controversial dam - the Mohmand, on the Swat River near Peshawar - started last month. Pakistan’s government has provided funding for acquisition of land for both projects. Dozens of farmers from Sindh province marched to Karachi last October to protest construction of the Diamer Basha dam on the Indus River. A leading organisation of fishermen also has objected to the dam, saying it will hurt their business. Salman Shah, a former Pakistani finace minister, said in a televised interview that completing the Diamer Basha dam could take more than 12 years as the dam site is mountainous and falls in an earthquake risk zone, necessitating strong and extra stable construction. But he believes that if the water storage dam can be built, international investors will come in to provide the infrastructure for power generation from the dam. “Energy generation is a good profit-earning source in Pakistan,” he said in the October interview.

2019-02-24,"DAKAR/FATICK, Senegal (Reuters) - Senegalese voters headed to the polls on Sunday for an election President Macky Sall is expected to win after strong economic growth in his first term, although rights groups criticise him for squeezing out rivals. Senegal’s small fish-exporting economy expanded more than 6 percent last year, one of the highest rates in Africa, driven by an ambitious reform and development plan that included the construction of a new railway. The 57-year-old told thousands gathered for his final rally in Dakar on Friday that he would deliver universal healthcare and better access to education in a second term. “Victory in the first round is inevitable,” Sall told a crowd earlier in the week. About 6.5 million people are registered to vote at polling stations that opened at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) and close at 6 p.m. Official results are due out on Friday with a run-off for the top two on March 24 if no one secures a majority. Opinion polls are banned in the run-up to the vote, but a survey by a Senegalese data company in November gave Sall 45 percent support. Of his four rivals now lined up in the smallest field of candidates since 1988, none had more than 16 percent. Despite Sall’s popularity, some citizens question whether a high-speed train, new motorways and a swanky conference centre will benefit average citizens in the former French colony of 15 million people where average income is less than $200 a month. Many people do not have reliable water or power supplies. Rights groups have criticised the exclusion of two popular candidates from the race in the West African nation that has long been viewed as the region’s most stable democracy. It has seen peaceful transitions of power since independence in 1960. Former mayor of Dakar, Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade, son of former President Abdoulaye Wade who was in power from 2000 to 2012, were barred from running due to corruption convictions. The former president himself said in a statement the vote was being rigged and told supporters of his son to boycott the poll. The government has dismissed the criticism, promising a free and fair vote. The remaining challengers are third-time contender and former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck, and Ousmane Sonko, a former tax inspector who is popular among the youth. Lawyer Madicke Niang and IT professor Issa Sall are also running.  Sonko told supporters at his final rally on Thursday that he would congratulate Sall if the vote was fair. “But if he steals the victory, I ask the youth to walk to the presidential palace and chase him out,” he said. At least one person was killed this month in clashes between Sall’s backers and his opponents in the southeastern city of Tambacounda, but campaigning has been largely peaceful.

2019-02-24,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran successfully tested a cruise missile on Sunday during naval exercises near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran’s state media reported, at a time of heightened tensions with the United States. Tehran has in the past threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route at the mouth of the Gulf, in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action, including attempts to halt Iranian oil exports through sanctions.  In August, Washington said Iran had test-fired a short-range anti-ship missile in the strait during naval drills it believed were intended as a warning following President Donald Trump’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. “On the third day of the ... exercises, a Ghadir-class Iranian navy submarine successfully launched a cruise missile,”  the official news agency IRNA reported. Iran’s other submarines, the Tareq and the new domestically built Fateh (Conqueror) have the same anti-ship capability, IRNA quoted a military statement as saying.   More than 100 vessels were taking part in the ongoing three-day war games in a vast area stretching from the Strait of Hormuz to the Indian Ocean, state media reported. Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme last May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.  Iran’s expansion of its missile programme, particularly its ballistic missiles, has been met with expressions of concern by the United States and European countries. Tehran says the programme provides deterrent capabilities and is defensive. The USS John C. Stennis entered the Gulf in December, ending a long absence of U.S. aircraft carriers in the waterway. Western experts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities, although there are concerns about its long-range ballistic missiles.

2019-02-24,"(Repeats story, text unchanged) * Northwest Nigeria has highest number of voters * Buhari secured 90 percent of vote in regional hub Kano in 2015 By Aaron Ross KANO,  Feb 23 (Reuters) - Sunday Nicholas voted for Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria’s 2015 presidential election, but the 32-year-old factory worker in the northern city of Kano was casting his ballot on Saturday for the president’s challenger, Atiku Abubakar. “Most of the (workers) cannot feed their families,” Nicholas said as he queued in a dusty schoolyard to vote. People are suffering, he said. “There is no improvement.” If Buhari is turfed out of office when the results are tallied this week a major cause is likely to be defections by voters in the northwest, once Buhari’s most important electoral stronghold, where anger over a feeble economy and disaffection from local bigwigs has loosened his grip. A quarter of Nigeria’s nearly 73 million eligible voters are in the northwest, the country’s most densely-populated region. Buhari received nearly 90 percent of Kano state’s vote in 2015, running up a 1.7 million vote edge that accounted for more than half of his final margin of victory over then-president Goodluck Jonathan. But he faces stiffer headwinds this time around. Many voters are dissatisfied with an economy still sputtering after a 2016 recession. And his main opponent Atiku is also a northern Muslim rather than a southern Christian like Jonathan. Atiku stands to benefit from the support of influential local powerbrokers who have rallied behind the opposition candidate after falling out with Buhari and his allies. The most important among them, Rabiu Kwankwaso, is a senator, two-time governor of Kano State and so-called “godfather”, a term for local Nigerian kingmakers who draw their influence from elaborate patronage networks. The 62-year-old Kwankwaso has a loyal core of supporters known as “Kwankwasiyya” who are readily identifiable by their woven red caps. He quit Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) last year amid a wave of defections to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). In a sign of Kano’s newfound battleground status, Kwankwasiyya members on their way to a rally outside Kano city clashed with APC members on Thursday, leading to several injuries and torched vehicles. Each side blamed the other. PDP officials say Atiku could net as much as 40 or even 50 percent of the vote in Kano State. APC supporters dismiss that, although they concede that Atiku will make some inroads. “It will not be like what happened in 2015,” said Baballe Hayatu, 40, an actor in the local film industry, who was waiting to vote for Buhari. “There was this security challenge so everyone was desperate in 2015,” he said, referring to surging violence by militant group Boko Haram at the time that fed widespread rejection of Jonathan. But even if his four years in office have taken some of the lustre off Buhari, he remains popular in Kano, perceived by many as an incorruptible foe of the rampant graft that has plagued Nigerian politics for decades. “He’s an honest man. He’s a correct leader,” said Zainab Habib Haruna, 32, a teacher.

2019-02-24,"URENA, Venezuela/CUCUTA, Colombia (Reuters) - Troops loyal to President Nicolas Maduro violently drove back foreign aid convoys from Venezuela’s border on Saturday, killing two protesters and prompting opposition leader Juan Guaido to propose that Washington consider “all options” to oust him. Trucks laden with U.S. food and medicine returned to warehouses in Colombia after opposition supporters failed to break through lines of troops, who dispersed them with tear gas and rubber rounds, injuring dozens. Witnesses said masked men in civilian clothes also shot at protesters with live bullets. “Today’s events force me to make a decision: to formally propose to the international community that we must have all options open to secure the freedom of our country,” Guaido said on Twitter. The United States has been the top foreign backer of Guaido, who invoked Venezuela’s constitution to assume an interim presidency last month and is now recognised by most Western nations as the OPEC nation’s legitimate leader.  President Donald Trump has in the past said military intervention in Venezuela was “an option”, though Guaido made no reference to it on Saturday. Guaido had given a personal send-off to one convoy carrying aid from the Colombian city of Cucuta on Saturday. The opposition had hoped Venezuelan soldiers would baulk at turning back supplies desperately needed in the country, where a growing number of its 30 million people suffer from malnutrition and treatable diseases.  But while some 60 members of the security forces defected on Saturday, according to Colombian authorities, the lines of National Guard soldiers at the frontier crossings held firm, firing tear gas at the convoys. At the Urena border point, two aid trucks caught fire,  sending plumes of dark smoke into the air as crowds raced to try to save the boxes of supplies, a Reuters witness said. Guaido said he would keep demanding Maduro let the aid in and would seek other routes. He said he would attend a meeting of the regional Lima Group of nations in Bogota on Monday with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during which they would decide more actions to ramp up pressure on Maduro. “Today the world saw in minutes, in hours, the worst face of the Venezuelan dictatorship,” Guaido said at an earlier news conference in Colombia, alongside Colombian President Ivan Duque. Angered by Duque’s support for Guaido, Maduro said he was breaking diplomatic relations with Bogota and gave its diplomatic staff 24 hours to leave the country.  Maduro denies his oil-rich nation has any need of aid and accuses Guaido of being a coup-mongering puppet for U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington has warned it could seek to impose tough new sanctions on Venezuela at Monday’s summit if Maduro blocked the aid shipments. “What do the Venezuelan people think of Donald Trump’s threats? Get your hands off Venezuela. Yankee go home,” Maduro told a rally of red-shirted, flag-waving supporters in the capital, Caracas. “He is sending us rotten food, thank you!” Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton said on Twitter that countries still supporting Maduro “should take note of what they are endorsing”, in a thinly veiled rebuke to China and Russia.  In the Venezuelan border towns of San Antonio and Urena, troops fired rubber rounds at opposition supporters, including lawmakers, who walked towards the frontier waving Venezuelan flags and chanting “Freedom”. Reuters television images from San Antonio showed a dozen men on motorbikes, dressed in black and wearing balaclavas, firing shotguns and pistols at a crowd. Demonstrators in Urena barricaded streets with burning tires, set a bus alight and hurled stones at troops to demand that Maduro allow aid into a country ravaged by a meltdown that has halved the size of the economy in five years. “They started shooting at close range as if we were criminals,” said shopkeeper Vladimir Gomez, 27, wearing a white shirt stained with blood. At least six of about a dozen trucks that tried to reach Venezuela later returned to Cucuta, where Colombia’s disaster management agency said they would be unloaded and the aid stored until Guaido requested their use again. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said he ordered a Puerto Rican ship carrying humanitarian aid to turn back after a Venezuelan navy ship threatened to open fire on it. “This is unacceptable and shameful,” Rossello said in a statement. “We have also notified our partners in the U.S. government about this serious incident.”  A Reuters witness said two aid trucks crossed the Brazilian border but not the Venezuelan customs checkpoint. In the southern town of Santa Elena de Uairen at least two people were killed in clashes with security forces, according to a doctor at the hospital where they were treated. On Friday, a married couple in a nearby indigenous community was shot dead by security forces. Rights group Penal Forum said it recorded 29 injuries from bullet wounds and two deaths across Venezuela in clashes with troops on Saturday. Colombian authorities said they registered 285 people injured, including those affected by tear gas. “I’m a homemaker and I’m here fighting for my family, for my children and parents, resisting the military’s tear gas,” said opposition protester Sobeida Monsalve, 42, in Urena. Guaido had appealed to Venezuela’s armed forces to stand aside and allow aid in, promising amnesty to officers who disavowed Maduro. Dozens of soldiers, whose families suffer the same shortages as other Venezuelans, took up his offer. “You don’t owe any obedience to someone who sadistically celebrates that the humanitarian aid doesn’t enter a country that needs it,” Guaido said. A social media video showed troops who abandoned their post driving armoured vehicles across a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia, knocking over metal barricades, and then jumping out of the vehicles and running to the Colombian side. “What we did today, we did for our families, for the Venezuelan people,” one of the defectors said in a video televised by a Colombian news program. Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party calls Guaido’s aid effort a veiled invasion backed by Washington and insists that the United States should instead help Venezuela by lifting crippling financial and oil sector sanctions.  On Saturday, Maduro turned his ire on Colombia and said Duque was letting its territory be used for attacks against Venezuela.  “For that reason, I have decided to break all political and diplomatic relations with Colombia’s fascist government,” he told cheering supporters. Thousands of white-clad protesters gathered outside a military base in Caracas to demand that the armed forces allow in the aid. “This is the biggest battle that the armed forces can win,” said Sheyla Salas, 48, who works in advertising. “Please join this struggle, get on the right side of history, allow the humanitarian aid to enter.” Reporting by Nelson Bocanegra, Anggy Polanco, Mayela Armas and Steven Grattan; Additional reporting by Helen Murphy and Julia Symmes Cobb in Bogota, Anthony Boadle in Brasilia, Ricardo Moraes in Pacaraima, and Angus Berwick in Caracas; Writing by Brian Ellsworth and Angus Berwick; Editing by Daniel Flynn, Grant McCool and Daniel Wallis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics/update-8-venezuelas-guaido-says-all-options-open-after-maduro-blocks-aid-idUKL1N20I046,2019-02-24,"Troops

On Saturday, troops loyal to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blocked convoys of U.S. humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia to Venezuela, using teargas and rubber bullets and killing two protesters. The violence could lead the United States to impose new sanctions as early as Monday to cut off the Maduro’s government access to revenues. Pence is traveling to the Colombian capital Bogota to meet with the Lima Group of regional leaders who recognize Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after Maduro held elections last year which were dismissed as fraudulent. A senior U.S. official told reporters on Friday that Pence would be prepared to announce new sanctions at the meeting if the aid was turned back, - adding to pressure from sanctions on state-owned oil company PDVSA. “If there is any type of violence, or if there is any type of negative reaction from the hierarchy of the Venezuela armed forces, there may also be measures that are announced by the vice president and other countries in regards to closing even further the international financial circle,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States and allies are looking at ways to expel family members of Venezuelan military officials who are living outside the country, including some in south Florida, the official said. Maduro has denied there are shortages of food and medicine in Venezuela, and says the aid is aimed at undermining his government.

2019-02-24,"MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan, Feb 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  As Pakistan faces worsening water scarcity - and trouble sourcing international cash for hydropower dams it says it needs - it has turned to an unlikely source of cash: A fundraising campaign backed by the country’s top court judges. Last year Mian Saqib Nisar - then the country’s chief supreme court judge - donated a million Pakistani rupees ($7,400) of his own money to start the drive, calling water shortages a major national threat. The drive aims to raise as much as a staggering $14 billion toward the cost of installing water reservoirs and other equipment for two major dams. Nisar retired in January from the court, but the current panel of top judges have taken over the push. Some politicians from government opposition parties have dismissed the effort, calling it inappropriate and doomed to fail. “Building dams is not the responsibility of the court,” said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, chairman of party Pakistan Peoples Party. But efforts to solicit donations from as far away as the United States and Britain, largely from expatriate Pakistanis, have raised $70 million as of mid-February toward the “Chief Justice Dam Fund”, according to the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s website. The country’s green-leaning Prime Minister Imran Khan backs the effort. “Water (scarcity) has been Pakistan’s number one issue and the country may face shortages by 2025 if dams are not built,” Khan warned in a state television address last September. He has urged Pakistanis living overseas to donate generously to the effort, comparing the battle to combat water scarcity to a holy war. “Pakistanis, do take part in this jihad,” the prime minister urged. Nisar has said he took up Pakistan’s water worries as a personal campaign after Syed Mehar Ali, commissioner of the country’s Indus water treaty, testified in a court hearing last July about worsening water scarcity risks in the country. Ali told the court that the country’s three western rivers - the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - carry nearly 140 million acre feet (MAF) of water but the country has water storage capacity for less than 14 MAF. Much of the water flowing down the river ends up in irrigation channels, but at least 29 MAF simply flows to sea, he said. Pakistan needs to store 25 MAF of water each year to help shore up water security, the commissioner said - and that would require a series of new large dams, he said. But building them has proved difficult. An effort to construct a large-scale hydropower dam in Gilgit Baltistan, a Kashmir border region disputed with India, for instance, has had trouble attracting multinational funding. The proposed Diamer Basha also has proved controversial within the country, facing opposition from some environmental and farmer groups. Development experts, as well, say charity won’t be enough to build the volume of dams Pakistan needs. Sardar Riaz Ahmed Khan, a former development secretary in Pakistani-administered Kashmir, said donations can give citizens a sense of ownership in solving the water crisis, but “it’s useless to say that dams will be built by contribution”. Muzammal Hussain, chairman of Pakista’s Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), however, has said work on the Daimer Basha dam, which could store more than 9 MAF of water and generate clean electricity, will begin in May. Initial work on a second, less controversial dam - the Mohmand, on the Swat River near Peshawar - started last month. Pakistan’s government has provided funding for acquisition of land for both projects. Dozens of farmers from Sindh province marched to Karachi last October to protest construction of the Diamer Basha dam on the Indus River. A leading organisation of fishermen also has objected to the dam, saying it will hurt their business. Salman Shah, a former Pakistani finace minister, said in a televised interview that completing the Diamer Basha dam could take more than 12 years as the dam site is mountainous and falls in an earthquake risk zone, necessitating strong and extra stable construction. But he believes that if the water storage dam can be built, international investors will come in to provide the infrastructure for power generation from the dam. “Energy generation is a good profit-earning source in Pakistan,” he said in the October interview.

2019-02-24,"DAKAR/FATICK, Senegal (Reuters) - Senegalese voters headed to the polls on Sunday for an election President Macky Sall is expected to win after strong economic growth in his first term, although rights groups criticise him for squeezing out rivals. Senegal’s small fish-exporting economy expanded more than 6 percent last year, one of the highest rates in Africa, driven by an ambitious reform and development plan that included the construction of a new railway. The 57-year-old told thousands gathered for his final rally in Dakar on Friday that he would deliver universal healthcare and better access to education in a second term. “Victory in the first round is inevitable,” Sall told a crowd earlier in the week. About 6.5 million people are registered to vote at polling stations that opened at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) and close at 6 p.m. Official results are due out on Friday with a run-off for the top two on March 24 if no one secures a majority. Opinion polls are banned in the run-up to the vote, but a survey by a Senegalese data company in November gave Sall 45 percent support. Of his four rivals now lined up in the smallest field of candidates since 1988, none had more than 16 percent. Despite Sall’s popularity, some citizens question whether a high-speed train, new motorways and a swanky conference centre will benefit average citizens in the former French colony of 15 million people where average income is less than $200 a month. Many people do not have reliable water or power supplies. Rights groups have criticised the exclusion of two popular candidates from the race in the West African nation that has long been viewed as the region’s most stable democracy. It has seen peaceful transitions of power since independence in 1960. Former mayor of Dakar, Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade, son of former President Abdoulaye Wade who was in power from 2000 to 2012, were barred from running due to corruption convictions. The former president himself said in a statement the vote was being rigged and told supporters of his son to boycott the poll. The government has dismissed the criticism, promising a free and fair vote. The remaining challengers are third-time contender and former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck, and Ousmane Sonko, a former tax inspector who is popular among the youth. Lawyer Madicke Niang and IT professor Issa Sall are also running.  Sonko told supporters at his final rally on Thursday that he would congratulate Sall if the vote was fair. “But if he steals the victory, I ask the youth to walk to the presidential palace and chase him out,” he said. At least one person was killed this month in clashes between Sall’s backers and his opponents in the southeastern city of Tambacounda, but campaigning has been largely peaceful.

2019-02-24,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran successfully tested a cruise missile on Sunday during naval exercises near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran’s state media reported, at a time of heightened tensions with the United States. Tehran has in the past threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route at the mouth of the Gulf, in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action, including attempts to halt Iranian oil exports through sanctions.  In August, Washington said Iran had test-fired a short-range anti-ship missile in the strait during naval drills it believed were intended as a warning following President Donald Trump’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. “On the third day of the ... exercises, a Ghadir-class Iranian navy submarine successfully launched a cruise missile,”  the official news agency IRNA reported. Iran’s other submarines, the Tareq and the new domestically built Fateh (Conqueror) have the same anti-ship capability, IRNA quoted a military statement as saying.   More than 100 vessels were taking part in the ongoing three-day war games in a vast area stretching from the Strait of Hormuz to the Indian Ocean, state media reported. Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme last May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.  Iran’s expansion of its missile programme, particularly its ballistic missiles, has been met with expressions of concern by the United States and European countries. Tehran says the programme provides deterrent capabilities and is defensive. The USS John C. Stennis entered the Gulf in December, ending a long absence of U.S. aircraft carriers in the waterway. Western experts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities, although there are concerns about its long-range ballistic missiles.

2019-02-24,"(Repeats story, text unchanged) * Northwest Nigeria has highest number of voters * Buhari secured 90 percent of vote in regional hub Kano in 2015 By Aaron Ross KANO,  Feb 23 (Reuters) - Sunday Nicholas voted for Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria’s 2015 presidential election, but the 32-year-old factory worker in the northern city of Kano was casting his ballot on Saturday for the president’s challenger, Atiku Abubakar. “Most of the (workers) cannot feed their families,” Nicholas said as he queued in a dusty schoolyard to vote. People are suffering, he said. “There is no improvement.” If Buhari is turfed out of office when the results are tallied this week a major cause is likely to be defections by voters in the northwest, once Buhari’s most important electoral stronghold, where anger over a feeble economy and disaffection from local bigwigs has loosened his grip. A quarter of Nigeria’s nearly 73 million eligible voters are in the northwest, the country’s most densely-populated region. Buhari received nearly 90 percent of Kano state’s vote in 2015, running up a 1.7 million vote edge that accounted for more than half of his final margin of victory over then-president Goodluck Jonathan. But he faces stiffer headwinds this time around. Many voters are dissatisfied with an economy still sputtering after a 2016 recession. And his main opponent Atiku is also a northern Muslim rather than a southern Christian like Jonathan. Atiku stands to benefit from the support of influential local powerbrokers who have rallied behind the opposition candidate after falling out with Buhari and his allies. The most important among them, Rabiu Kwankwaso, is a senator, two-time governor of Kano State and so-called “godfather”, a term for local Nigerian kingmakers who draw their influence from elaborate patronage networks. The 62-year-old Kwankwaso has a loyal core of supporters known as “Kwankwasiyya” who are readily identifiable by their woven red caps. He quit Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) last year amid a wave of defections to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). In a sign of Kano’s newfound battleground status, Kwankwasiyya members on their way to a rally outside Kano city clashed with APC members on Thursday, leading to several injuries and torched vehicles. Each side blamed the other. PDP officials say Atiku could net as much as 40 or even 50 percent of the vote in Kano State. APC supporters dismiss that, although they concede that Atiku will make some inroads. “It will not be like what happened in 2015,” said Baballe Hayatu, 40, an actor in the local film industry, who was waiting to vote for Buhari. “There was this security challenge so everyone was desperate in 2015,” he said, referring to surging violence by militant group Boko Haram at the time that fed widespread rejection of Jonathan. But even if his four years in office have taken some of the lustre off Buhari, he remains popular in Kano, perceived by many as an incorruptible foe of the rampant graft that has plagued Nigerian politics for decades. “He’s an honest man. He’s a correct leader,” said Zainab Habib Haruna, 32, a teacher.

2019-02-24,"URENA, Venezuela/CUCUTA, Colombia (Reuters) - Troops loyal to President Nicolas Maduro violently drove back foreign aid convoys from Venezuela’s border on Saturday, killing two protesters and prompting opposition leader Juan Guaido to propose that Washington consider “all options” to oust him. Trucks laden with U.S. food and medicine returned to warehouses in Colombia after opposition supporters failed to break through lines of troops, who dispersed them with tear gas and rubber rounds, injuring dozens. Witnesses said masked men in civilian clothes also shot at protesters with live bullets. “Today’s events force me to make a decision: to formally propose to the international community that we must have all options open to secure the freedom of our country,” Guaido said on Twitter. The United States has been the top foreign backer of Guaido, who invoked Venezuela’s constitution to assume an interim presidency last month and is now recognised by most Western nations as the OPEC nation’s legitimate leader.  President Donald Trump has in the past said military intervention in Venezuela was “an option”, though Guaido made no reference to it on Saturday. Guaido had given a personal send-off to one convoy carrying aid from the Colombian city of Cucuta on Saturday. The opposition had hoped Venezuelan soldiers would baulk at turning back supplies desperately needed in the country, where a growing number of its 30 million people suffer from malnutrition and treatable diseases.  But while some 60 members of the security forces defected on Saturday, according to Colombian authorities, the lines of National Guard soldiers at the frontier crossings held firm, firing tear gas at the convoys. At the Urena border point, two aid trucks caught fire,  sending plumes of dark smoke into the air as crowds raced to try to save the boxes of supplies, a Reuters witness said. Guaido said he would keep demanding Maduro let the aid in and would seek other routes. He said he would attend a meeting of the regional Lima Group of nations in Bogota on Monday with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during which they would decide more actions to ramp up pressure on Maduro. “Today the world saw in minutes, in hours, the worst face of the Venezuelan dictatorship,” Guaido said at an earlier news conference in Colombia, alongside Colombian President Ivan Duque. Angered by Duque’s support for Guaido, Maduro said he was breaking diplomatic relations with Bogota and gave its diplomatic staff 24 hours to leave the country.  Maduro denies his oil-rich nation has any need of aid and accuses Guaido of being a coup-mongering puppet for U.S. President Donald Trump. Washington has warned it could seek to impose tough new sanctions on Venezuela at Monday’s summit if Maduro blocked the aid shipments. “What do the Venezuelan people think of Donald Trump’s threats? Get your hands off Venezuela. Yankee go home,” Maduro told a rally of red-shirted, flag-waving supporters in the capital, Caracas. “He is sending us rotten food, thank you!” Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton said on Twitter that countries still supporting Maduro “should take note of what they are endorsing”, in a thinly veiled rebuke to China and Russia.  In the Venezuelan border towns of San Antonio and Urena, troops fired rubber rounds at opposition supporters, including lawmakers, who walked towards the frontier waving Venezuelan flags and chanting “Freedom”. Reuters television images from San Antonio showed a dozen men on motorbikes, dressed in black and wearing balaclavas, firing shotguns and pistols at a crowd. Demonstrators in Urena barricaded streets with burning tires, set a bus alight and hurled stones at troops to demand that Maduro allow aid into a country ravaged by a meltdown that has halved the size of the economy in five years. “They started shooting at close range as if we were criminals,” said shopkeeper Vladimir Gomez, 27, wearing a white shirt stained with blood. At least six of about a dozen trucks that tried to reach Venezuela later returned to Cucuta, where Colombia’s disaster management agency said they would be unloaded and the aid stored until Guaido requested their use again. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said he ordered a Puerto Rican ship carrying humanitarian aid to turn back after a Venezuelan navy ship threatened to open fire on it. “This is unacceptable and shameful,” Rossello said in a statement. “We have also notified our partners in the U.S. government about this serious incident.”  A Reuters witness said two aid trucks crossed the Brazilian border but not the Venezuelan customs checkpoint. In the southern town of Santa Elena de Uairen at least two people were killed in clashes with security forces, according to a doctor at the hospital where they were treated. On Friday, a married couple in a nearby indigenous community was shot dead by security forces. Rights group Penal Forum said it recorded 29 injuries from bullet wounds and two deaths across Venezuela in clashes with troops on Saturday. Colombian authorities said they registered 285 people injured, including those affected by tear gas. “I’m a homemaker and I’m here fighting for my family, for my children and parents, resisting the military’s tear gas,” said opposition protester Sobeida Monsalve, 42, in Urena. Guaido had appealed to Venezuela’s armed forces to stand aside and allow aid in, promising amnesty to officers who disavowed Maduro. Dozens of soldiers, whose families suffer the same shortages as other Venezuelans, took up his offer. “You don’t owe any obedience to someone who sadistically celebrates that the humanitarian aid doesn’t enter a country that needs it,” Guaido said. A social media video showed troops who abandoned their post driving armoured vehicles across a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia, knocking over metal barricades, and then jumping out of the vehicles and running to the Colombian side. “What we did today, we did for our families, for the Venezuelan people,” one of the defectors said in a video televised by a Colombian news program. Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party calls Guaido’s aid effort a veiled invasion backed by Washington and insists that the United States should instead help Venezuela by lifting crippling financial and oil sector sanctions.  On Saturday, Maduro turned his ire on Colombia and said Duque was letting its territory be used for attacks against Venezuela.  “For that reason, I have decided to break all political and diplomatic relations with Colombia’s fascist government,” he told cheering supporters. Thousands of white-clad protesters gathered outside a military base in Caracas to demand that the armed forces allow in the aid. “This is the biggest battle that the armed forces can win,” said Sheyla Salas, 48, who works in advertising. “Please join this struggle, get on the right side of history, allow the humanitarian aid to enter.” Reporting by Nelson Bocanegra, Anggy Polanco, Mayela Armas and Steven Grattan; Additional reporting by Helen Murphy and Julia Symmes Cobb in Bogota, Anthony Boadle in Brasilia, Ricardo Moraes in Pacaraima, and Angus Berwick in Caracas; Writing by Brian Ellsworth and Angus Berwick; Editing by Daniel Flynn, Grant McCool and Daniel Wallis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics/update-8-venezuelas-guaido-says-all-options-open-after-maduro-blocks-aid-idUKL1N20I046,2019-02-24,"Troops

On Saturday, troops loyal to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blocked convoys of U.S. humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia to Venezuela, using teargas and rubber bullets and killing two protesters. The violence could lead the United States to impose new sanctions as early as Monday to cut off the Maduro’s government access to revenues. Pence is traveling to the Colombian capital Bogota to meet with the Lima Group of regional leaders who recognize Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after Maduro held elections last year which were dismissed as fraudulent. A senior U.S. official told reporters on Friday that Pence would be prepared to announce new sanctions at the meeting if the aid was turned back, - adding to pressure from sanctions on state-owned oil company PDVSA. “If there is any type of violence, or if there is any type of negative reaction from the hierarchy of the Venezuela armed forces, there may also be measures that are announced by the vice president and other countries in regards to closing even further the international financial circle,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States and allies are looking at ways to expel family members of Venezuelan military officials who are living outside the country, including some in south Florida, the official said. Maduro has denied there are shortages of food and medicine in Venezuela, and says the aid is aimed at undermining his government. Pence spoke to Guaido by phone in January before the opposition leader, who heads Venezuela’s national assembly, swore himself in as interim president.
