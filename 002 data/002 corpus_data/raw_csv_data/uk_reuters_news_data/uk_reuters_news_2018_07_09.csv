2018-07-09,"OSLO, July 10 (Reuters) - Wage talks between hundreds of workers on Norwegian oil and gas offshore rigs and their employers went into overtime on Tuesday, and could lead to a strike if they fail. A state-appointed mediation between trade unions Safe and YS and employers’ organisation the Shipowners’ Association passed a midnight deadline. Some 669 workers could walk out from Tuesday and could potentially increase to 2,250 workers if the conflict is not resolved. Trade union Safe said it would initially take out 106 workers from the Teekay Petrojarl production ship operating at Shell’s Knarr field, which had a daily production of 63,000 barrels of oil, according to Teekay’s website. Safe would also take out workers on drilling rigs that conduct exploration or production drilling for oil firms, including 117 workers from the Transocean Spitsbergen; 80 workers from the Songa Offshore Enabler; 71 workers from Odfjell Drilling’s Deepsea Stavanger and 60 workers from North Atlantic Drilling’s West Elara, among others.

2018-07-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - California is ready to work with major automakers on revisions to greenhouse gas emission vehicle rules through 2025 and sees a “window” for a deal in the coming months, the state’s top clean air regulator told Reuters on Monday. Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in an interview on Monday that agreements with the federal government or automakers could be struck in the coming months as the state pursues its own changes to fuel economy standards through 2025. “If the car companies want to come and talk to us, they will,” Nichols said. California’s effort could potentially putting pressure on the Trump administration to back a compromise instead of its own plans to rollback federal vehicle emissions rules.  “I feel like there is enough at stake here for the (auto) industry that we may be able to get the federal government to back off on the extreme proposals that they have made,” Nichols said.  The U.S. Transportation Department in May submitted a proposal to the White House recommending freezing fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through 2026 and would bar California from setting stricter standards than the federal government. That proposal, developed in tandem with the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to be made public as early as next week. California has vowed to fight a federal freeze in court, which could leave automakers in regulatory limbo for years as litigation grinds through the courts. “There is also the possibility of this all getting settled amicably and there is really a window of time to do that,” Nichols said. She suggested the time frame between August, when the state proposes changes to its rules, and sometime in September, when the federal government closes a 60-day public comment period on its proposal.  The current federal rules, negotiated with automakers by former President Barack Obama’s administration in 2011, aimed to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles per gallon by 2025 and they included significant annual increases in automaker requirements. Automakers now want changes, citing lower gasoline prices and a shift in consumer preferences to larger vehicles. California agreed to adopt the Obama administration’s fuel rules in 2011, but can insist automakers follow tougher rules if the Trump administration weakens requirements, Nichols said. Nichols said California plans to propose changes to its rules through 2025 in mid-August and the state may propose ways to make it easier for automakers to comply. Nichols said the state has been at “a bit of an impasse” with the Trump administration, which has not held substantive talks with California, she said. California and 16 other states in May filed suit to challenge the administration’s decision to reconsider the vehicle efficiency rules. Gloria Bergquist, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp and others, said Monday “automakers believe one national program is better for our customers, who don’t want to face higher vehicle prices from redundant, duplicative government regulations, so we urge the federal government and California to come to an agreement.” Nichols said automakers should get involved if they want to strike a deal to avoid years of litigation. “The non-U.S. based companies are mostly hiding under their desks at the moment waiting for something to happen,” Nichols said. Federal regulators have declined to comment on their proposal until it is made public. The U.S. Transportation Department and Environmental Protection Agency did not immediately comment.

The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.86 percent. Wall Street notched a third straight day of gains as the market looked past the tit-for-tat trade battle under way between Washington and Beijing.

2018-07-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices gained on Monday, with U.S. crude ending a choppy session higher on expectations for a Canadian production outage lasting until September, while global benchmark Brent gained on looming sanctions on Iran and falling output in Libya.  U.S. light crude futures gained 5 cents to settle at $73.85 a barrel. Brent jumped 96 cents at $78.07.  “We continue to see the oil market supported, with growing concern on sanctions on Iran now that the European and Korean refiners reduced their purchases to virtually zero,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.  The United States says it wants to reduce oil exports from Iran, the world’s fifth-biggest producer, to zero by November, which would oblige other big producers to pump more. “There is concern that the Saudi and Russian increases in production might now be nearly enough to offset - not just Iranian production- but also supply disruptions that we’re seeing from Libya, Nigeria and Canada,” said Lipow.  In Canada, an outage at the 360,000-bpd Syncrude oil sands facility has reduced flows into Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. futures.  Majority stakeholder Suncor Energy Inc  said on Monday that some Syncrude production would come back online in July, sooner than expected. It will not resume full operations until September, however, which is later than expected. Monday’s updated timeline on the restart added a jolt of volatility into U.S. crude trading, said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. Inventories at Cushing hit a three-and-a-half-year low last week. [EIA/S] Meanwhile, money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude in the week to July 3, the U.S. Commodity Trading Commission said on Monday. Concerns over falling production in Libya have also buoyed prices.  Libyan oil output has more than halved in five months, falling to 527,000 barrels per day, the head of the National Oil Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla, said on Monday. “Tomorrow it will be less and the day after tomorrow less again. And we are going lower,” Sanalla said. Saudi Arabia, fellow members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia agreed last month to increase output to dampen price gains and offset global production losses in countries including Libya.  The market has grown concerned that if the Saudis offset the losses from Iran, it will use up global spare capacity and leave markets more vulnerable to further or unexpected production declines.

2018-07-09,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Europe’s power grid operators group said on Monday it had started a compensation scheme to limit a frequency deviation originating from a power grid row between Serbia and its former province Kosovo, which has again slowed some of Europe’s clocks. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), grouping 43 grid operators from 26 countries, said digital clocks across Europe that use mains frequency to keep time, such as those on microwaves and clock radios, have fallen behind by one minute due to a drop in frequency on continental Europe’s transmission network. The body urged Serbia and Kosovo to quickly resolve the problem, which earlier this year slowed those clocks by as much as six minutes. With the warmer weather in Europe, power demand across the continent could rise and the frequency deviation may widen. “Drops of frequency happen and solidarity mechanisms exist but the Kosovo-Serbia issue is new,” ENTSO-E spokeswoman Claire Camus said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters, calling it a political issue that demanded a political solution. Camus said the compensation scheme launched by continental European transmission system operators would limit the delay to below 60 seconds. “If it is proven that there is deliberate unwillingness from both parties to solve the situation, sanctions can be looked at but so far there is no such proof,” she added. To lessen the impact on consumers, European grid operators agreed in March to inject missing electricity into the joint network and to restore the frequency. But the operators agreed they would not tolerate a grid time deviation of more than 60 seconds. EMS blamed Kosovo for “withdrawing in an unauthorised manner uncontracted electricity” from the synchronised European grid. “EMS will remain in contact with ENTSO-E seeking a solution to the problem,” EMS said, adding that prior to any decision about possible sanctions all the facts and responsibility had to established.  Kosovan grid operator KOSTT was not available to comment. It aims to become an ENTSO-E member but Serbia has been obstructing these efforts. The dispute over regulatory issues and grid operation is further complicated by Belgrade’s refusal to recognise Kosovo, which seceded from Serbia in 2008. Some 40,000 Serbs in the north of Kosovo do not pay their electricity bills to the Kosovo authorities. Their bills used to be paid by the rest of Kosovo’s population until the country’s energy regulator ended that practice, leaving its grid operator KOSTT without the financial means to buy the energy needed to cover usage in the north. Because this energy is not injected in the interconnected continental European system, frequency drops slightly, creating a grid time deviation. The European Union is mediating in the dispute, which includes the implementation of the connection agreement between KOSTT and continental Europe, Camus said. But the Serbian authorities set as a pre-condition the creation of an association of Serb municipalities in Kosovo and this is not acceptable to the Kosovo authorities, she added.

2018-07-09,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s president-elect, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said on Monday that fuel prices would begin to come down in three years, once domestic fuel output starts to rise thanks to refinery improvements and a planned new refinery.  Lopez Obrador, who won by a landslide in the July 1 election and takes office on Dec. 1, said in a press conference after meeting with industry leaders that there would be no sharp rises in fuel prices during the first half of his six-year term, and that they would rise only in line with inflation.  “After three years, by which time we will have fuel production in Mexico - because we’re going to rehabilitate the six refineries and build one so we can stop buying fuel abroad - we will have lowered prices,” he said.  Lopez Obrador has long criticized a broad energy sector overhaul pushed through Congress by current President Enrique Pena Nieto, but has toned down attacks in recent months. Pena Nieto’s popularity suffered a big hit after a sharp fuel price rise in January 2017.  During the campaign, Lopez Obrador said he would lower fuel prices as soon as he reached power, but later said he would not undertake any “real price” rises. He has also said he wants to build two new refineries but might settle for just one.  Mexico’s six refineries, which are owned by state-oil firm Pemex, are operating at 43 percent capacity, while crude production has fallen to 1.9 million barrels per day, well below the 3.4 million bpd reached in 2004.  Mexico also imports 65 percent of its gasoline needs and 60 percent of the diesel consumed in the country.  Lopez Obrador said on Monday that “there won’t be any above-inflation rises in gas, diesel and electric power prices.” He added that “the aim” of his administration is to reach 4 percent growth.

2018-07-09,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Netherlands said on Monday it was monitoring fuel trading more closely after discovering inadequate reporting of toxicity levels in fuel mixed and stored in European Union ports and bound for West Africa. The Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT) said it was conducting six criminal inquiries into trading in fuel exported to West African countries, where quality standards are lower. It did not give details of the inquiries. The U.N. environment agency, which has been pushing West African nations to toughen fuel quality rules, welcomed the report and said “shipping of dirty fuels to West Africa has been nothing short of an environmental and public health scandal.” In a 47-page report on the trade, the Dutch regulator said: “Gasoline and diesel may contain more carcinogenic and toxic substances than in the EU ... They use low-quality and unhealthy blend stocks when blending diesel and gasoline for West Africa.” “Since accurate track is not kept of what is added to the blends, heavy fuel oil may be produced that represents an unknown risk to people and the environment when stored, transshipped or burnt in vessel engines,” it said, adding that it would increase spot checks of fuel mixed in the Netherlands. The regulator, which monitors trading in the capital Amsterdam and Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest fuel bunkering hub and the third biggest in the world, said the practice violated European rules for chemicals and, in some cases, the EU’s Waste Act. Each year, roughly 10 billion liters of blended car fuel and 10 million tonnes of heavy shipping fuel oil, are mixed and transported out of the Dutch ports. In its recent checks, ILT said it had found heavy fuel and automotive fuel blends with toxic chemicals that exceeded levels accepted for use in vehicles in the EU, exposing the gap between European rules and those in West Africa. ILT spokeswoman Lianne Sleutjes said six criminal inquiries have been launched that would examine the supply chain. She did not elaborate. The report, which did not name any businesses involved in any wrongdoing, said gasoline blends that were being investigated “contain manganese, a substance that is prohibited in Europe.” “This means that the product is carcinogenic to a higher degree and leads to more particulate matter emissions when combustion takes place in a diesel engine,” it said.

2018-07-09,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s FTSE 100 jumped on Monday after two leading eurosceptic ministers’ resignations dented sterling, with real estate and utilities stocks declining as uncertainty over Brexit negotiations deepened. The FTSE 100 .FTSE rose 0.9 percent in its third straight day of gains, outpacing European peers thanks to the slide in the pound as markets continued to benefit from Friday's strong U.S. jobs report.  Analysts said the political tensions were no positive for stocks in longer term, despite the currency effect.  Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson quit in protest at a new Brexit plan presented by Prime Minister Theresa May, heaping added pressure on her less than 24 hours after Brexit Minister David Davis did the same. Davis said on Monday he would not encourage his colleagues to try to oust May.    But investors saw Johnson’s subsequent resignation as making a leadership challenge more likely, and bookmakers cut their odds of an early general election this year.  The FTSE was climbing “for the wrong reasons”, a trader said, predicting a snap election. While international, dollar-earning stocks such as British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L) gained with sterling’s fall, some domestic sectors suffered as the resignations added to political uncertainty.  Utilities were the worst-performing, with Severn Trent (SVT.L) bottom of the FTSE 100, while real estate stocks - seen as especially vulnerable to a messy Brexit - were also bruised.  Real estate agencies Foxtons (FOXT.L) and Countrywide (CWD.L) were the two worst hit on the small-cap index, down 6.2 and 5.1 percent respectively.

2018-07-09,"CALGARY, July 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s energy heartland is showing a spark of optimism at the Calgary Stampede, an annual rodeo and corporate networking destination, with party sizes and event attendance on the rise as oil prices claw up from the 13-year lows of 2016. Oil and gas producers, who laid off thousands of workers and slashed millions in capital expenditures after prices began their sharp descent in 2014, are slowly increasing their spending at the 10-day festival that runs to July 15. In a sign the sector is still feeling the effects of tough times, many of the new sponsors for the Stampede’s key Canvas Auction were from outside of the energy sector. “We are seeing a bit more activity the last couple of years. It’s a slow recovery, a very cautious recovery,” said Gregg Scott, president of Scott Land & Lease Ltd, which acquires land for oil and gas companies. For more than 20 years, energy companies have been footing the bill on annual parties for clients and staff during the Stampede, while guests often contribute to designated charities. After U.S. crude oil futures prices tumbled more than 70 percent over 1-1/2 years to a 13-year low at $26.5 per barrel in 2016, Stampede budgets tightened up. Prices have since tripled to around $73 per barrel, a marked improvement but still around 50 percent below the highs of 2008. Scott’s Stampede party rose to 800 people this year, up from 600 in 2016, a sign of increased company spending at its 21st consecutive event. “This year is a better year but I think people are still cognizant of what has happened in the past,” said Codey McCurrach, 43, an energy company employee who is racing a four-horse chuck wagon in the Stampede. At Cowboys, an establishment that hosts parties next to Stampede grounds, daytime party bookings are down 80 percent from 2012, said Paul Vickers, president and chief executive of Penny Lane Entertainment Group, a majority owner of Cowboys. The Stampede itself has seen an uptick with first-day attendance at a record 122,403 people on July 6, up 38 percent from the five-year average. Earlier this year, money raised through the Calgary Stampede Canvas Auction – a de facto litmus test on the state of the economy that auctions sponsorship for the 10-day chuck wagon races - rose to C$3.2 million ($2.45 million). This was up 34 percent from 2017 and the highest in the last four or five years, said Theresa Howland, director of marketing, communications and sponsorship for the Calgary Stampede. “The energy sector was, and still is, in the midst of a prolonged downturn,” said Jim Davidson, deputy chairman of GMP FirstEnergy Capital and founder of FirstEnergy.

2018-07-09,"HOUSTON, July 9 (Reuters) - Venezuelan crude sales to the United States recovered in June from May as state-run PDVSA exported more of its diluted oil to its customers and drained inventories from two Caribbean islands affected by assets seizures, according to Thomson Reuters data. PDVSA exports have declined in recent months due to a stubborn tanker backlog around Venezuela’s main ports and its fast-declining crude output, which has stopped the firm from complying with supply contracts to almost all of its customers. Legal actions against PDVSA by U.S. producer ConocoPhillips aimed to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration award also have recently worsened the bottleneck as the Venezuelan firm is no longer fully using its Caribbean terminals to store and export. But an increase in production of diluted crude oil, or DCO, formulated by PDVSA by blending naphtha and extra heavy oils while its crude upgraders are out of service, and shipments from Aruba and Curacao ahead of seizure attempts by Conoco helped PDVSA and its joint ventures deliver more barrels to the United States in June. PDVSA exported 563,962 barrels per day of crude to the United States last month, 5 percent above May figures and the largest volume since August. Exports of DCO slightly surpassed 250,000 bpd, the highest level since May 2017, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data. PDVSA shipped at least four crude cargoes from its terminals in Curacao and Aruba to Citgo’s Lake Charles and Corpus Christi refineries on the Gulf Coast, including two shipments of Santa Barbara light sweet crude, a grade that is rarely exported to the United States. The largest receiver of Venezuelan crude in the United States last month was PDVSA’s refining unit Citgo Petroleum, followed by Valero Energy and Chevron Corp. A U.S. district court judge in Houston last week ruled Conoco can depose Citgo as preparation for a court case against PDVSA and others over alleged asset transfers in the Caribbean that Conoco claims were designed to frustrate its efforts to obtain payment under the arbitration award.

2018-07-09,"(Adds price, stock impact) By John Benny July 9 (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Monday its Syncrude oil sands project in Western Canada will resume some production in July, sooner than expected, and hit full capacity in September, following an outage last month that disrupted total output. The disruption at Syncrude, representing 10 percent of Canadian oil production, has tightened Canadian supplies and reduced the crude flow to Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point of the U.S. crude futures contract. Suncor, the biggest stakeholder in the northern Alberta project, said an early investigation showed the cause of disruption was a transformer trip. Syncrude can produce up to 360,000 barrels per day of crude oil and had been expected to remain down through July. But Suncor said one of its coker drums, which produces about 150,000 bpd, would return to service during the second half of July. A second one, which has an output of about 100,000 bpd, is expected to return to service in the first half of August. Coker units convert mined bitumen from the oil sands into synthetic crude oil. Suncor expects pipeline shipments from its Syncrude oil sands project to be about 60 percent to 70 percent of total capacity in August. Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy crude trades at a discount to West Texas Intermediate light oil (WTI), the North American benchmark, in part because of difficulties transporting crude through clogged pipelines from Alberta to U.S. refineries. Traders reduced that discount for three consecutive days last week as Haywood Securities research predicted a longer start-up schedule that would ease pipeline congestion. The discount was little changed in early trading on Monday, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. WTI crude futures eased 0.7 percent to $73.29 per barrel. The outage will cost Syncrude about 205,300 bpd in lost production in the third quarter, which translates to about 59 percent utilization, AltaCorp analysts wrote in a note. “We view the update as slightly negative as the project is expected to return to normal operations ... after the acceleration of planned maintenance, resulting in a longer outage than originally anticipated,” they added. Suncor is expected to report the ongoing quarter’s results on July 25. The company’s Toronto shares dipped 0.4 percent at C$53.74 in morning trade on Monday. Imperial Oil Ltd, which is majority owned by Exxon Mobil Corp, and China’s Sinopec have also invested in the project.

2018-07-09,"COLOMBO, July 9 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares fell on Monday and turnover slumped to a near three-month low as many investors stayed away from the market after confusion over fuel price hike and lower economic growth outlook hurt sentiment, stockbrokers said. Turnover stood at 154.9 million rupees, its lowest since April 16 and less than a sixth of this year’s daily average of 921 million rupees. Sri Lankan state-run fuel retailer, Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC), on Friday reversed an earlier decision to increase petrol and diesel prices at its fuel stations hours after the finance ministry demanded a hike to stem losses. “The investor confidence is low. The fuel price decision could not be implemented with mixed signals and investors are also confused,” said Prashan Fernando, CEO at Acuity Stockbrokers. Another analyst said lower economic growth outlook also has hit the sentiment, after the central bank cut its estimate. Economic growth in 2018 is likely to be between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, falling short of an earlier estimate of 5 percent, Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy told reporters on Friday, adding that the earlier estimate was “ambitious”. Foreign investor are selling and concerns about lower economic growth weighed on sentiment, analysts said. The Colombo stock index ended 0.51 percent weaker at 6,077.32. It hit its lowest close since March 30, 2017 on Wednesday and has declined for a 19th session in 22 through Monday. The index fell 1.4 percent last week, sliding for a seventh straight week. They net sold equities worth 22.9 million rupees on Monday, extending the year-to-date foreign outflows to 2.25 billion rupees. Ceylinco Insurance Plc fell 5.3 percent, while Lanka Orix Leasing Company slipped 3.3 percent. Investors are waiting for some positive news both on the economic and political fronts, said analysts, adding that the government’s policy implementation had been sluggish since both main parties in the ruling coalition lost local polls in February.

2018-07-09,"SARAJEVO, July 9 (Reuters) - European power grid lobby ENTSO-E warned on Monday it could suspend Serbia unless it quickly resolves a dispute with its former province Kosovo which has again made some digital clocks on the continent run slow. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), which groups grid operators from 26 countries, said that digital clocks across Europe that use mains frequency to keep time, such as those on microwaves and clock radios, have fallen behind by one minute due to a drop in frequency on continental Europe’s transmission network. Earlier this year, a power shortfall in Kosovo which Serbian grid operator EMS failed to compensate for, slowed those clocks by as much as six minutes. With the warmer weather in Europe, power demand across the continent could rise and the frequency deviation may widen. “Drops of frequency happen and solidarity mechanisms exist but the Kosovo-Serbia issue is new,” ENTSO-E spokeswoman Claire Camus said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters, calling it a political issue that demanded a political solution. “ENTSO-E can look at possibilities to suspend EMS’ membership,” she said. To lessen the impact on consumers, European grid operators agreed in March to inject missing electricity into the joint network and to restore the frequency. The compensation scheme is still ongoing but the operators agreed that they would not tolerate a grid time deviation of more than 60 seconds, Camus told Reuters. The Serbian and Kosovan grid operators were not immediately available to comment. Kosovo’s KOSTT has applied for membership of ENTSO-E but Serbia has been obstructing the application. The dispute over regulatory issues and grid operation is further complicated by the fact that Belgrade does not recognise Kosovo, which seceded from Serbia in 2008. Some 40,000 Serbs in the north of Kosovo do not pay their electricity bills to the Kosovo authorities. Their bills used to be paid by the rest of Kosovo’s people until Kosovo’s energy regulator ended that practice, leaving its grid operator KOSTT without the financial means to buy the energy needed to cover usage in the north. Because this energy is not injected in the interconnected continental European system, frequency drops slightly, creating a grid time deviation. The European Union is mediating in the dispute, which includes the implementation of the connection agreement between KOSTT and continental Europe, Camus said. But the Serbian authorities set as a pre-condition the creation of an association of Serb municipalities in Kosovo and this is not acceptable to the Kosovo authorities, she added.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.4 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.5 percent, led by a strong bounce across mining and energy stocks. The pound regained ground after an earlier wobble after news broke that Brexit Secretary David Davis and Minister Steven Baker had resigned in opposition to British Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the EU. Sterling hit its highest level since June 14, up 0.4 percent at $1.3337. Britain’s FTSE gained 0.4 percent. The resignations came just two days after a meeting at May’s Chequers country residence supposedly sealed a cabinet deal on Brexit and underlines the deep divisions in her ruling Conservative Party over the departure from the EU. “Sterling up and FTSE up does suggest that there’s a slight sigh of relief generally,” Ian Williams, economics & strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt, said. “(The UK) is quite defensive, so in trade war times when industrials and tech are getting clobbered, that’s not so much of problem for the UK because those sectors are not as big in weighting terms as they are for the Euro zone or the U.S.,” added Williams. More broadly, sentiment across markets was mostly positive after Friday’s U.S. payrolls report showed tame wages and more people looking for work. “The combination of rising employment and increased labour force participation suggests healthy but not tightening labour market conditions in June, something that will allow the Fed to continue to hike rates at a gradual pace,” said Kevin Cummins, a senior U.S. economist at RBS. The balanced report helped Japan’s Nikkei end 1.2 percent higher, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.4 percent, set to extend Friday’s rally when the jobs report was released. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.3 percent, on top of a 0.7 percent rally on Friday when the launch of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports came and went without too many fireworks. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar was mostly softer following the jobs report. Against a basket of currencies the dollar had pulled back to 93.797, from a top of 94.486 on Friday. The euro held its gains at $1.1776, while the dollar was flat on the yen at 110.42. Global stocks were under pressure in June as uncertainty over trade dented risk appetite. “Our central expectation is that these skirmishes do not escalate into a full trade war,” Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said. However, attention has shifted to the strong economic backdrop and the upcoming second-quarter earnings season. “While trade tensions fan concerns about the future, incoming data show a soaring U.S. economy, a healthy labour market, and some rebound in Europe and Japan,” said Barclays economist Michael Gapen. “For now, overall policies and financial conditions still support growth and investment,” he added. Chinese shares managed to rally on Monday with the Shanghai blue chip index up 2.8 percent after hitting its lowest in almost 18 months last week. China’s securities regulator said on Sunday it plans to ease restrictions on foreign investment in stock listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges to attract more foreign capital and support the economy. The focus this week would be on Chinese data for June covering inflation, new loans and international trade. The United States also releases inflation figures, while the Bank of Canada might well hike rates on Wednesday. In commodity markets, oil prices pushed higher as the dollar eased. Brent rose 81 cents to $77.92 a barrel. Gold was 0.9 percent firmer at $1,265.06 an ounce.

2018-07-09,"YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor (7201.T) said on Monday it had improperly measured exhaust emissions and fuel economy for 19 vehicle models sold in Japan, the second case in less than a year where misconduct has been discovered in its inspection processes. Nissan said it had found sample test environments for emissions and fuel economy in final vehicle inspections at most of its factories in Japan were not in line with domestic standards, and that inspection reports were based on altered measurements. The incident is the latest in a growing list of data tampering in Japan which has tarnished the image of the country’s manufacturing industry, known for high-quality, efficient production. The latest misconduct does not impact vehicles exported overseas, as it applies to requirements intended specifically for the Japanese market, Nissan said. Shares in the Japanese automaker closed down about 5 percent at their lowest in more than a year. The news came after the close of trading, but the company had said earlier it would make an announcement about its emissions tests, sparking concerns. The admission came after Nissan said in October that for decades uncertified inspectors had signed off on final checks for cars sold in Japan, triggering a domestic recall of 1.2 million vehicles.  “This is a deep and serious issue for our company,” Chief Operating Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi told reporters at a briefing. “We realize that our compliance awareness remains lacking,” he said, adding the company would carry out an investigation into the issue to determine the root causes, which it expects will take a month or more. The issue was discovered during voluntary compliance checks it launched following last year’s vehicle inspection scandal, and affects models including the Note, the subcompact hatchback which is Nissan’s top-selling model in Japan, and the Juke SUV crossover. Of around 2,200 sample tests performed at six plants producing Nissan vehicles, 1,200 at five locations showed some form of falsification, Nissan said. The automaker discovered incidents in which vehicle driving speeds and durations, along with external temperatures, had not been in line with Japanese regulations for emissions testing, while testing equipment had not been calibrated properly. In addition, mileage data were overstated in some cases to make them appear more favorable.  No recalls were necessary as the misconduct did not compromise the safety of the affected models, and mileage readings were in line with levels presented in product catalogues, Nissan said.     According to currently available data, tampering incidents date back to 2013 and involved 10 employees, although Yamauchi said it was possible that older data may show the problem could go back further.    Nissan last year blamed its use of uncertified inspectors on staff shortages, a scandal which contributed to a slide in full-year operating profit in the year ended March. Domestic rival Subaru Corp (7270.T) in April admitted to similar misconduct in its testing regime. Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T), which supplies steel parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, admitted last year to supplying products with falsified specifications to about 500 customers, throwing global supply chains into turmoil.

2018-07-09,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan rebels on Monday rejected a peace plan to reinstate insurgent leader Riek Machar as vice president, saying it failed to dilute the strong power base of the country’s president. Machar was President Salva Kiir’s deputy until 2013, when a political disagreement between them degenerated into a war that has ravaged South Sudan ever since. The deal naming Machar first vice president was reached in Entebbe in talks mediated by Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni and that he and Kiir attended. It was announced on Sunday by Kiir’s office. But an official of Machar’s SPLM-IO rebel group said on Monday it was not acceptable. Puok Both Baluang, SPLM-IO deputy spokesman, said the rebels should appoint two of the four vice presidents envisaged under the Entebbe deal and Kiir’s grip on power should be loosened further.  “We will not fall only for the position of the First Vice President in this negotiation. We are focusing more on structural and institutional issues to constrain Kiir’s regime both in the executive and legislature,” he said. It was not clear if Baluang was speaking on Machar’s behalf, and the SPLM-IO leader could not immediately be contacted for comment. SPLM-IO is the largest of the rebel groups fighting Kiir’s government, and militants allied to it control several areas close to the capital Juba. The agreement on Machar’s position would have marked a potential breakthrough in new efforts mediated by regional leaders to end the war, which has primarily been fought along ethnic lines between Kiir’s Dinka and Machar’s Nuer groups. It has killed tens of thousands and devastated the economy of Africa’s youngest nation. A similar power-sharing deal in 2015 failed the following year after Machar returned to the capital and disagreements quickly developed, reigniting fighting. On Friday, government and opposition signed an agreement on security arrangements that followed on from a ceasefire deal last month, but the truce has been frequently violated by both sides.

2018-07-09,"JAKARTA, July 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s state owned energy holding company, Pertamina, has decided not to go ahead with what would have been the country’s second land-based receiving terminal for liquefied natural gas (LNG), its chief executive said on Monday. Indonesia has forecast sharp increases in gas demand after 2020, but increases in domestic consumption of the super-cooled fuel have been hampered by an abundance of cheap coal and sluggish development of gas infrastructure. “Today we are not going ahead, because it is not yet feasible to continue,” Pertamina acting CEO Nicke Widyawati told reporters, referring to the project that would have been built in Bojonegara, not far from Jakarta. The terminal, valued at up to $800 million, was to be developed in a joint venture between Kalla Group unit Bumi Sarana Migas and Pertamina, with financing from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). The 4-million-tonne-per-year terminal was to be designed by the engineering unit of Tokyo Gas Co Ltd and was expected to come onstream in 2019. “Gas demand has declined so it’s not feasible from a business standpoint,” Widyawati added, noting that if gas demand for power generation increased the decision to halt the project may be reviewed.

2018-07-09,"LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - Gabon oil workers’ union ONEP began a 15-day strike at the facilities of French oil producer Total (TOTF.PA) on Monday after demands for higher pay and other issues were not met, the union said in a statement. ONEP threatened to strike last month, after Total Gabon failed to respond to demands made to the company in May. In addition to higher pay, the union requested new bonuses, increased opportunities for career advancement and a reduction in the number of foreign workers. “The 15-day strike will affect all installations operated by Total Gabon’s employees as of Monday July 9th,” the ONEP statement said, including facilities in the capital Libreville and the oil hub of Port Gentil. The decision to strike follows several failed discussions with Total representatives mediated by the Ministry of Employment, ONEP said.  A Total spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Gabon produces about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, but output from the OPEC member’s mature fields has plummeted from a 1997 peak of 370,000 bpd. A steep fall in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 choked much needed revenue and forced companies to layoff thousands of oil workers.  Total produces about 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Gabon.

2018-07-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - France’s Total is set to sell a third of its stake in Laggan Tormore gas field along with other oil and gas assets in Britain’s North Sea that could fetch a total of $1.5 billion, four banking and industry sources said. The divestment will include stakes in a number of smaller fields Total acquired as part of the 2017 $4.95 billion deal to buy the oil and gas division of A.P. Moller-Maersk, the sources said. The deal was completed in March. Those fields include Golden Eagle, in which Total has a 32 percent stake, as well as Dumbarton (30 percent), Bruce (43 percent) and Keith (25 percent).  Bank of America Merrill Lynch will run the sale of the 20 percent stake in Laggan Tormore process, which leave Total with a 40 percent stake once complete. Investment bank Lambert Energy will lead the sale of the other stakes. Total and Lambart Energy declined to comment. Bank of America Merrill Lynch did not respond to a request for comment. The sale is part of a broad change of guard in the aging North Sea where veteran players are seeking to dispose of older fields with declining production while new, nimbler companies believe they can squeeze out more value. Last week, Chevron said it was preparing to sell its fields in the central North Sea. Royal Dutch Shell and BP have also sold a large number of fields in recent years. The Laggan Tormore gas field, in which Total now has 60 percent, started production in February 2016 and can produce up to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Any deal for the Bruce and Keith fields is likely to be complicated, however.  London-listed Serica Energy, which agreed to acquire stakes in Bruce, Keith and the adjacent Rhum field from BP last year, is seeking a waiver from the U.S. government to allow it to operate Rhum, which is 50 percent owned by Iran’s national oil company, as Washington prepares to re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Without a waiver, the field will have to shut down, leaving Bruce and Keith holding little value, the sources said.

2018-07-09,"TUNIS, July 9 (Reuters) - Libya’s national oil production fell to 527,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a high of 1.28 million bpd in February following recent oil port closures, the head of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said in a statement on Monday. The NOC had not previously stated how high the country’s production had climbed after partially recovering to more than 1 million bpd a year ago. In the video statement dated July 8 the chairman of Tripoli-based NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, said the Feb. 23 closure of the El Feel oilfield due to protests led to the loss of 80,000 bpd, but output had subsequently remained around 1.1 million bpd. Last month it dropped sharply when an armed attack against forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar at the oil export ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider shut both terminals down. After Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) repelled the attack a week later, it announced it would hand the ports and fields in the east to a parallel NOC. Ras Lanuf and Es Sider have remained shut and tankers booked by the NOC in Tripoli, which is recognised internationally as the sole producer and seller of Libyan oil, have been unable to load. “Our production today is 527,000 bpd. Tomorrow it will be less and the day after tomorrow less again. And we are going lower,” Sanalla said. The NOC had previously estimated the production loss from the stoppage at 850,000 bpd, or $67 million in daily revenue. OPEC member Libya was pumping 1.6 million bpd or more before conflict, blockades and political splits slashed output from 2013. Reporting by Aidan Lewis and Ahmed Elumami, editing by Louise

2018-07-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Monday it will begin phasing out use of plastic straws at its restaurants by 2020, giving environmentalists a sizeable victory in their campaign to convince restaurants to abandon plastic utensils.  The Seattle-based chain said it would eliminate single-use plastic straws globally at its 28,000 locations. The straws will be replaced by new recyclable strawless lids and alternative material straws. Its announcement came just days after its hometown of Seattle barred plastic straws and utensils at restaurants, amid a broader global push to discourage the use of plastic straws and other one-time use plastics “For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,” Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said in a statement. Last month, rival McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), the world’s largest restaurant chain, announced plans to transition to paper straws at its UK and Ireland restaurants, beginning in September with completion in 2019. The McDonald’s decision does not extend to its other global restaurants, however. A proposal to investigate the impact of plastic straws at its 37,000 worldwide restaurants, what would have been a step towards phasing out plastic straws, was shot down by shareholders in May. The U.N. Environment Programme estimates that some 8 million tons of plastic is dumped into the ocean every year - the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck full of plastic every minute - killing birds and marine life and compromising the ocean ecosystem.  Plastic straws represent a comparatively small amount of all plastic waste. However, they are more difficult to recycle than other plastic items.  Dylan de Thomas, vice president of industry collaboration at The Recycling Partnership, said that curbside recycling programs in the United States don’t typically accept straws. Even for those consumers who recycle plastic items, a straw is so small it can be difficult to sort.  “It’s really thin. It’s really small. It’s really light. So it’s really challenging in our existing sortation system to be able to sort it out,” he said. In contrast, paper straws are often compostable. When disposed of in a landfill, paper straws decompose at a much faster rate than plastic ones. For businesses, paper straws are also more expensive than their plastic counterparts. Per 250 straws at UK-based catering equipment company Drinkstuff, paper straws cost about $8.62 (£6.49), versus $1.66 (£1.25) for plastic, for instance.  In 2017 there were about 63 billion straws used in the United States per year, around 170-175 million straws per day, according to data provided by Technomic. “Taken in isolation I don’t know that anyone would argue that slightly higher straw costs are going to break the backs” of restaurant owners, said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic food service consulting company.  “But you couple it with rising costs in a whole lot of other categories and that’s where the challenge comes... It’s a small increase here, and a small increase there.” Grassroots conservation groups have been among the most vocal opponents of plastic straws, though the push to paper and other biodegradable and recyclable materials has found support in some corporate boardrooms as well. Earlier this year, the fifth-largest U.S. carrier, Seattle-based Alaska Airlines (ALK.N), said it would be going strawless, beginning this month. “There’s always going to be people who still buy plastic straws,” Drinkstuff head of marketing Buzz Seager said in a phone interview. “Especially if you’re a little venue, prices are always going to be a bit of a barrier to it.” Yet Seager said the company has seen an increase in demand from customers for straws that are better for the environment.  “You basically just pay for the privilege of being eco-friendly,” Seager said.

2018-07-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is more resilient to oil price slumps than its biggest listed rivals, its 2016 accounts indicate, giving a rare insight into the state energy giant’s finances ahead of a proposed flotation. The full-year accounts, not publicly available but seen by Reuters, show Aramco’s net income fell by about 21 percent to $13.3 billion in 2016 - when oil prices collapsed to a 12-year low of $27.10 a barrel due to a global glut of crude. By comparison, the net income of Exxon Mobil Corp, the world’s largest listed oil company, dropped 51 percent in 2016, while the earnings attributable to shareholders of Royal Dutch Shell, the No.2 listed oil firm, fell 37 percent, excluding items.  Saudi Aramco said in response to a request for comment: “Saudi Aramco does not comment on speculation regarding its financial performance and fiscal regime.” Industry experts say Aramco’s ability to better weather price shocks is down to low production costs, the fact its major operations are concentrated in just one country and because it has fewer employees than its biggest rivals even though it is the world’s largest oil producer. Analysts estimates the Saudi giant’s production costs at below $1 per barrel compared to $10 per barrel in places like Russia and as much as $20-30 per barrel in locations like the North Sea. The accounts show 67,718 people worked for Aramco in 2016. That compares with 71,100 at Exxon and 89,000 at Shell.  Aramco produces around 10 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil compared with Exxon’s and Shell’s oil equivalent of 4 million bpd and 3.7 million bpd respectively. In April, Bloomberg reported Aramco had net income of $33.8 billion in the first six months of 2017, up from $7.2 billion in the first of half of 2016, as oil prices spiked and as the Saudi government changed the tax rate. Full-year results for 2016 and 2015 have never been disclosed before. Aramco’s earnings and other key information about the company, which pumps about 10 percent of the world’s oil, have been a closely guarded secret for decades. The accounts provide a window into its finances ahead of  the proposed stock market listing, should it go ahead.  Even though Aramco may be bigger and more resilient than its peers, analysts have repeatedly expressed doubt that it can achieve Riyadh’s $2 trillion valuation, if and when it decides to list its stock. Its nearest rival Exxon is worth $350 billion. A listing of up to 5 percent of Aramco has been the centerpiece of a government plan to diversify the kingdom’s economy. But some sources close to the process say the plans for a domestic and international listing may never happen. “Domestic is more likely, but the whole thing is uncertain,” said a source familiar with Aramco’s IPO plans. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said on June 21 it would be “nice” to see Aramco floated in 2019, adding  the timing was not critical to the government.    The documents seen by Reuters show that Aramco made more money than any other oil company in 2016. Its net income of $13.3 billion in 2016 outstripped Exxon’s $7.8 billion, while Shell reported 2016 earnings attributable to shareholders - the equivalent metric - of $3.5 billion. BP, dealing with the financial aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, reported a loss of $999 million in 2016, better than a $5.162 billion loss in 2015. Based on cash flow from operations, another important metric for investors, Aramco did well too. The company’s net cash from operating activities rose about 21 percent to $29 billion in 2016, the accounts show. The highest figure among the listed competitors was reported by Exxon, whose cash flow from operations was $22.1 billion, down 27 percent from 2015. Shell’s cash flow from operations fell 31 percent and BP’s declined 44 percent. Aramco realized an average price of $40.68 on its crude oil exports in 2016, down from $49.46 in 2015, the accounts showed. Revenue was $135 billion, down from $146 billion in 2015. The 2016 Aramco accounts reviewed by Reuters were prepared according to IFRS standards, and according to the 85 percent tax rate that applied at the time. The Saudi government cut the tax rate to 50 percent from 2017, making the firm more attractive to potential investors.

2018-07-09,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - All of China’s major polluters will need to install real-time emissions monitoring systems before the end of the year, according to a report submitted to parliament on Monday, as the country tries to improve surveillance and bring lawbreaking firms into line. China is now in the fifth year of its war on pollution, and President Xi Jinping said in May that the country would use the full might of the ruling Communist Party to fix the damage done by four decades of untrammeled economic growth. According to the National People’s Congress (NPC) report, published by state news agency Xinhua, China’s central government has already spent 52.8 billion yuan ($7.98 billion) to improve air quality over the 2012 to 2017 period.  But some regions are still way behind when it comes to monitoring and cracking down on pollution, it said, and China will work to create a comprehensive nationwide monitoring system by the end of the decade, extending full coverage to smog-prone cities in the country’s central and western regions.      Though China has tried to create a national surveillance system that would enable regulators to identify violations in real time, monitoring standards and compliance levels have so far been uneven. During a nationwide inspection program completed last year, the central government uncovered thousands of violations throughout China’s 31 provinces and regions, and according to recent reviews, many of the problems still have not been properly rectified. The report to parliament also promised that all households in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Shanxi-Shaanxi regions would make the switch from coal to natural gas heating by 2020 as part of efforts to curb smog.  China already converted more than 4.7 million households and 62,000 enterprises from coal to gas over the 2012 to 2017 period, but the acceleration of the program last year led to severe fuel shortages across the northern regions during the winter. China also installed ultra-low emissions technology on more than 700 gigawatts of coal-fired power capacity in the last five years, equal to 71 percent of the country’s total coal-fired power capacity. It also eliminated more than 20 million substandard vehicles from its roads over the period, the report added.

2018-07-09,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2NwQzpZ By John Kemp LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - The United States wants to eliminate all Iran’s crude oil exports from November, and is relying on Saudi Arabia and other OPEC and non-OPEC members to fill the gap in supplies. “Our goal is to increase pressure on the Iranian regime by reducing to zero its revenue from crude oil sales,” a senior State Department official told a news briefing this month. “We are working to minimise disruptions to the global market, but we are confident that there is sufficient global spare oil production capacity,” Brian Hook, the director of policy planning, said on July 2. “We are not looking to grant licences or waivers broadly on the re-imposition of sanctions, because we believe pressure is critical to achieve our national security objectives.” But if the United States succeeds in reducing Iran’s crude exports close to zero from November, in line with its stated policy, Saudi Arabia would have to raise its production to unprecedented levels to cover the loss. And it would leave the global market tighter than at any time since the oil shocks of 1973/74 and 1979/80, with resulting upward pressure on prices. The administration has not been clear about whether sanctions will apply just to crude or will include condensates (“Briefing with an Iran diplomacy update”, State Department, July 2). But assuming sanctions apply only to crude, the global market would still need to replace more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian exports from the start of November. According to the latest information from the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI), Iran exported between 2.1 million and 2.2 million bpd of crude between January and April. The question is where will the replacement barrels come from? The International Energy Agency estimates OPEC members held 3.4 million bpd of spare capacity at the end of May, while their non-OPEC allies had no more than 330,000 bpd (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, June 2018). Saudi Arabia accounted for almost two-thirds of the reported OPEC spare capacity (2.02 million bpd), with smaller volumes held by Iraq (330,000 bpd), United Arab Emirates (330,000 bpd) and Kuwait (220,000 bpd). Russia accounted for most of the non-OPEC spare capacity (roughly 250,000 bpd) with little or no available spare capacity in the other non-OPEC allies. Other agencies and market analysts put the spare capacity figures for OPEC and non-OPEC members significantly lower than the IEA, which implies the market is even tighter. But using the IEA’s figures, it is clear Saudi Arabia would have to replace most of the Iranian barrels lost as a result of sanctions. The kingdom would need to increase production and exports by at least 1 million bpd to cover the total loss of Iranian barrels. The required increase would be even higher if other OPEC and non-OPEC countries struggle to raise their output or more production is lost as a result of problems in Venezuela and Libya. In theory, there is sufficient spare capacity in Saudi Arabia and other countries, but it would leave the global market with less than 1 million bpd of capacity left to meet all other contingencies. In practice, some analysts think the market could be much tighter, with sanctions essentially using up all the spare capacity worldwide. The IEA estimates Saudi Arabia could raise production to just over 12 million bpd and sustain it at that level for an extended period. Saudi Arabia has already used some of its spare capacity to increase production by 458,000 bpd, from 10.03 million bpd in May to 10.49 million bpd in June. The figures were contained in a communication from the kingdom to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“Saudi Arabia raised oil output by around 500,000 bpd in June”, Reuters, July 5). But according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the kingdom has not produced more than 10.42 million bpd on an annual basis (2016) or 10.63 million bpd in a single month (July 2016) in the last 20 years. Saudi Arabia has reported roughly similar production numbers to JODI, with output peaking at 10.72 million bpd in November 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2NwQzpZ). It is possible the kingdom could lift production by another 1.3 million-1.4 million bpd beyond anything it has ever produced before but at the moment there is no way of knowing for certain. Some observers question whether such high rates of production could be implemented quickly and sustained for any length of time. Maximum production would require opening the chokes on existing wells and bringing previously shut-in wells back into service. Boosting production this way might risk a decline in oilfield pressure that could result in long-term damage to the reservoirs. Some spare capacity might require drilling new wells within existing fields, in which case it is not strictly speaking spare capacity at all. And it is not clear whether the pipelines, processing plants and export terminals have enough capacity to handle 12 million bpd because such high flow rates have never been tested. Saudi Arabia could boost volumes supplied to the market by releasing some of its domestic crude stocks as well as raising field production, but stock releases would only ever be a short-term measure. Domestic crude stocks have already fallen by 95 million barrels since their peak in October 2015, according to government data submitted to the JODI. Domestic stocks had been drawn down to 234 million barrels at the end of April, the lowest level since November 2011. Most of the remaining inventories are required for operational reasons, including as feedstock for the country’s growing refinery capacity, as well as ensuring smooth flow of oil from the fields onto tankers. If Saudi Arabia needs to replace Iranian barrels, most of the increase will have to come from more pumping rather than stock releases, and it would require producing more oil than Saudi Arabia has ever pumped before. Stringent sanctions on Iran will take both Saudi Arabia and the oil market into the unknown.

2018-07-09,"PARIS/MOSCOW, July 9 (Reuters) - Russia’s Aeroflot is in negotiations to conclude an expanded order for up to 28 Airbus A350 passenger jets worth $7.8 billion at list prices, two industry sources said. The long-awaited deal would double an order for 14 aircraft that has been on Airbus’s books for almost a decade without being fulfilled as the airline went through economic upheavals. Aeroflot and Airbus declined to comment. In 2007, Russia’s biggest airline ordered 22 A350s including 14 of the baseline A350-900 version and eight of the smaller A350-800, which Airbus later withdrew due to weak demand. Also that year, Aeroflot signed a contract for 22 Boeing 787 Dreamliners but later said it had cancelled the order. The deal, however, remains on Boeing’s catalogue of unfilled orders, indicating the contract has not been formally severed. Russian aviation market conditions were particularly challenging in 2015 and 2016, after sanctions by the United States and Europe, along with weak oil prices, hit the Russian economy and the rouble, hammering consumer demand. Demand started to recover along with the economy, and Aeroflot has benefited from its scale and the bankruptcies of Russian carriers Transaero in 2015 and VIM Airlines this year. One of the sources said Aeroflot was now discussing doubling the unfulfilled A350 order to 28 aircraft. Another predicted a total order for 25 airplanes. Aeroflot recently reported a first-quarter net loss of 11.54 billion roubles ($184.49 million) as fuel and staff costs outweighed revenue growth. The 95-year-old carrier, however, said it would set “more ambitious strategic goals”, having achieved its long-term 2025 ambitions to become a top-20 airline globally and top-five European airline ahead of schedule. Aeroflot sees transit passengers between Europe and Asia, as well as its low-cost subsidiary Pobeda, as key growth drivers.

The FTSE was up 0.15 percent by 0841 GMT, joining a bounce in global equity markets, which continued to benefit from Friday’s strong U.S. jobs report. The index was on track for its third straight day of gains. Davis, who resigned to protest at May’s strategy for leaving the European Union, said on Monday said he would not encourage his colleagues to try to oust May and did not want to see her replaced . “Investors believe she will keep hold of the reins”, London Capital Group analyst Jasper Lawler said. Analyst said Davis’s resignation should make it easier for May to implement a softer Brexit, under which Britain retains a close trading relationship with the EU, although caution over possible new challenges to her leadership remained. Top gainer on the FTSE on Monday was Just Eat, up 2.3 percent after RBC upgraded the stock to top pick. “Amidst an increasingly competitive landscape, we believe Just Eat is well positioned owing to its market leading positions and strong customer loyalty,” they said in a note. Materials stocks provided the biggest boost to the FTSE with mining company BHP up 1.9 percent after Reuters reported that BP was set to buy its U.S. onshore shale oil and gas assets after on offer worth more than $10 billion. BP fell 0.9 percent. Other mining stocks also rose as copper prices rebounded from one-year lows. Mid-caps precious metal miner Centamin, however, fell 6.6 percent after second-quarter gold production fell, disappointing investor expectations. Jefferies said Centamin will need a significant pick-up in the second half to hit the mid point of its full-year gold production guidance. Inmarsat rose 2.4 percent, shrugging off news that U.S. satellite group EchoStar does not intend to make an offer for the British peer, which had rejected its $3.2 billion takeover approach.

The move came just two days after a meeting at May’s Chequers country residence supposedly sealed a cabinet deal on Brexit and underlines the deep divisions in her ruling Conservative Party over the departure from the EU. “Sterling up and FTSE up does suggest that there’s a slight sigh of relief generally,” Ian Williams, economics & strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt, said. “(The UK) is quite defensive, so in trade war times when industrials and tech are getting clobbered, that’s not so much of problem for the UK because those sectors are not as big in weighting terms as they are for the Euro zone or the U.S.,” added Williams. More broadly, sentiment across markets was mostly positive after Friday’s U.S. payrolls report showed tame wages and more people looking for work. “The combination of rising employment and increased labour force participation suggests healthy but not tightening labour market conditions in June, something that will allow the Fed to continue to hike rates at a gradual pace,” said Kevin Cummins, a senior U.S. economist at RBS. The balanced report helped Japan Nikkei end 1.2 percent higher, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.4 percent, set to extend Friday’s rally when the jobs report was released. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.3 percent, on top of 0.7 percent rally on Friday when the launch of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports came and went without too many fireworks. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar was mostly softer following the jobs report. Against a basket of currencies the dollar had pulled back to 93.829, from a top of 94.486 on Friday. The euro held its gains at $1.1767, while the dollar was flat on the yen at 110.42. Global stocks were under pressure in June as uncertainty over trade dented risk appetite. “Our central expectation is that these skirmishes do not escalate into a full trade war,” Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said. However, attention has shifted to the strong economic backdrop and the upcoming second-quarter earnings season. “While trade tensions fan concerns about the future, incoming data show a soaring U.S. economy, a healthy labour market, and some rebound in Europe and Japan,” said Barclays economist Michael Gapen. “For now, overall policies and financial conditions still support growth and investment,” he added. Chinese shares managed to rally on Monday with the Shanghai blue chip index up 2.8 percent after hitting its lowest in almost 18 months last week. China’s securities regulator said on Sunday it plans to ease restrictions on foreign investment in stock listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges to attract more foreign capital and support the economy. The focus this week would be on Chinese data for June covering inflation, new loans and international trade. The United States also releases inflation figures, while the Bank of Canada might well hike rates on Wednesday. In commodity markets, oil prices pushed higher as the dollar eased. Brent rose 44 cents to $77.55 a barrel. Gold was 0.5 percent firmer at $1,260.84 an ounce.

2018-07-09,"FINNMARK PLATEAU, Norway/OSLO (Reuters) - When he’s not out on the Arctic tundra with his 2,000 reindeer, his dog and Whitney Houston blasting through his headphones, Nils Mathis Sara is often busy explaining to people how a planned copper mine threatens his livelihood. Along with other Sami herders and fishermen, the 60-year-old is in a standoff with the mine owners, Norwegian officials and many townspeople that is, after six years, coming to a head. It is a litmus test for the Arctic, where climate change and technology are enabling mineral and energy extraction, shipping and tourism while threatening traditional ways of life and creating tensions among its four million inhabitants. “This mine is completely nuts,” said Sara, preparing to move his herd from winter pastures on Norway’s windswept Finnmark plateau three days north to the grass-rich pastures on the coast, where females calve and there are fewer mosquitoes. “We would be losing summer pastures for our reindeer again.” Herders around the Arctic - in other Nordic nations, Russia, Canada and Alaska - echoed his concerns in interviews, citing threats from climate change, mining, oil spills and poaching as well as thoughtless behaviour from townspeople and tourists. Global majors, including Eni (ENI.MI), Equinor (EQNR.OL), Gazprom (GAZP.MM), Glencore (GLEN.L), Lukoil (LKOH.MM) and Rio Tinto (RIO.AX), are all grappling with how to square their prospecting plans with the interests of people whose views count more than in the past. Anders Oskal, Executive Director of the International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry, said the copper mine was in the spotlight. “Big industry is sitting on the fence and seeing how it plays out,” he said. Photo essay: reut.rs/2tLnOwq Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2tQSjlC Local officials gave the green light for the privately-owned Nussir copper project back in 2012 on the grounds it would bring in much-needed jobs and funds. It has been stuck ever since. Indigenous Sami herders and fishermen say the plan to dump the mine’s tailings in the fjord, while less damaging than piling them on land, would destroy spawning grounds for cod and the mine would damage summer pasture grounds and frighten the reindeer. “I don’t get it,” Tommy Pettersen, a 47-year-old Sami fisherman, said on board his boat, which gives him a potentially lucrative but unpredictable income. “We are a maritime nation. We have relied on the ocean to live off and we want to dump this stuff in the fjord?” He had just caught king crabs worth 16,000 Norwegian crowns (1,496.92 pounds). Last year he earned 1.6 million crowns ($199,000) for four weeks’ work — about half from cod and the rest from crabs, a Pacific species brought to the Barents Sea in the Stalin era. Sara’s income is steadier. He gets up to 130 Norwegian crowns ($16) a kilo for his meat, 300 crowns for each skin and 140 crowns a kilo for the antlers, which he sells to China as aphrodisiac. Nussir has won the necessary permits, says the area contains 72 million tonnes of copper — Norway’s largest reserve — and plans more than 1 billion crowns ($124 million) in investment. “We can run this mine alongside reindeer herding and fishing,” said Oeystein Rushfeldt, the head of the project. Terje Wickstroem, mayor of Kvalsund, a village of painted wooden houses on the Repparfjord with 1,027 inhabitants, said the mine would boost a municipality which spends 40 percent of its income caring for the elderly as young people move away. “It would create optimism for the town,” said Wickstroem, who is himself a Sami. After years of back and forth with locals and the consultative Sami Parliament of Norway, as well as assessments by ministries and government agencies, the centre-right, pro-business government will make a ruling on the copper mine this year. Oskal, of the reindeer husbandry centre, said it was ironic that Nussir may be allowed to dump waste when Norwegian laws oblige Sami reindeer herders to send the animals’ stomachs and intestines for destruction, sometimes hundreds of kilometres away, to reduce risks of disease. Traditionally, herders just buried the remains. The Sami herders insist they are not opposed to change — their language has no word for “stability” — but Sara said the politicians were not listening. “If this mine gets the go ahead, we will go to the courts to stop it,” he said. Wickstroem said he understood Sara’s concerns. “His business is under pressure. But this is a bigger, national debate.” It is also an international one. Average temperatures in the Arctic region have risen more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6°F) since pre-industrial times, twice as fast as the world average, according to research for the intergovernmental Arctic Council. Temperatures now sometimes spike above freezing in mid-winter, melting snow that then re-freezes into a blanket of ice on lichen pastures that the reindeer cannot nuzzle through. In the worst recorded ‘rain on snow’ event, in the Yamal Peninsula in Russia in 2013-14, about 61,000 of 275,000 reindeer died. “Indigenous peoples and systems in the Arctic” top a list of populations vulnerable to warming in a draft U.N. scientific report about the risks of climate change to be published in October. Shrinking ice also means liquefied natural gas tankers can now travel west to Europe year-round and east to Asia in summer from the Yamal Peninsula in northern Russia, where Gazprom is the dominant producer. “There is an explosion of industrial development in Arctic regions,” said Mikhail Pogodaev, Chair of the Association of World Reindeer Herders, who is based in Yakutsk, eastern Russia. The Nenets herders on the Yamal Peninsula still live in tents and travel with their herds, unlike the Sami, who now venture out on snowmobiles or quad bikes from village homes and overnight in caravans or wooden huts on skis. Russia does not have Norway’s consultative system — its regional governors are often swapped by the Kremlin — making things easier for companies able to navigate Kremlin politics but leaving the Nenets little power, wealth or legal redress. Gazprom says it goes out of its way to cooperate with herders, raising pipelines to let reindeer pass underneath and making road crossings where herders request them. “Around 10,000 reindeer cross via these crossing points during a season,” it said by email. Oskal, Pogodaev and some academics say Gazprom does plan carefully, but, like all energy majors, it is in the environmental firing line over its impact on global warming, which is speeding up as the polar ice caps melt. In Norway, some reindeer herders and fishermen noted efforts by Italian oil group ENI to cooperate, for instance using Sami interpreters and discussing the sitting of an electric cable that takes power to the Goliat oilfield offshore. Norwegian Equinor, formerly Statoil, operates the offshore gas field, Snoehvit, in Norway’s Barents Sea, sending gas to a liquefied natural gas plant near the northern town of Hammerfest. The government is offering exploration licences ever further north, in areas covered by winter sea ice until recent decades. Some reindeer herders see the influx of workers as a potential new market for their meat, but say companies rarely buy enough. A 2007 U.N. declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples obliges states to “obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands”. In practice, that usually stops short of a veto and lawsuits abound. In neighbouring Sweden, the government has appealed to the Supreme Court to resolve a dispute over management of hunting and fishing rights in the Sami village of Girjas. And there is a long-running conflict over the Kallak magnetite iron ore deposit near Jokkmokk in Norrbotten county, where British miner Beowulf Mining (BEM.L) is pursuing an exploitation concession for the Kallak North project. The Swedish government has not yet taken a final decision. In Finland, opposition from Sami people and environmentalists has blocked proposed geological surveys for iron ore, copper and gold in the Sami region of Enontekio. It is not only herders and companies that are facing off. Conflicts of interest between those continuing millennia-old traditions and other residents and visitors are increasing. Across the Arctic from Norway, in Canada, Lloyd Binder said his 4,000-strong reindeer herd at Inuvik, the country’s biggest, had suffered poaching since a new highway opened to cars in November. Bruce Davis, of the Midnite Sun Reindeer Ranch in Alaska, says he has just 40 reindeer left from a herd of 8,000 in his father’s day. It was partly because many had mixed with wild caribou, but damage by past gold prospectors and climate change had also taken their toll on the reindeer’s pastures. Still, some reindeer find ways around their problems. In Norway’s Hammerfest, a 19-km (12-mile) long wooden fence, built a decade ago with money from Equinor, has a gaping hole. “The reindeer are annoying ... They eat all the flowers I plant,” said Karin Karlsen, 78, knitting on her patio while reindeer nibbled at the grass behind her red wooden house.

2018-07-09,"MELBOURNE, July 9 (Reuters) - An Australian regulator said on Monday it had found some safety problems on the offshore gas platform for Japanese firm Inpex Corp’s Ichthys LNG project off northern Australia and was considering enforcement action. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) found “defiencies in the suitability of electrical equipment in hazardous areas” during a four-day inspection of the Ichthys Explorer platform in late June, a spokeswoman said in emailed comments. Inpex had hoped to start producing gas from the long delayed $40 billion project in June, but the company’s new chief executive, Takayuki Ueda, told Reuters last week the company still had to address “various minor issues”. “Inpex has informed NOPSEMA that it has delayed introducing hydrocarbons to the platform to address the identified deficiencies,” the NOPSEMA spokeswoman said. An Inpex spokeswoman declined to comment on the specific technical issues. During final safety checks required before start-up some minor areas for improvement were identified, but they posed “no major challenges”, she said. “We are firmly committed to the safety of our workers above all else and will only commence production from the wellhead when we are satisfied that final safety verifications are completed,” the spokeswoman said. Ichthys will send gas from the offshore central processing facility through an 890-km (550-mile) pipeline to the mainland near the city of Darwin, where it will be chilled into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export. NOPSEMA said its inspection has yet to be formally concluded so it could not provide any further details. Enforcement steps available to the regulator range from issuing improvement notices or prohibition notices regarding a specific activity up to civil and criminal prosecutions for major breaches, according to its web site (here).

2018-07-09,"(Repeats item from July 6, no changes in text.) By Josephine Mason BEIJING, July 6 (Reuters) - Washington imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on Friday and Beijing has said it will retaliate with punitive measures on U.S. products worth a similar amount, including soybeans, pork and cotton. The Chinese government had not officially confirmed on Friday afternoon that the retaliatory tariffs had taken effect. But the tit-for-tat measures have escalated the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies and the world’s commodities markets are increasingly embroiled in the bust-up. The higher U.S. tariffs went into effect just after noon in Beijing (0401 GMT). The U.S. and China have also issued a second batch of proposed duties on $16 billion of each other’s goods. These would hit U.S. energy exports, such as coal and crude oil, among other areas. It is unclear when these will come into effect. Below is a detailed breakdown of the markets affected by the tariffs imposed and proposed: * Beijing’s tariffs will have the biggest impact on soybeans, the United States’ top agricultural export to China in 2017 worth about $12.7 billion, hurting U.S. farmers in states, such as Iowa and Texas, which backed Republican President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Buying interest in U.S. beans from China, the world’s top importer of the oilseed, has slowed to a trickle ahead of the tariffs, with one remaining U.S. cargo heading for China still on the water. The vessel, Peak Pegasus, carrying 70,000 tonnes of the U.S. oilseed for state grain trader Sinograin, was due to arrive in the port of Dalian at 5:00 p.m. (0900 GMT) on Friday, just hours after the duties went into effect. Some shipments marked for China were due to be loaded from the U.S. Pacific Northwest, and are likely to get sent elsewhere as exporters scramble to avoid paying the tariff, a U.S. trader said. In the months ahead though, China will struggle to replace the U.S. beans, forcing processors, which crush the beans to make oil and animal feed, to pay the extra duty or find substitutes. Rabobank reckons China may have to buy up to 15 million tonnes of U.S. beans at tariff prices. Crushers may not pass on the inflated cost at least in the short term, further eroding their already low margins, the bank said in a research note. The biggest impact will likely be seen in sales of the next U.S. crop, which will come to market in September. In the meantime, Brazil, the world’s top exporter, will likely pick up the slack, although a trade association warned on Thursday the South American country may need to import the oilseed from the United States this year to satisfy demand from local processors. * U.S. pork was already saddled with duties enacted in an earlier round of the trade row and now faces an extra 25 percent tariff that would raise the total charges up to 62 percent. European pork will gain some ground over the U.S., which shipped almost $500 million worth of pork to China last year. U.S. shipments have nearly ground to a halt since the 25 percent tariffs implemented on April 2. * A record volume of U.S. crude oil is heading to China even as Beijing’s planned tariffs threaten to cut off a relatively new and burgeoning business for U.S. exporters. Nine vessels with 26.6 million barrels of crude oil loaded in Texas and Alaska and worth about $2 billion are due to land over the next five weeks, Thomson Reuters trade flow data shows. That equates to 700,000 barrels per day, 8 percent of China’s daily imports and a large volume for the United States, a newcomer to the Chinese market. If enacted, the import duty would make U.S. oil less competitive than other crudes, likely causing a decline in Chinese purchases and forcing U.S. oil firms to find other buyers. Amid a relatively well-supplied global oil market, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the United States “would find it hard to find an alternative market that is as big as China,” as Chinese buyers make up 20 percent of U.S. overseas crude sales. China would likely replace the lost U.S. barrels from their top sellers Russia or Saudi Arabia, which have recently announced plans to raise output. Among other energy products, China noticeably spared U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from potential import tariffs, but in doing so, it has preserved a potential weapon should the trade war with Washington deepen. However, coal could be caught in the crossfire if the second batch of duties are introduced. Replacing American shipments with coal from other places would not be difficult for China, but a loss of business with the world’s top importer of the fuel would hurt companies in West Virginia, a state that heavily favoured Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

2018-07-09,"TOKYO, July 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up in early Asian trading on Monday, with many investors focused on any fallout from the U.S. imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods at the end of last week, which prompted immediate retaliation from China. Global benchmark Brent was up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, at 77.25 a barrel by 0113 GMT. On Friday, the contract slipped 28 cents to settle at $77.11 a barrel. U.S. crude futures added 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $73.88 after trading slightly lower earlier in the morning. They gained 86 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $73.80 a barrel on Friday. Oil prices are likely to be weighed down by the trade conflict as investors are concerned about the impact of the tariffs and counter tariffs on global economic growth, analysts said. “(Nonetheless) supply disruptions in Libya and Canada may put upward pressure on prices in the near-term,” ANZ said in a morning note, adding that recent data showed “an increase in the net-long positioning of hedge funds on Brent crude”. The United States and China exchanged the first salvos in what could become a protracted trade war on Friday, slapping tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others’ goods and giving no sign of willingness to start talks aimed at a reaching a truce. Supply disruptions are giving some support, with an outage at a major Canadian oil sands facility cutting regional supply. The stoppage at the 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) Syncrude facility in Canada has contributed to a sharp reduction in the discount for U.S. crude versus Brent crude over the past month. U.S. producers are continuing to bring more rigs into oilfields already producing at record levels. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, was up by five in the week to July 6, according to General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm. That brings the total count to 863, up 100 from last year. Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick

2018-07-09,"* Sterling hit as two UK ministers resign over Brexit * Nikkei leads Asia shares higher in early trade * Balanced U.S. jobs data suggest Fed can stay gradual on hikes By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, July 9 (Reuters) - Asian share markets crept higher on Monday following favourable U.S. jobs data, while sterling slipped after two members of the British government resigned over Brexit and put the future of Prime Minister Theresa May in doubt. The pound peeled off around a third of a U.S. cent to $1.3292 in early trading as news broke British Brexit Secretary David Davis and Brexit Minister Steven Baker had resigned. The loss came just two days after a meeting at May’s Chequers country residence supposedly sealed a cabinet deal on Brexit and underlines the deep divisions in her ruling Conservative Party over the departure from the EU. Sentiment in other markets was mostly positive after Friday’s U.S. payrolls report showed tame wages and more people looking for work. “The combination of rising employment and increased labour force participation suggests healthy but not tightening labour market conditions in June, something that will allow the Fed to continue to hike rates at a gradual pace,” said Kevin Cummins, a senior U.S. economist at RBS. The balanced report helped Wall Street end last week in the black and Japan’s Nikkei followed up with gains of 1 percent on Monday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2 percent, on top of 0.7 percent rally on Friday when the launch of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports came and went without too many fireworks. “While trade tensions fan concerns about the future, incoming data show a soaring U.S. economy, a healthy labour market, and some rebound in Europe and Japan,” said Barclays economist Michael Gapen. “For now, overall policies and financial conditions still support growth and investment,” he added. “A sharper-than-expected China slowdown from a domestic credit crunch and external trade tensions could be the main risk to global growth.” The focus this week would be on Chinese data for June covering inflation, new loans and international trade. The United States also releases inflation figures, while the Bank of Canada might well hike rates on Wednesday. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar was mostly softer following the jobs report, with sterling being an exception. Against a basket of currencies the dollar had pulled back to 93.925, from a top of 94.486 on Friday. The euro held its gains at $1.1750, while the dollar was flat on the yen at 110.48. In commodity markets, oil prices were little moved in early trade after a mixed end to last week. U.S. crude futures gained 2 cents to $73.82 a barrel, while Brent eased 1 cent to $77.10 a barrel. Gold was little changed at $1,256.39 an ounce.

2018-07-09,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Protesters blocked streets in Haiti on Sunday while many damaged or looted stores stayed closed for a third day following anger over steep fuel price increases in the Caribbean nation. The mostly young protesters used felled trees and large rocks to block roads, as well as piles of tires set on fire, some of which still smoldered on Sunday, sending up thick clouds of black smoke. Police used tear gas to disperse crowds in some places. The charred remains of cars could be seen in several spots around the sprawling capital, including in front of the Best Western and Oasis hotels, in the capital’s southern hilltop suburb of Petion-Ville, as well as near the offices of telecommunications company Natcom. The U.S. embassy warned its citizens to avoid the unrest in the capital Port-au-Prince and reschedule travel plans as several airlines cancelled flights. At the Toussaint Louverture international airport, dozens of stranded travellers camped out waiting for flights to resume, lounging on suitcases. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant announced the temporary suspension of double-digit government hikes to prices for gasoline, diesel and kerosene on Saturday afternoon - just a day after they were announced - but the unrest continued.  Across the capital, few cars and motorcycles were moving on the rubble-strewn streets on Sunday, while broken windows and damaged buildings were a common sight. At a shopping centre in Petion-Ville, police tried to secure shops, with broken glass and merchandise scattered on the floor. Both the Canadian and Mexican embassies in Haiti announced that they would be closed on Monday. The decision to raise fuel prices was part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which requires the impoverished country to enact measures to boost government revenue and services and strengthen the country’s economy. “Due to continuing demonstrations, roadblocks, and violence across Port-au-Prince, as well as short staffing at the airports, embassy personnel have been instructed to re-book any flights originally scheduled for Sunday,” the U.S. embassy said in a statement. A spokesman for U.S. carrier American Airlines Group Inc said it had cancelled three out of seven round trip flights scheduled to stop in Port-au-Prince on Sunday. The carrier’s Sunday route to Haiti’s Cap-Haitien airport had not been cancelled. JetBlue Airways Corp also cancelled its flights to Haiti on Sunday. Haiti’s Commerce and Economic ministries Friday said they would lower fuel subsidies in a bid to generate more tax revenue to better fund government services, which translated to a 38 percent jump for gasoline and 47 percent for diesel.
