2018-07-14,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant resigned on Saturday as he faced a non-confidence vote after a move to lower fuel subsidies prompted days of violent protests in the impoverished Caribbean nation. In a speech to the Lower Chamber that was broadcast live on television, Lafontant defended his tenure but said that Haiti’s President Jovenel Moise had accepted his resignation.  “As I told you, I am at service to the Republic,” Lafontant said. Earlier this month, the Haitian government announced a reduction of fuel subsidies as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The move translated to a 38 percent rise in gasoline prices and 47 percent hike for diesel, triggering protests during which demonstrators barricaded roads, looted stores and set cars ablaze in the capital, Port-au-Prince.  The unrest caused embassies to close and airlines to suspend flights to Haiti for days. Lafontant announced a temporary reversal of the policy in a bid to quell the demonstrations, but the protests continued. A no-confidence vote in his leadership had been scheduled for Saturday, according to the Miami Herald. The IMF said on Thursday that it expects Haiti to create a revised reform plan that will include a gradual lowering of fuel subsidies. A medical doctor and political novice, Lafontant became prime minister in March 2017 with ambitious plans to boost agricultural production, improve infrastructure and expand access to clean water.

2018-07-14,"* Norway union to add 900 workers to rig strike from Monday * Strike to have no imminent extra impact on oil, gas output By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, July 14 (Reuters) - Norway’s ship-owners and two oil unions said on Saturday they planned no compromise talks to end a five-day strike over wages and pension benefits before a planned escalation of the stoppage from Monday. Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, closing Shell’s Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. One of the unions, Safe, plans to escalate actions from Monday (Sunday 2200 GMT) and send 901 more workers on strike. The stoppage will have no immediate extra impact on oil and gas output. The Norwegian Ship-owners’ Association said it planned no contact to resolve the strike before the deadline and was considering countermeasures instead. “A middle way is not a solution. Our position is unchanged. I don’t think that there will be any contact during the weekend,” the Ship-owners’ Association chief negotiator Jakob Korsgaard told Reuters. The Safe union also told Reuters on Saturday that it expected no contact before the planned escalation. The employees who will join the action work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by Saipem, Transocean, Songa Offshore, Odfjell Drilling, Archer and COSL, among others. Chief executive John Lechner of Archer, from which more than 100 workers plan to strike, hitting drilling operations and possibly future output from Aker BP’s wells in Valhall field, also said he did not know of any efforts to resolve the standoff. The employers, who say workers already have fair wages, are considering countermeasures if the strike doesn’t end soon. “Obviously a conflict like this cannot go on for ever. All counter-measures are considered,” said Korsgaard, without giving details. In 2012, employers threatened to shut down all oil and gas operations in Norway after a weeks-long strike choked off 13 percent of the country’s output. In that strike, the government ordered offshore workers back to work to avoid a total shutdown, invoking laws that allow it to end strikes that threaten big economic damage. “The government has that measure if they find it relevant,” said Korsgaard.

2018-07-14,"(Adds production dropping, NOC statement, worker’s nationality) BENGHAZI, Libya, July 14 (Reuters) - Production at Libya’s giant Sharara oil field was expected to fall by at least 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) on Saturday after two staff were abducted in an attack by an unknown group, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said. The attack happened at a control station on the outskirts of Sharara, about 40 km (25 miles) from the main part of the field, engineers at the field said. One of the abducted workers was Romanian, they said. NOC said it expected output to drop by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd), although one engineer said output at the field, which had been producing 200,000-300,000 bpd recently, had already dropped to below 100,000 bpd. Tripoli-based NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor , formerly known as Statoil. The field, in Libya’s remote southwest, has suffered security problems in the past, including raids in which vehicles and mobile phones have been stolen. The facility that was targeted on Saturday is called Station 186 and was also attacked last year. The NOC said unknown armed assailants entered the station at 6.30 a.m. (4.30 GMT) on Saturday. “Four of the station staff were initially kidnapped but two of them have been since released,” it said. “Oil wells in the surrounding area have been shut down as a precaution, and all other workers evacuated.” An engineer at the field said one of the abducted workers was Romanian. In addition to being one of Libya’s main export grades, Sharara feeds the 120,000 bpd Zawiya oil refinery on the country’s northwest coast.

2018-07-14,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said state-controlled utility CEZ could expand its nuclear capacity via a subsidiary, and reiterated his opposition to splitting the company. Babis’s government postponed a decision on building new nuclear units in May, saying it needed more time to evaluate the impact on its budget and find out European Union views on state aid for such a project. CEZ operates two nuclear power plants in the EU member country, in Dukovany and Temelin. “It is a simple operation. I would take Dukovany, appraise it, put it into a 100-percent subsidiary, run a tender for a supplier, financing and possibly even a joint-venture,” Babis said in an interview published on Saturday by the Mlada Fronta Dnes daily paper. “Let CEZ guarantee that, so that is has good conditions. And to make it even better and more serious, the state can be the second one guaranteeing,” Babis said. Besides splitting CEZ, which Babis has opposed, and a subsidiary building the new blocs, his government has been working on one more option - that the government could buy a small CEZ unit to build the plants. CEZ chief executive Daniel Benes has said that a state-owned part of CEZ would be best placed to build the new nuclear blocs.  The nuclear project and other matters have been on the back-burner since October, as Czechs did not have a full-fledged government until Thursday when Babis’s second minority government, leaning on far-left Communists, finally got the backing of parliament. CEZ has refused to invest into new plants without some form of state support.

2018-07-14,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Protesters stormed the provincial government building in the Iraqi city of Kerbala on Saturday as protests over poor public services and corruption across southern Iraq entered their sixth day. Demonstrations also took place in the cities of Najaf and Basra, where security forces announced city-wide curfews amid reports of skirmishes between protesters and local militia groups. In Basra, seven protesters were injured after clashing with guards belonging to a local militia group, security forces said. Oil exports from Basra account for more than 95 percent of OPEC producer Iraq’s state revenues. Any potential disruptions could severely impact Iraq’s limping economy, though officials said the protests had not so far impacted crude production. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced that his government would release funds to Basra for water, electricity and health services, state television said. Earlier, Abadi, who also serves as commander-in-chief of Iraq’s armed forces, had issued a nationwide order placing security forces on high alert in the southern provinces in response to the protests.     Reinforcement troops from both the Counter-Terrorism Service and the Army’s Ninth Division have already been dispatched to Basra to help protect the province’s oil fields, security sources said. Abadi’s directive aims to stem the burgeoning protests, which on Friday spread from Basra - where residents had blocked access to the nearby commodities port of Umm Qasr - to the cities of Amara, Nasiriya and the Shi’ite holy city of Najaf.         Hundreds of Iraqis stormed the airport and halted air traffic in Najaf on Friday. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, had expressed solidarity with protesters, saying they faced an “extreme lack of public services” such as electricity in the suffocating summer heat. Sistani, who has millions of followers, rarely intervenes in politics, but has wide sway over public opinion. Dozens of protesters demonstrated on Saturday at the Safwan border crossing with Kuwait as well as at the entrance to the Majnoon oil field, one of the largest in the country which lies 40 km (25 miles) north of Basra, local security sources said. However, they did not enter the facility. Iraqi politicians face growing unrest as they try to form a coalition government after a May 12 parliamentary election tainted by allegations of fraud.  Abadi is heading a fragile caretaker government, in place until the new government is formed. A political bloc led by cleric Moqtada al-Sadr won a majority in the poll on an anti-corruption platform which had appeal across Iraq’s electorate.

2018-07-14,"(Adds details) By Chijioke Ohuocha ABUJA, July 14 (Reuters) - Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, has signed a $650 million loan facility with the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) for his oil refinery project in Nigeria. The seven-year term loan would attract a moratorium of five years, according to facility terms read out during the signing. Cairo-based Africa’s trade bank also signed a $750 million facility with Nigeria’s development bank, the Bank of Industry. Reuters witnessed the signing of both loans on Saturday. Dangote Group Executive Director Devakumar Edwin told Reuters last week that the oil refinery would cost around $10 billion and should be completed by December 2019. He said the company would borrow $3.3 billion for the project, arranged by Standard Chartered Bank. The remainder will be funded by equity and through export agencies. Dangote built his fortune on cement and now has interests in flour milling, agriculture and real estate. He is building the world’s largest single oil refinery and also expanding into fertiliser, aiming to address long-standing problems in Nigeria’s energy markets. The refinery and petrochemical complex is located on 25,000 hectares of swampy land with a jetty to ferry products by sea within Nigeria and abroad including an undersea pipeline to transport gas. It would account for half of Dangote’s sprawling assets when it is finished next year. Dangote intends to process different grades of crude to meet local demand for refined petroleum products and also target export markets abroad. Afreximbank, celebrating its 25 years of operation this year, aims to foster intra-African trade through the creation of a payment platform to ease settlement and currency risks.

South Korea said on Friday it had scrambled military aircraft to intercept two Russian bomber jets that flew into its air defence identification zone (KADIZ) four times that day. The South Korean foreign ministry summoned a senior Russian diplomat and “expressed regrets and urged the incident not to happen again”, it said in a statement. South Korea’s defence ministry called in a Russian military official and lodged a protest about the incursion. “Russian military planes’ KADIZ entry will never help stabilise the Korean peninsula as well as Northeast Asia and the possibility of mid-air collision cannot be ruled out,” the defence ministry said in a statement. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that two Russian TU-95 bombers escorted by Su-35 fighter jets flew over the international waters of the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea and the eastern part of the Pacific Ocean. The Russian military said they were escorted by Korean F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and Japanese F-2A war planes “on some stages of the route”.
