2018-04-03,"(Agnia Grigas is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Her latest books include “The New Geopolitics of Natural Gas” and “Beyond Crimea: The New Russian Empire.” The opinions expressed here are her own.) By Agnia Grigas April 3 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has just held his first Baltic Summit with the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. At the media briefing after Tuesday’s meeting, the U.S. president re-affirmed America’s commitment to their “deep and lasting friendship” and praised his Baltic counterparts for doing “terrific jobs.” With tensions rising between Moscow and NATO, these three countries are indeed important U.S. allies – and the administration would do well to learn from their hard-earned expertise on the frontline of Russia’s energy, cyber and propaganda war. The summit, which took place against a backdrop of diplomatic expulsions after Britain blamed Moscow for poisoning a former Russian spy in the UK and just days after Russia test-fired its new intercontinental ballistic missile Sarmat, was of enormous strategic significance. When President Barack Obama met with the leaders of the three Baltic nations in Washington in 2015 he called them the United States’ “most reliable allies in NATO.” More recently, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to the Baltic states during his visit to the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 2017, saying that the United States stands firmly behind NATO’s Article 5 pledge of mutual defense of Alliance members: “An attack on one of us is an attack on us all.” The Baltic leaders received the same message from Trump, who praised their commitment to “burden-sharing” in the costs of NATO. The U.S. president should now craft a careful policy to show Washington’s support for the needs of the nations run by Lithuania’s Dalia Grybauskaite, Estonia’s Kersti Kaljulaid and Latvia’s Raimonds Vejonis. The Baltic states are not simply recipients of NATO’S protection; they are also active supporters of U.S. foreign policy. Since joining the alliance in 2004, the Baltic countries have participated in a number of NATO missions. They have deployed their troops to Afghanistan as part of NATO-led operations and sent soldiers to Iraq to fight Islamic State. In addition, they are hosting NATO battalions in their countries as part of a broader bid to deter Russian aggression. Washington, which already has sent troops to Norway and Poland, should consider rotating American troops through the Baltic republics in the coming years as well. All three Baltic states have gradually increased their share of GDP on defense since 2010. Estonia was one of only five NATO allies that met the benchmark of 2 percent spending in 2017; Lithuania and Latvia reached the target this year. Lithuania also reintroduced conscription in 2015, while Estonia has had the draft since the 1990s. Following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and since boosting their defense budgets, they will spend a total of around $2 billion on defense by 2020. The Baltic republics have also been purchasing American military equipment, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles. While Trump has been vocal about expecting NATO countries to boost their defense spending, the administration should help the Baltic countries outline their broader defense priorities once they’ve achieved this objective. In addition, Washington should broaden its cooperation with the three key NATO Centers of Excellence based in the Baltic states. These institutions, which include the Energy Security Centre in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre in Tallinn, Estonia and the Strategic Communications Centre in Riga, Latvia, are intended to train and educate specialists from NATO member and partner countries. While all three are already contributing to NATO operations, the United States should increase the involvement of U.S. experts in these hubs. Looking further east, Washington should turn to its Baltic allies for advice on plans to provide support for the nascent democracies in the East. The Baltic states and Poland have particularly close relations with countries like Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in the European Union’s Eastern Partnership (EaP); the leaders who met with Trump in Washington this week are among the best placed and informed to take the lead in shaping EU policy on this initiative. The Trump administration should also take guidance from the Baltic leaders on the best way to optimize programs like the Washington’s Emerging Donors Challenge Fund, which allows USAID to partner with 10 donor countries on a range of development and anti-corruption programs. The Baltic states are not only allies in the defense sector. In 2017, Lithuania began importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States. Along with Poland’s LNG terminal expansion and Polish and Lithuanian purchases of American LNG, this signals a powerful challenge to Russia’s dominance in Europe’s gas markets. While the globalization of natural gas markets is boosting diversification options for gas-importing states, the arrival of American gas to this region is strategically important. The first meeting between Trump and his Baltic counterparts was more than a symbolic encounter. With the rise of Russian aggression, it was important to reaffirm the United States’ support for its friends on Europe’s frontlines. But it was also an opportunity for the Trump administration to build deeper relationships that move beyond rhetoric with often-overlooked allies.

2018-04-03,"April 3 (Reuters) - EDP Renewables and four other companies have joined with a Northern California power provider to develop the first U.S. offshore wind farm to boast advanced floating turbines, the group said in a statement on Tuesday. The Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA), a local government authority that provides electricity to most of California’s Humboldt County, solicited bids for an offshore wind project earlier this year because it is seeking to generate more of its power needs locally. The group plans to submit an unsolicited lease application to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in May or June of this year, said Lori Biondini, director of business development for RCEA. In the meantime, it is speaking to fishing industry and Department of Defense representatives about suitable locations for the wind farm. The wind power will help balance out the large amounts of solar energy consumed in RCEA’s territory, Biondini said. Currently RCEA sources solar from Southern California and wind energy from Oregon and Washington. Humboldt County has the best wind resources off the coast of California, the group said in a statement, but the deep water along its coast has prevented development of standard, fixed offshore wind turbines. Floating wind turbines are costly and have not been deployed widely. A small, 30 megawatt floating wind farm began operating off the coast of Scotland last year. The Humboldt County project is expected to be between 100 and 150 MW, the group said. Participants in the project include floating wind turbine maker Principle Power Inc, Aker Solutions, ecological consultants H.T. Harvey & Associates and environmental consulting firm Herrera Environmental Consultants Inc.

2018-04-03,"PARIS (Reuters) - France on Tuesday wished Abdel Fattah al-Sisi success for his next presidential term in Egypt and said it stood “resolutely” with the country on the fight against terrorism. Sisi, who had no real opposition, was re-elected for a second term with 97 percent of the vote, official returns showed.  “France offers its wishes for the full success of President Sisi for his second mandate,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von Der Muhll said in a daily briefing. “It hopes that his reelection will allow him to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people for security, prosperity and the full expression of freedoms in a constitutional framework,” she said without elaborating. With both France and Egypt concerned by the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt, the two countries have cultivated even closer economic and military ties under Sisi. Rights organizations have accused France under President Emmanuel Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi’s government. After hosting Sisi in Paris in October, Macron said it was not up to him to “lecture” Egypt on civil liberties. “France stands resolutely alongside Egypt to face the common challenge of terrorism, to work for the solution of regional crises and to develop cooperation at the United Nations, in Africa and in the Mediterranean,” von Der Muhll said. She added that Paris would continue its dialogue with Egypt on human rights and fundamental freedoms.

2018-04-03,"(Adds statement from Renewable Fuels Association) By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency has exempted one of the nation’s largest oil refining companies, Andeavor, from complying with U.S. biofuels regulations - a waiver historically reserved for tiny operations in danger of going belly up, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The exemption, which applies to the three smallest of Andeavor’s ten refineries, marks the first evidence of the EPA freeing a highly profitable multi-billion dollar company from the costly mandates of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. The law requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline or purchase credits from those who do such blending. The decision, which has not been previously reported, raises the question of whether other big and profitable oil firms with small refineries - such as Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Phillips 66 - also have or could receive the waivers, which are granted by the EPA in secret. Such waivers were designed for refineries producing less than 75,000 barrels per day that can demonstrate that they suffer a “disproportionate economic hardship” from the costs of RFS compliance. Andeavor posted net profits of about $1.5 billion last year. The EPA exemption, granted about a month ago, could reduce Andeavor’s regulatory costs by more than $50 million this year, based on the number of biofuels credits that two brokers say the refiner recently sold into the market, along with previous disclosures by firms that own refineries of a similar size. Biofuels credit prices tied to ethanol dropped by 6 cents, to 38 cents each, after Reuters reported Andeavor’s exemption, traders said. Andeavor shares jumped by more than 1 percent on the news, hitting a session high of $102.78. Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, reacted to the report by calling the exemption an “outrageous abuse” of the law. “Providing a small refiner waiver to a company like Andeavor is laughable and abandons the commitment of President Trump to protect the RFS,” he said in a statement. The exemption releases the firm of its obligation to provide the EPA with biofuels credits proving compliance at the three refineries - two located in North Dakota and one in Utah - for the year 2016, which would have come due this year, the sources said. Andeavor is also asking EPA for a waiver for its 2017 obligations for the same refineries, but has not yet received a decision, the sources said. Andeavor spokeswoman Destin Singleton declined to comment. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman did not immediately comment in response to Reuters inquiries on Monday and Tuesday. As a matter of policy, the agency refuses to release any information on the waivers, or to name their recipients, citing concerns over disclosing private business information. The EPA denied a Freedom of Information Act request from Reuters seeking information on companies receiving the waivers. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Phillips 66 also own refineries small enough to meet the barrel-per-day standard, as does billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn - whose efforts last year to overhaul the biofuels program drew scrutiny from federal investigators. Icahn, majority owner of refiner CVR Energy, had served as an advisor to Trump on regulatory issues during his push to reform biofuels regulations early last year, but he resigned amid allegations that the role gave him a conflict of interest. Spokespeople for all four companies declined to comment on whether they had applied for or received any exemptions. The lucrative waivers are typically only reported if a publicly-traded firm considers them to be material to their financial or operational performance, in which case they must disclose the information through Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The RFS has long been a lightning rod of conflict between the corn lobby, which supports the policy as an engine for demand, and refiners who say it costs them a fortune. The White House has sought to broker a deal between two of its key political constituencies in a series of meetings, but the effort has failed to yield policy changes acceptable to both sides. Ethanol industry advocates argue exemptions for refiners undermine the intent of the law, originally designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependence on foreign oil and boost farm economies. While the EPA’s motives in providing hardship waivers are unclear, the exemptions are one of the tools at the administration’s disposal to ease financial pressure on refiners without undertaking a reform of the RFS policy. EPA chief Scott Pruitt, appointed by Trump, has repeatedly said the RFS is too costly to oil refiners and should be overhauled. But Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, told an agriculture conference in February that Trump “stands with corn farmers, biofuels farmers and the RFS,” according to a recording heard by Reuters. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to a question about whether the administration was expanding the use of the RFS waivers to help refiners. Bowman, of the EPA, also did not comment on the question. Andeavor’s waiver follows a successful lawsuit by another refiner, Sinclair Oil, last year challenging the strict standard the EPA has used under past administrations for determining financial hardship. “The EPA’s interpretation takes the statutory language too far,” wrote Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. “A ‘hardship’ is something that makes one’s life hard or difficult - not just something that makes continued existence impossible.” The lawsuit - along with a perception that the Trump administration might be more sympathetic to refiners - has sparked a big increase in applications from refining firms for he exemptions this year. More than 30 refineries have sought the waivers, according to sources familiar with the matter. In a typical year, the EPA would receive about 12 to 15 requests for hardship exemptions and would grant about half of them, a former official familiar with the program told Reuters. Andeavor sold some 100 million of those credits to its competitors in recent weeks, according to two brokers in the biofuels credit market. The company otherwise would have needed to provide those credits to the EPA to prove compliance with the RFS. Those credits would be worth about $58 million based on a Reuters calculation of average renewable fuel RIN prices this year. In the past, other companies have said the exemptions they were granted saved them tens of millions of dollars, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Last year, for example, HollyFrontier disclosed a reduction of almost $58 million in its costs of credits for two refineries for 2016. Refiners granted exemptions win in two ways: They no longer have to blend biofuels or buy credits to comply with the law, and they can sell any credits they had previously purchased to use for compliance.

2018-04-03,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly a dozen U.S. states and Washington D.C. on Tuesday promised to defend federal automobile efficiency standards against a rollback proposed this week by Scott Pruitt, the embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency. “All Americans ... deserve to enjoy fuel-efficient, low-emission cars and light trucks that save money on gas, improve our health and support American jobs,” the attorneys general from 11 states said in a statement responding to Pruitt’s proposal on Monday to ease the Obama-era standards.  The standards called for roughly doubling by 2025 the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon. Proponents say they help spur innovation in clean technologies and cut emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. California has long been allowed by an EPA waiver to impose stricter standards than Washington does on vehicle emissions of some pollutants. And 12 other states follow California’s lead on cleaner cars. The attorneys general, from states including New York, Iowa and Massachusetts, said they would challenge a rollback in court. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has already threatened to sue in defence of the standards.  The statement, also signed by more than 50 mayors from around the country, said automakers have been making progress in meeting the national standards and that compliance costs have been lower than projected. Auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011 as part of a bailout deal. But they have urged Pruitt and President Donald Trump to revise the standards so it becomes easier and less costly to meet the targets. Pruitt defended his decision at EPA headquarters on Tuesday. “We have nothing to be apologetic about with respect to the progress we’ve made in reducing emissions as a country,” Pruitt said. The EPA will make sure that U.S. consumers would not have to buy more expensive autos as a result of efficiency standards, he said. Pruitt, a former attorney general of Oklahoma, a major oil producer, has been criticised by politicians after reports that he paid well below market rates to live in a condo owned by a lobbyist who deals with issues overseen by his agency. Trump  and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly phoned Pruitt this week to say they support him, an administration source said on Tuesday.

The gains were in part the result of a technical rebound from Monday’s losses, as well as a recovery in the equities market, Macaluso said. Wall Street’s main indexes were higher on Tuesday as technology and consumer discretionary stocks recovered from Monday’s sharp selloff. Also lending support was Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak’s comments on Tuesday that a joint organization for cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries may be set up once the current deal on oil output curbs expires at the end of this year. However, an expected increase in U.S. crude inventories limited price gains. U.S. crude inventories, widely viewed as a litmus test of the broader trend in global inventories, are expected to have risen for the second straight week. According to a Reuters poll on Tuesday, analysts anticipated a 200,000 barrel crude stock build in the week to March 30. The American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly inventory data later on Tuesday and the U.S. government releases its figures on Wednesday. There is also an element of seasonality at play, said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP. “Yesterday was a little more dramatic than might typically be the case, but it’s entirely in keeping with seasonal peaking risk that the month of April brings to crude oil,” he said. Also weighing on the market is speculative length, after money managers last week raised their bullish bets on crude. “With excessive hedge fund positions still looming over the market, profit-taking should weigh on oil prices over the coming weeks,” Julius Baer head of commodities and macro research Norbert Ruecker said. Prices for physical barrels of oil in the North Sea are around their lowest since last June, as extensive refinery maintenance across the region eats into demand.

2018-04-03,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The leaders of Turkey and Russia marked the official start of work to build Turkey’s first nuclear power station on Tuesday, launching construction of the $20 billion Akkuyu plant in the southern province of Mersin. The plant will be built by Russian state nuclear energy agency Rosatom and will be made up of four units each with a capacity of 1,200 megawatts. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Tayyip Erdogan marked the start to construction, watching by video link from Ankara. “When all four units go online, the plant will meet 10 percent of Turkey’s energy needs,” Erdogan said, adding that despite delays Turkey still planned to start generating power at the first unit in 2023. Speaking at a later news conference with Putin, Erdogan said the cost of the project may exceed the planned $20 billion for the 4,800 megawatt (MW) plant, part of Erdogan’s “2023 vision” marking 100 years since the founding of modern Turkey and intended to reduce Turkey’s dependence on energy imports. Since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010, the project has been beset by delays. Last month, sources familiar with the matter said Akkuyu was likely to miss its 2023 target start-up date, but Rosatom, which is looking for local partners to take a 49 percent stake in the project, said it is committed to the timetable. The Interfax news agency cited the head of Rosatom saying the sale of the 49 percent stake was likely to be postponed from this year until 2019. Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources have said. Erdogan told the news conference Turkey may cooperate with Russia on defence projects besides the S-400 missile defence system which Moscow has agreed to supply to Ankara. He did not give further details. Turkey signed an agreement to buy the S-400 system in late December in a move which raised concern in the West because it cannot be integrated into NATO’s military architecture.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will join Erdogan and Putin for a three-way summit on Syria in Ankara on Wednesday.

2018-04-03,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor said on Tuesday that the government campaign against corruption, which targeted the business and political elite last year, would work its way through lower-level offences. “The campaign is ongoing as long as there is even a simple case (of corruption) ... and it will not end until (all) corruption cases are finished,” prosecutor Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb told state television in a clip posted online, without providing details. Authorities rounded up dozens of princes, top officials and businessmen in November on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s orders, with many confined and interrogated at Riyadh’s opulent Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Most detainees, including global investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, were released after being exonerated or reaching financial settlements with the government, which says it arranged to seize more than $100 billion through such deals. The Ritz was cleared out and reopened to the public in February, though 56 people who had not reached settlements by then remained in custody and could face trial. Prince Mohammed is currently touring the United States to promote investment in the kingdom, touting the corruption sweep as critical to transforming an oil-dependent economy long plagued by graft but now contending with lower global crude prices. Yet the campaign remains shrouded in secrecy with few specific allegations or details of financial settlements revealed.

2018-04-03,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the warring sides in Yemen on Tuesday to reach a political settlement to end a conflict that is now in its fourth year and has left 22 million people in urgent need of aid. His Special Envoy Martin Griffiths will head to the United Arab Emirates, Oman and the Yemeni government-held city of Aden in the drive for peace, Guterres told reporters. Griffiths has already held talks with both sides in a war that has drawn in regional powers, meeting Houthi authorities who hold the capital Sanaa as well as internationally-recognised Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and Saudi officials in Riyadh. Guterres said he saw “positive perspectives” for preparing a plan of action “to lead to an effective inter-Yemeni dialogue able to achieve a political solution, with of course the involvement of all those that are relevant in this conflict”. “I am optimistic about that possibility,” the United Nations chief added. The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country to the verge of famine. Guterres was speaking on the sidelines of a U.N. pledging conference a day after an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition that supports Hadi’s government killed 12 civilians in the coastal city of Hodeidah. Houthi forces later targeted Saudi Arabia’s southern border area with a missile. He announced that more than $2 billion has been pledged towards a U.N. humanitarian appeal of $3 billion for Yemen this year. It includes $930 million from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which lead the coalition air strikes. When the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh last November, the Western-backed coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the danger of mass starvation and it was partially lifted.     Guterres told the conference: “All ports must remain open to humanitarian and commercial cargo, the medicines, food and the fuel needed to deliver them.” Most humanitarian aid enters through Hodeidah but the government accuses Houthis who control the port of smuggling weapons through it. Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi called for a return to the negotiating table and said that his government was working to open ports and airports to aid.  “We need to find the ideal solution which is a return to the talks table, to put an end the war, to return to a sustainable system supported by the people of Yemen,” he said. The U.N.’s World Food Programme is providing food rations to 7 million Yemenis, up from 3 million last year, Elisabeth Rasmussen, WFP assistant executive director, told the talks. But Dr. Nevio Zagaria, the World Health Organisation (WHO) representative in Yemen, said that child malnutrition rates are rising. About 1.8 million children under age five are acutely malnourished while 400,000 suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which can be deadly. “In Hajjah, I saw a baby weighing 2.6 kilos (5.7 pounds) who was six months old. Its twin died the week before,” Zagaria told Reuters. After more than one million Yemenis were found with apparent cholera last year, WHO is shipping vaccines to avoid a repeat of the epidemic that killed 2,267 people, he said. Some 1.4 million doses out of 4.4 million planned are on their way via Nairobi. “The rainy season is starting, so we need to use the window of opportunity to start a vaccination campaign,” he said.

2018-04-03,"BOSTON/HOUSTON, April 3 (Reuters) - A top U.S. pension fund manager said Tuesday it was pressing Exxon Mobil Corp for more details about its response to climate change, signaling that a key critic who elicited a report from the oil major last year remains unsatisfied with its answers ahead of the annual meeting this spring. The questions came from New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who last year led a campaign that convinced a majority of Exxon shareholders to call on the company to detail risks it could face from rising global temperatures. Exxon produced a report in February outlining how global oil demand could drop sharply by 2040, but critics said the report fell short on areas like how climate policies could affect company finances. Exxon has tried to placate investors by other means. At its annual investor day last month in New York, for instance, Exxon for the first time dedicated more than two hours to renewable technology investments and climate change. In a letter to Exxon, shown to Reuters, DiNapoli’s co-director of corporate governance Patrick Doherty called on Exxon to cut greenhouse gas emissions and sought details such as how its projections for fuel demand compare to national policy goals, or if Exxon considers health-based emissions standards in projections for fuel demand. In the letter Doherty wrote that his office needs answers for a “full understanding of Exxon Mobil’s planning and preparation to operate in a carbon constrained economy and in a changing climate.” Asked about DiNapoli’s letter, Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said via e-mail that “We value input from all of our shareholders.” Separately, DiNapoli’s office said on Tuesday it asked other companies including energy firms and utilities to reduce emissions and to address climate change risks. But staff withdrew resolutions at several U.S. energy firms after they agreed to provide climate risk details including at DTE Energy Co and at Dominion Energy Inc. Exxon’s annual proxy filing, likely to be released this month, will include ballot items for investors ahead of the company’s shareholder meeting set for May 30 in Dallas. A New York State fund overseen by DiNapoli, which has about 11.5 million shares of Exxon, withdrew a climate resolution for this year’s proxy ahead of Exxon’s February report. In theory investors left unhappy by the time of Exxon’s meeting could vote against individual company directors, though so far major investors who backed DiNapoli’s proposal last year have declined to discuss their views.

2018-04-03,"(Updates with market reaction, sending Andeavor shares up and biofuels credit prices down) By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency has exempted one of the nation’s largest oil refining companies, Andeavor, from complying with U.S. biofuels regulations - a waiver historically reserved for tiny operations in danger of going belly up, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The exemption, which applies to the three smallest of Andeavor’s ten refineries, marks the first evidence of the EPA freeing a highly profitable multi-billion dollar company from the costly mandates of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. The law requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline or purchase credits from those who do such blending. The decision, which has not been previously reported, raises the question of whether other big and profitable oil firms with small refineries - such as Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Phillips 66 - also have or could receive the waivers, which are granted by the EPA in secret. Such waivers were designed for refineries producing less than 75,000 barrels per day that can demonstrate that they suffer a “disproportionate economic hardship” from the costs of RFS compliance. Andeavor posted net profits of about $1.5 billion last year. The EPA exemption, granted about a month ago, could reduce Andeavor’s regulatory costs by more than $50 million this year, based on the number of biofuels credits that two brokers say the refiner recently sold into the market, along with previous disclosures by firms that own refineries of a similar size. Biofuels credit prices tied to ethanol dropped by 6 cents, to 38 cents each, after Reuters reported Andeavor’s exemption, traders said. Andeavor shares jumped by more than 1 percent on the news, hitting a session high of $102.78. The exemption releases the firm of its obligation to provide the EPA with biofuels credits proving compliance at the three refineries - two located in North Dakota and one in Utah - for the year 2016, which would have come due this year, the sources said. Andeavor is also asking EPA for a waiver for its 2017 obligations for the same refineries, but has not yet received a decision, the sources said. Andeavor spokeswoman Destin Singleton declined to comment. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman did not immediately comment in response to Reuters inquiries on Monday and Tuesday. As a matter of policy, the agency refuses to release any information on the waivers, or to name their recipients, citing concerns over disclosing private business information. The EPA denied a Freedom of Information Act request from Reuters seeking information on companies receiving the waivers. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Phillips 66 also own refineries small enough to meet the barrel-per-day standard, as does billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn - whose efforts last year to overhaul the biofuels program drew scrutiny from federal investigators. Icahn, majority owner of refiner CVR Energy, had served as an advisor to Trump on regulatory issues during his push to reform biofuels regulations early last year, but he resigned amid allegations that the role gave him a conflict of interest. Spokespeople for all four companies declined to comment on whether they had applied for or received any exemptions. The lucrative waivers are typically only reported if a publicly-traded firm considers them to be material to their financial or operational performance, in which case they must disclose the information through Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The RFS has long been a lightning rod of conflict between the corn lobby, which supports the policy as an engine for demand, and refiners who say it costs them a fortune. The White House has sought to broker a deal between two of its key political constituencies in a series of meetings, but the effort has failed to yield policy changes acceptable to both sides. Ethanol industry advocates argue exemptions for refiners undermine the intent of the law, originally designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependence on foreign oil and boost farm economies. While the EPA’s motives in providing hardship waivers are unclear, the exemptions are one of the tools at the administration’s disposal to ease financial pressure on refiners without undertaking a reform of the RFS policy. EPA chief Scott Pruitt, appointed by Trump, has repeatedly said the RFS is too costly to oil refiners and should be overhauled. But Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, told an agriculture conference in February that Trump “stands with corn farmers, biofuels farmers and the RFS,” according to a recording heard by Reuters. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to a question about whether the administration was expanding the use of the RFS waivers to help refiners. Bowman, of the EPA, also did not comment on the question. Andeavor’s waiver follows a successful lawsuit by another refiner, Sinclair Oil, last year challenging the strict standard the EPA has used under past administrations for determining financial hardship. “The EPA’s interpretation takes the statutory language too far,” wrote Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. “A ‘hardship’ is something that makes one’s life hard or difficult - not just something that makes continued existence impossible.” The lawsuit - along with a perception that the Trump administration might be more sympathetic to refiners - has sparked a big increase in applications from refining firms for he exemptions this year. More than 30 refineries have sought the waivers, according to sources familiar with the matter. In a typical year, the EPA would receive about 12 to 15 requests for hardship exemptions and would grant about half of them, a former official familiar with the program told Reuters. Andeavor sold some 100 million of those credits to its competitors in recent weeks, according to two brokers in the biofuels credit market. The company otherwise would have needed to provide those credits to the EPA to prove compliance with the RFS. Those credits would be worth about $58 million based on a Reuters calculation of average renewable fuel RIN prices this year. In the past, other companies have said the exemptions they were granted saved them tens of millions of dollars, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Last year, for example, HollyFrontier disclosed a reduction of almost $58 million in its costs of credits for two refineries for 2016. Such windfalls for oil firms come at the expense of the corn and ethanol industries, said Renewable Fuels Association Executive Vice President Geoff Cooper. Refiners granted exemptions win in two ways: They no longer have to blend biofuels or buy credits to comply with the law, and they can sell any credits they had previously purchased to use for compliance. The waivers, Cooper said in a post on the RFA web site, “are destroying demand for ethanol and corn.” (Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice Additional reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-epa-refineries/exclusive-epa-gives-giant-refiner-a-hardship-waiver-from-regulation-idUKL2N1RG1A7,03 Apr 2018,"The Environmental Protection

2018-04-03,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union and Gazprom (GAZP.MM) are poised to settle a long-running antitrust case after the Russian gas company agreed to price reforms and to allow rivals to gain a foothold in eastern Europe, people familiar with the matter said. A decision by the European Commission could come as early as this month although the timing could still slip, the people said. A settlement would allow Gazprom to avoid a possible fine of as much as 10 percent of its global turnover. The seven-year-old case underlines the rocky relationship between Europe and Russia, which have clashed over Ukraine, Syria and, most recently, a nerve attack against a former Russian spy living in England that resulted in expulsions of diplomats on both sides. Last year, state-owned Gazprom, which supplies a third of the EU’s gas, offered to link prices to benchmarks such as western European gas market hubs and border prices in France, Germany and Italy, and allow price reviews every two years. This aimed to address complaints of excessive pricing in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland vis-a-vis German prices due to Gazprom’s policy of locking clients into decades-long, oil-indexed contracts.  The company also pledged to scrap all contractual restrictions which bar clients from reselling its gas and let the Bulgarian transmission network operator take charge of the Balkan country’s gas flows to Greece. Gazprom will drop its $70 million claim for damages from Bulgarian partner BEH following the 2014 cancellation of the South Stream gas pipeline project that would have shipped Russian gas under the Black Sea via Bulgaria to central Europe.  Gazprom has tweaked its original proposal on concessions after negative feedback from EU countries and customers but the main elements remain unchanged, according to a recent draft seen by Reuters. Revisions have been mainly technical such as lower service fees charged by Gazprom which could result in its clients saving millions of euros. The concessions are expected to apply for eight years and be monitored by a trustee. Both the Commission and Gazprom declined to comment. The EU competition enforcer has rejected a complaint by state-run Polish oil and gas company PGNiG (PGN.WA) which wants Gazprom to sell its controlling stake in companies that own key gas infrastructure in the EU, including the Jamal-Europe gas pipeline, two other sources said. The EU had previously said this was not covered by the bloc’s antitrust rules because it was a bilateral deal between the Polish and Russian governments. Gazprom found itself in the EU antitrust crosshairs in 2011 after regulators raided about 20 offices of its customers in eastern and central Europe, seizing more than 150,000 documents.  At issue was whether Gazprom had imposed unfair prices by linking gas price to oil prices, divided up gas markets by hindering the free flow of gas across EU countries and prevented the diversification of the supply of gas.

2018-04-03,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Tardy Europeans have one less excuse for being late after Europe’s power network operators fixed a lag of nearly six minutes in mains-powered digital clocks that was caused by a power grid dispute between Kosovo and Serbia. Digital clocks that use the mains frequency in an electric power grid to keep time, like those on microwaves and clock radios, began falling behind earlier this year when the frequency in Europe’s transmission network dropped.  This was caused by a power shortage lasting from mid-January to March after Kosovo began to use more power than it produced and Serbia, which is in charge of balancing Kosovo’s grid, failed to fill the gap. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) said on Tuesday that 26 of its members had carried out a compensation scheme to return the mains frequency across Europe to its standard of 50 Hertz (Hz) from 49.996 Hz.  ENTSO-E said that to do so the grid operators had put more energy into the system, maintaining an average electric frequency at 50.01 Hz during March. “One of the effects is notably that the digital clocks geared by electric frequency are now back on time,” it said in a statement. Serbia and Kosovo maintain conflicting claims of ownership of Kosovo’s power grid. Both power grids are synchronised with others in Europe.    ENTSO-E said it would continue to support all parties in finding a long lasting solution to energy dispute between Serbia and Kosovo. Kosovo seceded from Serbia in 2008. Belgrade, which still refuses to recognise Kosovo, committed to normalise ties with Pristina, key to its progress towards European Union membership. But little progress has been made. As part of the deal, both countries in 2015 signed an agreement on operating their grids, but it has never been enacted as they maintain conflicting claims about ownership of the power grid in Kosovo. Serbs in the north of Kosovo, who do not recognise its institutions, refuse to pay their electricity bills and Kosovo’s grid operator KOSTT says that the Serbian counterpart EMS obstructs KOSTT’s efforts to become a full-fledged ENTSO-E member.

2018-04-03,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Wall Street gains as tech recovers * Dollar gains as risk appetite improves, outlook still weak * Oil steadies after 3.7 percent slump By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - Global equity markets edged higher on Tuesday amid a bright outlook for corporate earnings, while the U.S. dollar rose as concerns eased over a continuing China-U.S. trade spat. Oil prices edged up after posting their biggest one-day fall in almost a year on Monday, though higher Russian output and Saudi Arabia possibly cutting its selling prices acted as a drag on crude trading. Financial markets remained cautious after China said Sunday it would raise tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world’s two biggest economies and stoking jitters about the potential impact of the trade standoff on global growth. U.S. Treasury yields and benchmark German bunds rose as stock markets firmed and as investors looked ahead to Friday’s closely watched employment report for March. U.S. yields had dropped two-month lows on Monday, boosted by safe-haven buying as Wall Street reeled from a recent rout in technology shares. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.04 percent but the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 0.30 percent. After being shut for Easter Monday and feeling that impact a day later, Europe’s main bourses in London, Paris and Frankfurt were down. Tech stocks, following a recent rout that began in the U.S., remained a pressure point in Europe after renewed criticism of Amazon by U.S. President Donald Trump. The drop also came on reports that Apple intended to make more of its own parts, news that slammed European chipmakers such as AMS and STMicroelectronics. The S&P 500 Information Technology index has tumbled in recent weeks, ending Monday down about 9.8 percent from a March 12 closing record. Declines in large-cap tech shares was triggered by Trump’s recent allegations, made via Twitter, about Amazon’s business practices. Still, the fundamental picture of solid global growth and strong corporate earnings hasn’t changed that much, but a White House that was market friendly in 2017 has turned less so in 2018, adding a new twist to markets, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Management in Zurich. “If equities are going to find a solid foundation to recover some of the losses they suffered over the last two months, it’s probably going to be on the basis that companies can still demonstrate earnings and fundamental reasons that earnings story is intact,” Hatheway said, speaking in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 168.87 points, or 0.71 percent, to 23,813.06. The S&P 500 gained 11.08 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,592.96 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.67 points, or 0.23 percent, to 6,885.79. Traders were looking to a near $25 billion float of music app Spotify to lift the tech gloom, after a clobbering on Monday had pushed the benchmark S&P 500 index , the Dow and Nasdaq below pivotal technical levels. The dollar rebounded from an early fall on concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions. The dollar index, tracking it against a group of major currencies, rose 0.13 percent, with the euro down 0.23 percent to $1.2272. The Japanese yen weakened 0.64 percent versus the greenback at 106.57 per dollar. Asia’s shares had stumbled overnight, though its moves too had been small compared to Wall Street where the S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. Japan’s Nikkei ended down 0.45 percent, after initially falling as much as 1.6 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite index eased 0.9 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 was off 0.7 percent. The slight recovery in risk appetite meant U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds and UK Gilts all saw a bit of selling too in Europe. Yields on 10-year notes were all off two- to three-month lows. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.7844 percent. U.S. crude rose 0.79 percent to $63.51 per barrel and Brent was at $68.12, up 0.71 percent on the day.

2018-04-03,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Tuesday that the dumping of biodiesel imports from Argentina and Indonesia harms American producers, a move that locks in place duties on the imports. The commission’s final phase determination followed a Commerce Department move in February to add anti-dumping duties of 60.44 percent to 276.65 percent to already steep anti-subsidy duties on imported biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia. The independent panel had already found in the subsidy cases that the imports caused such injuries. The latest duties make it virtually certain that biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia will not be sold in the U.S. market, with combined rates of up to 159 percent on the Argentine fuel and up to 341 percent on Indonesian variety.  The trade case was filed by the National Biodiesel Board and 15 member companies that alleged a flood of subsidized imports sold below fair market value was preventing U.S. producers from earning an adequate return. The vote marked the last procedural hurdle before final antidumping orders can be issued this month, the board said in a statement. “This vote today finalizes the case to address the harm that unfair trade practices have had on the U.S. biodiesel industry,” said Donnell Rehagen, the board’s chief executive officer. “Foreign producers dumping product into American markets below cost has undermined the jobs and environmental benefits that U.S. biodiesel brings to the table.” Reporting by Doina Chiacu in Washington and Michael Hirtzer in Chicago; Editing by Tom Brown",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biodiesel/update-1-u-s-locks-in-anti-dumping-duties-on-biodiesel-from-argentina-indonesia-idUKL2N1RG0ZB,03 Apr 2018,"The U.S. International Trade

2018-04-03,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana, April 3 (Reuters) - Guyana expects to hire consultants to help market its offshore oil basins in the wake of the huge finds by U.S. giant Exxon Mobil and partners, the South American country’s energy minister told Reuters. Since 1999, Guyana has awarded an Exxon-led group hundreds of blocks that stretch across Guyana’s maritime borders with Venezuela and Suriname. Their finds are turning Guyana, a country with no history of oil production and relaxed energy regulation, into one of Latin America’s hottest prospects for oil investments. Exxon, China’s CNOOC and U.S.-based Hess Corp operating in a consortium discovered more than 3 billion barrels of oil and gas resources off Guyana’s Atlantic coast, enough to boost the nation’s oil output to more than 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in coming years, a similar volume to OPEC-member Ecuador. One of South America’s poorest nations, Guyana plans to recruit a firm to suggest ways of valuing and negotiating its remaining offshore areas, Guyana’s minister of natural resources, Raphael Trotman, told Reuters in an interview in the nation’s capital. “The cabinet has made a decision that any future allocations will be made based on advice from a firm of international repute that has advised governments on this kind of thing before and that is how we intend to proceed,” Trotman said. Guyana’s government has a list of qualified candidates for the advisory position, which he did not identify. No oil auctions are yet planned, Trotman said. The country is receiving interest from major oil firms, including France’s Total, Spain’s Repsol, U.S.-based Chevron Corp and Italy’s ENI Trotman said. The same majors, independents and national oil companies also are active in auctions in Brazil and Mexico, and studying other opportunities in Latin America, which is rushing this year to install energy reforms to attract more foreign investment. Among the blocks that Guyana could make available is a deepwater area near the Exxon group’s Stabroek, located 150 miles (241 km) off Guyana’s coast, as well as several shallow-water blocks. The Exxon consortium, which paid $18 million as a signing bonus for its Guyana blocks, expects production from its flagship Liza-1 well to reach 120,000 bpd by 2020. The group has made seven discoveries off the coast of Guyana, the most recent in February from the Pacora-1 exploration well at the 6.6-million-acre Stabroek block. In 2016 the companies signed a new agreement with Guyana for a four-year license to develop its blocks. The deal included two possible three-year extensions. The parties also agreed to a 2 percent royalty and 50-50 profits when production costs are recovered. Under Guyana’s petroleum act, a licensee may apply for no more than 60 blocks but the minister has the power to grant more than that, which is what Trotman said he did with the Exxon consortium. “We sought to give Exxon an area of land that touched the two boundary lines of the nation and that was strategic,” he said. Guyana has sought help from the United Nations and the International Court of Justice on claims by neighboring Venezuela to its land and offshore acreage.

2018-04-03,"* Gazprom concessions include linking gas prices to hub prices * Gazprom offers to scrap territorial curbs against re-selling gas * Settlement of EU case would stave off possible hefty fine (Adds European Commission, Gazprom decline comment) By Foo Yun Chee and Alissa de Carbonnel BRUSSELS, April 3 (Reuters) - The European Union and Gazprom are poised to settle a long-running antitrust case after the Russian gas company agreed to price reforms and to allow rivals to gain a foothold in eastern Europe, people familiar with the matter said. A decision by the European Commission could come as early as this month although the timing could still slip, the people said. A settlement would allow Gazprom to avoid a possible fine of as much as 10 percent of its global turnover. The seven-year-old case underlines the rocky relationship between Europe and Russia, which have clashed over Ukraine, Syria and, most recently, a nerve attack against a former Russian spy living in England that resulted in expulsions of diplomats on both sides. Last year, state-owned Gazprom, which supplies a third of the EU’s gas, offered to link prices to benchmarks such as western European gas market hubs and border prices in France, Germany and Italy, and allow price reviews every two years. The company also pledged to scrap all contractual restrictions which bar clients from reselling its gas and let the Bulgarian transmission network operator take charge of the Balkan country’s gas flows to Greece. Gazprom has tweaked its original proposal after negative feedback from EU countries and customers but the main elements remain unchanged, according to a recent draft seen by Reuters. Revisions have been mainly technical such as lower service fees charged by Gazprom which could result in its clients saving millions of euros. Both the Commission and Gazprom declined to comment. Gazprom found itself in the EU antitrust crosshairs in 2011 after regulators raided about 20 offices of its customers in eastern and central Europe, seizing more than 150,000 documents. At issue was whether Gazprom had imposed unfair prices by linking gas price to oil prices, divided up gas markets by hindering the free flow of gas across EU countries and prevented the diversification of the supply of gas.

2018-04-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Emissions regulated under Europe’s carbon market rose for the first time in seven years in 2017 due to stronger industrial output, data published on Tuesday by the European Commission and examined by carbon analysts at Thomson Reuters showed. Around 45 percent of the European Union’s output of greenhouse gases is regulated by the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the bloc’s flagship policy to tackle global warming by charging for the right to emit carbon dioxide (CO2). The ETS is expected to contribute around two thirds of the reductions needed to meet the EU’s target of slashing emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels. According to the analysts’ interpretation of the data, emissions totalled 1.756 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) last year for companies under the ETS excluding airlines, up 0.3 percent on the previous year. Capped emissions from power and heating generation fell by 1 percent, but the overall figure was lifted by a 1.8 percent rise in emissions from industry. “The European economy grew 2.5 percent last year. Solid growth in the European economy resulted in increased activity leading to higher emissions,” Ingvild Sorhus, lead carbon analyst at Thomson Reuters, said. The ETS caps the emissions of around 12,000 power plants, factories and airlines, forcing them to surrender one carbon permit for every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted annually by the end of April of the following year. The data published on Tuesday accounted for 94 percent of companies covered by the scheme, the analysts said. The emissions figure is keenly watched by participants in the EU’s ETS as it provides a first indication of the supply and demand balance. The benchmark EU carbon contract traded at 13.08 euros/tonne at 1140 GMT, down 1.5 percent from the previous day’s close. After further reviewing the preliminary data, the analysts forecast emissions from aviation rose 6.1 percent year-on-year in 2017 to 65.2 million tonnes, due to an increase in the number of flights, the analysts said. With aviation included, total EU ETS emissions were 1.821 billion tonnes, up 0.5 percent year-on-year, the analysts said. Under the ETS, airlines have to report emissions for all flights that begin and end within the EU.

2018-04-03,"ANKARA, April 3 (Reuters) - The leaders of Turkey and Russia marked the official start of work to build Turkey’s first nuclear power plant on Tuesday, launching construction of the $20 billion Akkuyu power station in the southern province of Mersin. The plant will be built by Russian State Nuclear Energy Agency Rosatom and will be made up of four units each with a capacity of 1,200 megawatts. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan marked the official start to construction of Akkuyu’s first unit, watching by videolink from the Turkish capital Ankara. “When all four units go online, the plant will meet 10 percent of Turkey’s energy needs,” Erdogan said, adding that despite delays Turkey still planned to start generating power at the first unit in 2023. The $20 billion, 4,800 megawatt (MW) plant, is part of Erdogan’s “2023 vision” marking 100 years since the founding of modern Turkey and is intended to reduce Turkey’s dependence on energy imports. However, since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010, the project has been beset by delays. Last month, sources familiar with the matter said Akkuyu was likely to miss its 2023 target start-up date, but Rosatom, which is looking for local partners to take a 49 percent stake in the project, said it is committed to the timetable. The Interfax news agency later cited the head of Rosatom saying that the sale of the 49 percent stake was likely to be postponed from this year until 2019. Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources have said. Putin is on a two-day visit to Turkey from Tuesday where he will meet Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for a summit on Syria.

2018-04-03,"MANILA, April 3 (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday expressed willingness to reopen peace talks with Maoist-led rebels, more than four months after breaking off intermittent negotiations and seeking a “terrorist” tag for the communists. The justice ministry asked a local court in February to declare the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA), “terrorist” bodies that Duterte had sought to destroy. When he came to office in July 2016, he freed some Maoist leaders and appointed leftists to the Cabinet to draw them into peace talks. However, the peace process was abandoned in November, with Duterte furious after what he called repeated attacks by the guerrillas during the talks. “We are not enemies,” Duterte said on Tuesday, addressing NPA fighters in a speech in central Oriental Mindoro province, a rebel stronghold, where he attended the inauguration of a bridge project. “If we can have a middle ground, I am not really closing everything,” he said, likening the disagreement between his government and the rebels to a lover’s quarrel that eventually he thought will end. Ending the nearly half-century long conflict with the communists, in which more than 40,000 people have been killed, was among Duterte’s priorities when he took office. Negotiations to end the revolt have been on and off since being brokered by Norway in 1986. “Let us agree on some fundamentals,” Duterte said, adding that he was ready to spend money to “subsidise” the rebels. Before resuming talks, however, he said the rebels must agree to a ceasefire, stop extortion activities and abandon their proposal for the creation of a “coalition government”.

Traders were looking to a near $25 billion float of music app Spotify to lift the tech gloom, after a clobbering on Monday had pushed the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq below pivotal technical levels. Having been shut on Monday and feeling that impact a day later, Europe’s main bourses in London, Paris and Frankfurt were down 0.2-0.9 percent. Tech stocks remained the pressure point there too after more criticism of Amazon by U.S. President Donald Trump and as reports that Apple intended to make more of its own parts burnt European chipmakers including AMS and STMicroelectronics. “Equities are having a driving force on markets and who knows where that is going,” said National Australia Bank strategist Gavin Friend market strategist, adding that other markets were struggling for direction as a result. Some signs of stability were emerging, however. As well Wall Street futures pointing 0.4 percent higher , the dollar steadied against the yen after three days of falls and safety plays like gold and government bonds were back in reverse. Asia’s shares had stumbled overnight, although its moves too had been small compared to Wall Street where the S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. As well as the tech problems, investors were wary after China imposed extra tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world’s two biggest economies and stoking concerns about the impact on global growth. “China does not provoke a trade war, and doesn’t want to fight a trade war, but we also aren’t afraid of a trade war,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing. Japan’s Nikkei ended down 0.45 percent, after initially falling as much as 1.6 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite index eased 0.9 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 was off 0.7 percent. The slight recovery in risk appetite meant U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds and UK Gilts all saw a bit of selling too in Europe. Yields on 10-year notes were all off two- to three-month lows. “The big question is how far the current tremor in the equity market will affect bonds, given it is driven by a single company - even if it is a tech giant having a huge market weight,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk. Music streaming leader Spotify was heading for a potentially choppy inaugural stock market ride following Monday’s sell-off. In a public letter published ahead of its listing, Chief Executive Daniel Ek cautioned employees and fans that “sometimes we succeed, sometimes we stumble” and “I have no doubt that there will be ups and downs”. In informal premarket trading, pricing appeared to be holding up at around $132 a share, however, valuing the company at more than $23 billion. Gobal data had also been mixed. Europe’s manufacturing boom stumbled in March as optimism waned and demand was hit by icy winter storms, though that followed a bumper few months and overall expansion was still broad-based. Among the main commodities, Brent oil futures nudged back up towards $68 a barrel. They had fallen more than 3.7 percent on Monday after signs of rising Russian output and possible Saudi price cuts had compounded weaker U.S. and Chinese data on Monday and the escalating trade dispute between the two countries. U.S. crude gained 14 cents to $63.15, copper jumped 1.4 percent for its fourth straight gain and spot gold ticked down 0.2 percent to $1,338.08 an ounce.

2018-04-03,"LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - The United Nations has blacklisted a North Korean ship for receiving oil in an October transfer that breached U.N. sanctions, as first revealed by Reuters. Reuters in December reported that Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea, which relies on imported fuel to keep its struggling economy functioning, by transferring cargoes at sea. European security sources told Reuters that a Russian vessel conducted a ship-to-ship transfer with the North Korean-flagged Sam Ma 2 tanker in open seas during October. “A DPRK-flagged (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) tanker, SAM MA 2 owned by Korea Samma Shipping Company, conducted a ship-to-ship transfer of oil and fabricated documents in mid-October 2017, loading almost 1,600 metric tons of fuel oil in one transaction,” the United Nations said. It is the first confirmation of the Reuters report. The U.N. Security Council on Friday blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping companies over oil and coal smuggling by North Korea, boosting pressure on Pyongyang as leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet with his South Korean and U.S. counterparts. The council’s North Korea sanctions committee acted on a request by the United States, designating 21 shipping companies - including five based in China - 15 North Korean ships, 12 non-North Korean ships and a Taiwanese man. The 12 non-North Korea ships are now subjected to a global port ban and must be deregistered, while the 15 North Korean ships are subjected to an asset freeze and 13 of those a global port ban. The move comes days after Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping and an announcement that the North Korean leader would meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in on April 27. He is also scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump some time in May.

2018-04-03,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s drought-stricken Cape Town has pushed back its estimate for “Day Zero,” when taps in the city run dry and people start queuing for water, to 2019 from August of this year, and data show dam levels rising elsewhere in the country.  An El Nino-triggered drought two years ago hit agricultural production and economic growth throughout South Africa. Cape Town was particularly hard hit, and lack of good subsequent rains around the city has made its water shortage worse. The City of Cape Town said on its web site that Day Zero had been “pushed out to 2019.” Residents have been living with stringent consumption restrictions, which now stand at 50 litres per person per day. Those restrictions remain in effect. Dam levels for the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town, were at 18.3 percent last week compared with 19 percent the week before, according to South Africa’s Department of Water Affairs. Elsewhere, the water situation has been improving. The Vaal Dam, a major supply source for Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg, Pretoria and much of South Africa’s industry, was at 94.7 percent, up from 83.5 percent the week before. Levels in the Katse and Mohale dams in neighboring Lesotho, which are key water storage systems for Gauteng, have a combined capacity now of almost 54 percent. In late January, they were at 32 percent, raising concerns that the water crisis would spread beyond Cape Town. Relief for Cape Town, a major tourist draw famed for its mountain backdrop, beaches and nearby wine farms, may also be imminent, with good seasonal rains forecast.   Cape Town typically gets rain in the southern hemisphere winter, starting around May. Above-average-rainfall is now forecast over the next three months, according to the latest seasonal outlook from the South African Weather Service.

2018-04-03,"LISBON, April 3 (Reuters) - For the first time in at least four decades, Portugal’s monthly renewable energy production in March exceeded power demand on the mainland, an industry report said on Tuesday, adding that it expected this to become a trend. Renewable energy accounted for 103.6 percent of mainland electricity consumption last month, the report by the Portuguese Renewable Energy Association and the Sustainable Earth System Association said citing data from power grid operator REN. While fossil fuel plants still worked for short periods to complement the electricity supply, those were fully compensated by other periods of greater renewable production. “Last month’s achievement is an example of what will happen more frequently in the near future. It is expected that by 2040 the production of renewable electricity will be able to guarantee, in a cost-effective way, the total annual electricity consumption of mainland Portugal,” the report said. “These data, besides indicating a historical milestone in the Portuguese electricity sector, demonstrate that renewable energy can be relied upon as a secure and viable source with which to completely meet the country’s electricity demands.” Separately on Tuesday the government suspended subsidies for guaranteed power supplies paid to producers, worth about 20 million euros a year, most of which goes to fossil fuel plants left in stand-by mode. Hydroelectric dams in March accounted for 55 percent of monthly consumption followed by wind power at 42 percent. Portugal, with its long Atlantic coast line, was one of the early pioneers in the mass use of wind power. March saw four times the monthly average rainfall, ending a long period of severe drought in the country, according to the Portuguese Sea and Atmosphere Institute. The downpour refilled most of the dammed reservoirs to levels of over 80 percent. The renewable generation reduced Portugal’s carbon dioxide emissions by 1.8 million tons and helped the country’s export balance. The average daily wholesale market price fell to 39.75 euros per MWh from 43.94 euros a year earlier, when renewables were able to meet only 6 percent of the electricity demand amid the drought. Portugal’s electricity prices are among the highest in the European Union.

The Colombo stock index ended 0.13 percent firmer at 6,458.33, edging up from its lowest close since Jan. 23 hit on Wednesday. The index climbed 0.51 percent last week, its first weekly gain in five, but dropped 1.14 percent last month. “The overall investor sentiment was on a wait-and-watch mode ahead of the no-confidence motion. There were some activities on illiquid distilleries, which moved the market up today,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings. The turnover stood at 530.1 million rupees ($3.40 million), less than this year’s daily average of around 1.2 billion rupees. Foreign investors sold shares worth net 128.2 million rupees on Tuesday, extending the year-to-date net foreign outflow to 1.14 billion rupees worth equities. Political uncertainty and worries over a slowing economy weighed on sentiment, brokers said. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is facing a no-confidence motion, which will be debated on Wednesday before voting, with analysts saying support from many political parties will be needed for Wickremesinghe to clear the vote. Cautious investors await the outcome of the rate announcement, said analysts. Sri Lanka’s central bank is expected to keep key interest rates unchanged on Wednesday after a rate review, but economists in a Reuters poll are not ruling out the possibility of a rate cut to help bolster economic growth that has slipped to a 16-year low.

2018-04-03,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Jf5hzq By John Kemp LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have turned bullish again towards oil prices, casting aside the caution that prevailed during much of February and March. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 85 million barrels in the week to March 27. Portfolio managers have increased their net long position in Brent, NYMEX and ICE West Texas Intermediate crude, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil by a total of 180 million barrels over the two most recent weeks. Net long positions stood at 1.396 billion barrels, not far below the record 1.484 billion barrels set nine weeks ago on Jan. 23 (tmsnrt.rs/2Jf5hzq). Fund managers’ long positions outnumber their short ones by a record ratio of 12.5:1, according to an analysis of records published by regulators and exchanges. On most measures, portfolio managers’ positioning in crude and refined products looks increasingly stretched and lopsided. Large concentrations of positions such as this, on either side of the market, have typically preceded a sharp reversal in prices since the start of 2015. With so many long positions already established and few short positions left to cover, there may not be much more buying to support prices if the holders of existing longs try to realise some of their profits. But the same risk factors have been evident for the last three months and so far prices have been steady with little day-to-day volatility. Most hedge fund managers seem convinced the next major move in prices is more likely to be on the upside. OPEC has signalled its willingness to continue supporting prices by indicating it will extend output curbs through the end of 2018. Venezuela’s output continues to fall as a result of internal unrest and mismanagement, while Iran’s exports are threatened by the possible reimposition of U.S. sanctions. U.S. shale output is rising rapidly but the rig count has levelled off in recent weeks, which some analysts have seen as a sign of increased capital discipline that should moderate further gains in production. At the same time, synchronised global growth and moderate oil prices are fuelling brisk growth in consumption, which is forecast to increase by more than 1.5 million barrels per day for the fourth year running. The biggest source of uncertainty is now on the demand side, where the macroeconomic cycle is rapidly maturing, interest rates are rising, and increasing protectionism is clouding the outlook. While the oil industry’s recovery seems to be mid-cycle, the macroeconomic backdrop appears to be much later in the cycle, with an increasing risk of a slowdown arriving by 2019 or 2020. For now, though, almost all hedge fund managers expect cyclical momentum to carry oil prices higher in the short to medium term.

2018-04-03,"WARSAW, April 3 (Reuters) - Australia’s Prairie Mining said it filed a lawsuit in a Warsaw civil court on Friday against the Polish environment ministry, seeking an extension to the company’s exclusive rights to a mining project in the country. The news sent the miner’s shares  plunging 30 percent in London and 20 percent in Warsaw. Prairie Mining secured in 2015 the exclusive right to apply for a mining concession for the Jan Karski mine in southeast Poland and had until April 2, 2018 to file its application. The company said in a statement on Tuesday that it had not been able to apply for the concession because it first needs to obtain an environmental permit from local authorities, which it said has been delayed. As a result it said it asked the ministry in December to sign a mining usufruct agreement on the project, “which precludes any other parties being granted any licence over all or part of the Jan Karski concessions”. The ministry was required by law to have responded to the request within three months but had failed to do so, Prairie said in a statement. “Accordingly, the company has now commenced legal proceedings against the ministry of environment through the Polish courts in order to protect the company’s security of tenure over the Jan Karski concessions,” the company said. Prairie’s share price had previously been buoyed by plans for the development. The company said in October that upfront capital costs for development of the mine totalled $630 million and that it was in advanced talks with Chinese lenders who could finance 85 percent of it. Since winning the general election in 2015, the conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) has introduced many regulatory changes, prompting some investors to take legal action against the government. Prairie, in its lawsuit, demanded that the mining usufruct agreement be signed so that it can still have the exclusive right to apply for the mining concession. It said a Polish civil court could enforce the agreement in place of the ministry. A spokesman for the environment ministry was not immediately available to comment. Jan Karski, situated in an area neighbouring the state-run Bogdanka coal mine, would produce semi-soft coking coal. Poland generates most of its electricity from coal, produced mostly by state-run mining companies, which survived a slump in coal prices thanks to state aid in 2016. In October U.S. company Invenergy LLC, which says it has spent more than $600 million building windfarms in Poland, said it was formally in dispute with the Polish government over state companies failing to honour contracts.

2018-04-03,"(Adds details) By Denis Pinchuk ANKARA, April 3 (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday a joint organisation for cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries may be set up once the current deal on oil output curbs expires at the end of this year. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters last month that Saudi Arabia and Russia are working on a historic long-term pact, possibly 10 to 20 years long, that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters. Novak said on Tuesday he and his Saudi counterpart, Khalid al-Falih, discussed long-term cooperation and that the current “mechanism of interaction” had proved to be effective. “We are now thinking about a format for cooperation which could be for the longer-term, which would include the possibility of market monitoring, information exchange and if needed the implementation of some joint actions,” Novak told reporters. Under an agreement by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries led by Saudi Arabia, and non-OPEC producers, Moscow pledged to cut output by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a figure of 11.247 million bpd based on its output in October 2016. “Oil production restriction is not a panacea, this is a necessary measure,” Novak said on Tuesday, adding that broader cooperation with OPEC is warranted. He also said that Russia joining OPEC is not on the agenda for discussions. Relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia have warmed in recent months, in part due to the successful implementation of the global oil pact. Last year, Saudi King Salman visited Moscow. A high-ranking delegation from Saudi Arabia is expected to attend the Russian economic forum in St. Petersburg in May, where Russian President Vladimir Putin will be present, according to the event’s organisers. Novak said there were no concrete plans on long-term cooperation yet, while new proposals for cooperation will be discussed during an OPEC ministerial committee tasked with monitoring the output cut deal in the Saudi city of Jeddah later in April. Novak is part of a delegation of Russian officials led by Putin that arrived in Turkey on Tuesday for talks.

2018-04-03,"KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British supermarket group Tesco has launched a scheme in Malaysia based on bags with barcodes, giving customers discounts on their shopping every time they reuse the bags. The “unforgettable bag” was launched in 11 Tesco stores in Malaysia’s capital Kuala Lumpur and the southern state of Johor on Tuesday in an effort to shift away from single-use plastic bags and reduce waste. Azliza Baizura Azmel, a director at Tesco Malaysia, said 70 percent of customers have their own carrier bags but leave them in the car rather than bringing them into the store. “That’s why we thought of the idea of the unforgettable bag - it’s a bit of a push for them,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The new bags will be sold for 0.50 ringgit ($0.13) each, and customers will get a free replacement if the bag is torn or damaged. Tesco will offer customers a cash rebate of 0.20 ringgit ($0.05) for every bag reused. Each year between 500 billion and 1 trillion plastic bags are used globally, according to industry estimates, with fewer than 10 percent recycled. Many end up in the world’s oceans or dumped in landfill. More than 8 million tonnes of plastics enter the ocean each year, and marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight. Plastic degrades over time into tiny particles which are ingested by marine life, harming the food chain and environment. In an attempt to cut down on waste and single-use plastic, many supermarkets around the world charge customers for plastic bags, promote reusable bags, and offer free recycling services. Meanwhile, more than 40 countries have banned, partly banned or taxed single-use plastic bags, including parts of Malaysia and India, China, France, Rwanda, Italy and Kenya. The “unforgettable bag” is made from a recyclable plastic that is more durable than conventional plastic bags, Tesco said, and sports a turtle, fish or whale design to highlight the risks plastic waste poses to sea creatures. The Tesco trial - the first of its kind by a major hypermarket in Malaysia - limits the bag discounts to two per transaction. The scheme will be extended to all Tesco’s 56 stores in Malaysia from June 1. If a success, the retailer hopes it will be adopted by other Tesco stores across Asia. The barcoded bags are a starting point towards phasing out all plastic bags from Tesco shops in Malaysia, said Azmel. Every Malaysian on average throws away 300 plastic bags a year, according to the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association. Von Hernandez, global coordinator of the Break Free From Plastic movement in Manila, welcomed the Tesco initiative but said governments and business in Asia needed to do more. “We’ve seen governments - whether at city or national level - take action to restrict the use of single-use plastics,” said Hernandez. “That has to be matched by the corporate sector.” “There is increasing momentum for similar restrictions in many parts of the world because this crisis is growing.” $1 = 3.8610 ringgit

Europe’s main markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt were all down more than 0.5 percent, after being closed on Monday when the pace of selling had pushed U.S. markets below pivotal technical levels. Tech stocks remained the pressure point, dropping more than 1 percent, after more criticism of Amazon by U.S. President Donald Trump and as reports that Apple intended to make more of its own parts burnt European chipmakers like ams AG and STMicroelectronics. Some signs of stability were emerging, though. Wall Street futures pointed higher, the dollar steadied against the yen after three days of decline and gold and government bonds were in reverse. “There is actually very little contagion from all the equity market moves that are grabbing all the headlines,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy. Asia’s shares had stumbled overnight, too, although less than Wall Street, where the S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. As well as the tech problems, investors were also wary after China imposed extra tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world’s two biggest economies and stoking concerns about the impact on global growth. Japan’s Nikkei ended down 0.45 percent, after falling as much as 1.6 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite index eased 0.9 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 was off 0.7 percent. U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds and UK Gilts all saw a bit of selling, with yields on 10-year notes off two- to three-month lows. “The big question is how far the current tremor in the equity market will affect bonds, given it is driven by a single company - even if it is a tech giant having a huge market weight,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk. Among the main commodities, Brent oil futures nudged back up towards $68 a barrel. They had fallen more than 3.7 percent on Monday after news of rising Russian output and the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute weighed on sentiment. U.S. crude gained 14 cents to $63.15, copper jumped 1.4 percent for its fourth straight gain and spot gold ticked down 0.2 percent to $1,338.08 an ounce.

Oil fell by 2.4 percent on Monday, pressured by a rise in Russian production, expectations Saudi Arabia will cut prices of the crude it sends to Asia and a deepening trade spat between China and the United States. In early Tuesday trade, Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia’s main export, was up 0.43 percent at $67.93 a barrel. Russian stock indexes were down. The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 0.41 percent at 1,229 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 0.45 percent lower at 2,247 points. Global investors are worried about trade tensions between the United States and China. China imposed extra tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world’s two biggest economies. “Russia is somewhat immune to the global trade war that is brewing between the U.S. and China,” analysts at Alfa bank said in a note. They also said the Russian market was supported by the recent recovery in oil prices and rumours President Putin could meet with President Trump in the United States.

2018-04-03,"HANOI (Reuters) - Tension in the South China Sea will hurt PetroVietnam’s offshore exploration and exploitation activities this year, the state-run oil and gas group said on Tuesday, weeks after the Southeast Asian nation suspended a project under pressure from China. Vietnam and China have been embroiled in maritime disputes in parts of the busy waterway, where China claims 90 percent of the potentially energy-rich maritime territory, which Vietnam calls the East Sea. “The East Sea is forecast to continue to have uncertainty this year ... affecting the company’s efforts to attract foreign investors to invest in its open offshore fields”, PetroVietnam said on its website. PetroVietnam has rarely openly admitted that the tension has had an adverse impact on its offshore exploration and production fields, especially those located near the U-shaped “nine-dash line” that marks the vast area claimed by China. During a trip to Hanoi on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said both nations should settle their disputes in the South China Sea through talks and move to jointly use its waters. The two countries had agreed such a move was “extremely important for the healthy and sustainable development of bilateral relations,” Wang said. In its statement, PetroVietnam said the dispute with China would add to its struggle to maintain crude oil output amid already declining production from Vietnam’s key fields. Last month, it ordered Spanish energy firm Repsol to suspend its “Red Emperor” project off Vietnam’s southeastern coast following pressure from China, sources told Reuters. The $1-billion (£0.7 billion) “Red Emperor” field is of moderate size by international standards but was seen as a key asset to help slow the decline of Vietnam’s stalling oil and gas production. But the block lies near China’s “nine-dash line” and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions. Vietnam’s crude oil output this year is expected to fall 14.7 percent from last year to 11.31 million metric tonnes, or 227,130 barrels per day, the government has said.

Anglo halted operations after a leak was discovered on March 29 on a pipeline which carries iron ore in slurry form from the mine to an export terminal. It said the leak of non-hazardous iron ore slurry was stopped within eight minutes and caused no disruption to local water supply.  The company said there were no injuries.  A previous leak prompted Anglo to suspend operations from March 12 to 27 at Minas-Rio, which transports iron ore from the company’s mine and processing facility in the state of Minas Gerais to a port in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

2018-04-03,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has declared a state of emergency around a port on Borneo island, officials said on Tuesday, after a large oil spill and fire killed four people at the weekend.     Disaster mitigation officials were able to control the blaze in the port city of Balikpapan but were still working to contain the spill, which started on Saturday and spread over an area of around 12 square km (4.5 square miles). “We have warned the public not to carry out activities that could spark fires,” Suryanto, head of the city’s environmental agency, said. Balikpapan, in East Kalimantan, is a major mining and energy hub and home to one of the few oil refineries in the country, run by state energy firm Pertamina. The state-owned company said it was investigating where the oil had originated and that its own underwater pipeline in the area did not have any leaks. Pertamina said there had been no disruptions to operations. “At this time, our team is prioritising management (of the incident),” said Arya Dwi Paramita, external communications manager at Pertamina.

2018-04-03,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian gas producer Santos Ltd (STO.AX) said on Tuesday it would “engage with” Harbour Energy after receiving a $10.4 billion takeover offer from the U.S. company, its fourth unsolicited bid since August 2017. The bid, valuing Santos at a 28 percent premium to its last close, would give Harbour access to a recently revived company with a low cost of oil production and stakes in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Asia-Pacific, where demand is soaring. News of the latest offer, the biggest inbound bid for a listed Australian company since Unibail-Rodamco’s $16 billion buy-out offer for shopping mall giant Westfield Corp, sent Santos shares soaring.  But even if accepted by Santos this time round, a deal may be fraught with political and regulatory risk: Australia’s  lingering energy supply crisis has stoked fears that companies that come under foreign ownership may ignore domestic needs. “The price is definitely in the ball park of something that we will seriously consider,” said Andy Forster, senior investment officer at Argo Investments, Santo’s ninth-largest shareholder. Investment bank RBC Capital Markets described the bid as a “knock-out” in a note to clients on Tuesday. The offer values Adelaide-based Santos (STO.AX) at A$6.50, per share, a 28 percent premium to the company’s last closing share price of A$5.07. Santos’ shares close 16.2 percent higher at A$5.89. The latest offer price is also 43 percent higher than Harbour’s first attempt last year.  Harbour’s chief executive Linda Cook said the plan for Santos was “one of growth, in Australia, Papua New Guinea and beyond”.  “We are prepared to move expeditiously through the due diligence phase to immediately begin the government review and approval process,” Cook said in a phone interview. But given the highly politicized nature of the Australian domestic gas landscape and Santos’ key role there, analysts and investors see government approval as a key risk to any deal. A takeover would be subject to government approvals and will be scrutinized by Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), which provides recommendations to the government. Cook said Harbour was preparing its FIRB application.    Santos’ more sensitive assets include its interest in the Gladstone LNG project in the Australian state of Queensland and the strategically important Cooper Basin in the country’s east, where significant onshore oil and gas deposits are located.  “Any buyer of Santos would need to be prepared for ongoing engagement with government and public scrutiny for many years going forward,” said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Still, for a new LNG player, Santos represents an attractive target given its portfolio of LNG assets and growth options, according to analysts. “The Santos board considers that, based on the indicative offer price of A$6.50 per share, it is in the interests of shareholders to engage further with Harbour,” Santos said in a statement to shareholders. The bid from Washington-based Harbour, a private equity-backed firm led by Cook, who is a former Royal Dutch Shell Plc executive director, consists of $4.70 per share in cash and a special dividend of $0.28 per share, or A$6.50.  The offer would allow for majority shareholders Hony Capital and ENN to retain a stake of up to 20 percent. Santos was in considerable trouble just a few years ago, struggling with high debt and low oil LCOc1 and gas LNG-AS prices. But asset sales, debt reduction and cost-cutting have led it back to health. As a result, Santos is seen to be able to produce profitably at average oil costs of just over $32 per barrel, versus actual costs of around $68 a barrel. The company’s focus on LNG, which is seen to be a bigger growth markets in coming years than oil, is also seen as attractive for investors. Harbour plans to fund the takeover through a combination of debt and equity, with J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley underwriting $7.75 billion of debt. Santos is a partner in the Papua New Guinea LNG export project, which was highly profitable before it got knocked out by a strong earthquake in late February. It is expected to resume operations in April.

Pruitt has declined to comment on the rental arrangement reported last week and a spokesman for the agency on Friday defended his conduct and said the lease agreement was in line with federal ethical regulations. The Journal quoted the official as saying the purpose of the inquiry was to “dig a little deeper.” Another White House official said few people were coming to Pruitt’s defense, the newspaper said, although there is no sign yet that his position is in jeopardy. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ABC News and Bloomberg News reported last week that during his first six months in Washington last year, Pruitt made a deal to pay about $50 a night - less than a third the price of similar properties - to rent a room in a Capitol Hill neighborhood condo building co-owned by energy industry lobbyist Steven Hart and his wife. Pruitt, a conservative who previously served as Oklahoma’s attorney general, is also one of several members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet who have come under scrutiny for their travel practices. The EPA confirmed last month that Pruitt’s private security detail accompanied him on first-class flights. Hart’s firm represents companies regulated by the EPA including Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co, shale producer Concho Resources Inc, ExxonMobil Corp and liquefied natural gas (LNG) company Cheniere Energy Inc. Travel records obtained through a public records request show that Pruitt spent over $17,000 in taxpayer money for a December trip to Morocco to promote U.S. exports of LNG.
