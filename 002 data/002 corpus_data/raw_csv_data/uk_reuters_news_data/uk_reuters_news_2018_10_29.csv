2018-10-29,"(Reuters) - Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and investor Warren Buffett are set for a desert showdown over electricity next week as the two billionaires’ interests collide on election ballots in Nevada. At issue in the Nov. 6 election is the cost and control of power from the neon lights shining on the Las Vegas Strip to the state’s gold mines. A measure supported by Republican donor Adelson, who is also  Las Vegas Sands Corp’s chairman, would force state legislators to break up control over much of the state’s electricity effectively held by a unit of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, NV Energy. It would allow customers to choose their own power provider by 2023. Buffett has supported liberal causes and backed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Unlike previous western duels, both sides in Nevada are showing up with cash. The energy tussle is shaping up as one of the more costly of an election season in which Democrats are trying to wrest control of at least one chamber of U.S. Congress from Republicans. So far, the dueling Nevada interests have poured in more than $96 million to the electricity battle, according to filings with the state government. NV Energy has out-spent Sands nearly 4-to-1. Hotel-casinos like Sands’ Venetian, whose lights glitter in Las Vegas, are major power customers in the state. Caesars Entertainment Corp, Wynn Resorts Ltd and MGM Resorts International earlier opted to pay tens of millions in exit fees to drop their power provider. Proponents say having a choice on their utility can lower costs. A Sands spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Voters approved the utility proposal in 2016 and need to do so a second time for Nevada’s constitution to reflect the change.  An NV Energy spokeswoman said in a statement the company is backing efforts to defeat the “risky and costly” measure, known as Question 3, “to make sure all Nevadans have the facts” about the potential to “dismantle an electricity system that already provides low costs, increased clean energy production, great customer service and industry-leading reliability.” The Nevada measure puts more pressure on an industry shaken up by the growth of alternative energy sources, some of which have made it easier for consumers to generate their own electricity.  U.S. electric utilities have delivered investors a 1.3 percent return, including dividends, over the past year, nearly half the payout from utilities overall. Since Berkshire acquired it in 2013, NV Energy has made investments in solar, in addition to coal and natural gas power sources. It reached an agreement in 2016 with Elon Musk’s SolarCity Corp that allowed thousands of Nevada rooftop solar customers to take advantage of richer subsidies than under new rate guidelines that NV Energy had supported.

2018-10-29,"NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Demand for bitcoin could single-handedly derail efforts to limit global warming because the increasingly popular digital currency takes huge amounts of energy to produce, scientists said on Monday. Producing bitcoin at a pace with growing demand could by 2033 defeat the aim of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, according to U.S. research published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Almost 200 nations agreed in Paris in 2015 on the goal to keep warming to “well below” a rise of 2°C above pre-industrial times. But mining, the process of producing bitcoins by solving mathematical equations, uses high-powered computers and alto of electricity, the researchers said. “Currently, the emissions from transportation, housing and food are considered the main contributors to ongoing climate change,” said study co-author Katie Taladay in a statement. “This research illustrates that bitcoin should be added to this list.” Mining is a lucrative business, with one bitcoin currently selling for about $6,300 (4,900 British pounds). In 2017, bitcoin production and usage emitted an estimated 69 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, the researchers said. That year, bitcoin was involved in less than half of 1 percent of the world’s cashless transactions, they said. As the currency becomes more common, researchers said it could use enough electricity to emit about 230 gigatonnes of carbon within a decade and a half. One gigatonne is equal to one billion metric tons of carbon. “No matter how you slice it, that thing is using alot of electricity. That means bad business for the environment,” Camilo Mora, another co-author, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Bitcoin mining, however, is becoming more energy efficient, said Katrina Kelly-Pitou, research associate at the University of Pittsburgh. She said bitcoin miners are moving away from sites such as China, with coal-generated electricity, to more environmentally friendly utilities in Iceland and the United States.

2018-10-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Early gains on Wall Street fizzled and sent global stocks lower on Monday after reports that the U.S. is planning an additional $257 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods if upcoming talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail to end a trade war between two of the world’s largest economies.   Additional tariffs on goods from China could be implemented as early as December, according to a Bloomberg report.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 245.39 points, or 0.99 percent, to 24,442.92, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 17.44 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,641.25 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 116.92 points, or 1.63 percent, to 7,050.29.7,050.29 The Dow had shot up more than 300 points shortly after the opening of trade, and at one point in afternoon trading was down more than 500 points.  “Obviously, this trade skirmish is metastasizing potentially into something worse than it already is,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Many stock indexes are already in official correction territory - meaning down 10 percent from recent highs - as investors fret about corporate earnings and global economic growth. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS lost early gains to slide nearly 0.7 percent. The index is down nearly 10 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7 trillion in market value since its January peak. Shares in Europe closed broadly higher following Standard & Poor’s decision to leave Italy’s sovereign rating unchanged, prompting relief that there was no ratings downgrade. Europe’s autos sector .SXAP jumped 4.9 percent, its strongest day since August 2015, after a report that China was considering halving the tax on car purchases to boost demand for autos, which has suffered from a trade war and slowing economic growth.  Asian stock trading was dampened by China’s blue-chip index, which tumbled more than 3.3 percent. Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy, as profit growth at industrial firms slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw materials and manufactured goods. Analysts have been downgrading estimates for European earnings at the fastest pace since February 2016, and weak results from internet companies Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) hurt U.S. stocks at the end of last week.

2018-10-29,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) backs an annual increase in fuel-efficiency standards based on “historic rates” rather than tough Obama era rules or a Trump administration proposal that would freeze requirements, according to a federal filing made public on Monday. The largest U.S. automaker said the Obama rules that aimed to hike fleetwide fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 are “not technologically feasible or economically practicable. The Detroit automaker said that since 1980, the motor vehicle fleet has improved fuel efficiency at an average rate of 1 percent a year. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) said in separate comments that the auto industry is complying with existing fuel efficiency requirements by using credits from prior model years. As a result even if requirements are frozen at 2020 levels “the industry would need to continue to improve fuel economy” as credits expire, it added, warning if the government hikes standards beyond 2020 requirements “the situation worsens ... without some significant form of offset or flexibility.” Fiat Chrysler and Ford Motor Co (F.N) urged the government to reclassify two-wheel drive SUVs as light trucks, which face less stringent requirements than cars. A four-wheel drive version of the same SUV is considered a light truck. Ford’s comments back fuel rules “that increase year-over-year with additional flexibility to help us provide more affordable options for our customers.” GM’s comments said it was “troubled” that President Donald Trump’s administration wants to phase out incentives for electric vehicles. The Trump plan’s preferred alternative freezes standards at 2020 levels through 2026 and hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day in the 2030s but reduce automakers’ collective regulatory costs by more than $300 billion. It would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles or setting state emissions rules. The administration of former President Barack Obama had adopted rules, effective in 2021, calling for an annual increase of 4.4 percent in fuel-efficiency requirements from 2022 through 2025. GM has been lobbying Congress to lift the existing cap on electric vehicles eligible for a $7,500 tax credit. The credit phases out over a 12-month period after an individual automaker hits 200,000 electric vehicles sold. GM said the current tax credit puts “companies like GM and Tesla (TSLA.O) at severe pricing disadvantage in the market for several years.” On Friday, GM called for a nationwide zero-emission vehicle programme, while 20 U.S. states called for the administration to abandon its proposal to weaken the Obama rules.  The GM proposal also calls for a U.S. national building code to require new residential construction to support EV charging and dramatically increase government spending on research and development in battery cell technologies. The Trump administration said it will review all comments before issuing final regulations by the end of March.

2018-10-29,"SAO PAULO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Brazilian sugar and ethanol producers said on Monday that the outlook for the sector is gradually improving and that better prospects for next year’s season could include shifting more production back to the sweetener. Millers taking part in Datagro’s international sugar conference in São Paulo said that a recent price rally in New York could help forward sales of sugar, which in turn might lead mills to earmark more cane to sugar production than they did this year, and less to ethanol. They also think that a new right-wing government in Brazil that is pledging to adopt market-friendly policies would eventually lead to higher fuel consumption, sustaining ethanol demand and forcing sugar consumers worldwide to pay more for the Brazil-made sweetener to compete. “I think mills have to take the opportunity to hedge some sugar now and avoid betting too much on ethanol next year, which is always subject to oil prices and public policies,” Gabriel Feres Junqueira, chief executive officer of Bioenergética Aroeira mill, told Reuters. “Considering currency exchange rates and New York futures currently, they could fix a price of 1,250 reais per tonne of sugar for next season, which is a reasonable value,” he said. His company decided not to produce any sugar this year, allocating 100 percent of the cane to ethanol production, Junqueira said. Bioenergética Aroeira was one of the 17 mills in Brazil’s center-south that concentrated entirely on the biofuel. On average, the center-south region is earmarking around 67 percent of cane to ethanol production and only 33 percent to sugar in the current season. “The worst is in the past, the outlook is constructive,” said Mariangela Grola, market intelligence manager at Raízen, the world’s largest sugar producer. She expects sugar prices could go up to 16 cents per pound if global supplies shrink due to production difficulties in some producing countries and buyers turn strongly again to Brazil, where they will have to compete with ethanol. Mario Lorencatto, CEO of Coruripe, one of the ten largest sugar and ethanol companies in Brazil, said his company already managed to secure profitable forward sales, combining New York futures with local currency non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts. The arrangement has been profitable, he said. “It is quite possible that more sugar (production) will be considered in Brazil next season at this level of prices,” said Jeremy Austin, Brazil director for sugar trader Sucden, in a presentation during the conference.

2018-10-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Monday, with futures on track for the worst monthly performance since mid-2016, after Russia signalled that output will remain high and as concern over the global economy fuelled worries about demand for crude. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 28 cents to settle at $77.34 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 55 cents to settle at $67.04 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent was on track to drop about 6.6 percent for the month. U.S. crude was on course to fall about 8.5 percent. Both were set for the steepest monthly decline since July 2016.  Even with U.S. sanctions on Iranian exports due to come into force on Nov. 4, oil prices have fallen about $10 a barrel since four-year highs reached in early October. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Saturday there was no reason for Russia to freeze or cut its oil production levels, noting that there were risks that global oil markets could be facing a deficit. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC member Russia, agreed in June to lift oil supplies, but OPEC then signalled last week that it may have to reimpose output cuts as global inventories rise. “When the Russians start talking about keeping the production levels high and even the possibility that they need to increase it because of a possible tightness in supply, that brought on some selling pressure,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. Industrial commodities such as crude and copper have also been rattled by hefty losses in global equities due to concern over corporate earnings, and fears over the impact to economic growth from escalating trade tensions, as well as a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar index .DXY also rose, supported by robust U.S. consumer spending data. [USD/] A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. Fund managers have cut their bullish positions in crude futures and options for four weeks in a row to their lowest since July 2017, as the demand outlook grows more uncertain.  “The hedge funds really abandoned the long side of the market and there’s some short-selling going on this perception that perhaps the economy is slowing,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “There’s continued psychological weakness on the market.” On the supply side, Iran has started selling crude to private companies via a domestic exchange for the first time, the oil ministry’s news website reported. With just days to go before U.S. sanctions on Iran take effect, three of Iran’s top five customers – India, China, and Turkey - are resisting Washington’s call to end oil purchases outright, arguing there are not sufficient supplies worldwide to replace them, according to sources familiar with the matter. That pressure, along with worries of a damaging oil price spike, is raising the possibility of bilateral deals to allow some buying to continue, according to the sources.

2018-10-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will levy a new tax on those who make or import plastic packaging with less than 30 percent recycled material, finance minister Philip Hammond said on Monday. The measure, to be introduced in April 2022 subject to consultation, is an attempt to reduce waste and help tackle climate change.  “We will introduce a new tax on the manufacture and import of plastic packaging which contains less than 30 percent recycled plastic transforming the economics of sustainable packaging,” Hammond announced as part of his annual budget. “The tax will provide a clear economic incentive for businesses to use recycled material in the production of packaging which in turn will create greater demand for this material,” the Treasury said, following Hammond’s announcement. Rupert Haworth, marketing director at Recycling Technologies, which converts waste plastic back into an oil to remake into plastic, said the move would encourage recycling.  “This (...) should stimulate new investment in plastic recycling innovation and capacity here in the UK and provide recycled plastic feedstock to the industry.”  Hammond added that he would continue to study the use of single-use plastic in takeaway cups but had concluded that a tax would not be effective in encouraging widespread reuse.

2018-10-29,"PARIS (Reuters) - Power demand from French utility EDF’s retail subsidiaries cannot limit the amount of cheap nuclear electricity that is available for its competitors to buy, the energy regulator said on Monday.  Under the so-called ARENH mechanism, EDF’s (EDF.PA) many smaller competitors have the right to buy up to 100 terawatt hours (TWh) of power - about a quarter of the state-controlled utility’s annual nuclear energy output - to compensate for EDF’s monopoly on nuclear production and boost competition.  In recent years, competitors have made limited use of the arrangement as market prices were below the ARENH price, which has been fixed at 42 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) since 2012.  But with market prices now around 75 euros per MWh, demand for access to the mechanism is high.  Alternative power suppliers have argued that the available ARENH volume has been limited by the demand of EDF’s unit Sowee, which like other alternative suppliers offers competitive market rates rather than the regulated power tariffs offered by EDF.  Market regulator CRE said in a statement that ahead of the next ARENH auction on Nov. 21 and a new government decree reviewing the mechanism, demand for ARENH power by EDF’s own retail units cannot be allowed to curtail the volumes available for other suppliers.  CRE added that it also wanted to avoid such demand driving up power prices.  “For these reasons, CRE has decided that in the case that there is more demand than the ARENH volume limit, demand from companies controlled by EDF will be fully capped for that part of the volume that exceeds the limit,” it said in a statement.  However, it said EDF units could buy extra power from their parent company under the same ARENH terms enjoyed by its competitors.  The French power retail market was opened to competition more than a decade ago, but despite losing about 100,000 customers per month to new market entrants, EDF still has a market share of about 82 percent of French household accounts. EDF’s two biggest competitors are utilities Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Direct Energie (TOTF.PA), but retailers such as Leclerc and Casino and foreign firms such as Italy’s ENI (ENI.MI) are also winning market share, along with dozens of smaller electricity retail startups such as Enercoop and ekWateur.

2018-10-29,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio called on Monday for unity within his 5-Star Movement after the anti-establishment party was forced to renege on an electoral pledge to halt a major, international gas transport project. Former party sympathisers set fire to the 5-Star flag in the southern Italian town of Melendugno on Sunday to protest against the government’s decision to endorse the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) that will bring Azeri gas into Italy via their coastline. Ahead of elections in March, 5-Star promised to abandon the project if it took power, but after months of deliberations, Di Maio acknowledged at the weekend that the pipeline would have to go ahead. He said Italy would face penalties of 20 billion euros (£17.8 billion) if it pulled out at this late stage. Facing ridicule and criticism on social media, Di Maio said the party was under attack, both from inside and out, and urged 5-Star supporters to close ranks in the same way ancient Roman soldiers locked their shields together to keep out enemy arrows. “Today, in our army, some people are showing signs of weakness ... We cannot allow ourselves such weakness,” Di Maio wrote on the party website.  “The slightest failure on any front means that all the land we have conquered will return to being no-man’s land.”  The 5-Star formed a coalition with the far-right League in June and is battling against the restraints of government, which sometimes clash with its anti-establishment roots. Besides giving way on the TAP, Di Maio has also had to ignore party objections to keeping the giant Ilva steelworks open. He is also having to back a tax amnesty which was endorsed by the League but is anathema to his own supporters. HIGH-SPEED ANXIETY Di Maio said he found out how much it would cost to cancel TAP only after he had taken office and gained access to official documents. Ministers from the former government denied his version of events and said all documentation was public.  “They are lying,” ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi said. “5-Star promised to block (TAP) within two weeks (of taking office) ...They won votes on the back of this promise. After six months they changed their mind. We lost the election, Italy has lost time. Di Maio has lost face,” Renzi said in a statement. With TAP and Ilva moving ahead, attention is switching to another major project that 5-Star has always opposed and that is under consideration - a high-speed rail link known as TAV that is meant to connect Turin with the French city of Lyon. Infrastructure Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is a member of 5-Star, called timeout on the project in June, saying he wanted a cost-benefit analysis of the 270-km (167-mile) line. The Turin newspaper La Stampa quoted Di Maio on Monday as warning the League that his party would implode if TAV went ahead. However, the League supports the link, which involves building a 57-km tunnel under the Alps, arguing that it will strengthen trade in the League’s northern heartlands. Turin City Hall, which is run by a 5-Star administration, held a largely symbolic vote on Monday calling for work on the line to be suspended. The League distanced itself from the motion, praising the TAV as a “strategic project”. “We don’t want to run the risk of seeing our territory shut off from European trade routes now that we really need them,” the League leader in city hall, Fabrizio Ricca, told La Stampa.

We cannot allow ourselves such weakness,” Di Maio wrote on the party website. “The slightest failure on any front means that all the land we have conquered will return to being no-man’s land.” The 5-Star formed a coalition with the far-right League in June and is battling against the restraints of government, which sometimes clash with its anti-establishment roots. Besides giving way on the TAP, Di Maio has also had to ignore party objections to keeping the giant Ilva steelworks open. He is also having to back a tax amnesty which was endorsed by the League but is anathema to his own supporters. HIGH-SPEED ANXIETY Di Maio said he only found out how much it would cost to cancel TAP after he had taken office and gained access to official documents. Ministers from the former government denied his version of events and said all documentation was public. “They are lying,” ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi said. “5-Star promised to block (TAP) within two weeks (of taking office) ...They won votes on the back of this promise. After six months they changed their mind. We lost the election, Italy has lost time. Di Maio has lost face,” Renzi said in a statement. With TAP and Ilva moving ahead, attention is switching to another major project that 5-Star has always opposed and that is under consideration - a high-speed rail link known as TAV that is meant to connect Turin with the French city of Lyon. Infrastructure Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is a member of 5-Star, called timeout on the project in June, saying he wanted a cost-benefit analysis of the 270-km (167-mile) line. The Turin newspaper La Stampa quoted Di Maio on Monday as warning the League that his party would implode if TAV went ahead. However, the League supports the link, which involves building a 57-km tunnel under the Alps, arguing that it will strengthen big business in the League’s northern heartlands. “I hope the government, having given the green light to the so-called TAP in Puglia, will not offer up the Turin-Lyon line and other major projects in the north as a sacrificial lamb to make up to (5-Star) voters,” said Sergio Chiamparino, a member of the centre-left Democratic Party who heads the Piedmont region centred on Turin.

2018-10-29,"* Magnolia LNG final go-ahead delayed to 2019 from end 2018 * LNG Ltd had focused marketing on China * Aiming to start LNG exports in 2022 (Adds analyst comment, background on other proposed U.S. LNG export terminals and links to factbox and graphics) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE/SINGAPORE, Oct 29 (Reuters) - LNG Ltd said on Monday it is delaying a final decision on whether to build its U.S.-based Magnolia liquefied natural gas plant, citing problems lining up Chinese customers due to the U.S.-China trade war. The Australian-listed company is now targeting final approval for Magnolia, located in Louisiana, in the first part of 2019. “We remain confident in our ability to reach (final investment decision) on Magnolia whether or not China participates,” LNG Ltd Chief Executive Officer Greg Vesey said in a tweet, noting “multiple opportunities with customers in Europe and Asia exist, and our discussions with them are proceeding well.” Development of liquefied natural gas terminals to ship the super-cooled fuel around the world has soared due to rising demand, particularly out of Asia, as countries seek more cleaner-burning energy sources as a substitute for dirtier coal. U.S. President Donald Trump has promoted the growth of U.S. LNG exports around the world as part of his efforts for global energy dominance, but the escalating trade dispute with China has harmed those plans. LNG Ltd had planned to make a final investment decision by the end of 2018 about Magnolia, which is designed to produce 8 million tonnes of LNG per year. “We made that statement prior to the trade tensions that have manifested over the past months, which have caused headwinds for LNG transactions,” Vesey said in a quarterly report. China purchased about 103 bcf of LNG from the United States in 2017, or about 15 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped that year, but is on track to fall short of that level in 2018, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking and U.S. Department of Energy data. LNG Ltd’s delay underscored how China, the world’s fastest-growing LNG market, has shifted its long-term LNG procurement strategies away from the United States in the last few months due in part to the trade dispute. That has had repercussions for the scale and pace for the next wave of U.S. projects, said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney. “Regardless of how long the trade dispute lasts, the overall risk profile of U.S. LNG will remain heightened in Chinese LNG buyers’ eyes for some time to come,” Kavonic said. LNG Ltd shares hit a one-year low on the day, before closing down 23 percent at 41.5 Australian cents. The company is developing two plants: Magnolia, where it planned to begin exports in 2022, and Bear Head in Nova Scotia in Canada. Vesey told Reuters in May that the plans have “strictly been about marketing to China.” But that was before Beijing imposed a 10 percent tariff on U.S. LNG as the trade war escalated. Washington has imposed tariffs across the spectrum on imported Chinese goods. There are varying views on how and when the trade issues with China will be resolved, Vesey said on Monday. “Considering that, our communications with potential Chinese offtakers remain robust with the intent to complete agreements if trade tensions abate before Magnolia is fully sold out,” he said. The United States is on track to export over 1 trillion cubic feet of gas as LNG in 2018, making the country one of the world’s biggest exporters of the fuel. In 2017, the United States exported 706.4 billion cubic feet worth about $3.3 billion. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. “Like so many LNG projects around the world, Magnolia LNG has struggled to find long-term customers for its LNG,” Ira Joseph, head of global gas and power at S&P Global Platts in New York, said. There are two LNG export terminals operating in the United States, with four more plants expected to enter service next year. Over two dozen U.S. LNG export projects are also in development, and at least ten companies have said they plan to make final decisions to build in the next two years. “LNG demand is indeed growing strongly. However, the universe of proposed projects is many times the size of potential demand growth, so a majority of the proposed but currently unsanctioned projects will fail to reach (final investment decision,” said Bob Ineson, managing director North American natural gas at IHS Markit.

Former Afren Chief Executive Osman Shahenshah and former Chief Operating Officer Shahid Ullah laundered more than $45 million, some of which was used to buy luxury properties in Mustique and the British Virgin Islands, the SFO said. ""The significant sentences reflect the seriousness of this fraud. Shahenshah and Ullah violated their duties and their employees, the board of directors and shareholders paid the price,"" Lisa Osofsky, the director of the SFO, said here in a statement. While the executives have been sentenced to a total of 30 years in jail, the terms will be served concurrently. Shahenshah, who was also the co-founder of Afren, will serve six years, while Ullah will serve five years, the SFO said.  Legal representatives for Shahenshah and Ullah did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The criminal investigation began in June 2015 following a self-report by Afren, while the defendants were charged with four offences in September last year. Shahenshah and Ullah created shell companies and agreed a side deal with one of Afren’s Nigerian oil partners from which they would benefit, without the knowledge of Afren’s board, the SFO said. The two men, who did not enter a plea, were found not guilty at Southwark Crown Court on a separate charge relating to a management buyout of another of Afren’s business partners.

2018-10-29,"ALGIERS/MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI) said on Monday it had struck a deal to team up with French peer Total (TOTF.PA) to look for oil and gas in Algeria and strengthen its position in the north African country. The two oil companies signed a deal with state-owned Algerian energy giant Sonatrach to pursue offshore exploration in the OPEC country while working together on exploration permits.  Algeria is seeking to increase oil output to boost revenues following a crash in prices in 2014. The recent rebound in prices has allowed Sonatrach to invest in petrochemicals, unconventional and offshore. “Together with Sonatrach and Total, we will have the opportunity to explore the deep waters of the Algerian offshore, a virtually unexplored geological province,” Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said. Eni, the biggest foreign oil and gas player in Algeria, said it had also agreed with Sonatrach to take a 49 percent stake in three oil blocks in the Algerian desert estimated to hold 145 million barrels of oil. The licences cover an area in the North Berkine basin where all Eni’s production assets are located and production is expected to start by the end of 2020. Eni has been operating in Algeria since 1981 and has strategic contracts with Sonatrach, importing 27 percent of Italy’s gas last year. With strong output potential in Libya and Egypt, it is looking to help create a gas hub in the Eastern Mediterranean area. It is in advanced talks with Spain’s Naturgy (NTGY.MC) to re-open its liquefied natural gas terminal at Damietta in Egypt which it sees starting operations next year. Eni has stakes in 32 mining permits in Algeria, and produces for itself around 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Eni’s Descalzi said the company is committed to investing in the North African country. “Definitely we will continue to invest and we hope to make a big discovery in the shale as the one we did in Egypt,” Descalzi said in a presentation at the Algiers’ international forum. France’s Total has already signed a $1.5 billion petrochemical deal with Sonatrach. “We will also invest more in Algeria because trust and confidence are back,” Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanne told reporters on the sidelines of the forum.

2018-10-29,"* Large energy companies diving into Africa’s off-grid market * EDF took 50 pct stake in BBOXX last week * BBOXX CEO says corporate money speeding up sector growth By Joe Bavier JOHANNESBURG, Oct 29 (Reuters) - UK-based off-grid power company BBOXX is looking to enter two new African markets in partnership with France’s EDF Group next year as it capitalises on growing interest in the sector from large energy companies, its chief executive said on Monday. The two companies announced last week that the French power utility had taken a 50 percent stake in BBOXX’s operation in Togo, where it won a tender to bring electricity to 300,000 households without access to the national grid. “We are actively looking to enter two more countries with EDF under the same sort of agreement during the course of 2019,” Mansoor Hamayun told Reuters in an interview. “Togo is the starting point.” He would not name the countries - both of them new markets for BBOXX - but said one was located in West Africa and the other in Southern Africa. Big European power utilities are increasingly exploring off-grid technology as a way of expanding their renewables footprint and growing their customer bases beyond stagnating home markets. Some 1.2 billion people around the world have no access to a power grid, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Lighting and phone charging alone costs them about $27 billion a year. “None of the existing business models and none of the existing technologies are able to reach the over 1 billion people who don’t have electricity,” said Hamayun. “That makes off-grid an important priority of organisations like EDF.” EDF’s French rival Engie, oil major Total and power companies Enel of Italy and Germany’s E.ON have all invested in the sector. “Historically the problem to scale for the entire sector has been capital. We have way more customer availability than we have capital to go and fund them,” he said. Founded in 2010, BBOXX has sold 150,000 of its solar home systems, which allow customers without access to a reliable grid to power lights and small appliances. It wants to provide electricity to 20 million people by 2020. The need to provide consumer financing for relatively expensive kits, however, means expansion by companies offering similar solutions requires significant capital. An influx of money from deep-pocketed corporations will likely make that less of an issue, Hamayun said, allowing off-grid companies to scale up their operations in new markets much more quickly. After their initial development in East Africa, that corporate backing has already helped fuel a rapid push by off-grid startups into West Africa. Hamayun said BBOXX, which made an initial investment in Pakistan last year, is already looking beyond the West African boom. “I think the next big frontier ... is going to become Asia quite soon,” he said. “We’re talking hundreds of millions of people who still don’t have electricity.” Reporting by Joe Bavier; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://uk.reuters.com/article/africa-power-bboxx/off-grid-firm-bboxx-targets-two-new-african-markets-with-edf-ceo-idUKL8N1X94KU,29 Oct 2018,"* Large energy companies diving into Africa's off-grid

2018-10-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shale gas company Cuadrilla has paused fracking at its Preston New Road site in northwest England for the second time in two weeks, after a tremor with a magnitude of 1.1 was detected on Monday, the company said. The tremor is the third recorded at the Lancashire site over a 0.5 magnitude limit, set by the government, since the company restarted fracking for natural gas on Oct. 15, although Cuadrilla said one was a so called “trailing event” which didn’t stop production.  Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. It is opposed by environmentalists and green groups who say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, Britain’s government is keen to reduce the country’s reliance on imports of natural gas, which is used to heat around 80 percent of Britain’s homes.     Cuadrilla said Monday’s 1.1 magnitude tremor was way below anything that can be felt at the surface and a very long way from anything that would cause damage or harm.  “In line with regulations, hydraulic fracturing has paused for 18 hours now, during which seismicity will continue to be closely monitored... Well integrity has been checked and verified,” Cuadrilla said in a statement. The company, which is 47.4 percent owned by Australia’s AJ Lucas (AJL.AX) and 45.2 percent owned by a fund managed by Riverstone, first attempted to frack gas near the coastal town of Blackpool in northwestern England in 2011, but the practice led to a 2.3 magnitude earth tremor. It said then that the quakes at that site were caused by an unusual combination of geological features, but they led to an 18-month nationwide ban on fracking while further research was carried out. The government has since introduced a traffic-light system that immediately suspends work if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected.  Cuadrilla said earlier this month it expects to spend at least three months fracking two wells to determine whether full-scale gas extraction would be viable.

2018-10-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - According to Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, no one has any idea how much oil Iran will be able to export after new U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic kick in on Nov. 4. But more precisely, Iran’s shipment figures - crucial to oil markets - are already a mystery. Iran’s oil exports are becoming harder to measure as ships switch off tracking systems, oil industry sources say, adding uncertainty over how far U.S. sanctions are scaring off buyers. The prospect of more oil heading into storage could make number-crunching even tougher. Amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to cool the price of oil, the lack of export clarity adds to the challenge for other OPEC members, chiefly top crude supplier Saudi Arabia, to make up for falling Iranian shipments. Iran is the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and estimates of its crude exports in October vary by more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd). That amount is enough to cover the oil demand of Turkey and move prices in the 100-million-bpd world market.  Before Trump’s May announcement of the sanctions, Iranian exports were above 2.5 million bpd. Falih acknowledged the challenge in an interview with Russia’s TASS news agency published on Oct. 22. “Nobody has a clue what Iranian exports will be,” he said. An Iranian oil official, asked how much crude Iran was exporting in October, declined to comment. Oil prices have extended a rally on expectations the sanctions will test OPEC and other producers. Brent crude on Oct. 3 reached $86.74 a barrel, the highest since 2014, although it has since eased to $77. While the Saudi minister may have been referring to what happens after sanctions kick in, the range of estimates of how much Iran is exporting now is already widening. “A large set of numbers estimating Iranian October first-half exports have been thrown to the market these last few days, ranging for 1 million bpd to 2.2 million bpd, which is a massive spread,” Kpler, a data intelligence company, said. According to Refinitiv Eikon data, Iran exported 1.55 million bpd in the first three weeks of October, higher than the 1.33 million bpd seen in the first two weeks of the month. Kpler put Iranian exports at 1.85 million bpd in the first 24 days of October. An industry source who also tracks the exports estimated a similar volume of 1.8 million bpd in the first half of October, including vessels not showing on satellite tracking. A second source initially agreed and later trimmed his figure to 1.65 million bpd through Oct. 22. “It’s pretty high, I have to admit,” this source said of estimated exports in the first two weeks of the month. “It’s possible that there is a drop-off since.” At any time, adjustments to tanker schedules and week-by-week variation complicate the task. While easier than in the past due to satellite information, the tracking of tankers is still both art and science. Another element may be making this harder, industry sources say. Tankers loading Iranian crude sometimes switch off their AIS signal, an automatic tracking system used on ships, only to switch it back on at a later stage of their journey, according to oil industry sources. This could create a problem for ship-tracking services trying to pinpoint the exact date, or even the exact hour, on which a tanker loaded its crude cargo.  Neither Iran’s National Iranian Oil Co nor National Iranian Tanker Co responded to an emailed request for comment.  “Concretely, we are able to confirm loadings of vessels having shut down AIS transponders by other means such as satellite imagery or by tracking Iranian-flagged tugs, which has proven especially valuable given the lack of AIS coverage throughout much of the Gulf,” Kpler said. Iran was believed by oil trading and shipping sources in 2012 to be hiding the destination of its oil sales by strategically switching off vessels’ tracking systems. Attempts by Reuters to seek official Iranian comment on that development, both in 2012 and for this article, received no response. Iran insists it will keep exporting oil and says the U.S. sanctions will ensure the market remains volatile. “Iranian oil exports cannot be stopped,” Tasnim news agency quoted Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh as saying on Oct. 23. Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said on Sunday: “Despite sanctions, Iran’s oil exports will not fall below a million barrels a day.”  As the number of buyers dwindles, a large volume of Iranian crude is set to arrive at China’s northeast Dalian port this month and in early November. [nL3N1WY44K] China intends to cut purchases in November [nL3N1X43QE]. But Iran is undeterred, planning to send buyers such as India and China oil for storage rather than consumption, making it harder to measure how much oil is reaching the market, sources say. Analysts, in assessing a producer’s supply of oil to the market, generally do not take into account crude moved into storage.  “We will give them oil even for our inventory there,” a source familiar with Iranian thinking said, referring to India. “The same we will do for China.”  The data seen to date suggests Iranian crude exports in October are still down from at least 2.5 million bpd in April, before Trump in May withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions. Exports dropped below 1.2 million bpd under previous sanctions that were lifted following that 2015 nuclear agreement. While Washington has said it wants to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero, Iran and Saudi Arabia say that is unlikely. The Trump administration is considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports. Iran says waivers will be granted allowing shipments to continue at a lower level, as it contends that Saudi Arabia and other producers cannot fully replace Iran’s crude exports. “Waivers are expected, as Saudi Arabia and Russia cannot do it,” the source familiar with Iranian thinking said.

2018-10-29,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CMzx3Y By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers continued to liquidate former bullish positions in oil last week and for the first time in more than a year clear signs of fresh short-selling emerged. Rising oil production from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Russia has eased concerns about the availability of supplies once U.S. sanctions on Iran are re-imposed in November. At the same time, intensifying fears about a possible global economic slowdown have hit oil prices and equity markets hard over the last three weeks. The bullish wave of hedge fund position-building in oil and refined products that started in July 2017 and crested in January 2018 has now largely broken. Portfolio managers’ combined positions in crude and refined products climbed from a low of 310 million barrels at the end of June 2017 to almost 1.5 billion barrels in late January but have since fallen back to just over half that level. Fund managers have not yet turned bearish on the outlook for oil prices; U.S. sanctions on Iran are deterring all but the most aggressive sellers. But the hedge fund community is no longer significantly bullish, with most managers opting to realise their profits after a year-long rally and await further developments. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 111 million barrels in the week to Oct. 23. Portfolio managers have cut their combined net long position by the equivalent of 298 million barrels over the last four weeks to just 801 million barrels, the lowest level for more than a year. Bullish long positions were cut to just 965 million barrels, the lowest level for 65 weeks, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges. The ratio of long to short positions sank to less than 6:1, down from a recent peak of more than 12:1 at the end of September (tmsnrt.rs/2CMzx3Y). Hedge funds cut net length in Brent (-48 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-43 million), U.S. gasoline (-11 million), U.S. heating oil (-7 million) and European gasoil (-2 million). Once again, the sell-off was driven mostly by the liquidation of former bullish long positions, which declined by a combined 81 million barrels. But clear evidence of fresh short selling emerged, with short positions up by 30 million barrels to 164 million barrels, the highest level since the end of June. In the NYMEX WTI contract, fund managers have boosted outright short positions by a total of 42 million barrels since the end of August, initiating the first new cycle of short-selling for almost a year.

Europe’s autos sector jumped 4.9 percent, set for its strongest day since August 2015, after a report that China was considering halving the tax on car purchases in an attempt to boost demand for autos, which has been hurt by a trade war and slowing economic growth. Germany’s DAX jumped 2.1 percent by 1310 GMT, boosted by carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, while the leading index of euro zone stocks rose 1.5 percent. Italy’s FTSE MIB led the market with a 2.4 percent gain after Italian bond yields fell sharply to a one-week low following Standard & Poor’s decision to leave Italy’s sovereign rating unchanged, prompting relief there was no ratings downgrade. This also pushed Italian bank stocks up as much as 4.5 percent, set for their strongest day since Sept. 10. Strong gains across Europe helped boost U.S. stock futures back into the positive, with the Nasdaq futures up 1.4 percent, S&P 500 futures up 1.1 percent and Dow Jones futures up 0.7 percent. The MSCI world equity index, tracking shares in 47 countries, extended early gains to rise 0.4 percent. The index is down 9.3 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7 trillion in market capitalisation since its January peak. Investors shrugged off news German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek re-election as party chairwoman, as she said she would serve her full term as chancellor until 2021. Analysts saw little likelihood of policy disruption. Her decision, which followed bruising losses for her Christian Democrats in a regional election in Hesse, heralded the end of an era in which she has dominated European politics. Despite gains on Monday, investors remained wary of betting on a turnaround in risk. “The only way I can summarize the core sentiment among the European investors I met is something like ‘pretty grim’,” wrote Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, in a note to clients. Overnight Asian stock trading was dampened by China’s blue-chip index which tumbled more than 3.3 percent. Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy as profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw materials and manufactured goods. Global financial markets have been hit by negative factors from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict to tensions in Europe over Italy’s budget and tightening monetary policy. Many indices are already in official correction territory amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global growth. “With the volatility of the last week or so, today’s stronger open to markets should not be seen as a sea change but more a pause for breath,” said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald. Analysts have been downgrading their estimates for European earnings at the fastest pace since February 2016, and weak results from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet hurt U.S. stocks at the end of last week. Emerging markets stocks built on early gains to climb 0.7 percent in their first rise in five sessions after far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won the runoff in Brazil’s presidential election. Brazil-exposed stocks in Europe climbed on his win. Blackrock’s Latin American Investment Trust London-listed shares gained 8.4 percent while a Germany-listed iShares MSCI Brazil ETF climbed 5.8 percent. “Our initial assessment for the Bolsonaro administration is that it will have a pro-business stance, focused on enhancing the country’s competitiveness,” said UBS analysts. Foreign exchange markets were relatively subdued with the dollar index leading, up 0.3 percent. The euro fell on the Merkel news, down 0.2 percent at $1.1381. Sterling dipped 0.1 percent, near a two-month trough of $1.2775 before Britain’s annual budget due later on Monday. Finance minister Philip Hammond is likely to urge his divided Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity. In commodities, oil prices dipped as investors priced in growing worries about Chinese growth. U.S. crude fell 43 cents to $67.17 per barrel and Brent crude slid 44 cents to $77.18.

2018-10-29,"LISBON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Portugal’s Galp Energia raised its 2018 pre-tax earnings estimate to 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion) from a previous forecast of 1.8-1.9 billion on Monday, as a jump in oil prices and stronger output boosted its third-quarter results. Galp shares rose by more than 3 percent to 15.5 euros, outperforming the broader Lisbon, which was up by 1.3 percent, and the Stoxx 600 oil and gas index, which was 1.4 percent higher. Oil and gas output rose 10 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier to around 104,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but Galp’s new projection for a full-year output increase of 15 percent came at the lower end of its previous forecast range of 15-20 percent. International oil prices surged over 40 percent in the quarter from a year ago. Third-quarter net income and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) rose 35 percent and 38 percent respectively, in line with market expectations, even as refining margin fell 21 percent and refinery throughput declined 7 percent due to scheduled maintenance. Galp’s refining margin of $5.8 per barrel was nevertheless well above the industry’s benchmark of $3.2 in the quarter. The rise in projected EBITDA came despite expectations of a “weaker refining environment in the fourth quarter”. The company, which is a relative newcomer in the world of big oil, plans to boost output to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020. Most of Galp’s production growth will come from Brazil, where it has stakes in large offshore oil fields and is looking for further expansion opportunities.

2018-10-29,"NORWICH, England (Reuters) - Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power will use offshore wind power to replace the capacity of the gas and hydro power projects it is selling, with wind becoming its sole source of electricity production, Iberdrola’s director of Offshore told Reuters. Scottish Power, the British arm of the Spanish energy giant, earlier this month announced plans to sell a group of gas, hydro and pumped storage power plants for 702 million pounds ($900 million) to British power generator Drax (DRX.L). The sale makes Scottish Power the first of Britain’s big six energy suppliers to shift to 100 percent renewable electricity generation but it will more than halve its UK capacity. Scottish Power already owns around 2,000 megawatts (MW) of operational on and offshore wind projects in the UK and plans to more than double this, with new East Anglia wind projects off the east coast of England set to replace the lost generation, Jonathan Cole told Reuters in an interview. “If you look at the capacity of East Anglia one and three, with the two projects alone we will cover the generation being sold to Drax,” he said. The 2.5 billion pound East Anglia One project will, at 714 megawatts (MW) of capacity, produce enough electricity to power around 600,000 homes in 2020. The company is also developing the East Anglia Three windfarm, which at 1,200 MW could power around 890,000 homes. Scottish Power has almost 3 million electricity customers and 2 million gas customers in the UK. It does not yet have the capacity to provide all these customers with renewable power but this will change as new projects are built, Cole said. “It’s entirely feasible that at some point in the future we will produce enough power on our own to supply all our customers with renewable energy,” he said. At the East Anglia One site Iberdrola has installed 37 of 102 jacket foundations which will provide the base to house the near 200 meter high turbine towers for the project. East Anglia One has already secured a subsidy from Britain’s government through its contracts for difference renewable auction and Cole said the company will enter East Anglia Three into next year’s auction. “It’s fully consented, with everything ready to bid into the next auction process in the UK next year,” he said. Under the government’s renewable subsidy auctions project developers are awarded a minimum price for the electricity they will produce.     The cost of producing electricity from offshore windfarms has plummeted in the past few years, helped by larger turbines. Britain’s last renewable auction, held in 2017, cleared at a record low of 57.50-74.75 pounds per megawatt hour for offshore wind, figures Cole said the company is comfortable with. “Anyone who’s in the UK market has to look at what happened last time and be pitching around that level,” he said. Scottish Power could also develop two more East Anglia sites with a combined capacity of 1,700 MW, he added.

2018-10-29,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's diesel output and exports: tmsnrt.rs/2phRfVg By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 29 (Reuters) - It may be stretching the bow too far to blame Donald Trump for the collapse in the profits Asian refiners get for making gasoline, or indeed for the surge in diesel profits, but the policies of the U.S. president are certainly playing a role. The profit margin on producing 92-octane gasoline at a typical Singapore refinery GL92-SIN-CRK dropped to $2.37 per barrel of Brent crude on Oct. 26, the lowest in 27 months, according to Refinitiv data. At the same time, the profit, or crack, for making a barrel of gasoil with 10 parts per million of sulphur - the base for diesel and jet fuel - reached $18.53 above the price of a barrel of Dubai crude on Oct. 26, the strongest since February 2015. This means that Asian refiners are making large profits from producing diesel and jet fuel, but barely scraping by on gasoline. However, the strong profits for the middle-distillate fuels mean the refiners are still incentivised to maximise their crude throughput. That means they will continue to produce large volumes of gasoline, even though it’s hardly worth their while to do so. How does Trump fit into this picture? The main influences are the unintended side-effects of his administration’s ongoing trade war with China and the renewed sanctions against Iran’s crude oil exports. The escalating trade dispute with China has led the authorities in Beijing to once again open the infrastructure spending taps in a bid to stave off a slowdown in their economy caused by the U.S. imposition of tariffs on imports from China. This has had the impact of increasing domestic diesel demand, which has led to a reduction on Chinese exports of the transport fuel. China’s exports of diesel in September dropped to a 21-month low of 1.03 million tonnes, or about 257,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to customs data released on Oct. 23. In the first eight months of the year, China’s diesel exports had averaged 409,000 bpd, and in May they reached 484,000 bpd, the highest month so far in 2018. The surge in China’s diesel exports in May also coincided with the weakest profit margins for Asian refiners producing the fuel, with the crack dropping from mid-May to late June, when it hit a low for 2018 of $12.97 a barrel on June 27. Lower diesel exports from China are likely to have helped push the profit margin to its recent highs, but it’s also worth noting that Asian refiners are finding it harder to source barrels of heavy sour crude grades. These typically yield more middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel, and fewer light distillates like gasoline and naphtha. The Trump administration’s renewed sanctions on Iran’s crude exports come into effect on Nov. 4, but major buyers in Asia, such as India, have already cut back on purchases from the Islamic Republic. While China has yet to curtail its buying from Iran, indications are that it will do so from next month. It’s also likely that much of the Iranian crude heading to China will be placed in bonded storage tanks, meaning it won’t clear customs and is therefore unavailable to Chinese refiners. Overall, the impact has been to reduce the amount of heavy crude available to Asian refiners, many of which operate complex plants capable of maximising diesel and jet fuel output from this type of crude. The reduction in cargoes heading to Asia from Venezuela, another heavy crude producer, has exacerbated the situation. Some refiners have been turning to lighter crudes from Russia, the United States and West Africa to replace heavy crudes, which have also become more expensive. This has increased the amount of gasoline available in Asia, contributing to a reduction in the profit margin for making the fuel predominately used by light vehicles. The gasoline glut may become worse in the coming weeks as China has issued new fuel export quotas. These will likely increase the amount of fuel being exported. There is a further interesting dynamic at play at the retail level in several countries in the Asia-Pacific region: gasoline prices haven’t dropped much at all for consumers. In India and China, gasoline prices are higher than those for diesel, while in Australia, gasoline is only slightly cheaper. While Chinese retail prices may well be described as managed according to movements in the crude price, those in India and Australia are largely set by market forces. If there is a glut of gasoline in the region, it would be logical to expect refiners to try and clear it by lowering prices in order to stimulate demand. But this hasn’t happened so far.

2018-10-29,"WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The top U.S. coal miners union has put a larger share of its campaign donations behind Democrats ahead of the Nov. 6 elections than in 2016, as dimming hopes for a coal industry revival led by President Donald Trump reinforce fears about the safety of worker pensions. The United Mine Workers of America has donated nearly 84 percent of its money to Democratic candidates and committees in national races, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance data. That is a roughly 20-point jump from 2016, when Trump courted coal miners with promises of an industry comeback. The UMWA, pumping more money into races this year, has spent $910,000 of its more than $1 million in total on donations to Democrats and advertising supporting them through mid-October, compared with $250,000 of $395,000 to Democrats through mid-October 2016. The shift marks a setback for efforts by Trump and the Republican party to maintain control of Congress. He had won over many U.S. coal miners during the last election with promises to scrap Obama-era environmental regulations blamed for the industry’s demise. While the Trump administration has rolled back some environmental protections in its first two years, the promise of a coal comeback has yet to be fulfilled. A Reuters survey of utilities found that the administration’s replacement of Obama-era carbon regulations will not save U.S. coal-fired power plants from shutdown. Ongoing closings of coal-fired plants have meanwhile pushed U.S. coal consumption by utilities this year to the lowest since 1983, according to the Energy Information Administration. The UMWA said it is not intentionally favoring Democrats but rather donating to lawmakers who support miners’ pension funds, which have been undermined by coal company bankruptcies and which the Republican-led Congress has failed to backstop. “We have one primary criteria for making contributions to any candidate of either party: Do they support our fight to preserve our retirees’ pensions? If the answer is yes, then we support that candidate,” said Phil Smith, the UMWA’s spokesman. The UMWA’s support for Democrats sagged in 2016 when Trump focused his campaign on undoing Obama-era regulations limiting greenhouse gases, which he described as part of a “war on coal.” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said the union’s donations this year marked a shift back to the union’s core labor values, and away from hopes for the promised rebound in coal country. “The ‘war on coal’ narrative is basically over. Now the things that people are concerned about are health care and pensions ... these are the overwhelming issues that dominate their lives,” he said. Still, the UMWA’s support for Democrats remains below where it had been earlier in the decade. In 2014, the union gave 92 percent of its money to Democrats, while in 2012 it was 96 percent. Trump’s 2020 campaign team did not immediately comment. The Republican National Committee did not comment. UMWA has boosted donations to sitting Democratic senators from industrial states who championed funding miners’ pensions -including Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who is in a tight race with Republican Mike Braun. But the union has also been favoring a different breed Democrat in many races - often military veterans who, in addition to supporting labor causes, can hold their own against Republicans that cast Democrats as anti-gun or weak on crime. Conor Lamb, a Marine veteran, for example, won a special U.S. House race in Pennsylvania earlier this year against Republican Rick Saccone, aided in part by coal miner rallies and a UMWA endorsement. The UMWA is also backing West Virginia congressional hopeful Richard Ojeda, a 24-year Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Once seen as a long-shot candidate, Ojeda now only trails his Republican opponent, Carol Miller, by a few percentage points in a district Trump carried by about a 50-point margin in 2016. Other Democratic veterans with UMWA support include Anthony Brown of Maryland, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Randy Bryce in the Wisconsin district of Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is not seeking reelection. Underscoring the point, the UMWA’s political action committee in July gave $75,000 to VoteVets, a progressive political action committee that supports veterans running for office, a 15-fold increase from its 2016 donation to the group. “People who have been out in the field in the military understand the plight of people who work for a living in the coal mine,” said Jon Soltz, the chairman and co-founder of VoteVets. Republicans who support miner pensions who received UMWA donations include Representatives David McKinley of West Virginia, and Mike Bost and Rodney Davis of Illinois.

2018-10-29,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chemical giant BASF (BASFn.DE) said on Monday it had signed a  memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China’s Sinopec Corp (600028.SS) to build a steam cracker in east China, the second major investment pledged by the German firm in four months. China, the world’s top chemicals consumer, is allowing greater access by global majors and local independents to its massive chemicals market to feed plastics, coatings and adhesives to the fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors, as well as polyesters for clothing. According to the MoU, BASF-YPC, the German group’s joint venture with Sinopec in Nanjing, will invest in a 50 percent stake in the new cracker. SINOPEC Yangtzi Petrochemical (YPC) will take the other 50 percent. “This additional investment into a new steam cracker and the expansion of our BASF-YPC joint venture in Nanjing underline the strong partnership between Sinopec and BASF and the commitment to our customers in China,” BASF Chief Executive Martin Brudermueller said. BASF said the new steam cracker will have an annual capacity of one million tonnes of ethylene, a building block for plastics, rubber and synthetic fibre. The group declined to disclose financial details. A joint venture consisting of French oil group Total (TOTF.PA), Borealis [BESGR.UL] and NOVA Chemicals [INPTVN.UL] last year said it would spend $1.7 billion on an ethane steam cracker at Port Arthur, Texas, with a similar capacity. In July, BASF landed a preliminary deal to build China’s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex in Guangdong, worth some $10 billion in investment to 2030, aided in part by trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The German group made 22 percent of sales in the Asia-Pacific region last year, its annual report shows. It does not break out Chinese numbers. BASF said a joint pre-feasibility study on the cracker will be completed by the end of 2018. Zhong Jian, chief analyst with consultancy JLC, said global chemicals firms have been encouraged by China’s top leaders, who have repeatedly expressed support this year for foreign investment in the petrochemicals sector. “The companies are more ambitious than just building ethylene plants. They are aiming for a bigger market share in the whole supply chain and the ethylene complex might just be their first step,” said Zhong. BASF and Sinopec will also explore new business opportunities in China’s fast-growing battery materials market, they said. Founded in 2000, BASF-YPC has spent approximately $5.2 billion in China. “The rising importance of alternative energy in China, especially in the automotive industry, has led to a surge in demand for innovative battery materials for a range of applications,” the groups said in a joint statement. Following on from BASF’s July deal, U.S. energy titan Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) signed a pact in September to build a petrochemical complex in Huizhou city of Guangdong, which will also be solely foreign-owned. Just a week later, Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE followed suit and signed a deal with Fujian government.

The euro, however, fell to a session low after a senior party source said German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek re-election as party chairwoman after bruising losses for her Christian Democrats in a regional election in Hesse. Germany’s DAX was up 0.7 percent by 0929 GMT while the leading index of euro zone stocks rose 0.5 percent, boosted by a weaker euro. Italy’s FTSE MIB led the market with a 1.5 percent gain after Italian bond yields fell sharply to a one-week low following Standard & Poor’s decision to leave Italy’s sovereign rating unchanged, sparking relief there was no ratings downgrade. This also boosted Italian bank stocks up 2.7 percent. Despite gains on Monday, investors remained wary of betting the farm on a turnaround in risk. “The only way I can summarize the core sentiment among the European investors I met is something like ‘pretty grim’,” wrote Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, in a note to clients. The MSCI world equity index, tracking shares in 47 countries, managed a 0.1 percent gain. The index is down 9.3 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7 trillion in market capitalisation since its January peak. Overnight losses in Asia were largely led by China’s blue-chip index which tumbled more than 3.3 percent. Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy as profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw materials and manufactured goods. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial futures declined 0.2 to 0.3 percent after the figures, reversing gains of as much as 0.4 percent earlier. Global financial markets have been hit by a range of negative factors from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict to tensions in Europe over Italy’s budget and tightening monetary policy. Many indices are already in official correction territory amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global growth. Analysts have been downgrading their estimates for European earnings at the fastest pace since Feb 2016, and weak results from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet hurt U.S. stocks at the end of last week. Emerging markets stocks were a bright spot, gaining 0.1 percent in their first rise in five sessions after far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won the second-round runoff in Brazil’s presidential election. Brazil-exposed stocks in Europe climbed as investors cheered the win. Blackrock’s Latin American Investment Trust London-listed shares gained 7.4 percent while a Germany-listed iShares MSCI Brazil ETF climbed 6.6 percent. “Our initial assessment for the Bolsonaro administration is that it will have a pro-business stance, focused on enhancing the country’s competitiveness,” said UBS analysts. In FX, the dollar index rose 0.2 percent to 96.553 after gaining 0.7 percent last week. The euro fell 0.2 percent to near a two-month low at $1.1381. Sterling fell 0.2 percent, holding near a two-month trough of $1.2775 ahead of Britain’s annual budget due later on Monday. Finance minister Philip Hammond will likely urge his divided Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity. In commodities, oil also reversed early gains to dip on growing worries about Chinese growth. U.S. crude fell 58 cents to $67.01 per barrel and Brent crude slid 71 cents to $76.89. Spot gold prices edged lower as the dollar firmed. Reporting by Helen Reid

2018-10-29,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian oil and gas firm Equinor (EQNR.OL) has found more oil near its Johan Castberg field in the Arctic Barents Sea, the company said on Monday. The Skruis exploration well, drilled about 8 kilometres north of the original discovery, indicated a volume of 12-25 million recoverable barrels of oil. “The Skruis discovery confirms the potential in this part of the Barents Sea ... The partners will now further consider tie-in of the discovery to Johan Castberg,” Equinor said. The Castberg field, estimated to hold 450-650 million barrels of oil, excluding Skruis, is expected to start in 2022. The timeframe for developing Skruis would depend on the availability of spare capacity at Johan Castberg production facilities, which are likely to be fully utilised until 2026-2027, the company added. Equinor, the operator, holds a 50 percent stake in the Johan Castberg licence, while Eni (ENI.MI) has 30 percent and Norway’s state-owned Petoro the remaining 20 percent.

2018-10-29,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s pollution control efforts are coming under increasing pressure from the nation’s slowing economy and officials must not drop their guard this winter, the country’s environment minister said in remarks published on Monday. At a meeting last week, Minister of Ecology and Environment Li Ganjie told officials that China’s clean-up campaign was becoming “increasingly complex”, according to details of the meeting published by the ministry’s official publication, China Environmental News. Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this year promised to use the full might of the Communist Party to tackle the country’s longstanding environmental problems, but the government is also trying to ensure the war on pollution does not disrupt an already slowing economy. After shutting down huge swathes of industry last winter to meet politically crucial smog targets, it has promised to take a more flexible approach this year, giving local governments the power to set their own goals.      But while China is “ahead of schedule” when it comes to curbing pollution, the environment now faced an increasing number of challenges as a result of slowing growth, structural economic adjustments, widening regional disparities and unfavorable weather conditions, environment minister Li told officials. China’s economy experienced its slowest quarter since 2009 from July to September this year, with gross domestic product rising 6.5 percent compared to a year earlier. Industrial profits also slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September.   But though China is taking action to try to stimulate growth, several key regions are still about to embark on a winter campaign against smog that is expected to force hundreds of factories to cut production.  The major manufacturing hub of Jiangsu in eastern China and the top steel producing region of Hebei in the north will both impose production cuts of between 30-50 percent this winter, and other cities in the north are under pressure to meet air quality targets.  The government has already worked to try to minimize the economic impact of the crackdowns on the economy, and has repeatedly promised to put an end to the “one size fits all” measures that forced factories to shut down whether they had implemented pollution controls or not. At the meeting last week, Li said China would draw up more detailed guidelines to help prevent such behavior this year, and would also establish dedicated investigative teams to help eliminate the practice.

2018-10-29,"SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), currently India’s second most valuable listed company, got rich by trading fuel across Asia, Africa and Europe while effectively ignoring its home market. Reliance’s refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That began to change when India’s oil demand surged, overtaking Japan as the world’s third-biggest consumer. Reliance took more interest in the country’s retail fuel sector and has opened more than 1,300 service stations. This push into the domestic fuel market may stumble after India’s government imposed cost controls on Oct. 4 on gasoline and diesel prices to rein in recent record highs. Reliance’s shares plunged 6.9 percent on the day of the announcement and are down about 20 percent since their record close on Aug. 28. The decline has pushed Reliance’s market capitalization down to 6.64 trillion rupees ($90.47 billion) and it is no longer India’s most valuable company, sitting behind Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS.NS) at 6.77 trillion rupees. The price shock, driven by soaring crude import costs, angered consumers and triggered riots by farmers, forcing the government to react at the cost of its refiners’ health. For now, Reliance is staying with its retail plans despite the recent trouble. “When prices are cut, you have to effectively match it,” said Venkatachari Srikanth, Reliance’s joint chief financial officer, during their earnings presentation on Oct. 17. “We are not going to let this alter broadly our strategy on retail petroleum.” In line with that, Reliance is planning as many as 2,000 retail stations with oil major BP Plc over the next three years, local media reported on Tuesday. Reliance’s domestic push made sense in an Asian fuel market that is increasingly crowded with new refinery capacity from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and China. The new capacity, combined with soaring crude prices, has eroded profit margins for producing refined fuels. With the domestic market now also under pressure from price controls, some analysts have been spooked. Sukrit Vijayakar, director of Indian oil consultancy Trifecta said the government move could “be disastrous for Reliance.” The retail move puts Reliance into competition against government controlled refiners like Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL.NS), Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL.NS) and Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS), the country’s biggest refiner. Reliance’s domestic strategy initially won the backing of investors and the retail fuels group was touted by company Chairman Mukesh Ambani in a speech at its annual general meeting in July. Between January and August, Reliance's shares soared 45 percent, far outpacing the state-owned refiners as well as India's main stock index, the Nifty 50 .NSEI, which gained 12.5 percent. But rising crude prices LCOc1, which jumped from under $70 per barrel in early 2018 to around $85 in early October, and a tumbling rupee INRUSD=R combined to push domestic fuel prices to records, undermining Reliance’s retail strategy despite some relief from a dip in crude prices in recent weeks. Still, Rohit Ahuja, senior vice president of India’s BOB Capital Markets, which has a buy rating on Reliance, said signs of an “oil price shock” in India were “already visible.” Reliance may gradually mothball its retail stations because of the cost controls, said Macquarie Capital Ltd Analyst Aditya Suresh in a note on Oct. 5, though the bank expects no meaningful impact on its earnings. Reliance may be better placed to thrive on exports despite the increasing competition in Asia and the Middle East. The company operates the world’s biggest refinery complex at the port of Jamnagar in the western Indian state of Gujarat. The first Jamnagar plant can process 663,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude while the second site can process another 709,000 bpd. Reliance’s refining margins last quarter were at a premium of $3.40 per barrel over the average Singapore margin, the benchmark for Asia. However, the Singapore margin DUB-SIN-REF has dropped by about 50 percent since mid-2017 because of rising crude prices. Reliance also said in its results that fewer refinery outages last quarter meant global run rates were high. Still, Reliance’s refineries benefit from being among the most modern in the world.  Several units process residual fuel oil, the leftovers after crude oil is initially refined, into higher-value gasoline and distillate products as well as remove pollutants such as sulfur.  That ability to cut its high-sulfur fuel oil output to nearly nothing while maximizing its diesel fuel output gives Reliance an advantage as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will require new low-sulfur fuel oil used in ships starting in 2020. “IMO regulations are positive because of our mid-distillate configuration,” said Reliance’s Srikanth. With a move toward cleaner fuels as part of IMO, BOB Capital’s Ahuja said Reliance’s gross refining margins could rise by up to $5 per barrel.   Beyond IMO 2020 and the Indian fuel price turmoil, the oil industry is threatened by the rise of electric vehicles and alternative fuels that could reduce oil’s use as a transport fuel. Refiners are looking at petrochemicals to replace potentially lost demand in the transport sector. “If I have to look at it from a ‘oil demand hit from electric vehicles’ perspective, it’s going to be petrochemicals that’s going to survive for them (Reliance) beyond ten years,” said Ahuja. Combined, Reliance’s refining and marketing group along with its petrochemicals division contribute more than 90 percent of the overall company revenues, its latest annual report showed. Under Reliance’s “Oil to Chemicals Journey” strategy the company is seeking to “upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals” over the next decade. “We are focusing to produce and sell at every level,” said Reliance’s Srikanth. “Between whether to sell domestically or on bulk, whether we will export, every day is an analysis of which is a better option.” Reporting by Koustav Samanta in SINGAPORE and Promit Muhkerjee in NEW DELHI; Writing by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/reliance-india/focus-after-years-of-global-success-indias-reliance-industries-faces-oil-shock-at-home-idUKL8N1WK1ZU,29 Oct 2018,* India's petrol is very expensive: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ol51EM,"FOCUS-After years of global success, India's Reliance Industries faces oil shock at home"
2018-10-29,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Vattenfall is considering converting its German coal-fired power stations to use fuels including gas or biomass as utility companies in the country brace for a government deadline for phasing out coal altogether. The end of coal is the latest major challenge power firms face in Germany, whose energy transformation, or “Energiewende”, has already included a rushed exit from nuclear power and a costly expansion of solar and wind capacity. Vattenfall corporate.vattenfall.com, owned by the Swedish state, operates 2.9 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power stations in Germany, including the 1.7 GW Moorburg site that only opened three years ago and supplies 80 percent of Hamburg's electricity. The way German power station operators deal with their coal assets is crucial for investors, jittery ahead of a December announcement from a government-appointed commission about how coal plants will be phased out of Europe’s largest economy. “How long Moorburg will run significantly depends on what the coal commission decides,” Vattenfall [VATN.UL] board member Tuomo Hatakka told Reuters. “We will also examine alternatives for how to shape Moorburg’s future, for example through the use of biomass. We are at a very early stage in this process.” German rivals EnBW (EBKG.DE), RWE (RWEG.DE) and Uniper (UN01.DE), have also started to retrofit coal plants for biomass or gas, or are considering such steps to soften the hit to earnings a shutdown of the power stations would entail. An accelerated shutdown of Moorburg would be a major blow to Vattenfall, which spent 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion) on the plant. Converting coal-fired plants to fuels such as gas or biomass would also lead to marked drop in generating capacity. Hatakka also said Vattenfall was planning to shut its Reuter West and Moabit coal-fired stations no later than 2030 and partially replace them with industrial waste heat, waste burning, biomass, power-to-heat and gas technology. For graphic on Dirty addiction, click tmsnrt.rs/2R73qjo Shutting coal plants will be the third major shift for power companies in a decade. They scrambled to cope with a state-ordered expansion of renewable energy and then faced the sudden decision to stop nuclear power after Japan’s Fukushima disaster. As a result of the policy changes, German electricity consumers now stump up more than 20 billion euros a year to subsidise solar and wind power, while utilities had to write off billions of euros from their nuclear stations. Berlin later had to compensate them for the forced closures. ""I don't believe that wind turbines and solar modules will be enough to generate power in the future,"" said Georg Oehm, chair of the administrative board of the 53 million euro Mellinckrodt www.mellinckrodt.com/en equity fund A1T72CX.DX. In 2017, cheap nuclear power accounted for just 12 percent of Germany’s power production, down from 22 percent a decade ago. Meanwhile, the share of renewables in the energy mix more than doubled to a third last year. Germany aims to raise that to 65 percent by 2030 to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and achieve its climate commitments. Britain and Spain, in contrast, have taken a more measured and less costly approach to expanding renewable energy and kept nuclear plants on line to provide cheap energy, EU data shows. The use of coal to generate electricity in Germany is on the wane but it is still the most commonly used fuel. In 2017, coal and lignite, or brown coal, accounted for 37 percent of power production, down from 46 percent a decade ago. Biomass usually refers to energy generated by burning wood pellets, often made from compressed sawdust, or other organic matter. The 31-member coal commission will likely recommend an end-date for coal plants in the 2030s, several people close to the commission told Reuters. Two said co-chair Ronald Pofalla last month recommended a complete phase out between 2035 and 2038. The commission declined to comment. The oldest and most polluting plants are expected to be shut down right away though operators may be allowed to compensate for a fall in capacity by producing more power at newer coal plants for a while. EnBW said switching to gas and biomass could work for its coal-fired plants, as did RWE, Germany’s leader with 14.7 GW of coal-powered production capacity. It said building new plants on phased-out coal sites would be an option. ""Premises like that are in demand,"" RWE said, adding that it could also sell sites to investors - as it did in Britain last year by selling its oil-fired Littlebrook plant to real estate investment trust Tritax Big Box tritaxbigbox.co.uk. RWE, reeling from a court decision this month that effectively delayed brown coal mining in the Hambach Forest hambachforest.org, singled out its former plants at Voerde and Bochum as being potentially attractive for investors. Uniper sees similar potential for converting its 828 mega-watt (MW) coal-fired Scholven plant in the industrial heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is spending at least 100 million euros to retrofit the plant with gas turbines by 2022. As part of the plan, Uniper has teamed up with German chemicals company Evonik (EVKn.DE) to build a 15 km (10 mile) gas pipeline to connect Scholven to the network of Open Grid Europe (MQG.AX) (MUVGn.DE). The retrofit, however, will drastically cut Scholven’s capacity to about 110 MW, because it is harder to turn a profit from gas which is imported mainly from Russia and is more expensive than coal. “It’s open how many employees will still be working here in the future,” said the plant’s manager Lars Wiese, adding that Scholven’s current workforce of about 200 could more than halve. To make sure its Scholven investment will pay off, Uniper has agreed a long-term partnership extension with an industrial enterprise nearby. It declined to name the partner. Companies with operations close to Scholven include British oil company BP (BP.L) and chemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE. Wiese said Scholven could also offer services such as delivering compressed air, water treatment, waste heat utilisation and plant maintenance. LEAG www.leag.de/en/company, Germany's second-biggest operator of coal-fired power stations with about 8.1 GW of capacity, declined to comment on its plans. LEAG is owned by Czech energy company EPH www.epholding.cz/en and private equity firm PPF Investments www.ppfinvestments.com. Investors such as Germany's Union Investment union-investment.com/home.html and Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund www.nbim.no/en/the-fund are watching for cuts in exposure to polluting assets closely - as they are not allowed to invest in companies that derive a substantial share of sales from coal. “We have to regularly review our stance also with regard to coal,” said Thomas Deser, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment, which holds shares in RWE and Uniper.

The losses in Asia were largely led by China’s blue-chip index which tumbled over 3.3 percent following disappointing earnings from the country’s top liquor maker, Kweichow Moutai. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index also turned red, leaving MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan mostly flat after rising over 0.5 percent earlier in the day. Chinese data over the weekend underscored worries of a cooling economy as profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September as sales of raw materials and manufactured goods ebbed. Citibank has projected China’s real economic growth to slow to 6.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter “amid trade headwinds and domestic uncertainties,” compared to a 6.8 percent rise at the start of the year. “As lagging indicators, overall industrial revenue and profit should continue to soften accordingly,” it said. Wider sentiment in global financial markets has been hit by a range of negative factors from an intensifying China-U.S. trade conflict to worries about U.S. corporate earnings to Italian budget woes as well as Federal Reserve rate increases. Analysts warn of more volatility after heavy losses across major equity indices left investors with negative returns for the year. Bears are on the rise, with some indices already in official correction territory amid heightened worries over corporate earnings and global growth. “We’re now over halfway through the U.S. earnings season and while headline growth remains strong, there are a number of trends making market participants nervous,” asset manager Insight Investment wrote in a note to clients. It cited “explicit commentary” by Caterpillar, 3M and Ford on the adverse effects of U.S. import tariffs and disappointing revenue growth by Amazon and Alphabet among top concerns for investors. More companies have lagged forecasts this quarter with the beat rate on sales at 44 percent compared with 58 percent last quarter, Insight Investment said. “European earnings are showing a similar trend, with only 43 percent beating estimates, the lowest in five years. Raw material costs appear to be the main headwind,” it added. In another sign of increased risk aversion, 10-year U.S. Treasuries reversed early gains to be almost flat on the day . Among emerging markets, Brazilian-linked stocks got a lift from the South American country’s presidential election, which saw the victory of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro whose campaign centred on promises to clean up politics and crack down on crime. Tokyo-listed Brazilian stock exchange traded funds (ETFs) jumped nearly 14 percent to 7-1/2-month highs after Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, propelled to victory. The safe-haven Japanese yen has benefited from the global sell-off in riskier assets as investors unwound carry trade exposures. It gained 0.6 percent last week and was last at 111.87 per dollar. Over this week, investors will keep an eye on the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy announcement due Wednesday. The dollar index rose 0.1 percent to 96.470 after gaining 0.7 percent last week. The euro hovered near a more than two-month low to hold at $1.1389. Investors heaved a sigh of relief after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s junior coalition partners gave her conservatives until next year to deliver more policy results. However, concerns loomed over her future after both parties suffered in a regional election on Sunday. Sterling held near a two-month trough of $1.2775 ahead of Britain’s annual budget due Monday. Finance Minister Philip Hammond will likely urge his divided Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity. In commodities, oil also reversed early gains tracking Wall Street futures lower. U.S. crude slipped 29 cents to $67.30 per barrel and Brent eased 37 cents to $77.25. Spot gold was a shade weaker at 1,232.34 an ounce.

2018-10-29,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's diesel output and exports: tmsnrt.rs/2phRfVg By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 29 (Reuters) - It may be stretching the bow too far to blame Donald Trump for the collapse in the profits Asian refiners get for making gasoline, or indeed for the surge in diesel profits, but the policies of the U.S. president are certainly playing a role. The profit margin on producing 92-octane gasoline at a typical Singapore refinery GL92-SIN-CRK dropped to $2.37 per barrel of Brent crude on Oct. 26, the lowest in 27 months, according to Refinitiv data. At the same time, the profit, or crack, for making a barrel of gasoil with 10 parts per million of sulphur - the base for diesel and jet fuel - reached $18.53 above the price of a barrel of Dubai crude on Oct. 26, the strongest since February 2015. This means that Asian refiners are making large profits from producing diesel and jet fuel, but barely scraping by on gasoline. However, the strong profits for the middle-distillate fuels mean the refiners are still incentivised to maximise their crude throughput. That means they will continue to produce large volumes of gasoline, even though it’s hardly worth their while to do so. How does Trump fit into this picture? The main influences are the unintended side-effects of his administration’s ongoing trade war with China and the renewed sanctions against Iran’s crude oil exports. The escalating trade dispute with China has led the authorities in Beijing to once again open the infrastructure spending taps in a bid to stave off a slowdown in their economy caused by the U.S. imposition of tariffs on imports from China. This has had the impact of increasing domestic diesel demand, which has led to a reduction on Chinese exports of the transport fuel. China’s exports of diesel in September dropped to a 21-month low of 1.03 million tonnes, or about 257,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to customs data released on Oct. 23. In the first eight months of the year, China’s diesel exports had averaged 409,000 bpd, and in May they reached 484,000 bpd, the highest month so far in 2018. The surge in China’s diesel exports in May also coincided with the weakest profit margins for Asian refiners producing the fuel, with the crack dropping from mid-May to late June, when it hit a low for 2018 of $12.97 a barrel on June 27. Lower diesel exports from China are likely to have helped push the profit margin to its recent highs, but it’s also worth noting that Asian refiners are finding it harder to source barrels of heavy sour crude grades. These typically yield more middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel, and fewer light distillates like gasoline and naphtha. The Trump administration’s renewed sanctions on Iran’s crude exports come into effect on Nov. 4, but major buyers in Asia, such as India, have already cut back on purchases from the Islamic Republic. While China has yet to curtail its buying from Iran, indications are that it will do so from next month. It’s also likely that much of the Iranian crude heading to China will be placed in bonded storage tanks, meaning it won’t clear customs and is therefore unavailable to Chinese refiners. Overall, the impact has been to reduce the amount of heavy crude available to Asian refiners, many of which operate complex plants capable of maximising diesel and jet fuel output from this type of crude. The reduction in cargoes heading to Asia from Venezuela, another heavy crude producer, has exacerbated the situation. Some refiners have been turning to lighter crudes from Russia, the United States and West Africa to replace heavy crudes, which have also become more expensive. This has increased the amount of gasoline available in Asia, contributing to a reduction in the profit margin for making the fuel predominately used by light vehicles. The gasoline glut may become worse in the coming weeks as China has issued new fuel export quotas. These will likely increase the amount of fuel being exported. There is a further interesting dynamic at play at the retail level in several countries in the Asia-Pacific region: gasoline prices haven’t dropped much at all for consumers. In India and China, gasoline prices are higher than those for diesel, while in Australia, gasoline is only slightly cheaper. While Chinese retail prices may well be described as managed according to movements in the crude price, those in India and Australia are largely set by market forces. If there is a glut of gasoline in the region, it would be logical to expect refiners to try and clear it by lowering prices in order to stimulate demand. But this hasn’t happened so far.

2018-10-29,"WASHINGTON/SINGAPORE, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced in May he would reimpose sanctions on Iran, the State Department began telling countries around the world the clock was ticking for them to cut oil purchases from the Islamic Republic to zero. The strategy is meant to cripple Iran’s oil-dependent economy and force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions, but this time, its ballistic missile program and its influence in Syria. With just days to go before renewed sanctions take effect Nov. 5, the reality is setting in: three of Iran’s top five customers – India, China, and Turkey - are resisting Washington’s call to end purchases outright, arguing there are not sufficient supplies worldwide to replace them, according to sources familiar with the matter. That pressure, along with worries of a damaging oil price spike, is putting the Trump administration’s hard line to the test and raising the possibility of bilateral deals to allow some buying to continue, according to the sources. The tension has split the administration into two camps, one led by National Security Adviser John Bolton, who wants the toughest possible approach, and another by State Department officials keen to balance sanctions against preventing an oil price spike that could damage the U.S. and its allies, according to a source briefed by administration officials on the matter. The global price of oil peaked just below $87 a barrel this month, a four-year high. Because of that concern, the source said, the administration is considering limited waivers for some Iranian customers until Russia and Saudi Arabia add additional supply next year, while limiting what Tehran can do with the proceeds in the meantime. Revenues from sales could be escrowed for use by Tehran exclusively for humanitarian purposes, the source, who asked not to be named, said – a mechanism more stringent than a similar one imposed on Iran oil purchases during the last round of sanctions under U.S. President Barack Obama. “If you’re the administration, you’d like to ensure you don’t have a spike in the price. So, you are better off from mid-2019 onwards to aggressively enforce the barrels side of reducing to zero and in the interim aggressively enforcing the revenue side,” the source said. Such concessions could be problematic for the White House as it seeks stricter terms than under Obama, who along with European allies imposed sanctions that led to an agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear weapons development. The State Department declined comment for this story, but the administration has confirmed Washington is considering waivers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters that countries will first have to reduce purchases of Iran’s oil by more than the 20 percent level they did under the previous sanctions. U.S. Treasury and State Department teams have traveled to more than two dozen countries since Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal on May 8, warning companies and countries of the dangers of doing business with Iran. U.S. allies Japan and South Korea have already ceased importing Iran’s crude. But the situation is less clear among other, bigger buyers. Brian Hook, the State Department’s special representative for Iran, and Frank Fannon, State’s top U.S. energy diplomat, most recently met with officials in India, Iran’s No. 2 buyer, in mid-October after a U.S. source said for the first time that the administration was actively considering waivers. An Indian government source said India told the U.S. delegation that rising energy costs caused by a weak rupee and high oil prices meant zeroing out Iranian purchases was impossible until at least March. “We have told this to the United States, as well as during Brian Hook’s visit,” the source said. “We cannot end oil imports from Iran at a time when alternatives are costly.” A U.S. diplomat confirmed the discussions, saying limited waivers for India and other countries was possible. India typically imports over 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil, but has reduced that level in recent months, according to official data. Discussions are also underway with Turkey, Iran’s fourth biggest crude buyer, even though Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Turkish ministers have openly criticized the sanctions. An industry source in Turkey familiar with the talks told Reuters the country had cut Iranian imports in half already, and could get to zero, but would prefer to continue some purchases. Obama’s administration granted a six-month waiver to Turkey, but the source said Turkey expected the Trump administration to impose tougher requirements for obtaining waivers that could potentially cover shorter periods. “It could be for three months, or they may not get a waiver at all. It is all a bit unpredictable this time, as we understand a lot of things are up to Trump,” the source said. The situation is least clear in China, Iran’s biggest customer, whose state-owned buyers are also seeking waivers. The country took in between 500,000 and 800,000 bpd from Iran in the past several months, a typical range. Beijing’s signals to its refiners have been mixed, said the two sources. Last week, Reuters reported Sinopec Group and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the country’s top state-owned refiners, have not placed orders for Iranian oil for November because of concerns about the sanctions. Joe McMonigle, energy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington, said he expected the administration would have to accept some level of Iranian oil buying from China, given its consumption. “Of all the countries, I don’t think they think China is going to zero,” he said. U.S. State Department’s Fannon is scheduled to travel to Asia in coming days, with a speech in Singapore planned for Oct. 30; an official did not say if Fannon would use the trip to discuss Iran with China.

2018-10-29,"MELBOURNE, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Australian-listed LNG Ltd said on Monday it is delaying a final decision on whether to build its Magnolia LNG plant to next year as it has run into problems lining up customers in China, knocking its shares down 28 percent. LNG Ltd had planned to make a final investment decision by the end of 2018 on Magnolia, which would be designed to produce 8 million tonnes of year liquefied natural gas (LNG). “We made that statement prior to the trade tensions that have manifested over the past months, which have caused headwinds for LNG transactions,” LNG CEO Greg Vesey said in a quarterly report. The company is now targeting final approval for the Magnolia LNG project in Louisiana in “the first part of 2019”, depending on how talks to line up contracts go, he said. “While trade issues with the Chinese market impact our discussions, our negotiations with customers in other parts of the world remain strong.” The company is developing two plants — Magnolia, from where it hoped to begin exports in 2022, and another in Nova Scotia in Canada. Vesey told Reuters in May: “For us, it’s strictly been about marketing to China.” That was before Beijing imposed a 10 percent tariff on U.S. LNG in an escalating trade dispute with Washington. There are varying views on how and when the trade issues with China will be resolved, Vesey said on Monday. “Considering that, our communications with potential Chinese offtakers remain robust with the intent to complete agreements if trade tensions abate before Magnolia is fully sold out,” he said. The United States is on track to export over 1,000 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas as LNG in 2018. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. But China, which purchased about 15 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped in 2017, is now on track to buy less than 100 bcf of U.S. LNG in 2018, less than last year, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking and U.S. Department of Energy data. Shares in LNG Ltd fell as much as 28 percent to a one-year low of A$0.39.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last up 0.3 percent after rising just over 0.5 percent earlier in the day. The losses in Asia were largely led by China’s blue-chip index which tumbled 2.5 percent following disappointing earnings from the country’s top liquor maker Kweichow Moutai. Chinese data over the weekend also underscored worries of a cooling economy as profit growth at its industrial firms slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September as sales of raw materials and manufactured goods ebbed. Citibank has projected China’s real economic growth to slow to 6.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter “amid trade headwinds and domestic uncertainties,” compared to a 6.8 percent rise at the start of the year. “As lagging indicators, overall industrial revenue and profit should continue to soften accordingly,” it said.

Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.1 percent, having climbed 1 percent earlier while South Korea’s KOSPI eased 0.4 percent. Shanghai’s SSE Composite faltered 1.5 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 and Dow minis declined about 0.1 percent each, after rising as much as 0.4 percent earlier in the day. Australian shares, up 1.2 percent, were a rare bright spot.

2018-10-29,"LONDON, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Big brands - from Coke to Kellogg - pledged on Monday to cut all plastic waste from their operations in what the United Nations called the most ambitious effort yet to fight plastic pollution. The intiative comes as public pressure mounts on manufacturers and retailers to pare back the deluge of plastic packaging that is clogging landfills and choking the seas. “We know that cleaning up plastics from our beaches and oceans is vital, but this does not stop the tide of plastic entering the oceans each year. We need to move upstream to the source of the flow,” said Ellen MacArthur, the record-breaking British sailor who is behind the plastic initiative. The pledge by 250 organisations included many of the world’s biggest packaging producers, leading consumer brands, retailers and recyclers, as well as governments and NGOs. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation launched its New Plastics Economy Global Commitment in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Signatories promised to eliminate single-use and unnecessary plastic and to innovate so that all packaging could be recycled, with targets to be reviewed regularly and updates posted on their progress to drive momentum, the Foundation said. UNEP has estimated that if current pollution rates continue, there will be more plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, as 8 million tonnes of bottles and waste swamp the oceans each year, killing marine life and entering the food chain. “Most efforts ‘til now have been focused on cleaning up plastic pollution. This commitment is about eliminating pollution at its source,” Rob Opsomer, who leads the foundation’s New Plastics Economy initiative, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Erik Solheim, executive director of UNEP, described the commitment as “the most ambitious set of targets we have seen yet in the fight to beat plastics pollution.” Last week, the European Parliament voted for a complete ban on single-use plastic items, including straws and cutlery, in a bid to curb pollution. Three of the brands that signed up, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestle, were recently named the world’s worst plastic polluters, according to an index by the Break Free From Plastic movement. In North America, these three brands accounted for 64 percent of all plastic pollution identified in cleanups, according to the analysis. “We are focused on improving the sustainability of all of our packaging, regardless of the type, and increasing the amount of recycled and renewable material,” Ben Jordan, senior director of environmental policy at Coca-Cola, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. PepsiCo said it had made a number of pledges in a bid to “build a PepsiCo where plastics need never become waste”. ""Protecting our planet is hugely important to us. We are committed to achieving 100 percent recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging by 2025,"" PepsiCo spokesman Gian-Carlo Peressutti told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

2018-10-29,"PIDARWAH, India, Oct 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - S iyaram Saket refuses to give up his one-and-a-half acres of farmland in central India - no matter how much the coal mining company offers him. Whatever the amount, said the 55-year-old, it will not be enough to replace the value of the fertile land feeding his family of six in Pidarwah village, Singrauli district. He knows of people in nearby villages who moved on the promise by the government and power companies of money, jobs or homes in exchange for their land a decade ago. Now homeless, they are still waiting for compensation, he said. “We can see what happened to those villagers. They’ve become beggars,” Saket explained. “We’re not going to let that happen with us.” As energy-hungry India seeks to fuel its continued economic growth, millions of people are being robbed of their homes by companies building power plants on their land or mining the coal below it, activists and villagers say. India’s energy output has tripled in the last 15 years - according to CARE Ratings, a credit rating agency - making it the world’s third-largest electricity market. In Singrauli district alone, more than 1.3 million people have been displaced as the result of government deals with power companies since the 1960s, says Climate Agenda, a local nonprofit. The government and the power companies often renege on the terms of their land acquisitions, said Priya Pillai, a senior researcher at Asar Social Impact Advisors, a sustainable energy consultancy, who has worked for several years in Singrauli. “The biggest problems in the area are displacement, a lack of livelihood and environmental degradation,” Pillai told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Mines (have) destroyed entire lives and whatever was promised in return never happened.” The government led the first wave of displacements in the mid-1950s to build the 300-megawatt Rihand Dam, said Ravi Shekhar, a campaigner with Climate Agenda. Lured by the steady electricity supply, private and state-owned companies soon followed, he said. Some families have been moved as many as four times to accommodate energy projects, he added. More than a decade after the government allocated land to Indian power company Essar Power across four villages in Mahan, a forest area in Singrauli district, locals say they are still waiting for their dues. Sitapati Singh, a resident of Khairahi village, said she was told by government and Essar representatives that she was a minor when the deal went through, making her ineligible for any compensation. She insists she was over 18 at the time. Such disputes are common. According to Land Conflict Watch - a New Delhi-based research initiative - as of October, about 7.2 million people have been affected in more than 600 ongoing land disputes across India, involving investments worth $179 billion. “One of the biggest (issues) with land and environment is that none of the procedures that are meant to be followed are followed ... That leads to conflict,” said Kanchi Kohli, a researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, a think tank. “The transition is inhuman. You dislocate someone from a place and take completely no responsibility for it,” she said. An Essar spokesman said by email that the state government and the district administration had identified and acquired the land for its power plant and the company paid for compensation under the guidance of the administration. “All the eligible villagers have been duly compensated,” he said. India’s power ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the rehabilitation procedure for residents affected by power projects. Saket, the farmer in Pidarwah, pointed to villagers’ complaints about Essar’s land deal to explain why he and his neighbours will not sell their land to state-owned power company THDC India Ltd. According to residents, in November last year villagers attended a meeting called by the government to discuss the proposal. As per protocol, everyone present had to sign or put their thumbprint on a register to hear about the proposal. People who were at the meeting said that about 150 villagers attended. But when they later filed a freedom of information request to look at the register, they saw the signatures and thumbprints of 661 people. Based on that number of signatures, the company has approval from the villagers to move ahead with the purchase, said A.K. Sharma, additional general manager at THDC. Villagers said that in the days after the meeting, a village council official tricked people into adding their thumbprints to the register, telling them that he was doing a survey of how many people lived in the area. Some of the signatures were simply forged, Saket and other Pidarwah residents said. The villagers have written to government officials with their version of events - a copy of which was seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation - but have not heard back so far. Anurag Chaudhary, the administrative head of Singrauli district, said that he has not received any complaints from Pidarwah residents but was ready to “resolve any procedural issues”. “The villagers need to tell me if there is a problem ... I can order an inquiry if anyone complains to me,” he said by phone. Sharma said that government officials were currently trying to figure out the best compensation package for the residents of Pidarwah. “They don’t need to worry,” he said, referring to the villagers. “We are a government company and the government never deceives.” Param Sukh, a former farmer in Singrauli, said that is not his experience. He was about six years old when his family was first moved to another part of the district in the 1950s to make way for the Rihand Dam. They were displaced again in the 1970s for a state-owned power plant, he said, and were given a 1,500-square-foot plot in the nearby Chilkatand resettlement camp, bordered by a coal mine to the north and a power plant to the south. They have lived there ever since. “Earlier we had land, and we could grow our own food, and we were comfortable,” Sukh said. ""Today we are suffering.""

2018-10-29,"* Markets nervous after broad slump last week * Analysts expect global trade slowdown * U.S. rig count at March '15 high: tmsnrt.rs/2RlEcxJ By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices held steady on Monday, supported by an early bounce in Asian stocks, but analysts said sentiment remains cautious after a plunge across financial markets last week triggered worries that global growth may be slowing. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $77.77 a barrel at 0033 GMT, up 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $67.89 a barrel, up 30 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. Despite the gains and calmer financial markets early on Monday, sentiment among investors remained cautious after hefty losses last week. Oil faced “downward pressure from lower growth forecasts around the globe,” said Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst at futures brokerage Oanda. There were also signs of a slowdown in global trade, with rates for dry-bulk and container ships - which carry most raw materials and manufactured goods - coming under pressure. On the supply side, however, oil markets remain tense ahead of looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports, which are set to start next week and are expected to tighten supply, especially to Asia which takes most of Iran’s shipments. Some relief could come from rising output in the United States C-OUT-T-EIA, which has already increased by almost a third since mid-2016 to around 11 million barrels per day. Production is set to rise further. U.S. drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Oct. 26, bringing the total count to 875, the highest level since March 2015, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. More than half of all U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the country’s biggest shale oil formation.
