2018-08-22,"(Corrects fifth paragraph from end to show EIA forecast came on Aug. 7, not last week) * U.S. crude stocks fall 5.2 mln barrels to 405.6 mln - API * Market weighs potential oil supply cut from Iran sanctions * U.S., China trade dispute raises demand growth concerns By Jane Chung SEOUL, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, supported by a drop in U.S. crude inventories and a weaker dollar, along with concerns about a potential shortfall of Iranian oil from November due to U.S. sanctions. Brent crude oil futures were at $72.83 per barrel at 0234 GMT, up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $66.12 per barrel. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels in the week to Aug.17, to 405.6 million barrels, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for a fall of 1.5 million barrels, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. “Investors are also confident that (official) inventories in the United States will decrease this week,” ANZ Bank said in a note. Signs of slowing U.S. crude output growth and a weaker U.S. dollar also provided some support to oil prices, said Kim Kwang-rae, commodity analyst at Samsung Futures in Seoul. The U.S. dollar index against a basket of six major currencies eased on Wednesday to 95.211 after losing 0.7 percent the previous day, weighed by U.S. President Trump’s comments on monetary policy. A weaker U.S. dollar makes oil, which is priced in dollars, less expensive to buyers in other currencies. The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Aug. 7 cut its 2018 U.S. crude production growth to 10.68 million barrels per day (bpd), from 10.79 million bpd amid lower crude prices. Concerns also remain over how much oil will be removed from global markets by renewed sanctions on Iran, despite worries that demand growth could weaken amid a trade disputes between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. “The Iran issue continues to occupy traders’ minds,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and OPEC’s third-largest oil producer, said earlier this week no other OPEC member should be allowed to take over its share of oil exports. Meanwhile, a Chinese trade delegation is in Washington to discuss trade disputes with the U.S. side. But signs of a thaw were unlikely as U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview on Monday that he did not expect much progress.

2018-08-22,"TIKRIT, Iraq (Reuters) - A suicide attack on a former Iraqi lawmaker’s house killed at least six tribal militiamen and wounded seven others in a northern Sunni Muslim village early on Wednesday, police said. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but Islamic State militants operate in the area. A militant wearing a suicide vest blew himself up just after midnight at Adnan al-Ganam’s house in the village of Asdira, Colonel Khalil al-Sahn, the police chief of surrounding Shirqat district, told Reuters. Those killed were members of the Tribal Mobilisation Forces, a network of Sunni militias that back the government in its fight against Islamic State, he said. The village is north of Tikrit, the capital of Iraq’s Salahuddin province. Islamic State, which had seized control of much of northern Iraq in 2014, lost Shirqat to U.S.-backed Iraqi security forces supported by Sunni tribal fighters in 2016.  A small number of militants are still operating in the area and are capable of launching sporadic attacks, security officials say. Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December but security officials say the militants are likely to wage an insurgency after their self-proclaimed caliphate collapsed and they were dislodged from all the territory they held. Its fighters have kept up a campaign of kidnap and killing, mainly in the provinces of Kirkuk, Diyala and Salahuddin.

2018-08-22,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan up 0.1 pct * Shanghai Composite falls 0.7 pct, CSI300 down 0.6 pct * Australian shares fall on leadership turmoil By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Asian stocks inched higher on Wednesday, with sentiment boosted by Wall Street’s rise and a record intraday high for the S&P 500 index, but political headlines in the U.S. and Australia and a retreat in Chinese markets darkened the mood. Investors in the region took some comfort from hopes that the trade talks between the U.S. and China expected this week will ease trade tensions. But Chinese investors sold shares across the board, sending the Shanghai Composite index 0.7 percent lower and the blue-chip CSI300 index down 0.6 percent, as economic concerns returned after the central bank said on Tuesday it would not resort to strong stimulus to support growth. U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters on Monday that he does not expect much progress from the trade talks with China. European shares look set to take their lead from China, with financial spreadbetters expecting London’s FTSE to open 16 points lower, Frankfurt’s DAX to fall 20 points, and Paris’ CAC to lose 9 points. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index advanced 0.6 percent. Seoul’s Kospi rose 0.3 percent, buoyed by tech firms as data showed robust chip exports, and Taiwan shares were 0.1 percent higher. But S&P futures fell Wednesday as markets assessed the possible impact of a guilty plea from Trump’s former personal lawyer, and the conviction of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. “Next to these headlines, trade news fell completely under the radar,” Citi analysts said, noting “concern that something could come out linked to Trump or other of his associates” and that Cohen’s guilty plea sparked a late-session bid in U.S. treasuries. S&P E-mini futures were 0.2 percent lower at 2855.5. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.8279 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.844 percent on Tuesday. Investors are also looking to Wednesday’s release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s August meeting, and a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday for clues on future rate hikes. Trump on Monday told Reuters he was “not thrilled” with the Fed under his appointee Powell for raising rates, and said the U.S. central bank should do more to boost the economy. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5995 percent Wednesday compared with a U.S. close of 2.608 percent. Australian shares fell 0.4 percent the day after a leadership challenge to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and as a second challenge to his leadership loomed. “There’s a bit of a risk premium now being built into Australia,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management in Sydney. “If you’re a foreign investor, suddenly Australia’s looking a lot less attractive.” In New York on Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose as high as 2,873.23, topping the previous record of 2,872.87 set on Jan. 26. The index is poised to record its longest-running bull market in history on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.25 percent to 25,821.95, the S&P 500 rose 0.21 percent to 2,862.91, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.49 percent to 7,859.17. On Wednesday, the dollar edged higher against the yen , gaining 0.12 percent to 110.42. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.05 percent lower at 95.213. The currency has lagged following Trump’s comments on Monday, in which he also accused China and Europe of manipulating their currencies. The euro was up 0.08 percent on the day at $1.1578, while China’s yuan strengthened to 6.8425 per dollar at 0543 GMT, 88 pips stronger than its previous onshore close. In commodity markets, U.S. crude rose 0.5 percent to $66.15 a barrel. Brent crude was 0.4 percent higher at $72.89 per barrel.

2018-08-22,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The smog-prone Chinese province of Hebei is aiming to slash road freight in favor of rail and river transport over the next two-and-a-half years as part of efforts to improve air quality, officials said. Hebei, which surrounds the capital Beijing, is on the front line of China’s efforts to improve it’s poor air quality, and has been under pressure to restrict industrial output, cut coal consumption and curb traffic.  The province has vowed to cut concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 by a further 15 percent over 2017-2020, although they would still be at more than five times the World Health Organisation’s recommended level. In a local briefing on Tuesday, officials said Hebei will accelerate construction of new rail links in the next two years to reduce road freight, according to a transcript published on the provincial government’s website on Wednesday. “Exhaust emissions from road freight vehicles, especially medium- and heavy-duty diesel trucks, are one of the main sources of atmospheric pollution,” said Song Shuqiang, vice-head of the province’s transportation bureau. Hebei will improve port infrastructure to facilitate the change, and shift deliveries of iron ore to steel mills to rail. It aims to raise the rail delivery capacity for iron ore shipped from the major port of Caofeidian to 40 million tonnes by next year, up from about 15 million tonnes this year, Song said.  By 2020, all major deliveries of iron ore and coking coal from the ports of Huanghua and Tangshan, which includes Caofeidian, will be by rail or waterways rather than roads, he added. In the first half of the year, 57 percent of the province’s total freight was delivered by road, with just 11.7 percent by rail. Hebei came under pressure to cut pollution by 25 percent over the 2013-2017 period. It met the target with blanket curbs on industrial enterprises, coal consumers and traffic, but has since vowed to adopt a more targeted approach. The latest moves are in line with a national plan to boost rail freight levels by as much as 30 percent by 2020, with trucks blamed for producing 13 times more pollution per unit of cargo than trains.   Hebei’s major industries like steel and coking coal would also face far tougher standards in the coming two to three years, said Gao Jianmin, the head of Hebei’s environment bureau. Steel mills will have to slash dust emissions fourfold and sulfur dioxide sixfold, he said.

2018-08-22,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Imagine a country that is one the world’s largest exporters of energy, but can’t agree on a domestic policy to end electricity blackouts. Imagine a country on the verge of losing a fourth prime minister within a decade to internal party squabbles, mainly over energy policy. Imagine a country that is likely to start importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), even though it is about to become the world’s largest exporter of the super-chilled fuel. The problem for Australia is that this isn’t something being imagined, it’s the reality of a country that can’t find political and social consensus on climate politics and the role of its vast reserves of coal, natural gas and even uranium. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull narrowly survived a vote this week for the leadership of his Liberal Party, held by the party’s parliamentarians amid in-fighting over his signature energy policy, known as the National Energy Guarantee (NEG). Turnbull, whose Liberals and junior coalition partner National Party hold a narrow majority in the country’s lower house of parliament, had hoped to use the NEG as the platform to end policy uncertainty over power generation, and ensure that Australia met its obligations under the Paris accord on climate change. The problem for Turnbull is that a significant number of his party-room are either climate change deniers or sceptics, or strong promoters of the coal industry. This group already forced Turnbull to scrap the part of NEG which would have legislated emissions reduction targets, effectively neutering a large part of the proposed policy. While Turnbull survived the party-room vote, most political pundits believe it’s now only a matter of time before his rival, Peter Dutton, gathers enough support to topple him and claim the prime ministership. Dutton, who quit as home affairs minister after losing the internal vote, was once caught unaware on tape joking about climate change swamping Australia’s Pacific island neighbours through rising seas. Turnbull appears set to follow in the footsteps of former Labor Party prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and his Liberal predecessor Tony Abbott in being knifed by their own parties. Rudd, who won a landslide victory in 2007, was dumped in 2009 by Gillard, with part of the reason being his decision to abandon a planned emissions cap and trade system. Gillard was then toppled by Rudd in 2013, partly because of public anger at rising electricity prices, which then Liberal leader Abbott managed to link to the price on carbon her government introduced. Abbott won a general election over the resurrected Rudd in 2013, before losing the prime ministership to Turnbull in 2015, mainly because of his rising unpopularity following a harsh budget that was viewed as unfairly targeting those less well off. While Abbott may not have been axed because of his energy policy, there is little doubt that his plan to reduce emissions by paying polluters not to pollute as much was largely an expensive farce. The upshot is that Australia’s energy policy has been a mess for the last 10 years, at a time when retail electricity prices have more than doubled and the country has experienced widescale blackouts in the wake of the closure of several old coal-fired power plants. With the NEG all but dead and buried, it seems that a comprehensive energy policy will not be delivered any time soon. Under Australia’s federal system, this means the six state and two territory governments will largely be responsible for their own energy policies. However, there are a few things that are probably clear for the future of energy policy. The first is that its highly unlikely a new coal-fired power plants will ever be built in Australia, despite the country being the world’s largest exporter of the polluting fuel, and its role in providing more than 60 percent of current power generation. No major utility has any interest in investing billions of dollars into a coal plant, especially given policy uncertainty and the certainty of wide-scale public opposition and protests to such a move. This leaves state governments as the only players likely to build coal-fired generators, and while it is possible they may seek to extend the life of some existing plants, they too would be wary of investing in a fuel that takes the blame for much of the current concern over climate change. Natural gas also presents problems, given the difficulty in getting the fuel from where it is produced (mainly northern and central Australia) to where it is needed (mainly the heavily-populated southeast). The last of eight mega-LNG projects is due to start this year, which will make Australia the world’s largest exporter of the fuel. However, the rapid scaling up of LNG exporters has also meant that domestic gas prices have risen to reflect international LNG prices, and local consumers are struggling to secure long-term supplies under contracts. This has raised the possibility of LNG imports to cities like Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest and home to much of the country’s manufacturing base. What initially seemed like a band-aid fix may end up being a structural feature of the LNG market, in which Australia ships LNG to Asia but buys from other countries to meet its domestic needs. The other thing that appears virtually certain is that the main investment in electricity generation in Australia is going to be in the form of renewables, both large-scale and small, rooftop systems. Solar and wind farms, with battery backups, are already in existence in South Australia state and several more are planned. Pumped hydropower using off-peak wind and solar to pump water from a lower reservoir back to a higher one to be used to generate power in periods of higher demand is also likely, with extensions to existing projects in Tasmania state and the Snowy Mountains that straddle Victoria and New South Wales states. The seemingly ever-rising retail power bills are also driving consumers to rooftop solar with battery storage, which could result in lower demand from the grid but also could serve as a back-up for the grid assuming consumers are encouraged to make their excess power and battery storage available. The ultimate irony is that Australia is on the verge of losing a fourth prime minister in a decade, partly because of his attempts to deliver an energy policy that reduced the role of coal. The coal proponents circling Turnbull like sharks don’t seem to realise or care that their preferred fuel is likely to be replaced over time, not only by cheaper alternatives but also by a community that can see first-hand the devastating effects of climate change, as witnessed by the drought currently gripping much of Australia.

Brent crude oil futures were at $72.80 per barrel at 0109 GMT, up 18 cents, or 0.25 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 26 cents, or 0.39 percent, at $66.10 per barrel. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels in the week to Aug.17, to 405.6 million barrels, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for a fall of 1.5 million barrels, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. “Investors are also confident that (official) inventories in the United States will decrease this week,” ANZ Bank said in a note.

2018-08-22,"(Repeats AUG 21 story. No change to text.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2nRQtxk By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Rising fuel costs have dampened gasoline demand from private motorists in the United States, leaving the market relying on continued economic and freight expansion to boost oil use. U.S. traffic volumes were up by just 0.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months from April to June compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Traffic growth has slowed from an annual rate of between 2 percent and 3 percent through most of 2015 and 2016, when gasoline prices were low and falling (“Traffic Volume Trends,” FHA, August 2018). Traffic growth has been correlated with changes in gasoline prices for the past quarter century and recent fuel price increases have resulted in a predictable slowdown (tmsnrt.rs/2nRQtxk). Retail gasoline prices are up by more than 55 percent from their cyclical low in February 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Traffic volumes have levelled out despite continued strong growth in economic output, incomes and employment, indicating that motoring demand has been hit by rising fuel prices. Slower traffic growth has been mirrored in flattening gasoline consumption, with sales to domestic customers at or slightly below prior-year levels for most months so far this year. Between March and May, the most recent three-month period for which data are available, gasoline supplied to the domestic market was marginally down from the same period in 2017. The Energy Information Administration is now forecasting gasoline consumption will be essentially unchanged in 2018, down from predicted growth of around 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the start of the year (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, August 2018). If the prediction proves accurate, it will be the second year of little or no growth, after gasoline use surged by 140,000 bpd in 2016 and 257,000 bpd in 2015, corresponding with the slump in oil prices. Lack of growth in gasoline contrasts with distillate fuel oil, where consumption between March and May was up by almost 75,000 bpd compared with 2017, spurred by rising industrial output and strong growth in freight. U.S. freight volumes were up by more than 8 percent year-on-year in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (“Transportation Services Index”, BTS, August 2018). Manufacturing output was up by 2.8 percent in the year to July while mining output, which includes oil and gas drilling, rose by 12.9 percent (“Industrial production and capacity utilization”, Federal Reserve, August 2018). Distillate fuel oil and jet fuel accounted for essentially all the growth in fuel consumption in the United States in the March-May period. EIA forecasts distillate consumption will increase by 170,000 bpd in 2018, while jet fuel will be up by another 30,000 bpd. Freight growth within the United States remains robust, but in the rest of the world has showed signs of slowing since the start of the year. Flat-lining domestic gasoline consumption coupled with softness in international distillate growth helps explain why benchmark oil prices have pulled back from highs set in May. Prices are falling to buy back some demand growth, or at least prevent any more being lost.

2018-08-22,"SHANGHAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were flat in early trade on Wednesday after Wall Street ended higher, with the S&P 500 index touching a record high on Tuesday, and as lower-level trade talks between the U.S. and China due this week boost hopes of easing trade tensions. But concerns over the broader impact of the legal problems of two close associates of U.S. President Donald Trump pulled S&P futures lower, weighing on investor sentiment. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index lost 0.2 percent. Australian shares fell 0.5 percent after a leadership challenge to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Tuesday. “With leadership changes and disunity amongst the major parties having marked Australian politics for a decade now, the disruption is likely to be met negatively by business,” ANZ analysts said in a note. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose as high as 2,873.23, topping the previous record of 2,872.87 set on Jan. 26, and is poised to become the longest-running bull market in the index’s history on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.25 percent to 25,821.95, the S&P 500 rose 0.21 percent to 2,862.91, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.49 percent to 7,859.17. But S&P 500 E-mini futures were 0.5 percent lower on Wednesday at 2847.75, after a guilty plea from U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, and the conviction of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. “Next to these headlines, trade news fell completely under the radar,” Citi analysts said, noting “concern that something could come out linked to Trump or other of his associates” and that Cohen’s guilty plea sparked a late-session bid in U.S. treasuries. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.8225 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.844 percent on Tuesday. The dollar weakened, as comments from U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday in an interview with Reuters continued to weigh. Trump said he was “not thrilled” with the Fed under his appointee Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates, and said the U.S. central bank should do more to boost the economy. He also accused China and Europe of manipulating their currencies. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.1 percent at 95.184. The dollar dropped 0.2 percent against the yen to 110.11 , edging closer to the key 110 level. The euro was up 0.05 percent on the day at $1.1577. In commodity markets, U.S. crude ticked up 0.3 percent to $66.05 a barrel. Brent crude was 0.2 percent higher at $72.76 per barrel.

2018-08-22,"(Adds Pemex challenge to the fine) MEXICO CITY, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Mexico’s competition authority said on Tuesday that it has fined a unit of state-owned oil company Pemex for presenting an annual compliance report on antimonopoly measures in the recently opened fuel market a year after it was due. The Federal Commission for Economic Competition, or COFECE, fined Pemex’s Industrial Transformation unit, responsible for a range of refining and logistical activities, 418.31 million pesos ($22.1 million) for the late report. COFECE said the report, one of the measures the Pemex unit committed to in 2016 to end an investigation into monopolistic practices in the sale and distribution of diesel and other fuels was presented a year late. “By delaying the presentation of the aforementioned audit, Pemex’s TRI (Industrial Transformation unit) disregarded a necessary and fundamental element for COFECE to verify compliance with the obligations acquired,” the authority said in a statement. Pemex will challenge the decision, contending that it has complied with all reporting requirements, and describing the fine as “illegal and disproportional,” the company said in a statement later on Tuesday. Last year, COFECE fined Pemex’s Industrial Transformation unit nearly 369 million pesos for the “possible commission of a monopolistic practice... in the diesel market.” At the time, Pemex said it would challenge the fine. $1 = 18.8900 Mexican pesos

2018-08-22,"(Repeats story published earlier with no changes to text) * Smaller renewable firms starved of growth capital * Face stiff competition from well-funded, bigger firms * Mid-size firms with debt finding it hard to refinance By Promit Mukherjee MUMBAI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Small to mid-sized renewable energy companies in India are starting to look like attractive takeover targets as lenders and investors withhold funds, worried by the stiff competition, weak bond markets, low tariffs and high debt besetting the sector. The small companies’ difficulty in raising cash is keeping them away from government power project auctions, restricting their growth and crippling their ability to refinance loans, said a consultant from a top global consultancy firm. With many smaller operators being gobbled up or offering themselves for sale, the number of projects being developed could fall, potentially keeping India from its renewable energy targets, said the consultant, who did not wish to be named as he is directly involved with a company that cancelled a bond issue. “India’s solar industry is becoming a big boys’ club,” said Rahul Goswami, managing director of Greenstone Energy Advisors. In a few years, there may be only a few big companies and a few regional firms active in India’s renewable sector, he said. The trend goes back at least to 2016, when Tata Power bought solar and wind company Welspun Renewable Energy, but the pace is expected to pick up. “Smaller players are being squeezed out ... due to two main factors: cost of equipment and ... financing”, said Alok Verma, executive director at Kotak Investment Banking, an arm of Kotak Mahindra Bank. One of India’s largest renewables companies, Greenko Group, said in June that it was buying 750 megawatts (MWs) of solar and wind assets from Orange Renewables, because the Singapore-based company saw few opportunities for growth. The deal has yet to be closed. Essel Infra, with a renewable power capacity of 685 MWs, and Shapoorji Pallonji Group’s 400-MW solar arm are also in talks to sell off their assets, one firm and two banks doing the due diligence for these companies have said. Besides loans, other funding options have also been dead ends for the smaller companies, further limiting growth opportunities. ACME Solar postponed an initial public offering (IPO) announced in September last year as the proposed share issue did not generate enough interest from investors, confirmed a banker who was directly involved in the listing attempt. Mytrah Energy, a major mid-sized renewables company, called off a $300 million to $500 million bond issue earlier this year as that option also went dry for the sector, and it canned IPO plans as well, said a separate banker directly involved there. The companies have all declined to comment. This dearth of financing and trend towards consolidation could be a significant threat to India’s target of 175 gigawatts (GWs) of renewables capacity by 2022, up from 71 GWs now, some analysts said. Others said a concentration of bigger players, with more cash and better financing, could mean things move faster. “Consolidation in the renewable energy industry augurs well for the overall success of the programme ... Large players have access to required capital at reasonable rates and can procure the latest technology,” said Debasish Mishra, head of Energy, Resources and Industrials at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India. Tata Power, one of India’s largest power generators, said in May it plans to invest $5 billion to increase its renewable capacity in India fourfold over the next decade to 12 GWs. More than doubling India’s renewables capacity by 2022 will require $76 billion, including debt of $53 billion, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said in July. Another problem in India’s renewable sector is debt. “Many mid-sized firms have taken debt to fund their equity,” the partner of an investment firm said, adding that many such companies will need financial restructuring or have to put themselves up for auction. This model of financing debt through equity is called mezzanine financing and tends to involve high interest rates and an option to convert debt to equity in future. Both ACME and Mytrah are funded by Piramal Finance Ltd via mezzanine financing, according to statements by the companies at the time of funding. For lending banks, this quasi-equity is seen as debt, making the liabilities of these companies look higher than usual, said the partner, who asked not to be named. The investment firm handles all kinds of financing, including mezzanine. When companies with mezzanine financing go to banks for funds for upcoming projects, banks ask them for higher collateral or offer less cash in loan, said Kotak’s Verma. Fitch Solutions said in a note last week that India would likely miss its renewable capacity targets due to “risks stemming from bureaucratic, financing and logistical delays.” Reporting by Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Henning Gloystein

2018-08-22,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Castigated by U.S. President Donald Trump as relying too much on Russian gas supplies, German Chancellor Angela Merkel heads to Azerbaijan this week to discuss the development of a southern pipeline to deliver gas to Europe from the Caspian. The visit underscores Merkel’s openness to finding alternative sources of affordable gas even as she remains committed to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry gas directly from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany. “We have a big interest in further developing the Southern Corridor,” a senior German government official said. “This is part of the EU’s diversification strategy of getting gas from other regions, not just Russia, to Europe.” In Baku, Merkel will discuss energy issues, including improving the infrastructure to help transport gas from Azerbaijan to Europe via Turkey, officials said.  Azerbaijan looks set to play a crucial role as it plans to launch the second stage of a gas pipeline from the vast Shah Deniz field to Europe. Shah Deniz II is expected to produce 16 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year from 2020, with 10 bcm earmarked for Europe and 6 bcm for Turkey and Georgia. Later, gas could be brought from Turkmenistan, Iran and Iraq to Europe. In a sign of progress, Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan agreed in principle this month on how to divide the potentially huge oil and gas resources of the Caspian Sea. However, the southern pipeline is dwarfed by Nord Stream 2, a Gazprom initiative that will double Russia’s export capacity to Europe to 110 bcm. That pipeline is welcomed by much of German industry, which wants as much cheap gas as possible. Last month Trump, who is pressing Germany to buy more U.S.  liquefied natural gas, lambasted Germany as being “a captive” of Russia due to its dependence on Russian energy, a charge Germany denies. Trump has called Nord Stream 2 “horrific”. Germany imported 39 percent of its gas from Russia in the first half of 2018, figures from state foreign trade authority BAFA showed. Merkel discussed energy in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a palace outside Berlin at the weekend. She is trying to assuage some Nord Stream 2 critics by ensuring Ukraine does not suffer from lower gas transit revenues. Merkel also travels to Georgia and Armenia on her three-day trip, which starts on Thursday. She will hold talks with Azeri President Ilham Aliyev on Saturday.

2018-08-22,"KUBINKA, Russia (Reuters) - Russian government ministries have agreed a proposed windfall tax on metals, mining and chemical companies is “inappropriate” for now, Industry Minister Denis Manturov said on Wednesday. “With colleagues from other ministries, we reached a common position that as of today it’s inappropriate,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a military forum outside Moscow, adding that  companies’ debts had to be taken into considerations.  Earlier in August, Kremlin aide Andrei Belousov proposed to President Vladimir Putin to raise 500 billion roubles ($7.5 billion) a year from metal and mining companies. The proposal listed Evraz, NLMK, Nornickel, Severstal, MMK, Mechel, Alrosa, Polyus, Phosagro and Acron as among the targeted companies. The shares of these companies were mixed on Wednesday. Mechel stock was up 5.3 percent on the Moscow exchange after it reported second quarter results. Russia needs extra budget revenue to meet the economic goals set out by Putin after he began a new six-year term in May.

Investors digested the conviction of Trump’s former campaign chairman on eight counts of financial wrongdoing and a guilty plea by his former personal lawyer in separate cases . U.S. stock futures initially fell on the news but had recouped some losses by 1035 GMT, trading flat to down 0.1 percent. While the immediate market reaction was not dramatic, the developments present further uncertainty over Trump’s leadership for investors to navigate. U.S. bond yields dropped as investors sought safety in Treasuries, and a dip in S&P 500 futures spread to European shares, which opened lower. U.S. 10-year yields were trading at 2.82315 percent, compared with Tuesday’s close of 2.844 percent. “Trump has weathered quite a few allegations before this, where many people were quick with the `I’ word (impeachment), so we need to see whether this could open a new chapter or if it will calm down again and markets move on,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger. MSCI’s all-country world stock index was unmoved by the uncertainty, rising 0.3 percent after the S&P 500 hit a record intraday high of 2,873.23 points, topping the 2,872.87 set on Jan. 26. The index was poised for the longest-running bull market in its history. Its relentless rise highlights the divergence in fortunes between U.S. stocks - turbo-charged by tax cuts and share buybacks - and the rest of the world. Year-on-year earnings growth in the U.S. is expected to be around 24 percent this year while Europe is forecast to deliver around 9 percent. European shares inched up 0.2 percent by 1100 GMT. They had opened lower as the market awaited U.S.-China trade talks, set to resume under the cloud of Trump’s prediction that they would make no real progress. “The key point is these are mid-level officials,” said Donough Kilmurray, managing director and head of the Investment Strategy Group for EMEA at Goldman Sachs. “It’s good they are talking, but at that level of engagement we doubt anything significant will come out of it.” The U.S. dollar gave up early gains, set for its sixth straight day of selling after Trump’s criticism of the Federal Reserve’s rate rises in a Reuters interview. The dollar index fell 0.1 percent to 95.172 by 1030 GMT. Emerging-market stocks climbed 0.4 percent, leaving 13-month lows further behind as the dollar’s losses helped ease pressure on EM assets, which entered bear territory last week. “If you look at the transmission from economic growth to earnings growth to shareholder returns, it’s strongest in the U.S., it’s ok in Europe and pretty weak in EM,” said Goldman’s Kilmurray, who has been underweight emerging markets for five years. “The question we’re getting asked now by investors is whether what we see in EM is a sign that something bigger is going wrong in the global economy. Our answer to that is no, these issues have been local issues,” he said. A new threat of further sanctions on Russia from U.S. lawmakers hit the rouble and backed the market’s view that Russian sanctions would increase in severity regardless of the Trump administration . Chinese investors sold shares across the board, sending the Shanghai Composite index down 0.5 percent after the country’s central bank said it would not resort to strong stimulus to support growth. German 10-year Bunds bucked the trend set by Treasuries, with yields hitting their highest since Aug 10, tightening the gap with the U.S. as the euro zone economy showed signs of improvement. Investors were also looking to Wednesday’s release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s August meeting and a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday for clues on future rate hikes. “This could present the opportunity for the Fed to discuss longer-term issues, potentially including discussion around the balance sheet and the implementation of monetary policy,” said Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank.

2018-08-22,"Aug 22 (Reuters) - Canada’s gas-rich province of Alberta is looking to recreate the building boom spreading along the U.S. Gulf Coast, where inexpensive natural gas generated billions of dollars in investment by petrochemical companies. The adoption by drillers of fracking technology to unlock oil and gas from shale rock expanded U.S. production dramatically starting a decade ago. That abundance has generated $194 billion since 2010 in announced capital investment to build or expand U.S. chemical plants that use gas to make plastics, fertilizer and fuel, according to the American Chemistry Council. Alberta hopes to do the same thing, turning prices that are about one-third those at the U.S. Gulf Coast into a competitive advantage to attract petrochemical companies. Such investment would provide a badly needed market for oil and gas within the landlocked province, where energy companies struggle to reach buyers farther away. Alberta in 2016 launched incentives to diversify its oil-based economy. Two projects, including Inter Pipeline Ltd’s planned C$3.5 billion ($2.7 billion) petrochemical plant near Edmonton, have been approved to share C$500 million in royalty credits. Alberta solicited bids for a second subsidy round in June. “They’re getting all kinds of expressions of interests,” David Podruzny, vice-president of business and economics at the Chemical Industry Association of Canada, said in an interview. As attractive as cheap gas is, skeptics say Alberta’s incentives fall short of those in the U.S. Gulf, and the province also has the disadvantages of higher costs and inadequate infrastructure. But companies are chasing opportunities even without government help. CF Industries Holdings Inc is boosting ammonia fertilizer production by 150,000 short tons annually at its Medicine Hat, Alberta, plant starting later this year. The lower cost allows it to ship farther than usual, to farmers in the corn-growing U.S. state of Iowa. “At times it’s free,” said Bert Frost, CF’s senior vice-president of sales, of Alberta’s gas. “We have the lowest-cost gas in the world today.” Fertilizer producer Nutrien Ltd has begun analyzing a potential expansion in Alberta, Chief Executive Chuck Magro said. He expects the abundance of cheap gas to persist, even if the $40 billion LNG Canada terminal for liquified natural gas is built in coming years, creating a new export outlet. “Our analysis is you would need to build several (LNG terminals) before we would see much higher gas prices,” he said in an interview this month. “I’m quite bearish for natural gas in Western Canada for the foreseeable future.” Methanex Corp, which makes a liquid chemical called methanol, is considering a second plant in Medicine Hat, said Paul Daoust, vice-president for North America. Canada is the world’s fifth-largest gas producer, but much of the gas it used to sell into the Northeastern United States has been displaced by expanding U.S. supplies. An incentive program spanning up to a decade and competitive with what is available along the U.S. Gulf Coast is necessary to offset Alberta’s higher capital costs, said Lori Kent, executive director of Resource Diversification Council. Insufficient pipeline infrastructure is also holding the province back, said John Rogers, senior vice-president at credit ratings agency Moody’s. Low prices have been a hardship for gas producers, and prolonged weakness could force them to reduce supplies. Crew Energy Inc has already shut in dry gas wells this year, said Chief Executive Dale Shwed. “If companies are not going to make money producing gas and selling it, they’re not going to drill for it,” Shwed said.

2018-08-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Some Chinese coal traders handling U.S. imports have begun sourcing future supplies domestically, people with knowledge of the matter said, as they await delivery of the last U.S. cargoes to arrive before hefty tariffs kick in on Thursday in a deepening trade row between the world’s top two economies.  At least six cargoes of U.S. coal were due to arrive this month, Thomson Reuters Eikon shipping data showed, but at least three were still en route or waiting off ports to unload cargo on Wednesday.  From Thursday, the United States will impose new tariffs on $16 billion(12.55 billion pounds) of goods and in retaliation, Beijing has pledged additional tariffs on a similar amount of U.S. imports including metals, fuel - and coal. Shanghai Runhei International, a major domestic coal trading house, cleared its last U.S. metallurgical coal cargo at Qinhuangdao port earlier this week, a senior manager with the trading house said. He declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. “We have completely stopped U.S. metallurgical coal (imports), which is popular among steel mills, in late July. There is too much uncertainty in trade,” he said. The cargos due for August arrival were mainly booked in May after Beijing first threatened to hit coal with heavy tariffs and Chinese buyers were able to scoop up volumes at bargain prices, according to the manager.  Shanghai Runhei said it will increase purchases of domestic coking coal instead of foreign supplies to meet demand from clients - a policy that is set to gain traction. “Unless U.S. coal producers give us a big bargain, Chinese buyers will not import U.S. coal,” said Huang Zhiqi, a coal trading consultant at Falcon Information. China’s appetite for U.S. coal grew this year as traders looked for alternative supplies after Australian coal prices hit six-year highs in July. “Traders have anticipated yuan depreciation and shored up imports in advance, including cargoes from the United States,” Wang Fei, coal analyst at Huaan Futures said. “Traders can easily shift their supplies to either domestic coal or Australian and Indonesian coal since U.S. imports only count for a tiny share.”  Some Chinese buyers were also hoping to use the trade war as a bargaining chip to get even cheaper U.S. supplies. State-owned utility Guangdong Yudean Group asked U.S. coal miners to give a discount on prices after the trade dispute escalated, but was denied, a source with direct knowledge of the conversation said. The person declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to media. Guangdong Yudean Group was not available for comment.  China’s domestic metallurgical coal market remained tight in August amid a continuing environmental crackdown in the major producing region Shanxi province.

2018-08-22,"(Reuters) - Four of Japan’s biggest nuclear operators and plant builders have started talks on a potential partnership in atomic energy, as the sector struggles to reboot in the wake of the Fukushima disaster seven years ago, a source said on Wednesday. Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc (Tepco) (9501.T), Hitachi Ltd (6501.T), Toshiba (6502.T) and Chubu Electric Power Co Inc (9502.T) have signed an initial agreement that will be fleshed out in discussions, the source told Reuters. He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media. The Nikkei newspaper earlier reported the companies had begun talks on an alliance that would initially focus on decommissioning old reactors.  That could be extended to building and maintaining nuclear plants, with the moves likely to spur a broad realignment in Japan’s nuclear industry, the Nikkei reported. “It makes sense in the domestic arena to cooperate. Four balance sheets is better than one when it comes to nuclear risks,” said Tom O’Sullivan, the founder of energy consultancy Mathyos Japan. When contacted by Reuters, all four companies said they had regular discussions with each other as well as with other nuclear operators and builders. Hitachi denied the details included in the Nikkei report on plans for decommissioning and the building of new reactors. Japan’s nuclear sector provided about 30 percent of the country’s electricity supply before a tsunami and earthquake caused reactor fuel meltdowns at Tepco’s Fukushima Daiichi station in March 2011.  The disaster highlighted regulator and industry failings and turned swathes of the public against nuclear power, with all reactors needing to be relicensed by a new regulator to meet tougher safety standards.  While nine reactors have been restarted, utilities have had to spend billions of dollars on upgrades and alternative fuel supplies to produce electricity in the world’s third-biggest economy. That has led to calls for the government to take over nuclear operations and reorganize an industry that has 10 atomic power operators.   Japan’s powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) supports the partnership plans, the Nikkei report said, quoting an unidentified official saying: “it is now impossible for a private company to be in the business by itself.” An official at METI declined to comment on talks between private companies and denied it was leading the moves, when contacted by Reuters, declining to be identified. The shakeup in Japan’s energy industry sparked by Fukushima has already led to Tepco and Chubu to merging their fossil fuel power businesses under a venture called JERA that is due to complete the takeover of their coal, gas and oil generation assets in April next year.  Tepco and Chubu, two of Japan’s biggest three utilities, have yet to restart any nuclear units and are meeting strong resistance from local populations to any restarts.  The utilities both use the same basic boiling water reactor technology supplied by Toshiba and Hitachi, which built all their nuclear units.  Japan had 54 operational reactors before the disaster, but utilities have announced plans to decommission nine units in the aftermath, in addition to the six reactors at Fukushima, where a decades long clean-up is in progress.   Hitachi shares closed 1.3 percent higher, while Chubu shares dropped 0.8 percent and Tepco gained 0.2 percent. Toshiba was unchanged, with the Nikkei 225 climbing 0.6 percent.

2018-08-22,"KUWAIT (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil exporting producers are expected to agree on a mechanism to monitor their crude production before the end of the year, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Bakhit al-Rashidi said on Wednesday. A committee set up by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied non-OPEC exporters would review their crude output at a meeting in Algeria next month, he told reporters while touring an electricity station. “The production numbers of OPEC and (countries) outside OPEC will be reviewed at the meeting in Algeria, and before the end of the current year, there will be an agreement on a mechanism to monitor output next year,” he said. Oil markets should “remain stable” until the end of the year, he added. The committee that will meet in Algeria on Sept.23, known as the JMCC, is chaired by Saudi Arabia and includes OPEC members Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, as well as non-OPEC members Oman and Russia.  Iran asked to attend the meeting to defend its market share which could be impacted by U.S. sanctions due to take effect on its oil industry in November. After months of underproduction aimed at bolstering crude prices, OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil producing allies to raise output from July. Saudi Arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more to meet the group’s overall conformity level, meaning some members, such as itself, could make up for shortfalls elsewhere. Iran, which faces U.S. sanctions, disagreed and criticized Saudi plans to boost output above targeted levels.

Brent crude oil futures were at $72.83 per barrel at 0234 GMT, up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $66.12 per barrel. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels in the week to Aug.17, to 405.6 million barrels, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for a fall of 1.5 million barrels, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. “Investors are also confident that (official) inventories in the United States will decrease this week,” ANZ Bank said in a note. Signs of slowing U.S. crude output growth and a weaker U.S. dollar also provided some support to oil prices, said Kim Kwang-rae, commodity analyst at Samsung Futures in Seoul. The U.S. dollar index against a basket of six major currencies eased on Wednesday to 95.211 after losing 0.7 percent the previous day, weighed by U.S. President Trump’s comments on monetary policy. A weaker U.S. dollar makes oil, which is priced in dollars, less expensive to buyers in other currencies. The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Aug. 7 cut its 2018 U.S. crude production growth to 10.68 million barrels per day (bpd), from 10.79 million bpd amid lower crude prices. Concerns also remain over how much oil will be removed from global markets by renewed sanctions on Iran, despite worries that demand growth could weaken amid a trade disputes between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. “The Iran issue continues to occupy traders’ minds,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and OPEC’s third-largest oil producer, said earlier this week no other OPEC member should be allowed to take over its share of oil exports. Meanwhile, a Chinese trade delegation is in Washington to discuss trade disputes with the U.S. side. But signs of a thaw were unlikely as U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview on Monday that he did not expect much progress.

2018-08-22,"TIKRIT, Iraq (Reuters) - A suicide attack on a former Iraqi lawmaker’s house killed at least six tribal militiamen and wounded seven others in a northern Sunni Muslim village early on Wednesday, police said. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but Islamic State militants operate in the area. A militant wearing a suicide vest blew himself up just after midnight at Adnan al-Ganam’s house in the village of Asdira, Colonel Khalil al-Sahn, the police chief of surrounding Shirqat district, told Reuters. Those killed were members of the Tribal Mobilisation Forces, a network of Sunni militias that back the government in its fight against Islamic State, he said. The village is north of Tikrit, the capital of Iraq’s Salahuddin province. Islamic State, which had seized control of much of northern Iraq in 2014, lost Shirqat to U.S.-backed Iraqi security forces supported by Sunni tribal fighters in 2016.  A small number of militants are still operating in the area and are capable of launching sporadic attacks, security officials say. Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December but security officials say the militants are likely to wage an insurgency after their self-proclaimed caliphate collapsed and they were dislodged from all the territory they held. Its fighters have kept up a campaign of kidnap and killing, mainly in the provinces of Kirkuk, Diyala and Salahuddin.

Investors in the region took some comfort from hopes that the trade talks between the U.S. and China expected this week will ease trade tensions. But Chinese investors sold shares across the board, sending the Shanghai Composite index 0.7 percent lower and the blue-chip CSI300 index down 0.6 percent, as economic concerns returned after the central bank said on Tuesday it would not resort to strong stimulus to support growth. U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters on Monday that he does not expect much progress from the trade talks with China. European shares look set to take their lead from China, with financial spreadbetters expecting London’s FTSE to open 16 points lower, Frankfurt’s DAX to fall 20 points, and Paris’ CAC to lose 9 points. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index advanced 0.6 percent. Seoul’s Kospi rose 0.3 percent, buoyed by tech firms as data showed robust chip exports, and Taiwan shares were 0.1 percent higher. But S&P futures fell Wednesday as markets assessed the possible impact of a guilty plea from Trump’s former personal lawyer, and the conviction of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. “Next to these headlines, trade news fell completely under the radar,” Citi analysts said, noting “concern that something could come out linked to Trump or other of his associates” and that Cohen’s guilty plea sparked a late-session bid in U.S. treasuries. S&P E-mini futures were 0.2 percent lower at 2855.5. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.8279 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.844 percent on Tuesday. Investors are also looking to Wednesday’s release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s August meeting, and a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday for clues on future rate hikes. Trump on Monday told Reuters he was “not thrilled” with the Fed under his appointee Powell for raising rates, and said the U.S. central bank should do more to boost the economy. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5995 percent Wednesday compared with a U.S. close of 2.608 percent. Australian shares fell 0.4 percent the day after a leadership challenge to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and as a second challenge to his leadership loomed. “There’s a bit of a risk premium now being built into Australia,” said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management in Sydney. “If you’re a foreign investor, suddenly Australia’s looking a lot less attractive.” In New York on Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose as high as 2,873.23, topping the previous record of 2,872.87 set on Jan. 26.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.25 percent to 25,821.95, the S&P 500 rose 0.21 percent to 2,862.91, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.49 percent to 7,859.17. On Wednesday, the dollar edged higher against the yen , gaining 0.12 percent to 110.42.

2018-08-22,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The smog-prone Chinese province of Hebei is aiming to slash road freight in favor of rail and river transport over the next two-and-a-half years as part of efforts to improve air quality, officials said. Hebei, which surrounds the capital Beijing, is on the front line of China’s efforts to improve it’s poor air quality, and has been under pressure to restrict industrial output, cut coal consumption and curb traffic.  The province has vowed to cut concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 by a further 15 percent over 2017-2020, although they would still be at more than five times the World Health Organisation’s recommended level. In a local briefing on Tuesday, officials said Hebei will accelerate construction of new rail links in the next two years to reduce road freight, according to a transcript published on the provincial government’s website on Wednesday. “Exhaust emissions from road freight vehicles, especially medium- and heavy-duty diesel trucks, are one of the main sources of atmospheric pollution,” said Song Shuqiang, vice-head of the province’s transportation bureau. Hebei will improve port infrastructure to facilitate the change, and shift deliveries of iron ore to steel mills to rail. It aims to raise the rail delivery capacity for iron ore shipped from the major port of Caofeidian to 40 million tonnes by next year, up from about 15 million tonnes this year, Song said.  By 2020, all major deliveries of iron ore and coking coal from the ports of Huanghua and Tangshan, which includes Caofeidian, will be by rail or waterways rather than roads, he added. In the first half of the year, 57 percent of the province’s total freight was delivered by road, with just 11.7 percent by rail. Hebei came under pressure to cut pollution by 25 percent over the 2013-2017 period. It met the target with blanket curbs on industrial enterprises, coal consumers and traffic, but has since vowed to adopt a more targeted approach. The latest moves are in line with a national plan to boost rail freight levels by as much as 30 percent by 2020, with trucks blamed for producing 13 times more pollution per unit of cargo than trains.   Hebei’s major industries like steel and coking coal would also face far tougher standards in the coming two to three years, said Gao Jianmin, the head of Hebei’s environment bureau. Steel mills will have to slash dust emissions fourfold and sulfur dioxide sixfold, he said.

2018-08-22,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Imagine a country that is one the world’s largest exporters of energy, but can’t agree on a domestic policy to end electricity blackouts. Imagine a country on the verge of losing a fourth prime minister within a decade to internal party squabbles, mainly over energy policy. Imagine a country that is likely to start importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), even though it is about to become the world’s largest exporter of the super-chilled fuel. The problem for Australia is that this isn’t something being imagined, it’s the reality of a country that can’t find political and social consensus on climate politics and the role of its vast reserves of coal, natural gas and even uranium. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull narrowly survived a vote this week for the leadership of his Liberal Party, held by the party’s parliamentarians amid in-fighting over his signature energy policy, known as the National Energy Guarantee (NEG). Turnbull, whose Liberals and junior coalition partner National Party hold a narrow majority in the country’s lower house of parliament, had hoped to use the NEG as the platform to end policy uncertainty over power generation, and ensure that Australia met its obligations under the Paris accord on climate change. The problem for Turnbull is that a significant number of his party-room are either climate change deniers or sceptics, or strong promoters of the coal industry. This group already forced Turnbull to scrap the part of NEG which would have legislated emissions reduction targets, effectively neutering a large part of the proposed policy. While Turnbull survived the party-room vote, most political pundits believe it’s now only a matter of time before his rival, Peter Dutton, gathers enough support to topple him and claim the prime ministership. Dutton, who quit as home affairs minister after losing the internal vote, was once caught unaware on tape joking about climate change swamping Australia’s Pacific island neighbours through rising seas. Turnbull appears set to follow in the footsteps of former Labor Party prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and his Liberal predecessor Tony Abbott in being knifed by their own parties. Rudd, who won a landslide victory in 2007, was dumped in 2009 by Gillard, with part of the reason being his decision to abandon a planned emissions cap and trade system. Gillard was then toppled by Rudd in 2013, partly because of public anger at rising electricity prices, which then Liberal leader Abbott managed to link to the price on carbon her government introduced. Abbott won a general election over the resurrected Rudd in 2013, before losing the prime ministership to Turnbull in 2015, mainly because of his rising unpopularity following a harsh budget that was viewed as unfairly targeting those less well off. While Abbott may not have been axed because of his energy policy, there is little doubt that his plan to reduce emissions by paying polluters not to pollute as much was largely an expensive farce. The upshot is that Australia’s energy policy has been a mess for the last 10 years, at a time when retail electricity prices have more than doubled and the country has experienced widescale blackouts in the wake of the closure of several old coal-fired power plants. With the NEG all but dead and buried, it seems that a comprehensive energy policy will not be delivered any time soon. Under Australia’s federal system, this means the six state and two territory governments will largely be responsible for their own energy policies. However, there are a few things that are probably clear for the future of energy policy. The first is that its highly unlikely a new coal-fired power plants will ever be built in Australia, despite the country being the world’s largest exporter of the polluting fuel, and its role in providing more than 60 percent of current power generation. No major utility has any interest in investing billions of dollars into a coal plant, especially given policy uncertainty and the certainty of wide-scale public opposition and protests to such a move. This leaves state governments as the only players likely to build coal-fired generators, and while it is possible they may seek to extend the life of some existing plants, they too would be wary of investing in a fuel that takes the blame for much of the current concern over climate change. Natural gas also presents problems, given the difficulty in getting the fuel from where it is produced (mainly northern and central Australia) to where it is needed (mainly the heavily-populated southeast). The last of eight mega-LNG projects is due to start this year, which will make Australia the world’s largest exporter of the fuel. However, the rapid scaling up of LNG exporters has also meant that domestic gas prices have risen to reflect international LNG prices, and local consumers are struggling to secure long-term supplies under contracts. This has raised the possibility of LNG imports to cities like Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest and home to much of the country’s manufacturing base. What initially seemed like a band-aid fix may end up being a structural feature of the LNG market, in which Australia ships LNG to Asia but buys from other countries to meet its domestic needs. The other thing that appears virtually certain is that the main investment in electricity generation in Australia is going to be in the form of renewables, both large-scale and small, rooftop systems. Solar and wind farms, with battery backups, are already in existence in South Australia state and several more are planned. Pumped hydropower using off-peak wind and solar to pump water from a lower reservoir back to a higher one to be used to generate power in periods of higher demand is also likely, with extensions to existing projects in Tasmania state and the Snowy Mountains that straddle Victoria and New South Wales states. The seemingly ever-rising retail power bills are also driving consumers to rooftop solar with battery storage, which could result in lower demand from the grid but also could serve as a back-up for the grid assuming consumers are encouraged to make their excess power and battery storage available. The ultimate irony is that Australia is on the verge of losing a fourth prime minister in a decade, partly because of his attempts to deliver an energy policy that reduced the role of coal. The coal proponents circling Turnbull like sharks don’t seem to realise or care that their preferred fuel is likely to be replaced over time, not only by cheaper alternatives but also by a community that can see first-hand the devastating effects of climate change, as witnessed by the drought currently gripping much of Australia.

2018-08-22,"* U.S. crude stocks fall 5.2 mln barrels to 405.6 mln - API * Market weights potential oil supply cut from Iran sanctions * U.S., China trade dispute raises demand growth concerns By Jane Chung SEOUL, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, supported by a drop in U.S. crude inventories, while a potential shortfall of Iranian oil from November due to U.S. sanctions added to the positive tone. Brent crude oil futures were at $72.80 per barrel at 0109 GMT, up 18 cents, or 0.25 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 26 cents, or 0.39 percent, at $66.10 per barrel. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels in the week to Aug.17, to 405.6 million barrels, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for a fall of 1.5 million barrels, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. “Investors are also confident that (official) inventories in the United States will decrease this week,” ANZ Bank said in a note. Concerns also remain over how much oil will be removed from global markets by renewed sanctions on Iran, despite worries that demand growth could weaken amid a trade disputes between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. “The Iran issue continues to occupy traders’ minds,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and OPEC’s third-largest oil producer, said earlier this week no other OPEC member should be allowed to take over its share of oil exports. Meanwhile, a Chinese trade delegation is in Washington this week to discuss trade disputes with the U.S. side. But signs of a thaw were unlikely as U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview on Monday that he did not expect much progress.

2018-08-22,"(Repeats AUG 21 story. No change to text.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2nRQtxk By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Rising fuel costs have dampened gasoline demand from private motorists in the United States, leaving the market relying on continued economic and freight expansion to boost oil use. U.S. traffic volumes were up by just 0.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months from April to June compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Traffic growth has slowed from an annual rate of between 2 percent and 3 percent through most of 2015 and 2016, when gasoline prices were low and falling (“Traffic Volume Trends,” FHA, August 2018). Traffic growth has been correlated with changes in gasoline prices for the past quarter century and recent fuel price increases have resulted in a predictable slowdown (tmsnrt.rs/2nRQtxk). Retail gasoline prices are up by more than 55 percent from their cyclical low in February 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Traffic volumes have levelled out despite continued strong growth in economic output, incomes and employment, indicating that motoring demand has been hit by rising fuel prices. Slower traffic growth has been mirrored in flattening gasoline consumption, with sales to domestic customers at or slightly below prior-year levels for most months so far this year. Between March and May, the most recent three-month period for which data are available, gasoline supplied to the domestic market was marginally down from the same period in 2017. The Energy Information Administration is now forecasting gasoline consumption will be essentially unchanged in 2018, down from predicted growth of around 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the start of the year (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, August 2018). If the prediction proves accurate, it will be the second year of little or no growth, after gasoline use surged by 140,000 bpd in 2016 and 257,000 bpd in 2015, corresponding with the slump in oil prices. Lack of growth in gasoline contrasts with distillate fuel oil, where consumption between March and May was up by almost 75,000 bpd compared with 2017, spurred by rising industrial output and strong growth in freight. U.S. freight volumes were up by more than 8 percent year-on-year in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (“Transportation Services Index”, BTS, August 2018). Manufacturing output was up by 2.8 percent in the year to July while mining output, which includes oil and gas drilling, rose by 12.9 percent (“Industrial production and capacity utilization”, Federal Reserve, August 2018). Distillate fuel oil and jet fuel accounted for essentially all the growth in fuel consumption in the United States in the March-May period. EIA forecasts distillate consumption will increase by 170,000 bpd in 2018, while jet fuel will be up by another 30,000 bpd. Freight growth within the United States remains robust, but in the rest of the world has showed signs of slowing since the start of the year. Flat-lining domestic gasoline consumption coupled with softness in international distillate growth helps explain why benchmark oil prices have pulled back from highs set in May. Prices are falling to buy back some demand growth, or at least prevent any more being lost.
