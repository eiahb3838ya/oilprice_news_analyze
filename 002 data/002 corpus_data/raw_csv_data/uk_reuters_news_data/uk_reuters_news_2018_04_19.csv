2018-04-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tobacco and tech stocks dragged down Wall Street on Thursday, while oil prices softened and other commodities walked back huge gains after a wild ride. A bump in long-dated U.S. Treasury yields steepened the curve after two weeks of flattening, and supported a stronger dollar. Robust corporate earnings had boosted shares this week, but a tepid forecast on smartphone demand sent stocks from Apple to chipmakers tumbling on Thursday. Tobacco company Philip Morris plunged as much as 17.7 percent after announcing weak results and forecasts, dragging down the S&P 500 index and rival Altria. Oil prices softened after having spiked to highs not seen since 2014. U.S. crude fell 0.48 percent to $68.14 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.61, up 0.18 percent on the day. “I do think we could see $70 pretty quick, but I want to caution that maybe we’ll see the market level out a little bit in a few weeks,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at PRICE Futures Group in Chicago. Commodities were buoyed by talk that Saudi Arabia had its sights set on $80 to $100 a barrel of oil. Nickel and aluminum also rose on fears over the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminum producers, including Rusan. Nickel initially jumped by the most in 6-1/2 years and aluminum prices reached their highest since 2011.  But the metals later turned sharply negative, with analysts saying the gains were overdone. The Thomson Reuters CoreCommodity total return index opened on Thursday near its highest since mid-2015, before giving back all its gains. [O/R] The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.18 points, or 0.34 percent, to 24,664.89, the S&P 500 lost 15.51 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,693.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 57.18 points, or 0.78 percent, to 7,238.06. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.02 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.25 percent. The bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down. [ECILT/WRAP] Investors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.9135 percent, nearly the highest since Feb. 21. The 30-year bond last fell 34/32 in price to yield 3.1015 percent, from 3.046 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar index rose 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies as the higher yields and expectations of more Federal Reserve rate increases offset concerns about a trade war and a ballooning U.S. budget deficit.

2018-04-19,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil company is nearing a deal in which China National Petroleum Corp Ltd (CNPC) would invest in an oil refinery in exchange for crude oil, two people with knowledge of the talks told Reuters, potentially giving China its first refining capacity in the Americas. Petróleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), or Petrobras, may give the state-owned Chinese firm stakes in oil fields it operates in the Campos basin, off the Rio de Janeiro coast, along with the right to use the new Comperj refinery, the sources added. “We are going to have a deal, but it is complex. We should have an integrated solution,” said one of the sources, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are private. The second source said talks with the Chinese intensified recently and a deal could be only a few weeks away. Two other people familiar with the matter said the refinery needed about $3 billion of investment to reach an initial capacity of 165,000 barrels per day, adding that it was not clear if Petrobras would foot part of the bill.     Petrobras declined to comment. CNPC did not respond to a request for comment. The talks highlight rising Chinese interest in the Brazilian energy sector, which has attracted billions of dollars from oil majors over the past year for rights to new exploration blocs as the government lowers barriers to foreigners. Chinese state companies have also taken a central role in Brazil’s electric grid, acquiring rights to hydropower dams, major transmission lines and the country’s largest distributor. The Comperj deal would not be the first in which Petrobras offered oil to attract Chinese funding. In 2016, it renewed a $10 billion credit line with China Development Bank, originally opened in 2009, that was guaranteed by Brazilian oil exports. China has also provided more than $50 billion to Venezuela over the past decade under oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy. CNPC and Petrobras signed a memorandum of understanding last year to reach a strategic partnership in oil exploration and production. CNPC has already partnered with Petrobras in the Libra field of the Santos basin, one of the largest discoveries in Brazil’s prolific pre-salt oil area. The investment at Comperj would help to offset Brazil’s fuel imports and resolve a long-running headache at the complex, where Petrobras has little to show for some $13.5 billion in investments over the past decade.  The project was caught up in a corruption probe in recent years and Petrobras has booked some 6.5 billion reais ($1.9 billion) in writedowns there linked to overpriced works and services. The company said it wants to finish Comperj, but preferably without pouring in any more money, so it is talking to potential partners. Petrobras Chief Executive Pedro Parente said last year that CNPC was in talks to invest in the refinery.  On Thursday, Petrobras announced plans to sell 60 percent stakes in four of its existing refineries, underscoring its willingness to give up a near monopoly on Brazilian refining. Parente told journalists the Comperj project was not included in the plans because it is not yet a productive asset.  He said negotiations for a partnership at the Comeperj refinery were still underway. Separately, Petrobras awarded a contract last month worth 1.95 billion reais to China’s Shandong Kerui Petroleum Equipment Co to build a natural gas processing unit at the Comperj complex.  The privately run Kerui Group partnered with mid-sized Brazilian engineering company Método Potencial Engenharia SA to build the plant in Itaboraí, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Rio.

2018-04-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices on Thursday hit highs not seen since 2014, built on the ongoing drawdowns in global supply and as Saudi Arabia looks to push prices higher, though U.S. crude gave back gains in the afternoon to finish lower. A global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, according to a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical panel, two sources familiar with the matter said, thanks in part to an OPEC-led supply cut deal in place since January 2017. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled 18 cents lower at $68.29 a barrel after earlier hitting $69.56, their highest since Nov. 28, 2014. WTI has gained nearly 8 percent in the last eight days of trading. Brent crude futures LCOc1 ended at $73.78 a barrel, up 30 cents. The global benchmark touched $74.75 a barrel, its highest since Nov. 27, 2014 - the day OPEC decided to pump as much as it could to defend market share.  “Overall the supply-demand equation is fairly balanced,” said Anthony Scott, managing director at BTU Analytics in Denver. “It depends on expectations at this point - bullishness may be stalling out, and people are asking, ‘What’s the next leg; you need to see the next signal, whether it’s a bullish or bearish signal.’” Traders said speculators continue to bet on further upside, expecting potential supply disruptions and further drawdowns, driven by strong demand. More than 830,000 front-month contracts changed hands on CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange on Thursday, compared with a daily average of about 615,000. Investors are eyeing the $70 level on U.S. crude, but said that would likely face resistance, particularly as the speed and magnitude of the recent rally would augur for selling pressure before long. “I do think we could see $70 pretty quick, but I want to caution that maybe we’ll see the market level out a little bit in a few weeks,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ Joint Technical Committee, meeting this week in Jeddah, found that inventories in developed nations in March were at just 12 million barrels above the five-year average, according to a source familiar with the matter. However, Oman’s oil minister, Mohammed bin Hamad Al Rumhi, said he still thinks the oil market is oversupplied. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia would be happy for crude to reach $80 or even $100 a barrel, viewed as a sign that Riyadh will not seek changes to the supply pact. Also supporting prices is the possibility that the United States might reimpose sanctions on Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, which could result in further supply reductions.

2018-04-19,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenian President Armen Sarkissian on Thursday called for dialogue, as thousands continued to protest on the streets against the appointment of the new prime minister, who was president for 10 years before switching jobs this month. Parliament on Tuesday voted to allow ex-president Serzh Sarksyan to become premier in the former Soviet republic, despite weeks of angry rallies against such a move. “I’m confident that the only solution is a dialogue and mutual respect,” Sarkissian said in a statement. “As a leader of the country, I’m calling on the sides to hold a dialogue in order to find the best solution in the current situation.” Thousands of opposition activists marched in the centre of  Yerevan on Thursday, waving national flags and chanting: “Make a stand, say no to Serzh”. They blocked entrances to government buildings and staged sit-ins. In the evening about 15,000 protesters were massed in the main square. Police detained more than 120 activists. Sarksyan was president from 2008 until April 9 and demonstrators said he was switching jobs but clinging to power. Under a revised constitution approved by referendum in 2015, the prime minister will hold most power while the presidency becomes largely ceremonial. Sarksyan’s ally Sarkissian was sworn in as president last week after being elected by parliament. Sarksyan said in March, while still president, he would become prime minister to allow him to share the benefit of his experience. Armenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning.

Rising U.S. Treasury yields widened the curve slightly after nine days of flattening, and supported a stronger dollar. Strong corporate earnings had boosted stocks this week, but a tepid forecast on smartphone demand sent stocks from Apple to chipmakers tumbling on Thursday.

But the metals later turned sharply negative, with analysts saying the gains were overdone. “It has been a very erratic day, it’s a bit crazy,” said Rabobank metals sector economist Casper Burgering. “Nickel went up by almost 10 pct and aluminium by almost 8 percent and now are coming right back down.” Expect more volatility, he said.

2018-04-19,"(Adds comments from natural resources minister, petition, details) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, April 19 (Reuters) - Canada is still talking to Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd about financial aid for a pipeline, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said on Thursday, a day after the company said such help might not be enough. The chairman of parent company Kinder Morgan Inc said the offer would not help resolve resistance in the Pacific province of British Columbia, where the government opposes plans to almost triple the capacity of an oil pipeline from Alberta to the west coast. Asked for his reaction to the comments, Carr told reporters that Ottawa was talking to the company. “So really nothing has changed ... They are still interested in having conversations with the government,” he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, citing the need to assuage investors worried about putting money into the energy sector, said last Sunday he had asked his finance minister to open talks with Kinder Morgan Canada about possible aid for the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project. Trudeau, in London for an official visit, told reporters on Thursday that “we will ensure that this pipeline gets built.” Trudeau insists his Liberal government has jurisdiction over the pipeline but British Columbia - concerned about the risks of a spill - is seeking to delay and possibly kill the project by going to court. Kinder Morgan Canada says it will walk away from the project on May 31 unless Ottawa acts to end the uncertainty over the project, which is also opposed by environmentalists and aboriginal activists. “We know that the May 31 deadline is real ... They are feeling the pressure from their investors because of uncertainty,” said Carr. Asked whether he was concerned that the federal government’s efforts to keep the project alive would fail, he replied: “It’s hard to predict the future in pipeline politics.” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said late on Wednesday that “the message we’re getting back (from the company) is that they are pleased with the high level of engagement that is happening between both us and the federal government.” Notley strongly backs the pipeline and has threatened to cut off oil supplies to British Columbia.

2018-04-19,"(Adds coalition statement, more details) By Ahmed Aboulenein BAGHDAD, April 19 (Reuters) - Iraqi warplanes attacked an Islamic State explosives factory and other positions inside Syria on Thursday, Baghdad’s military said, in a rare air assault across the border. Iraqi F-16 jets targeted the militants near the city of Hajin in coordination with the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an Iraqi military spokesman said. Both governments have been fighting the hardline group, which declared a caliphate on both their territories in 2014 before it was forced back by an international offensive. “Carrying out air strikes on Daesh gangs in Syrian territories is because of the dangers posed by said gangs to Iraqi territories and is proof of the improved capabilities of our armed forces,” the Iraqi military said in a statement. Daesh in an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. The U.S.-led coalition also fighting Islamic State said it gave the Iraqi mission intelligence support. Earlier this month, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said his country would “take all necessary measures if they threaten the security of Iraq,” referring to the jihadist militants who just three years ago overran a third of Iraq. The prime minister declared final victory over the ultra hardline group in December but it still poses a threat from pockets along the border with Syria and has continued to carry out ambushes, assassinations and bombings across Iraq. Iraq currently has good relations with Iran and Russia, Assad’s main backers in the seven-year-old Syrian civil war, while also enjoying strong support from the U.S.-led coalition. Last year, Iraqi warplanes carried out at least one strike on Islamic State targets inside Syria, also in coordination with the U.S.-led coalition and with the approval of the Syrian government.

2018-04-19,"NEW YORK, April 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fighters for social, economic and environmental justice earned places on Fortune’s list of the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders on Thursday, cited for their exceptional skills at building their organizations’ effectiveness. Ranging from little known to widely celebrated, those on the influential ranking ranged from activists in remote parts of Africa to the global #Metoo movement against sexual abuse. The annual list this year focused on what editors at the business magazine called “unbundling”, a process that can mean dividing, separating or outsourcing the roles of organizations. “For centuries, greater size made companies, nations, and other enterprises more efficient and effective. Increasingly, it doesn’t,” they wrote. “This year’s list puts an emphasis on leaders who are navigating this challenge deftly.” One such leader is Indira Jaising of the Lawyers Collective in India, which advocates for women, the poor and minorities. “Indira Jaising’s little NGO punches far above its weight because it can outsource staff and infrastructure; the Internet lets it communicate widely at low cost and enables volunteers to pitch in from around the world,” Fortune said. Indian architect Balkrishna Doshi made the list for designing low-cost, sustainable housing. This year he was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize, the highest honor in the field. Among the best-known winners were Bill and Melinda Gates, whose philanthropic foundation has built partnerships to develop insecticides to fight malaria. It also works to rid the technology industry of sex discrimination, the magazine said. Elsewhere in global public health, Donald Hopkins, a physician at the Carter Center, was cited for his campaign to eliminate Guinea worm disease. Angela Nyambura Gichaga, head of Financing Alliance for Health, was listed for designing finance for poor and remote communities in Africa, and Liberian Nobel laureate Leymah Gbowee was named for her work on behalf of girls and women. Katie Bethell of PL+US was cited for promoting paid family-leave benefits at giant U.S. corporations, while Kathleen McLaughlin was honored as chief sustainability officer at Walmart Inc. Daniel Servitje Montull, head of baking giant Grupo Bimbo , was named for keeping prices accessible for low-income families and buying wind power credits to offset energy use. Also listed was Feike Sijbesma of Dutch specialty chemicals company DSM, who works with the World Food Programme and Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition and is “particularly effective at rallying fellow executives,” Fortune said. In China, Ma Jun’s nonprofit Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs has gotten the attention of powerful political and corporate leaders, Fortune said. Attracting attention as well on the Fortune list was the #Metoo movement, in which women have spoken out to recount experiences of sexual harassment and assault. In the wake of #Metoo has been #TimesUp launched by actresses and others in the entertainment industry. Actress and producer Reese Witherspoon made the list for her founding role. Separately, Time magazine’s 100 most influential people, also published on Thursday, included journalists from The New Yorker and The New York Times who first reported the accusations of sexual mistreatment in Hollywood. Others on Time’s list were U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, LGBT community activist Janet Mock and Nice Nailantei Leng’ete who is combating female genital mutilation in Kenya.

2018-04-19,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration this week will begin the environmental review process for oil and gas drilling on a section of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a region in northern Alaska rich in crude but prized by conservationists.   In a notice from the U.S. Department of the Interior seen by Reuters, which the agency will post on Friday, it says it will hold meetings in five Alaskan towns where the public can speak about drilling in the refuge. It is the first step in the review process, which will consider proposed seismic testing and exploration plans.     The tax bill passed by the Republican-led Congress late last year allowed the Interior Department to hold two lease sales in part of the 1.5-million-acre (600,000-hectare).In 1980, when Congress created the refuge, it designated the “1002 area” as a part on the refuge’s coastal plain where drilling could occur in the future. The first lease sale could occur next year if there are no delays. Alaskan lawmakers have been fighting for decades to open the refuge. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said in a joint statement with Alaska’s other lawmakers that the drilling would “help ensure the energy and economic security of our nation.”     Conservationists have vowed to fight the opening of the reserve in court. They are concerned that drilling would harm sensitive populations of migrating birds as well as caribou herds on which Gwich’in native people depend.  Wilderness Society President Jamie Williams said the Interior Department is “pursuing an irresponsibly aggressive timeline for Arctic Refuge drilling that reflects the Trump administration’s eagerness to turn over America’s public lands to private industry for development.” Nobody knows how much oil the refuge contains, but the U.S. Geological Survey estimated in 1998 that the 1002 area held about 10.4 billion barrels of recoverable crude. And it is uncertain how much interest there is from oil companies to drill in the remote region. In December, a lease sale received only seven bids, on less than 1 percent of the 10.3 million acres offered in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is less than 150 miles (240 km) from the refuge. ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc, in partnership with Anadarko Petroleum Corp submitted the seven bids. Still, analysts at British bank Barclays have said if surveys show promising deposits, the refuge could attract oil producers that drill in frontier regions in Latin America and the Middle East. The public meetings will be held in Anchorage, Arctic Village, Fairbanks, Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik, the dates for which will be announced later. The Interior Department said in the notice more meetings could be held if there is strong community interest.

2018-04-19,"LAGOS (Reuters) - President Muhammadu Buhari has drawn criticism from social media and the opposition alike for saying many young Nigerians think they need “do nothing” to enjoy free homes, hospitals and schooling because they live in an oil-rich country. Buhari, who said last week he will run for a second term in elections next February, made the comments in London where he is attending a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. “More than 60 percent of the population is below the age of 30,” he told a business forum on Wednesday. “A lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria has been an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.” This went down badly with the very people the 75-year-old will need if he is to remain leader of Africa’s top oil producer. The median age in the nation of around 190 million people is just 18, according to the United Nations.  His remarks prompted the ironic hashtag #LazyNigerianYouths on Twitter even though Buhari, a former general who was also a military ruler in the 1980s, did not use the word “lazy”. Young Nigerians cited examples of their industry and fortitude in a nation where most people live on less than $2 a day, public services are poor and corruption is rife.   “Imagine living and surviving in a country that has no plan for you and constantly tries to make life hard, yet we survive and try to break through. We are not #LazyNigerianYouths,” wrote Twitter user @UmehOMA.  Others used another hashtag - #LazyNigeranPVC - in reference to the Permanent Voter Card (PVC) used to cast a ballot, linking Buhari’s comments to next year’s election.  “Dear #LazyNigerianYouths 2019 is around the corner let us get our #LAZYNIGERIANPVC so that we can show him our Laziness,” said one Twitter user called @Blessmhe. Buhari has promised to fix the economy and reduce Nigeria’s dependence on oil but it fell into recession in 2016, largely due to low crude prices. Growth returned last year but remains sluggish, and four out of every 10 people in the workforce are unemployed or underemployed. The opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) described   Buhari’s comments as “false, derogatory and unpatriotic”. “Most disheartening is that these are the same young persons who form the highest demography of voters that put their confidence in him in 2015,” it said in a statement. The PDP, which was in power in 1999-2015, has not selected a presidential candidate. Buhari himself still requires his party’s endorsement, although many see this as a formality. Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and erstwhile Buhari ally, said he backed the young. “I will never refer to Nigeria’s youth as people who sit and do nothing. They are hardworking,” Abubakar, who left the president’s party in November and rejoined the PDP, said in a tweet. Abubakar, who has declared his readiness to run for president in 2019, also said “their entrepreneurial spirit, work ethic, and creative abilities are things of pride and should be applauded”. Bashir Ahmad, a presidential aide, tweeted that Buhari had “always applauded and celebrated Nigerian youths who excel in different areas of endeavour, from sports, to academia, and other realms”.

2018-04-19,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s second biggest public pension fund, Caisse de depot, held a 7.8 percent stake in Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd (KML.TO) at the end of last year, according to its annual report, making it the largest independent shareholder of the pipeline company at the center of a contentious expansion project. Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec [CDPDA.UL], which discloses its shareholdings in Canadian companies once a year, said it acquired the stake in the period following Kinder Morgan Canada’s initial public offering last May and before it announced plans to reduce its carbon footprint by 25 percent per dollar invested last October. Kinder Morgan, a unit of Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), is at the center of an escalating crisis over a planned C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) Trans Mountain oil pipeline that will almost triple the capacity of its line from Alberta to the Pacific province of British Columbia.  The company has threatened to pull out of the project unless all hurdles are cleared by May 31. In a post earnings call on Wednesday, Kinder Morgan said recent events confirmed an investment in the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion may be “untenable.” It added that Ottawa’s pledge of financial support did not resolve political risk related to British Columbia’s opposition.. The project, which has the support of Canada’s federal government, is opposed by the province of British Columbia. Caisse spokesman Maxime Chagnon declined to say what the fund’s current shareholding in Kinder Morgan is, or whether it planned to keep a stake in light of its carbon footprint commitment. “The Kinder Morgan investment was before we adopted our new strategy regarding climate change,” he said. “We’re looking at the portfolio and all of our assets on an overall basis to see how we can reach our objective.” Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Tom Brown",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-caisse/canadas-caisse-pension-fund-reveals-stake-in-kinder-morgan-idUKL1N1RW17X,19 Apr 2018,"Canada's second biggest public

2018-04-19,"NEW YORK, April 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Veronica Harwood-Stevenson gambled her life savings on research into a rare species of bee, she had no way of knowing whether it would pay off. The 33-year-old New Zealander, a trained reproductive biologist, had a hunch that the cellophane-like substance in which the Hylaeus bee breeds its larvae could replace toxic chemicals used in plastics. The idea, inspired by a chance reading of an academic paper while trying to distract herself from a job in film distribution, set her on a completely new life path. “The results were good,” Harwood-Stevenson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “I had just spent my life savings, so I was relieved.” After Harwood-Stevenson chased around rugged bush to catch specimens, tests revealed that as well as being waterproof, the bee’s nest lining was resistant to fire and certain acids, giving it a wide range of potential uses. Plastics are commonly treated with chemicals to change their properties, waterproofing them in products from raingear to camping gear and making them fire-resistant for firefighters’ jackets and construction tarps. Those chemicals are drawing scrutiny from environmentalists concerned about the danger they pose to health. Some studies have linked bisphenol A (BPA), used to stiffen plastic food containers, to a range of possible effects from cancer to heart disease to infertility although this is disputed. Enter Humble Bee, a Wellington-based startup that has raised NZD $320,000 ($230,000) in private funding as well as a NZD$120,000 government-backed grant since its inception in 2011. Dissecting the minute bee, which measures no more than 12 mms (about half an inch), to extract its microscopic glands has allowed Humble Bee to chart a chemical pathway to replicate the precious nest lining. Extracting the genetic code behind the material, the company’s current focus, holds more promises as it would make it cheaper to manufacture and selling the material at a more competitive price, said Harwood-Stevenson. Company director Richard Furneaux, a chemistry professor who heads a research institute at the Victoria University of Wellington, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the discovery was “almost too good to be true”. “Its robustness is beyond what you would have expected,” said Furneaux, who has opened his laboratory to Humble Bee. The interest of funders in the start-up reflected a growing interest in the scientific field of biomimicry, which looks to nature for solutions, said Maurie Cohen, a professor of sustainability at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Harwood-Stevenson hopes the final product would go on sale within five years and have a commercial and social impact. ""The answer lies in nature,"" she said.

2018-04-19,"WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - The Trump administration this week will begin the environmental review process for oil and gas drilling on a section of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a region in northern Alaska rich in crude but prized by conservationists. In a notice from the U.S. Department of the Interior seen by Reuters, which the agency will post on Friday, it says it will hold meetings in five Alaskan towns where the public can speak about drilling in the refuge. It is the first step in the review process, which will consider proposed seismic testing and exploration plans. The tax bill passed by the Republican-led Congress late last year allowed the Interior Department to hold two lease sales in part of the 1.5-million-acre (600,000-hectare). In 1980, when Congress created the refuge, it designated the “1002 area” as a part on the refuge’s coastal plain where drilling could occur in the future. The first lease sale could occur next year if there are no delays. Alaskan lawmakers have been fighting for decades to open the refuge, and the latest effort was led by Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who has said it would lead to jobs and increase U.S. energy security. Conservationists have vowed to fight the opening up of the reserve in court. They are concerned that drilling would harm sensitive populations of migrating birds as well as caribou herds that Gwich’in native people depend on. Wilderness Society President Jamie Williams said the Interior Department is “pursuing an irresponsibly aggressive timeline for Arctic Refuge drilling that reflects the Trump administration’s eagerness to turn over America’s public lands to private industry for development.” Nobody knows how much oil the refuge contains, but the U.S. Geological Survey estimated in 1998 that the 1002 area held about 10.4 billion barrels of recoverable crude. And it is uncertain how much interest there is from oil companies to drill in the remote region. In December, a lease sale received only seven bids, on less than 1 percent of the 10.3 million acres offered in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is less than 150 miles (240 km) from the refuge. ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc, in partnership with Anadarko Petroleum Corp submitted the seven bids. Still, analysts at British bank Barclays have said if surveys show promising deposits, the refuge could attract oil producers that drill in frontier regions in Latin America and the Middle East. The public meetings will be held in Anchorage, Arctic Village, Fairbanks, Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik, the dates for which will be announced later. The Interior Department said in the notice more meetings could be held if there is strong community interest.

2018-04-19,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece has accepted a 535 million euro (466.31 million pounds) offer from a consortium led by Italy’s Snam (SRG.MI) for a majority stake in gas grid operator DESFA, naming it the “preferred investor”, its privatisation agency said on Thursday. DESFA runs a network for transporting gas from the Greek-Bulgarian and Greek-Turkish borders via a 1,459-km (907-mile) pipeline. It also has a liquefied gas terminal facility on an islet off Athens. Strategically-placed, Greece could represent an important crossroads for the diversification of supplies and new natural gas routes in Europe, the consortium said. It anticipated the transaction would be finalised in the second half of 2018 after securing approvals, including antitrust clearance. “With our partners Enagas and Fluxys we have built a strong European industrial consortium with the aim of further developing DESFA, the Greek market, the Energy Union and the entire energy system of Mediterranean Europe,” Snam’s Chief Executive Marco Alvera said in a statement. The sale of a majority stake in DESFA is mandated under Greece’s latest international financial bailout, worth up to 86 billion euros.  It was forced to re-launch the sale process for 66 percent stake in DESFA last year after a previous 400 million euro deal with Azerbaijan’s SOCAR fell through in 2016. A consortium of Snam (SRG.MI), Spain’s Enagas Internacional (ENAG.MC) and Belgium’s Fluxys (FLUX.BR) and another consortium of Spain’s Regasificadora del Noroeste, Romania’s Transgaz and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) bid for DESFA in February.  Athens had requested both suitors to improve their bids and after unsealing their new offers on Monday, it asked the Snam-led consortium, the highest bidder, to further improve its offer. Discussions have started with Greek and international banks to secure financing for the acquisition, the consortium said. Greece welcomed the consortium’s offer, saying it exceeded Socar’s bid in the previous tender. The Greek state is selling a 31 percent stake in DESFA and Hellenic Petroleum (HEPr.AT), Greece’s biggest oil refiner and the other shareholder in the operator, 35 percent. The privatisation agency’s board and the board of Hellenic Petroleum met on Thursday and accepted Snam’s offer. Hellenic will seek shareholders’ approval for the sale on May 14, Hellenic said in a statement.    Alantra and Alpha Bank acted as financial advisers for Greece. Lazard advised Snam on the sale.

2018-04-19,"* Oil producer hit hard by drop in crude prices * Govt-guaranteed debt at around 110 pct of GDP * Talks with IMF drag on due to need to restructure debt (Retops with IMF statement, writes through) By Christian Elion BRAZZAVILLE, April 19 (Reuters) - An International Monetary Fund team in the Congo Republic said on Thursday it was not ready to propose an aid programme for the debt-crippled country to the IMF board but did applaud reforms promised by Brazzaville to obtain a bailout. Like other Central African oil producers, Congo has been hit hard by low crude prices. But while several regional neighbours, including Chad and Gabon, have secured bailouts from the IMF, talks with Congo have dragged on since last year. The delay is largely due to the IMF’s demand that the government restructure its debt, which stood at $9.14 billion, or around 110 percent of GDP, by the end of July and which the Fund says is unsustainable. The IMF wrapped up its latest visit to Congo on Wednesday. “Staff understands that the authorities will continue to work in the coming weeks on implementing their comprehensive strategy to restore debt sustainability and ensure full program financing,” it said in a statement. “Once compliance with all relevant IMF policies has been established, an arrangement to support Congo’s economic program would be proposed for the IMF Executive Board’s consideration.” Congo is seeking to restructure its debt with commodities trading houses after borrowing $2 billion from merchants including Trafigura and Glencore. The bulk of its external debt, however, is owed to Chinese entities. In a statement released late on Wednesday, Prime Minister Clement Mouamba said that any restructuring of the external debt would not affect multilateral creditors or holders of Congo’s Eurobond, which matures in 2029. It added that the government expected the talks to “rapidly lead to the adoption” of a three-year programme with the IMF. Government revenues have dropped by a third since world prices for crude plummeted in 2014 and 2015. The IMF said last year that the non-oil economy was expected to contract by 9.2 percent in 2017. That hardship was exacerbated by Congo’s chronic governance problems, the Fund statement said. “The authorities will need to take bold and immediate governance reforms to put into effect the government’s proclaimed intention to mark a break with past policies and practices,” it said. The mission commended the government’s pledges to establish an independent anti-corruption body, oblige senior officials to declare their assets and foster transparency regarding natural resource management and large infrastructure projects.

Wall Street equity indexes fell in choppy trading on a broad-based slump in technology stocks and a tumble in consumer staples, while higher bond yields supported a steady U.S. dollar. After Brent crude futures climbed past $74 a barrel overnight, the Thomson Reuters CoreCommodity total return index opened on Thursday near its highest level since mid-2015, before giving back all its gains. The surge came on a Reuters report that OPEC’s new price hawk Saudi Arabia would be happy for crude to rise to $80 or even $100, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to a supply-cutting deal even though the agreement’s original target is now within sight. After jumping nearly 3 percent overnight, Brent was at $74.40 per barrel, up 1.25 percent on the day. U.S. crude rose 0.73 percent to $68.97. The leap in the price of oil, combined with fears that sanctions on Russia could hit supplies of other commodities, energized the entire sector. “It has been a very erratic day, it’s a bit crazy,” said Rabobank metals sector economist Casper Burgering. “Nickel went up by almost 10 pct and aluminium by almost 8 percent and now are coming right back down.” Expect more volatility, he said. However such increases, if sustained, could fuel inflationary pressures. Investors hedged by selling sovereign bonds. Nickel initially jumped by the most in 6-1/2 years on talk Nornickel - the world’s second-biggest producer of the metal - could be impacted. But nickel then turned negative, dropping as much as 2 percent in price before regaining some ground. Aluminium prices reached their highest since 2011, its raw material alumina touching an all-time peak before retreating when Russia floated the idea of a temporary nationalisation of sanctions-hit giant Rusal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 76.32 points, or 0.31 percent, to 24,671.75, the S&P 500 lost 16.86 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,691.78 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 52.82 points, or 0.72 percent, to 7,242.42. Global resource stocks were the winners from Thursday’s romp higher in prices. Chinese blue chips added 1.22 percent; MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.74 percent, led by energy shares. Industrial and commodities-focused stocks also led the pack in Europe though the pan-regional STOXX 600 faded after a two-day rally that had taken it to a six-week high. The bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down. Investors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 17/32 in price to yield 2.9284 percent, its highest since Feb. 21. The U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of major currencies as higher yields and expectations of more Federal Reserve rate increases offset concerns about a trade war and ballooning U.S. budget deficit.

2018-04-19,"PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European utility companies are retrenching in their home markets and looking to unwind debt-financed cross-border mergers deals as increasingly nationalist governments balk at foreign ownership of strategic power supplies. Hungary was one of the first European countries to turn against foreign ownership of utilities back in 2013 but there are growing signs that borders are springing up again in an industry that has struggled to make international deals pay off. Several European utilities were lining up to buy German utility RWE’s (RWEG.DE) subsidiary Innogy (IGY.DE) but in March RWE and domestic rival E.ON (EONGn.DE) agreed to carve up the renewable energy firm themselves in an all-German deal. Then this week, French electricity retailer Direct Energie DIREN.PA, the biggest independent challenger to market leader EDF (EDF.PA), went to French energy giant Total (TOTF.PA) in another all-domestic deal. “In a business as sovereign and strategic as utilities, it is hard to see major deals materializing in today’s Europe,” said a banker in Paris who has worked on cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the utilities sector. Bankers say the German deal, hammered out within two months, was partly aimed at keeping Innogy’s prized assets out of foreign hands and the backlash against foreign owners is now fuelling speculation some big cross-border deals may be unwound. EDF’s Italian energy subsidiary Edison (EDNn.MI), the third-biggest power producer in Italy, is seen as a prime example of a legacy cross-border investment ripe for unwinding. Edison’s oil and gas activities no longer fit EDF’s low-carbon strategy and its prospects of winning retail market share from Enel (ENEI.MI), in which the Italian state has a 24 percent stake, look limited. “The Italians have never accepted that Edison is no longer Italian,” said the Paris banker, adding that the firm’s growth outlook in Italy would always be constrained by its French ownership. Sources told Reuters this month that Edison had selected banks to sell its oil and gas exploration and production division - joining other utility firms that have sold off hydrocarbon assets as they grapple with sluggish energy demand, low wholesale prices and a surge in cleaner, renewable energy. Spain’s Endesa (ELE.MC) is another asset owned by a foreign utility seen as a potential candidate for resale. Italy’s Enel, Europe’s biggest utility, outbid E.ON for Endesa in 2007 during a spate of cross-border European utility mergers. While Enel, which owns 70.1 percent of Endesa, has denied it has plans to sell, its control has drawn criticism from Spanish politicians who say Endesa is not investing enough locally and pays too much in dividends to its owners. Enel Chief Executive Francesco Starace acknowledged nationalism was having an impact on utilities M&A in Europe. “There is some but I don’t think Europe’s big countries can afford to be nationalistic because they would need really deep pockets to keep these companies off their markets,” he told Reuters. Edison and EDF declined to comment. The spate of cross-border utility takeovers before and just after the 2008 financial crisis came as 10 countries joined the European Union in its biggest enlargement and European power companies saw a chance to become regional power giants. E.ON spent 11.5 billion euros ($14.2 billion) on foreign assets after losing the battle for Endesa, RWE bought Britain’s npower, EDF bought Edison and British Energy [EDFBR.UL], France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) bought Britain’s International Power (IPWG.PK), Spain’s Iberdrola (IBE.MC) bought Scottish Power and Sweden’s Vattenfall [VATN.UL] bought Dutch Nuon Energy. But the collapse in wholesale power prices since has undermined many of these debt-fueled deals. Engie, E.ON and Vattenfall alone have written a combined 34 billion euros at least off the value of their international acquisitions. Now, not much of the cross-border deal euphoria is left. With nationalists in power in Hungary, Poland and Austria, and right-wing parties on the rise in other large European countries, utilities are feeling a backlash against the internationalization they embraced a decade earlier. “This is still a very national business,” said a senior banker who worked on the Innogy deal. “The most difficult situations in a big transaction are those that involve players from different countries.” While potential foreign ownership had not become a political issue ahead of the Innogy deal, German politicians publicly opposed attempts by China State Grid Corp [STGRD.UL] to buy a stake in German grid operator 50Hertz from Australian fund IFM. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that German officials had encouraged Belgium’s Elia (ELI.BR) - the leading shareholding in 50Hertz - to increase its stake rather than let State Grid buy it. The first moves against international ownership of utilities came in Hungary, where right-wing populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in 2013 the state would seek to buy back Hungarian assets of E.ON, RWE, EDF, Engie and Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI). Since then, Orban has imposed sharp cuts in energy prices, making mostly foreign-owned firms foot the bill, and several foreign utilities have sold their operations to the state. In Poland, EDF and Engie felt the sting of nationalist energy policies in 2016 when the ruling Law and Justice party put assets owned by French utilities on a list of firms deemed important for energy security, to block their potential sale. EDF, which had been in talks with Czech firm EPH and IFM about selling its assets in Poland, was ultimately forced to sell to Polish state-run firms. “Has there ever been a big value-creating cross-border M&A deal in the utility world? I would have to think very hard to find an answer,” said an M&A banker based in Frankfurt, who has worked on German and European sector deals.

2018-04-19,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - A global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, according to a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical panel, two sources familiar with the matter said, thanks in part to an OPEC-led supply cut deal in place since January 2017. The meeting of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) earlier on Thursday found that oil inventories in developed nations in March stood at 12 million barrels above the five-year average, one of the sources said. That’s down from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017.  The stated goal of the supply cut is to reduce the excess in oil stocks to that of the five-year average, although oil ministers have said other metrics should also be considered. Although OPEC is closing in on the original target of the pact, there is no indication yet that top exporter Saudi Arabia or its allies want to wind down the supply cut.  Saudi Arabia would be happy to see crude rise to $80 (56.38 pounds) or even $100 a barrel, three industry sources said, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to the supply-cutting deal even though its original target is within sight. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other producers began to reduce supply in January 2017 in an attempt to erase a glut. They have extended the pact until December 2018 and meet in June to review policy. Few OPEC sources call for an exit strategy. Most officials are talking of introducing additional inventory metrics to assess the success of the deal, and of a need to support investment in new production to avert any supply crunch. The impression is that oil prices are seen as not yet high enough to encourage sufficient oil investment. Oil LCOc1 was trading above $74 on Thursday, having reached its highest since November 2014. After the technical meeting, a ministerial panel of OPEC and non-OPEC producers called the JMMC gathers in Jeddah on Friday.  The ministers are expected to discuss the five-year average inventory metric on Friday, though the JTC has made no recommendations on this, the sources said. OPEC’s Secretariat in Vienna will be tasked to prepare a study with different scenarios on inventories, market fundamentals and the risks which might impact market stability such as possible U.S. sanctions on Iran, one of the source said.

2018-04-19," (This April 13 story, corrects paragraph three to show investment is $50 million, not 50 million euros.) By Giancarlo Navach MILAN (Reuters) - Italian energy group Eni (ENI.MI) is considering stepping up its investment in nuclear fusion, potentially doubling down on a technology considered so uncertain that Eni remains the only global oil company prepared to place a bet on it. Eni and bigger rivals such as Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) have been looking at moving into renewable energy as climate change, the falling cost of solar and wind power and a shift to electric vehicles raise doubts over long-term demand for oil. Eni last month committed $50 million (35.24 million pounds) to one of several projects aiming to produce energy by fusing atoms at temperatures as hot as the sun, a process seen by doubters as still closer to science fiction than commercial reality. After the move, Eni’s head of development operations and technology, Roberto Casula, said it might raise its investment in Commonwealth Fusion System, a firm created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which is developing the project. “After the transition to renewable energy, the real breakthrough technologically is nuclear fusion,” Casula said, adding the process involved recreating the physics of the sun, producing heat but no emissions and very limited nuclear waste. Casula estimates it will cost $3 billion to develop a 200-megawatt fusion reactor by 2033 and says Commonwealth Fusion System is looking to raise more funds and to draw up an overall investment agreement with a range of financiers. Casula and MIT declined to give the size of Eni’s current stake, and the Eni executive could not say at this stage how much it would be ready to invest. He said Eni had signed a deal giving it the right to use the project’s intellectual property. “The eventual stake we’ll have in the company will be decided when there is an overall investment agreement, depending also on how much they will raise,” Casula said. The MIT project is vying with research teams in France, China and Britain to develop a reactor that can generate more energy than the enormous amount that fusion consumes, and can also safely contain a mass of super-hot gases or plasma. Italy also recently entered the race, though Eni is sticking with MIT, saying the Boston project is unique in its aim to produce electricity, while others have scientific objectives. All projects are based on a system known as tokamak, which uses superconducting magnets to hold the plasma at temperatures of up to 100 million degrees, suspending it inside a vacuum chamber without it touching the chamber’s walls. To make electricity, heat produced by the fusion of hydrogen isotopes is used to spin steam turbines in the conventional way. The France-based ITER project is the largest endeavour, with a budget of around 20 billion euros. A collaboration between Europe, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea, it is more than halfway towards the first test of its super-heated plasma by 2025 and first full-power fusion by 2035. Unlike the MIT project, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) team does not plan to generate electricity, saying this will be further in the future, and is being supported by governments rather than the private sector. “Based on our experience with the ITER project, we feel the MIT timeline to a power plant in 15 years is very ambitious, if not overly ambitious,” ITER chief scientist Tim Luce said. “But if they succeed, we will celebrate their success.” ITER director Bernard Bigot said nuclear fusion research and development were being driven mainly by governments, likening it to the early days of space technology and suggesting the time had yet to arrive when private investors would take the lead. “In fusion research we are only about in the 1960s, before anybody got to the moon,” Bigot said. MIT and Eni are more optimistic. The Boston-based team, which has built a bedroom-sized experimental tokamak reactor, plans to develop a larger-scale system of superconducting magnets within three years and build a fusion reactor within eight before finally, within 15 years, completing a nuclear-fusion power plant generating electricity. “Our goal is to do things even faster than that because it is a unique opportunity right now and with climate change we should be aggressive and ambitious,” said Bob Mumgaard, chief executive of MIT project company Commonwealth Fusion System. He said the MIT and ITER projects differed mainly in their magnet technologies, and that MIT’s system enabled it to contain plasma in a smaller chamber. “In fusion devices the magnetic field is very important and this will allow us to build a device which is one sixtieth the volume of ITER,” Mumgaard said, adding that MIT’s final-stage reactor would be the size of a basketball court. Though research into nuclear fusion dates to the 1950s, some scientists doubt the technology can become a commercial energy source within MIT’s 15-year timeframe. “The ability to make these components work in the desired way in the presence of such intense fields of irradiation ... is a very big challenge,” said Matteo Passoni, a nuclear engineer and expert on plasma physics at Milan’s Polytechnic University. For Eni, though, its investment in fusion represents a modest bet on a potentially big discovery, a familiar equation to its upstream division when it explores for oil and gas. “Arriving within 15-16 years at a commercial reactor is exactly the timeframe we use in upstream,” Casula said.

2018-04-19,"NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s power company said it had restored power to over 1.1 million homes and businesses by Thursday morning after a transmission line failure cut service to almost all of the island’s 3.4 million residents the day before. The Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, was working to restore power to the less than 30 percent of customers in the U.S. territory still without power after Wednesday morning’s blackout. The power line failure in southern Puerto Rico was the latest in a string of operational and political headaches for the bankrupt, storm-ravaged power utility. The utility has struggled to escape the headlines since Hurricane Maria wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico on Sept. 20. Maria, the worst storm to hit the island in 90 years, devastated Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, and thousands were still without power at the time of Wednesday’s blackout. PREPA said on Twitter that several power plants were back in service, including units at Central Aguirre, EcoElectrica, Central Costa Sur, Yabucoa and Palo Seco. The blackout was caused by the failure of a 230-kilovolt transmission line between the oil-fired Aguirre generating complex in Salinas and AES Corp’s coal-fired power plant in Guayama, PREPA said in a statement on Wednesday. PREPA estimated on Wednesday that it would take 24 to 36 hours to restore service to all customers that had power before Wednesday’s blackout. Before the outage, PREPA said 1.43 million homes and businesses had electric service. That is 97.2 percent of the utility's 1.47 million total customers. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2jYDF9s) Many of the remaining 40,000 customers have been without power since Hurricane Maria. PREPA has suffered several blackouts since the storm, including an outage last week affecting about 870,000 customers, and has been in bankruptcy since July, owing some $9 billion to mutual funds, hedge funds and other investors.

The Saudi index finished in positive territory for a sixth straight day, gaining 1.6 percent. Brent oil rose to nearly $75 a barrel on a drop in U.S. crude inventories and after sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia aims to push oil prices higher. Al Rajhi Bank rose 2.9 percent and Samba Financial Group 3.5 percent, while Saudi Arabian Mining Co (Ma’aden) advanced by 6.1 percent. Saudi stocks have been gathering momentum in recent months as investors anticipate foreign fund inflows when the kingdom joins emerging market indexes. Al Sagr Cooperative Insurance registered its heaviest trade since February last year, closing 4.7 percent higher, while Wala’a Cooperative Insurance gained 2.5 percent after the companies said they would consider a possible merger. The Qatari index rose by 1.6 percent, driven by a 5.1 percent climb in QNB after shareholders approved a previously proposed increase of its non-Qatari ownership limit to 49 percent from 25 percent and a rise in the amount a single investor can own to 5 percent from 2 percent. Abu Dhabi’s index closed 0.5 percent up. Dana Gas recovered from early losses to close flat. Shareholders have approved payment of a cash dividend for 2017, its first in several years. However, courts in Britain and the United Arab Emirates, ruling in the dispute over whether it must redeem $700 million of Islamic bonds, have given conflicting rulings on whether it can legally make the dividend payout. Dubai’s index finished 0.2 percent down as Dubai Islamic Bank fell 2 percent.

2018-04-19,"DUEKOUE, Ivory Coast (Reuters) - Faced with the prospect of losing all its forests, Ivory Coast has partnered with chocolate makers to try to halt the spread of cocoa plantations in protected national parks and reserves.  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, and major chocolate companies from Mars to Hershey to Barry Callebaut pledged last year to eliminate the production and sourcing of cocoa from protected forests. Stamping out deforestation in the cocoa supply chain is just one of the commitments made by the world’s chocolate makers to make the industry more sustainable, along with finding ways to end child labor and boost farmers’ incomes. If deforestation continues unabated, Ivory Coast risks losing all its forest cover by 2034, environmental campaigners say (See the Forest 500 Ivory Coast report here). The country's rapidly disappearing forests are home to Western chimpanzees, classified as critically endangered since 2016, forest elephants and the rare pygmy hippopotamus. Yet plans to end deforestation, a major threat to the long-term sustainability of the cocoa industry, face major hurdles.  Ivory Coast estimates 40 percent its cocoa comes from protected areas, providing livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of farmers and their families. Ethical certification schemes and Ivory Coast’s laws have failed so far to stop forests being replaced by plantations while eco-friendly farming alternatives are typically difficult and costly to implement on a large scale. Ivory Coast’s forests have been cut down to make way for agricultural products such as cocoa, palm oil and rubber for decades since the country’s independence from France in 1960. The decimation of its national parks and forests since the turn of the century, however, has shocked researchers and led to the agreement to end deforestation, which was signed at the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP23) in November. (See the agreement here) A study published in the journal Tropical Conservation Science in 2015 concluded that three-quarters of the land in five national parks and 18 forest reserves in Ivory Coast had been transformed for cocoa production. (See the study here) In a 2017 Mighty Earth investigation (here), the director of Ivory Coast's Forest Reserve protection agency (Sodefor) estimated that 40 percent of the country's cocoa came from protected areas. Almost half the 34,000-hectare Mont Peko National Park had been converted to cocoa by 2015, data from the environmental campaign group seen by Reuters shows. Marahoue National Park had lost 40 percent of its forest by the same year. One contributing factor was the outbreak of civil war in Ivory Coast in 2002. The country was split for a decade between a rebel-held north and government-controlled south, with the forest regions in the west home to several armed groups. Many park rangers and forest officials abandoned their posts, allowing warlords to move in and parcel off fertile forest land ideal for cocoa production to locals and immigrants alike, accelerating the deforestation. Despite an end to the war in 2011, many of the lucrative fiefdoms carved out by former rebels remain in place. Attractive world cocoa prices also encouraged farmers to move deeper into protected forests, helping Ivory Coast consolidate its position as the world’s biggest cocoa grower ahead of neighboring Ghana. The deforestation agreement was signed by Ivory Coast and Ghana along with 24 trading firms and chocolate makers, including Ferrero, Nestle, Lindt, Mondelez, Ritter Sport, Olam, Cargill. A number of chocolate makers have committed separately to ensuring none of the beans they buy come from deforested areas by 2030. The details of the plan have yet to be worked out but cocoa exporters are pinning hopes on global positioning system (GPS) mapping and relationships with cooperatives producing beans under certified schemes such as the Rainforest Alliance. The idea is to trace all cocoa back to the farm where it was produced to prevent beans grown illegally in national parks and protected forests getting into the chocolate supply chain. “We believe cooperatives are the best driver,” said Lionel Soulard, Africa director for Cargill, the region’s top exporter. “It starts with ... GPS mapping the farmers, then making sure we can trace where (the cocoa) comes from and how we can prove it comes from there,” he told Reuters in an interview in Ivory Coast’s main city of Abidjan in February. Ivory Coast’s government is due to publish up-to-date maps on forest cover and land use for different forests, along with data on cocoa farmers and communities that depend on the forests, by the end of the year. The government has committed to beefing up surveillance of its forest reserves and applying sanctions for any new infringements by the middle of the year at the latest.  Ivory Coast is also coming up with a plan to restore its national forests and develop models for sustainable agro-forestry, a model that aims to restore forest cover while also allowing cocoa production to continue in protected areas.  “It’s a lot of work,” said Jean Claude Koya, a specialist on sustainable development for Ivory Coast’s government. “Some of these forests are so degraded there’s nothing we can do ... but some can still be saved.” To halt deforestation, Ivory Coast may be forced to kick out hundreds of thousands of farmers out of forests and find alternative livelihoods for them. To prove the provenance of all cocoa, every smallholder’s farm would need to be mapped and every cocoa bean tracked from farm to port.  But tracing where cocoa comes from is tricky and the supply chain is prone to manipulation. Reports by Mighty Earth and others have shown that cocoa farmed in national parks still ends being sold by cooperatives to large cocoa traders. Certification schemes such as Rainforest Alliance are meant to ensure cocoa sold under the brand has not come from illegal farming in protected forests, but sustainability experts acknowledge the schemes are not foolproof. In Duekoue, a town in west Ivory Coast surrounded by cocoa farms and thick bush, members of three cooperatives told Reuters that it was common for beans grown in protected forests to be mixed with cocoa from farms considered sustainable. “There are weaknesses in the system. Companies may think they’re buying certified cocoa but there’s some jiggery-pokery going on,” Edward Millard, Rainforest Alliance director for Africa and South Asia, told Reuters. “You do the best you can, but there are risks in any system of verification.” Attempts by the government to crack down on illegal cocoa farming since a second civil war in 2011 defused the country’s political crisis have also foundered, partly because of inertia and corruption. In the past, Ivorian authorities tended to respond to encroachment on protected areas by sending agents to forcibly remove farmers and destroy their crops. Park authorities evicted thousands of illegal cocoa farmers from Mont Peko in 2016, destroying cocoa trees and settlements. But no alternative livelihoods were on offer and many cocoa farmers returned afterwards. (See the story here) Farmers interviewed by Reuters in the Scio reserve said agents from Sodefor often came to remove them from the forest, but always ended up accepting bribes instead to let them stay. Ivory Coast’s Minister of Water and Forests Alain-Richard Donwahi declined a Reuters interview. A ministry spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions. Cargill’s head of cocoa sustainability Taco Terheijden thinks kicking farmers out of forests is undesirable unless alternative livelihoods can be found.  “If hundreds of thousands of farmers are to be expelled, I would not want to be responsible for ... a social disaster,” he said. “If we expel them out of their own source of cocoa, we need to make sure there’s an alternative available.” Last year, the Ivorian government began drafting plans to legalize cocoa plantations in some forests and reserves, creating so-called protected agroforests where new trees are planted while farmers continue to grow cocoa.  Under this model, trees are threaded through crops, helping shade cocoa plants while also doing less harm to biodiversity and keeping the soil fertile for longer. This strategy could help Ivory Coast curb deforestation without evicting farmers or slashing cocoa output, which provides more than half the country’s export revenue. But Ivory Coast’s aim to roll out agro-forestry on 2 million hectares of protected reserves is likely to prove costly and neither the government nor the cocoa industry have yet committed to footing the bill.  “Rolling out agro-forestry in 6 million hectares, wow that’s expensive,” said Etelle Higonnet of conservation watchdog Mighty Earth, referring to the amount of land devoted to cocoa in West Africa as a whole. “You can’t ask farmers to foot the bill. The companies have to stump up”.

2018-04-19,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Lyft Inc is launching a programme on Thursday to offset emissions from the 1.4 million cars that drive for the U.S. ride-hailing service by investing in projects to reduce other sources of greenhouse gas, the company said. The move comes as Lyft and Uber Technologies Inc , as well as bike-share and scooter-renting startups, face scrutiny for clogging city streets and sidewalks, worsening traffic.  The company will purchase carbon “offsets” to support projects such as renewable energy and reforestation, balancing the carbon impact of every mile driven by a car working for Lyft, including the miles driven to pick up a passenger. That will be a multi-million dollar investment in the first year and the cost will rise as Lyft grows.  “This in a sense puts a tax on ourselves to continue to move toward shared rides and lower emission vehicles,” said Lyft Co-founder and President John Zimmer in an interview. The company declined to provide a precise dollar amount for the programme. Lyft drivers completed 376 million rides in 2017, accounting for well over a billion miles, according to the company. Lyft said in a statement it is working with environmental firm 3Degrees, which sources carbon reduction projects. Lyft will tap its more than $4 billion in venture capital funding to pay for the carbon offsets. Zimmer said the project took on a heightened sense of urgency since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this month moved to ease Obama-era vehicle emissions standards. Initial carbon-offset projects funded by Lyft include an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emission from an auto parts factory in Michigan by using alternative materials and recycling transformer oil in Ohio. “It’s really important that we know what the projects are, that they are real and tangible and that they would not have happened otherwise,” Zimmer said. Lyft’s carbon-neutral effort is the latest example of a Silicon Valley company working to mitigate some of the harm its services have caused. This week, Airbnb announced its Office of Healthy Tourism, aimed at easing crowding from tourism that has plagued cities such as Barcelona and Amsterdam, a problem exacerbated by Airbnb. San Francisco’s city attorney last year issued subpoenas to Lyft and Uber for records of driving practices amid concerns the companies had created traffic hazards. Zimmer acknowledged “traffic is a major issue” and said the company also has plans to invest in electric autonomous vehicles and expand its carpooling service.

2018-04-19,"MUMBAI, April 19 (Reuters) - India’s central bank could take a more hawkish tone starting as early as June despite easing inflation, minutes of the monetary policy committee’s (MPC) meeting that took place this month showed. The Reserve Bank of India's MPC members flagged several concerns here, including an increase in minimum support prices for farmers and high and volatile crude oil prices, the minutes released on Thursday showed. Viral Acharya, a deputy governor at the central bank and a member of the panel, said he would “decisively” vote for a beginning of “withdrawal of accommodation” in the next monetary policy meeting in June, adding that it was also important to see some data on growth. “Reinforcement of inflation-targeting credibility that such a shift would signal is crucial in my view for prudent macroeconomic management, on both the domestic and external sector fronts,” Acharya said. The Reserve Bank of India this month kept its policy repo rate unchanged at 6 percent for the fourth straight meeting and retained its “neutral” stance. While five MPC members had voted in favour of the decision, one -  Michael Patra - recommended a quarter percentage point hike in the repo rate. Echoing Acharya, Patra said that despite ebbing inflation in the past few months, an easier or neutral monetary policy stance would delay achieving the inflation target. “Underlying macroeconomic developments impart some urgency to commencing the withdrawal of accommodation,” Patra said. The central bank’s medium-term inflation target has been set at 4 percent. “The minutes of the MPC’s meeting have a distinctly hawkish tinge as compared to our reading of the statement itself,” said Aditi Nayar, the principal economist of rating agency ICRA. “While incoming data and policy decisions related to factors such as MSPs, excise on fuels and expenditure announcements remain critical, today’s minutes suggest that a back-ended rate hike in 2018 remains a possibility, if headline inflation exceeds the trajectory set out by the MPC. “As a result, bond yields are likely to harden in the immediate term.” Data released after the monetary policy meeting showed retail inflation rate eased to 4.28 percent in March -  a number that has been moderating since it hit a 17-month high of 5.2 percent in December. During the policy meeting, the central bank lowered its April-September inflation projection to 4.7-5.1 percent, from a previous range of 5.1-5.6 percent that it released in February. For the second half of this fiscal year, the MPC said it saw inflation at 4.4 percent, but that was without taking into account any increase from higher housing allowances to government employees.

2018-04-19,"ASUNCION (Reuters) - The son of a key figure in Paraguay’s 1954-1989 dictatorship is expected to easily win the presidency in Sunday’s election, but his party is projected to lose seats in Congress, complicating  his business-friendly legislative agenda. Mario Abdo, of the ruling conservative Colorado party, promises to fight pressure to raise taxes on the country’s key farm sector despite opposition calls for a levy on soybean exports. Recent polls show him ahead by about 25 points over his rival Efrain Alegre, a lawyer from the centrist GANAR coalition. “Both candidates respect Paraguay’s trajectory in terms of macroeconomic stability, and I think that is positive,” former Finance Minister Manuel Ferreira told Reuters. Abdo, a 46-year-old former senator, supports the current structure of low taxes and exemptions aimed at stimulating  foreign investment and agricultural production in Paraguay, the world’s No. 4 soybean exporter and a major supplier of beef. He is the U.S.-educated son of the private secretary of  dictator Alfredo Stroessner, who ruled Paraguay with an iron hand for 35 years. But Abdo’s commitment to democracy has not been questioned. Paraguay’s economy has grown in recent years, social welfare programs have been small and the poverty rate among the country’s 6.8 million population is 26.4 percent. “I see two conservative, democratic platforms that do not put institutions at risk,” said political analyst Alfredo Boccia. “But I do not see a change in the old and tiresome Paraguayan politics that would make things different.”     The next president will govern for five years, without the possibility of reelection.     Alegre has focused on his promise of slashing electricity bills to take better advantage of Paraguay’s large-scale Itaipu and Yacyreta hydroelectric plants.      The polls indicate that after Sunday’s general election the Colorado Party will end up with fewer seats than it has today in Congress, while the leftist Frente Guasu coalition, led by former president Fernando Lugo, will make a strong advance.     If elected, Abdo may have to make concessions to form alliances that give him manoeuvrability in Congress. “The executive will have to exert tremendous leadership to bring together the different sectors to support his proposals,” said the president of the Association of Banks of Paraguay, Beltran Macchi.     About 4.2 million Paraguayans are eligible to vote in the election, which will also renew all seats in Congress and 17 governorships across the country.

Chinese companies are seizing opportunities in the Gulf as the world’s second-biggest economy seeks to expand its influence overseas with its ambition to rebuild Silk Road trade routes. Last year, five Chinese companies from Jiangsu province set up base in the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad) to build various industries with an initial investment of $300 million. Since then, 10 Chinese companies have invested in Kizad, taking the total number of companies to 15 and value of investments to $1 billion, Mohamed Juma al Shamsi, chief executive of Abu Dhabi Ports told a business forum. Abu Dhabi Ports Co manages Kizad as well as the ports in the emirate. “Given the interest of Chinese companies, we expect more investments to flow,” al Shamsi said. Three new companies in the chemicals, construction and oil sectors signed agreements on Thursday to invest and set up businesses in Kizad. A new investment law that will allow 100 percent ownership to foreign companies outside of free zones in the UAE is expected before the end of this year, encouraging more Chinese firms to invest, said He Song, Economic & Commercial Counsellor, Embassy of China in the UAE. The UAE is China’s largest non-oil trading partner and an important gateway to Europe and Africa, he said, adding many Chinese companies were awaiting the UAE’s new investment law. Currently, foreign companies can own only up to a 49 percent stake in a company in the UAE, but are allowed 100 percent ownership in free zones.

2018-04-19," LONDON (Reuters) - Last October, at the height of a political crisis in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, a letter arrived at the Iraqi oil ministry in Baghdad from Igor Sechin, head of Kremlin oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM). The Baghdad government was showing a “lack of constructive position and interest” about Rosneft’s offer to develop southern Iraqi oilfields, Sechin wrote in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Kurdistan, a region of about 6 million people in northern Iraq, had just tried and failed to break away from the rest of the country. Baghdad had dismissed the Sept. 25 independence referendum and sent in troops to seize control of key oilfields - Kurdistan’s main source of income. Now Sechin, one of the closest allies of President Vladimir Putin, said that given Baghdad’s reluctance to work with Rosneft, his firm would instead do business with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which showed “a higher interest in expanding strategic cooperation”. Global powers including the United States and European Union, which had previously expressed sympathy with the Kurdish independence drive, would eventually reassure Baghdad they recognized its sovereignty over the whole of Iraq, including Kurdistan. But there was no hint of such conciliation in Sechin’s letter. Rosneft had pledged to invest billions of dollars in Kurdistan to the anger of the Baghdad government. Now, instead of backing off, it was doubling down. And Sechin held a stronger hand than many Iraqi officials realized, according to seven sources familiar with the matter. Days before, Rosneft had taken over ownership of landlocked Kurdistan’s oil export pipelines to Turkey from the KRG in return for $1.8 billion. The aim of the deal for Rosneft was not only commercial, but to cement Russia’s political influence in Iraq and the Middle East, according to the Rosneft, oil industry, Kurdish and Iraqi government sources. (For a graphic showing Kurdistan's oil map, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2gq0Gk4) Control of the pipelines has given Rosneft a central role in ongoing talks between the KRG and Baghdad aimed at resuming full oil exports, which were disrupted by the referendum and Iraqi seizure of oilfields, said the sources. Kurdistan has large oil reserves - possibly a third of Iraq’s total - and its exports are vital to both the regional and national economies. In a sign of Rosneft’s influence, Kurdish officials have said they will not restart oil flows and transfer funds raised to the Iraqi government unless pipeline transit fees are paid to the Russian oil major, according to three industry sources in Erbil and Baghdad. Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi effectively recognized the firm’s growing role in Kurdistan when he met Sechin’s right-hand man Didier Casimiro in Baghdad this month and said he was ready to cooperate with Rosneft “in renovating pipelines”. Rosneft, Sechin, the Kremlin and the Iraq’s prime minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment on this story. Sechin and the Kremlin have repeatedly said Rosneft’s projects are purely commercial, not political. The Iraqi oil ministry declined to comment on any political aspects of the Rosneft deal. Rosneft’s actions in Kurdistan, a region long allied to the United States, provide an insight into how the Kremlin uses Rosneft - and its bold chief executive - as an instrument of Russian foreign policy across the world, from Erbil to Caracas and New Delhi, the sources said. Many countries, including Italy and France, have used their oil majors as tools of foreign policy, but Moscow’s use of Rosneft in this way has increased significantly over the past two decades under Putin’s rule. For Kurdistan, Russia’s growing influence represents a sharp geopolitical reversal. The region has been closely aligned to the United States since the toppling of Saddam Hussein during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.  Amos Hochstein, who served as the U.S. Special Energy Envoy in the Obama administration, said while Rosneft and other Russian state firms sought to make profits, they also acted as a political entities when necessary. “They report directly to President Putin. Not every transaction that they do is political. But when Putin wants to perform a political transaction, they will definitely do it,” he told Reuters. “Russia doesn’t have a lot of tools to exercise political influence, and energy is the most efficient one”.     Baghdad, which does not recognize the deal for the pipelines, has found itself in a difficult situation. The Iraqi government’s finances have been strained by its battle with Islamic State so it has little money to build new pipelines from Kurdistan, while it is loath to significantly disrupt the region’s oil flows, which it is banking on to deliver much-needed revenue. The role played by Rosneft in furthering Kremlin foreign policy is not unique to Iraq and has also played out in other parts of the world, according to the Rosneft and industry sources. “Sechin behaves like a second Russian foreign minister. Or to put it differently, he represents the economic might behind Russian foreign policies,” said one of the industry sources, an acquaintance of the Rosneft boss. “Very often these policies are about poking the Americans right in the eye.” In Venezuela, Rosneft lent around $6 billion to support the government. The company could end up owning large Texan refineries, currently belonging to Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, because the plants are collateral against the debt. In India, Rosneft invested $13 billion in a refinery – an abnormally high price for an oil processing complex – as it sought to outbid Saudi firm Aramco and boost Russian ties with the country, traditionally allied with the United States. Sechin said earlier this year in a rare interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung he was confident that both Venezuela and Kurdistan would repay their debts in full and denied the deals were political. Asked if he saw himself as a politician, the 57-year-old responded: “It is a difficult question. It often feels like I have already lived several different lives. “I think the right word is a manager.” Born in St Petersburg, he was sent in the 1980s to act as a military interpreter in Mozambique and Angola, where Moscow and Washington were fighting proxy wars. Putin, who had known Sechin since the early 1990s in St Petersburg, took him to Moscow when he rose to power. Sechin helped him nationalize much of the Russian oil industry and was appointed Rosneft CEO in 2012. The Kurds have long argued that as an autonomous region of Iraq they have the authority to make agreements with foreign companies about pumping oil in their territory. In 2014, they started independent oil exports via Turkey. Iraq’s central government, however, says any Kurdish deals with overseas firms, or to export oil from Kurdistan, are illegal without Baghdad’s blessing.    Russia was the only major world power that did not oppose the referendum, saying it understood Kurdish aspirations for independence. The United States, EU, Turkey and Iran all urged Erbil to cancel or postpone the vote in the weeks before it. As U.S. State Secretary Rex Tillerson unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a delay to the independence vote, Sechin was busy negotiating the pipelines deal. In the days following the referendum, Kurdish officials including natural resources minister Ashti Hawrami were flown to Moscow to meet Rosneft executives and Russian foreign ministry officials, according to two of the sources. On Oct. 20, at the peak of the post-referendum chaos when Iraqi Shiite militia backed by Iranian troops ousted Kurdish Peshmerga forces from Kirkuk oilfields, Sechin closed the deal. Rosneft paid the last tranche of the $1.8 billion deal sum to Erbil, the sources said. Rosneft and Sechin, both subject to Western sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea, have never disclosed how much the company paid for the pipelines.

2018-04-19,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: NT gas fields, pipelines: tmsnrt.rs/2JRs18Z By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 19 (Reuters) - The decision by the government of Australia’s Northern Territory government to allow the resumption of fracking for natural gas will do little to immediately solve the country’s energy woes, but will likely sharpen political battle lines. The territory’s government said on April 17 that it has lifted a near two-year moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, accepting the recommendations of its own commission of inquiry into the practice. Northern Territory is a vast, sparsely-populated 1.4 million square kilometre (540,000 square mile) part of central and northern Australia, and home to two potentially rich basins of natural gas. The remote region is ruled by the centre-left Labor Party, which is in opposition at a federal level. The Labor Party also controls state governments in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. The decision to permit fracking, subject to rigorous regulation, came as a surprise to many observers, given the opposition of many Labor supporters to this method of natural gas production. The territory government was elected on a platform of placing a moratorium on fracking and holding an inquiry into whether it was safe and what were the environmental risks. In some ways the territory’s commission merely confirmed what other similar inquiries in Australia have already found, namely that the risks of fracking can be managed with robust regulation. The government of New Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner must have known, however, that allowing the resumption of fracking would alienate part of its support base, and make it a target for well-funded, well-organised green activists. The natural gas industry has welcomed the lifting of the moratorium and Australian energy major Origin Energy said it aimed to resume plans “as soon as practical” to drill and frack the Beetaloo Basin, which the company says contains as much as 6.6 trillion cubic feet in reserves. Such a level of natural gas reserves would provide a welcome boost to Australia, which is struggling to balance the needs of three large liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants in Queensland with the demands for cheap and reliable supplies from industry and consumers along the populous east coast. It’s this dynamic that is creating political headaches for both state governments and the centre-right Liberal Party of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The natural gas industry maintains there is no actual shortage of the fuel, but says that to ensure that this situation continues, the states and territories will have to permit exploration and production. Currently, four states - New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia - have either bans or moratoriums on at least some forms of natural gas exploration and production. It remains to be seen whether NT’s decision to lift its fracking moratorium will encourage other jurisdictions to do the same, but any politician considering this will be aware of the furious reaction it would generate from environmental activists. The other issue for Australia is that domestic natural gas prices have risen sharply, and are now trading more in line with Asian spot LNG prices. The price of natural gas at the Wallumbilla hub in Queensland, as assessed by Argus Media, was $5.77 per million British thermal units last week, while spot Asian LNG LNG-AS was $7.25. Once the cost of the LNG is netted back to the hub, the two prices are more or less in line, meaning Australia’s domestic customers are paying for their natural gas at values linked to international prices. This is a shift from what happened prior to the three LNG plants being built in Queensland, when domestic natural gas was cheaper and generally sold in long-term contracts. Adding natural gas from the territory to Australia’s supply mix may help lower prices for both feedstock for the LNG plants and domestic customers, but the point is that this extra production is still several years away. In the meantime, pressure is going to mount on domestic natural gas suppliers and consumers, leading to political fallout and seemingly odd solutions, such as bringing a floating re-gasification ship to Melbourne and importing LNG. It seems ludicrous that Australia, which will overtake Qatar as the world’s top exporter of LNG once the last of eight new projects comes online later this year, will turn to importing the super-chilled fuel in order to meet domestic demand. It seems logical to develop onshore natural gas resources rather than import LNG, but this ignores the increasing influence of environmental activists, who are committed to ending all fossil fuel production in favour of renewable energy. While some green groups ignore the scientific evidence that supports fracking, others simply shift to say that natural gas production contributes to climate change and should be banned for this reason. Any company engaged in fracking in Australia can expect to be targeted by activists, which may deter some oil and gas companies, given they have become increasingly publicity shy. The end result of the Northern Territory’s decision to allow fracking may be some additional natural gas supply. But it will certainly up the political temperature and raise the risks of populist policies triumphing over cheap energy supplies that are cleaner than Australia’s existing coal-dominated power plants.

2018-04-19,"* Oil highest in over 3 yrs on report Saudis want higher prices * Nickel sees biggest jump in 6-1/2 years on sanctions worries * Risk of inflationary pulse a drag for fixed-income bonds * Wall Street digesting Blackstone earnings drop * Dollar mostly range-bound, Aussie weathers weak jobs data By Marc Jones LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Talk that Saudi Arabia has its sights on $80-$100 a barrel oil again and of more U.S. sanctions on Russia ignited a rally in commodities and resource stocks on Thursday, though the potential boost to inflation hit fixed-income assets. It was set to be the strongest day for the commodity complex in eight months as Brent crude futures climbed past $74 a barrel after a near 3 percent jump overnight. The surge came on a Reuters report that OPEC’s new price hawk Saudi Arabia would be happy for crude to rise to $80 or even $100, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to a supply-cutting deal even though the agreement’s original target is now within sight. The leap in oil combined with fears that sanctions on Russia could hit supplies of other commodities to light a fire under the entire sector. Nickel jumped the most in 6-1/2 years on talk Nornickel - the world’s second-biggest producer of the metal - could be impacted. Aluminium prices reached their highest since 2011, its raw material alumina touching an all-time peak before retreating when Russia floated the idea of a temporary nationalisation of sanctions-hit giant Rusal. “It has been a very erratic day, it’s a bit crazy,” said Rabobank metals sector economist Casper Burgering. “Nickel went up by almost 10 pct and aluminium by almost 8 percent and now are coming right back down.” Expect more volatility, he said. Such increases, if sustained though, could fuel inflationary pressures and investors hedged by selling sovereign bonds. Yields on U.S. two-year Treasuries stood at levels last visited in 2008 at 2.43 percent and 10-year German yields went above 0.57 percent for the first time in almost a month. “Saudi Arabia wants higher oil prices and yes, probably for the IPO, but it isn’t just that,” an OPEC source told Reuters. “Look at the economic reforms and projects they want to do, and the war in Yemen. How are they going to pay for all that? They need higher prices.” OPEC and its partners next meet formally on June 22 but a ministerial monitoring panel will gather in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Friday and are expected to make noises about the broader supply and demand in the oil market. Resource stocks were the big winners from Thursday’s romp higher in prices. Chinese blue chips ended up 1.1 percent and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.9 percent, with energy up more than 2.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei faded late in the day to end up 0.15 percent, but basic materials and utilities both climbed more than 2 percent. Industrial and commodities-focused stocks also led the pack in Europe though the pan-regional STOXX 600 showed signs of fatigue after a two-day rally that had taken it to a six-week high. The bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down. Investors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were pointing to a broadly steady start in New York later where traders were already digesting the latest flurry of earnings including from Blackstone and Philip Morris. Wall Street had also seen hefty gains in the energy and industrial indexes late on Wednesday, though that was offset by softness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials. IBM’s 7.5 percent drop was the biggest drag on the S&P after the technology company’s quarterly profit margins missed Wall Street targets. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar remained rangebound - its index barely budged at 89.59. It gained a touch on the yen to 107.46 yen, but stayed short of recent peaks at 107.78. The euro hovered at $1.2373, within striking distance of the week’s top of $1.2413, while Turkey’s lira shuffled back having had its best day in more than a year on Wednesday after President Tayyip Erdogan declared early elections. “The conventional wisdom is that (political) stability, even if it is not the form that you might choose, allows investment flows to continue.” said Tom Clarke, a cross-asset co-portfolio manager at William Blair Funds. The strength in commodity prices helped the Australian dollar easily weather unexpectedly soft jobs data, with employment rising by a meagre 4,900 in March. Figures out from New Zealand had also showed annual inflation there had slowed to just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, underlining expectations that interest rates would remain at record lows for many more months to come. A soft Swiss franc stayed near the 1.20 to the euro mark it used to be capped at by the country’s central bank, while the recently-revitalised pound held its ground despite weak British retail sales data.

2018-04-19,"LUANDA (Reuters) - A front page complains that the city traffic lights do not work, audiences laugh a little louder at risky political gags, and a policeman admits mistakes were made. After decades of iron rule in Angola, there are signs of a softer touch. For sure, institutions from public media to the courts remain weak and the state almost all-powerful, but President João Lourenço appears to be easing the grip held by his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who governed for 38 years including nearly three decades of civil war. Since taking over last September, Lourenço has promised to revive an economy battered by lower oil prices and tackle  corruption. He also said he would nurture civil liberties. Greater transparency in what was one of Africa’s most secretive states could help restore investor confidence in the continent’s second largest crude producer. Lourenço is already being tested.  On a recent Saturday in a poor and polluted corner of Luanda, around 70 men took to the streets, waving placards and chanting for the removal of a local government chief. Just 8 months ago, this would have been unthinkable. “Now with the new government there is a certain margin, a certain liberty and we are using that to make ourselves heard,” said Denilson Alexandre, a 26-year-old accountancy student. State news organisations covered the demonstration without labelling protesters dangerous delinquents. National papers increasingly write about the lack of medication in hospitals or functioning traffic lights in Luanda. State television and radio invite guests from opposition parties to discuss policy. In a recent radio debate, callers lambasted a police commander as he repeatedly apologised for the heavy-handed tactics of the past and guaranteed the force was working to correct errors. “We want our public media to actually serve the public, and not the government,” Social Communications Minister João Melo told Reuters. For Melo the opening is not just right, it is also vital for the ruling MPLA party to regain relevance and reverse haemorrhaging support. The party may have governed Angola uninterruptedly since independence from Portugal in 1975, but since regular elections were introduced in 2008 its share of the vote has tumbled from 82 percent to 61 percent – though the opposition contests those results. So far, Lourenço’s popularity has soared. Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president, has been sacked as chair of the state oil company Sonangol and her half-brother Jose Filomeno dos Santos has been charged for attempted fraud. But critics wonder if openness will continue if anti-government criticism mounts or once Lourenço secures the party presidency, a position still held by dos Santos. “The press is freer, but there’s no guarantee it will stay this way,” said Teixeira Candido, head of Angola’s journalist union, explaining the president still appoints the board of state media organizations. The president also remains seemingly beyond criticism.  When his convoy hit a 13-year-old girl in the province of Cabinda in November, far from causing a scandal, local media applauded Lourenço for organising her transfer to a private clinic in Luanda. “Adolescent crashes into government caravan,” read the headline on state news agency Angop. Minister Melo accepts there is still much work to do. He hopes to see state media entirely independent and said the government would seek to change laws, such as against insulting public officials, used to prosecute journalists and activists. “It’s all just window dressing,” said Rafael Marques, an activist and journalist currently on trial for allegedly insulting the former prosecutor general with a story about an illegal land grab. “Why don’t the stories dig into who’s to blame for the traffic lights not working, or for the hospitals having no medication? Why aren’t people being sacked?” he asked.   “It’s not because the journalists aren’t intelligent enough, I know them… It’s manipulation - period.” Angolans do, however, seem to view their government and president with less fear, making Tiago Costa’s work as a stand-up that little bit easier. “I’m still making the same political jokes, but people are happier to laugh than they were before,” he said. “They’ve stopped being afraid.” At the protest in Luanda, receding fear is palpable.  “We will keep pushing for more,” Alexandre said. “We’ll be back every month until we see change.” ",https://uk.reuters.com/article/angola-politics-reform/angolans-laugh-a-little-louder-as-iron-grip-loosens-idUKL8N1RV2A0,19 Apr 2018,"A front page complains that the

2018-04-19,"AMSTERDAM, April 19 (Reuters) - Large production cuts at its vast Groningen gas field turned the Netherlands into a net importer of gas last year for the first time since the 1950s, the Dutch national statistics office said Thursday. The Dutch have been one of the major gas suppliers in Europe for decades, exploiting what once was Europe’s largest gas field in the northern region of Groningen. But they have rapidly shrunk production in recent years, as a string of earthquakes directly related to gas extraction damaged thousands of houses and buildings. Production at the Groningen field has been cut by 60 percent since its 2013 peak of 53.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, and the Dutch government last month said it would phase out production by 2030. Last year, total production at all Dutch gas fields decreased by 13 percent to the equivalent of 1,390 petajoules, Statistics Netherlands said, while imports rose by nearly a fifth to 1,613 petajoules. The fourth consecutive drop in production meant foreign supply overtook domestic gas for the time since Dutch production began in the 1950s. The growing demand for foreign gas was mainly met by Norway, which saw its export to the Netherlands rise by a third in 2017. The considerably smaller stream of British gas to the Netherlands increased by 44 percent.

2018-04-19,"(Reuters) - Weir Group Plc (WEIR.L), which makes pumps and valves for the mining and energy industries, said it had agreed to buy ESCO Corp. for $1 billion as it looks to bolster its mining business. Weir shares rose as much as 6.6 percent to 2,258 pence on the news. ESCO shareholders will receive 59 percent of the deal value in cash, the remainder in new Weir shares. Weir plans to place about 16.7 million shares, or about 7.4 percent of its share capital, to partly fund the deal. Portland, Oregon-based ESCO, which has an enterprise value of $1.29 billion, makes parts for surface mining and construction industries, including ground engaging tools to move earth. Equipment makers like Weir have benefited from higher commodity prices as mining companies boost spending and explore brownfield projects. French tyre maker Michelin (MICP.PA) a month ago said it planned to buy British engineer Fenner FENR.L for 1.2 billion pounds ($1.7 billion), to better serve miners and benefit from an industry recovery. “We are acquiring a high quality business at the right time, with the market in the early stages of its recovery, providing opportunities for long-term growth,” Weir’s Chief Executive Officer Jon Stanton said. The company expects ESCO to accelerate Weir’s portfolio development through the expansion of opportunities for parts and components for mining equipments. The deal is expected to add to earnings per share in the first full year post completion, expected in early third quarter, Weir said. ESCO is expected to generate revenue of about $675 million and pro-forma adjusted earning before interest, tax and amortization of about $80 million in 2018, Weir said.”Strategically, this is the right thing for Weir to be doing,” Jefferies analyst Andy Douglas said, adding that acquisition looked “very solid” and the company had not overpaid. Weir also said it would start a process to sell its flow- control division, which designs and manufactures process pumps and valves for power, oil and gas industries. The flow-control business contributed $365 million pounds in revenue, or about 15.5 percent of its total revenue, last year. The 147 year-old company said its first-quarter orders rose 22 percent, with orders in its mining business increasing more than 13 percent. Oil and gas orders rose more than 50 percent, helped by higher demand for pressure pumping equipment in North America. Weir maintained its full-year growth outlook for revenue and profit, on a constant currency basis.

2018-04-19,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Survey results: tmsnrt.rs/2Hdyw4e * Business cycles: tmsnrt.rs/2JapXYP By John Kemp LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Energy market professionals estimate there is a 40 percent chance of the U.S. economy entering recession before the end of next year, rising to a little over 50 percent before the end of 2020. The results are based on a survey sent by Reuters to 7,000 energy market professionals between April 13 and April 17, with responses received from 700 (tmsnrt.rs/2Hdyw4e). There is a wide dispersion of views, and most see only a low risk of recession in 2018, but the assessed probability increases significantly in 2019 and especially 2020. The state of the global economy is one of the most important drivers for oil consumption and prices, so the economic outlook is crucial to the calculations of OPEC and other oil suppliers. The United States now accounts for less than one-fifth of global economic activity, but the rest of the world is unlikely to grow strongly if the United States is in recession, so it makes a useful proxy for global growth. Predicting turning points in the economic and trade cycles is notoriously difficult, but the current global expansion shows increasing signs of maturity and escalating trade tensions create clear downside risks. OPEC and its allies, as well as other oil producers, need to incorporate the increasing probability of a U.S. recession and global slowdown when projecting oil consumption and prices in 2019 and 2020. The current U.S. economic expansion started in July 2009 and is already 106 months old, according to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (tmsnrt.rs/2JapXYP). The current expansion will become the second-longest on record next month, surpassing the long boom of the 1960s. If the economy is still expanding in July 2019, it will become the longest on record, passing the long boom of the 1990s. The U.S. expansion is part of a synchronised global upturn in industrial activity and trade that is lifting consumption of oil and other commodities. The global economy continues to display broad-based momentum and is predicted to remain healthy in 2018 and 2019, according to the International Monetary Fund. World output increased by 3.8 percent in 2017 and is forecast to rise by 3.9 percent in both 2018 and 2019 (“Global economy: good news for now but trade tensions a threat”, IMF, April 17). Global trade volumes increased last year at the fastest rate since 2011, when the global economy was still rebounding from the financial crisis, according to the World Trade Organisation. The WTO forecasts trade will grow nearly as fast in 2018 and 2019, which would be the best run of growth since before the financial crisis (“Strong growth in 2008 rests on policy choices”, WTO, April 12). The current cyclical expansion has considerable momentum in the short term, which should ensure that it continues in the short term, but there is increased anxiety about whether it will be sustained in 2019 and 2020. Both the WTO and the IMF have warned about potential downside risks arising from increasing trade tensions between the United States and China. The recent exchange of tariff threats between Washington and Beijing contains a substantial element of bluffing so it is hard to estimate the risks that the threats will turn into an actual trade war. But even if the tariffs are never imposed, the increased uncertainty could have a damaging impact on business confidence and investment plans. Survey respondents were evenly divided about whether the trade tensions would have a damaging impact on global growth. Some 48 percent thought trade tensions would harm growth between 2018 and 2020, which also implies 52 percent thought they would not or were unsure. Respondents from North America were slightly less concerned than those in other regions, about the effect of trade threats, with only 45 percent thinking they would prove harmful. In contrast, respondents from other regions put the probability of trade tensions damaging global growth marginally higher at 53 percent. U.S. respondents may be more sanguine about the use of tariff threats as a negotiating tactic and/or that tariffs would benefit the domestic economy. Respondents from the rest of the world are slightly more worried, perhaps more concerned about the risk of miscalculation and the damage to confidence.

2018-04-19,"LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria plans to overhaul its energy tariff system by 2021 to try to attract investment and improve power supply, the vice chairman of the country’s electricity regulator said. Only about half of the 190 million people in Africa’s most populous country have access to power. The problem has been exacerbated by prices that are capped below what it costs to generate and deliver power. Nigeria’s ailing power infrastructure, which forces businesses and households to run costly fuel generators, is often blamed for hobbling growth and is likely to be major issue in campaigning ahead of next February’s presidential election. Sanusi Garba, vice chairman of the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), told a panel at the Developing Market Associates’ UK-Nigeria Trade and Investment Forum in London that NERC had devised a “recovery plan” that would fix the tariff issue. “Under the plan, by 2021, tariffs, regular tariffs, will reach parity with cost-reflective tariffs,” Garba said. He said increasing tariffs was difficult given the lack of regular power supply and the relatively few paying customers on the system; he said there are currently just 8 million customers on the billing platform. “The few that are paying are actually paying for others that are not paying,” he said of the current system. Garba said the reset plan would bring in more investors in order to add generation capacity, diversify power sources away from the gas that most of the grid relies on now, expand the transmission system and, crucially, add 10 to 20 million customers to the billing platform. He said that while investments were currently stalled, the government would soon invite utilities to submit the investments they need so the government can choose the most crucial projects, facilitate outside investment - and hold those who do get the money accountable for what they do with it. Garba said the potential millions of new customers, was a “tremendous opportunity” for those looking to place money in Nigeria.

2018-04-19,"KABUL, April 19 (Reuters) - Afghanistan is pressing ahead with plans to turn natural gas from an $8-billion pipeline into economic development, with projects ranging from fertilizer plants to power generation, but first it needs to start construction. The TAPI pipeline - named after the countries involved, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India - was first proposed three decades ago. The problem of crossing war-ravaged Afghanistan is a major reason it has not been built. Surveying work is finally underway in Afghanistan’s western province of Herat, with construction planned to start later in the autumn. Obstacles loom, however, starting with convincing donors to fund Afghanistan’s 5 percent share of the cost and attracting private investors. “They’re thinking, ‘Why a 30-year project that has not come into practice will be able to fully function in a few years?’ There is still that resistance, that maybe we will not be able to implement on time,” said Afghanistan’s acting minister of mines and petroleum, Nargis Nehan, in an interview. The Taliban militant group has pledged support for TAPI, but security remains a concern. TAPI will transport 33 billion cubic metres of gas a year along an 1,800 km (1,125 mile) route from Turkmenistan’s Galkynysh, the world’s second-biggest gas field, to Fazilka in northwest India. Afghanistan’s share, 5 billion cubic metres annually, would meet a huge need for the country, which relies on imported electricity and faces frequent power shortages. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is financing Afghanistan’s contribution to TAPI’s cost, and the World Bank are conducting for Kabul a feasibility study into generating electricity from the gas and using it to supply fertilizer and petrochemical plants, said Samuel Tumiwa, the ADB’s country director. A gas distribution system in Herat, Afghanistan’s third-largest city, could also pipe gas directly to homes for heating and generate electricity for plants to process juice and nuts, he said. “This opens up the possibility of Herat as an industrial city,” Tumiwa said. The priority of Afghanistan’s government-owned power utility Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), is producing power, and it is examining where it should build a power plant to convert TAPI gas, said the utility’s chief executive officer, Aman Ghalib. Afghanistan could access additional gas from Turkmenistan during the early years of TAPI’s operation until the pipeline extends to Pakistan and India, Ghalib said. TAPI is expected to start carrying gas by 2020, although the ADB’s Tumiwa said a later start was more realistic. To utilize the gas, additional infrastructure, from gas mains to feeder lines and compression stations, may be needed, Tumiwa said. Those costs plus Afghanistan’s share of capital would likely come from international donors, since the International Monetary Fund restricts borrowing. The country also expects to collect at least $400 million in annual transit fees. Kabul hopes to attract private investment, possibly including foreign fertilizer companies, Nehan said. Unlike other projects in Afghanistan, TAPI will immediately generate revenue and gas when it starts operating, she said. “This is a project where we see a very immediate return. From investment perspective, I think it is better that we focus on such projects.” (Reporting by Rod Nickel and Rupam Jain Editing by Robert Birsel)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/turkmenistan-afghanistan-gas-pipeline/afghanistans-30-year-pipe-dream-could-bring-power-industry-idUKL2N1RE01F,19 Apr 2018,"Afghanistan is pressing ahead

2018-04-19,"* Oil highest in over 3 yrs on report Saudis want higher prices * Nickel sees biggest jump in 6-1/2 years on sanctions worries * Risk of inflationary pulse a drag for fixed-income bonds * Dollar mostly range bound, Aussie weathers weak jobs data By Marc Jones LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Talk that Saudi Arabia has its sights on $80-$100 a barrel oil again ignited a fierce rally in commodities and resource stocks on Thursday, though the potential boost to inflation globally put some pressure on fixed-income assets. It was set to be the strongest day for the commodity complex in eight months as Brent crude futures climbed past $74 a barrel after a near 3 percent jump overnight. The surge came on a Reuters report that OPEC’s new price hawk Saudi Arabia would be happy for crude to rise to $80 or even $100, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to a supply-cutting deal even though the agreement’s original target is now within sight. “The Saudis and their colleagues in OPEC need higher oil for their fiscal positions and the Kingdom is on a bold – and costly – reform program,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. The leap in oil combined with fears that sanctions on Russia could hit supplies of other commodities to light a fire under the entire sector. Nickel jumped the most in 6-1/2 years on talk Nornickel - the world’s second-biggest producer of the metal - could be targeted. Aluminium prices reached their highest since 2011, its raw material alumina touched an all-time peak, while iron ore leapt 5 percent. Such increases, if sustained, could fuel inflationary pressures and investors hedged by selling sovereign bonds. Yields on U.S. two-year Treasuries stood at levels last visited in 2008 at 2.43 percent and 10-year German yields went above 0.55 percent for the first time in almost a month. “If oil prices were to move toward $80 a barrel and euro weakened a bit, there could be some inflation pressure,” said Rabobank’s head of macro strategy Elwin de Groot. “That usually has a negative impact on spending and could do here, especially if it comes on the back of these trade and geopolitical tensions.” Resource stocks were the big winners, driving Chinese blue chips up 1.1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.9 percent, with energy up over 2.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei faded late in the day to end up 0.15 percent, but basic materials and utilities both climbed more than 2 percent. Industrial and commodities-focused stocks also led the pack in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan though the pan-regionally STOXX 600 was showing some signs of fatigue after a two-day rally had taken it to a six-week high. The bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down. Investors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were pointing to a steady start in New York later. Wall Street had also seen hefty gains in the energy and industrial indexes, though that was offset by softness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials. IBM’s 7.5 percent drop was the biggest drag on the S&P after the technology company’s quarterly profit margins missed Wall Street targets. The Dow ended down 0.16 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.08 percent and the Nasdaq 0.19 percent. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar remained rangebound with its index a fraction firmer at 89.669. It gained a touch on the yen to 107.46 yen, but stayed short of recent peaks at 107.78. The euro hovered at $1.2383, within striking distance of the week’s top of $1.2413, while Turkey’s lira fell back 0.6 percent having had its best day in more than a year on Wednesday after President Tayyip Erdogan declared early elections. “The conventional wisdom is that (political) stability, even if it is not the form that you might choose - allows investment flows to continue.” said Tom Clarke, a cross-asset co-portfolio manager at William Blair Funds. The strength in commodity prices helped the Australian dollar easily weather unexpectedly soft jobs data, with employment rising by a meagre 4,900 in March. Figures out from New Zealand also showed annual inflation there had slowed to just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, underlining expectations that interest rates would remain at record lows for many more months to come.

The Kubal smelter in Sweden is Rusal’s only primary metal production facility outside of Russia. It produced 123,000 tonnes of metal last year or 3 percent of the total. The U.S. Treasury Department on April 6 imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 firms they own or control, saying they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in “malign activities” around the world. This includes Rusal, the world’s largest aluminium producer after China Hongqiao Group. Rusal is heavily dependent on its international network of mines and refineries. Last year these accounted for 53 percent of its output of raw material ore bauxite and 64 percent of production of semi-processed sister alumina. The company may be forced to divest most of its portfolio of overseas operations if the aluminium giant cannot restructure them to evade U.S. sanctions and ensure a flow of raw materials. Mining Group Rio Tinto  said last week it would declare force majeure on certain customer contracts after the U.S. imposed sanctions on its partner Rusal.

2018-04-19,"ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB (ABBN.S) reported its best start to a year since 2015 on Thursday, easing the pressure on Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer by showing his turnaround plan is making progress. The company’s shares rose more than 4 percent after it beat profit, sales and order forecasts in the first three months of the year. It pointed to improvements in its power grids division, having resisted calls from shareholders to spin off its least profitable business. Some investors, frustrated with the company’s tepid share price performance and stalled progress in recent quarters, had called for a separation of power grids whose products transmit electricity across long distances. ABB opted to retain the power grids business after a strategy review in 2016. Spiesshofer said it was now on track to reach its profitability target this year before making further improvements within the company’s guidance range. “We listen very carefully to all of our shareholders and we are always open to constructive dialogue,” Spiesshofer, in the top job since 2013, told reporters on a call. “We have moved that [power grids] business from 4 percent to close to 10 percent operating margin and we continue that transformation under ABB’s leadership. “The decision is taken, the portfolio is shaped, and now we execute and drive performance. The entire board with all its members and entire management are fully aligned on that.” He was speaking after ABB reported net profit of $572 million for its first quarter, beating the average estimate of $562 million in a Reuters poll of 24 analysts. Revenue rose 10 percent to $8.63 billion, also beating expectations. Operational earnings before interest, tax and amortization rose to $1.06 billion, while the margin of 12.3 percent was within ABB’s target range of 11 to 16 percent. Revenue and operating EBITA were at the highest level since the first quarter of 2015, when ABB started implementing Spiesshofer’s Next Level strategy which has focused on exiting risky and low-margin businesses like engineering, procurement and construction work and off-shore wind projects. ABB’s shares reacted positively, gaining 4.4 percent in early trading, the second-highest riser in the Stoxx European industrial sector index. .SXNP Analysts noted some of the margin improvement was due to the effect of the weaker dollar, but were generally upbeat. “Strong results strengthen our conviction that the consensus trend is turning upwards,” said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst William Mackie. Spiesshofer said he aimed to maintain the upturn, and highlighted positive economic signals around the world which was a good sign for increased spending by customers. ABB said its overall first-quarter order intake increased to $9.77 billion, beating estimates and the best figure in three years. Spiesshofer said order growth had come in all divisions, including power grids. “2018 for ABB is the first year that all our markets are either steady or growing,” he said.

2018-04-19,"TOMAKOMAI, Japan (Reuters) - A test site in Japan for burying carbon dioxide (CO2) below the seabed off Hokkaido island is showing more promise than other carbon, capture and storage (CCS) projects by cutting costs and increasing efficiency, its developer says.  While the $300 million site at Tomakomai port represents a small portion of the $20 billion invested in CCS, it has potential for easing CO2 emissions from industries such as gas processing and cement and chemical production.  Most investments into CCS have focused on capturing carbon from power plants fired by coal and other fossil fuels - the largest source of CO2 emissions - but there have been big setbacks and some projects canceled.  “Tomakomai is an exciting development. Progress on CCS has been far too slow and projects like that are very encouraging,” said Graham Winkelman, climate change lead at BHP.  Industrial applications such as that being tested at the Tomakomai site are where the focus now is on CCS, he said.  BHP is the world’s largest exporter of coal for steel-making, a fuel and industry often marked as big sources of climate-warming emissions.  On an exclusive tour of the Tomakomai test site, developers told Reuters they have cut energy costs by as much as two-thirds compared with other projects and increased the efficiency of capturing CO2.  Those claims have yet to be tested commercially but the project operated by Japan CCS - owned by Japan Petroleum Exploration, Mitsubishi Corp, JXTG Holdings and more than 30 other companies - looks promising.  In contrast, Southern Co’s Kemper power station in the United States was to use CCS in an attempt to get clean power from coal, but was abandoned after billions of dollars of investment.  Chevron Corp has also delayed the world’s largest CO2 injection operation in Australia, after spending A$2.5 billion ($2 billion) on the project at its Gorgon liquefied natural gas plant, itself beset by many problems.  For graphic on Japan carbon dioxide emissions by sector click reut.rs/2vsnc39 CCS involves separating CO2 from other materials and gases and injecting it underground to prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere or to use it to create pressure to push oil to the surface as wells deplete.  At Tomakomai, by-product gas is piped from a nearby Idemitsu Kosan refinery and CO2 pulled out as it passes through an amine solution. By using the remaining gases to generate power and recycling heat, energy costs are cut to between 1/2 and 1/3 of a typical extraction plant, the company said.  When Reuters visited the site, a counter showed 150,000 tonnes of CO2 had been injected, halfway to the project’s targeted 300,000 tonnes. The injection project is scheduled to run until 2020, with no decision yet on commercial operations.  For graphic on global carbon dioxide emissions by sector click reut.rs/2ERVxb0 Asked about costs, officials declined to state figures. Japan CCS has run simulations scaling the site to handle 1 million tonnes a year and these show it can make commercial sense, said Chiyoko Suzuki, manager of international relations at Japan CCS, during the visit.  Australia’s CarbonNet, looking at a similar type of CCS project, last year estimated the cost of compressing, transporting and burying carbon dioxide from gas processing, fertilizer manufacturing and hydrogen production at A$30 ($23.41) a ton.  Suzuki said he did not know CarbonNet’s details so could not make a judgment.  CCS will be needed to cut 14 percent of the emissions that have to be abated by 2060 to limit a global rise in average temperatures to less than 2 Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), the International Energy Agency says.

Yields on U.S. two-year Treasuries stood at levels last visited in 2008 at 2.43 percent. Resource stocks were the big winners, driving Chinese blue chips up 1.1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.9 percent, with energy up over 2.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei faded late in the day to end up 0.15 percent, but basic materials and utilities both climbed more than 2 percent. The bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down. Investors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent, as did futures for the FTSE. Wall Street had also seen hefty gains in the energy and industrial indexes, though that was offset by softness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials. IBM’s 7.5 percent drop was the biggest drag on the S&P after the technology company’s quarterly profit margins missed Wall Street targets. The Dow ended down 0.16 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.08 percent and the Nasdaq 0.19 percent. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar remained range bound with its index a fraction firmer at 89.669. It gained a touch on the yen to 107.46 yen, but stayed short of recent peaks at 107.78. The euro hovered at $1.2374, within striking distance of the week’s top of $1.2413. The strength in commodity prices helped the Australian dollar easily weather unexpectedly soft jobs data, with employment rising by a meagre 4,900 in March. Figures out from New Zealand also showed annual inflation there had slowed to just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, underlining expectations that interest rates would remain at record lows for many more months to come.

2018-04-19,"* EU last month removed duties on some Indonesian biodiesel * That paves way for boost in exports from the country * But likely to hit supply from rival producer Malaysia * Malaysia supply often more expensive due to higher output costs By Emily Chow and Bernadette Christina Munthe KUALA LUMPUR/JAKARTA, April 19 (Reuters) - Indonesian biodiesel makers are gearing up to boost exports after the European Union removed anti-dumping duties on shipments from some producers in the country, but rival suppliers in Malaysia are bracing for a slowdown in the wake of the move. After legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice, the EU last month removed duties on biodiesel imports for 13 Indonesian and Argentine producers that had been in place since 2013. The move is set to be a boon for Indonesia, the world’s top supplier of palmoil-based biofuel, but is expected to hit Malaysian exporters hard as they lose market share due to higher costs in their smaller-scale biodiesel industry. Traders estimate Malaysian prices for a tonne of biodiesel are typically $30 to $40 more expensive than Indonesian cargoes. Both nations use palm oil from their vast plantations to churn out biodiesel. Prices of Malaysian palm methyl ester, the bio component of biodiesel that comes from palm oil, traded at $747 a tonne on Thursday, versus $711 in Indonesia, according to a trader. “Some (Indonesian) companies have already started shipping (to Europe),” said the chairman of the Indonesia Biofuels Producer Association (APROBI), MP Tumanggor. He expects Indonesia to ship around 432,000 tonnes of biodiesel to the EU this year, up from virtually nothing in 2017. That would still be a way off the 1.4 million tonnes exported the year before the EU duties were introduced, although a Malaysian-based biodiesel trader said Indonesia could ship up to 80,000 tonnes a month from here on in. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. Weaker export demand for Malaysian biodiesel is expected to curb utilisation rates at the country’s production plants. “Malaysia biodiesel exports last year were pretty good ... It had a window to export to the EU, but now Malaysia is not competitive,” said U.R. Unnithan, president of the Malaysia Biodiesel Association (MBA). “I imagine Malaysian biodiesel exports (to the EU) now would be virtually nothing.” Malaysia’s biodiesel exports - largely EU bound - jumped to 235,000 tonnes in 2017 from 83,000 tonnes the previous year, according to MBA data. The removal of EU exports would see biodiesel production fall to 500,000 tonnes this year from 720,000 tonnes in 2017, forecast Unnithan, lowering plant utilisation rates from current levels of around 30 percent. Duties on biodiesel exports from other Indonesian producers are expected to be lifted soon. The latest step comes as prices for regular diesel last week hit a three-year peak, with benchmark palm oil prices recently declining to their largest discount to the fuel in the last few years. However, traders warn more competitive soy-based biodiesel could challenge Indonesian exports, as current prices of soy methyl ester are on-par with those for palm methyl ester.

2018-04-19,"LONDON/BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Talks between Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Iraq on a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure contract have reached an impasse, Iraqi officials and two industry sources said, in a potential setback to the oil major’s ambitions to expand in the country. More than two years of negotiations on awarding the U.S. firm a project to build a water treatment facility and related pipelines needed to boost Iraq’s oil production capacity have hit difficulties because the two sides differ on contract terms and costs, the officials and sources told Reuters. Unless the differences can be resolved, the project could be awarded to another company in a tender, the officials said, without elaborating on the points of dispute. Losing the contract could deal a blow to Exxon’s broader Iraqi plans, as it would be handed rights to develop at least two southern oilfields - Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi - as part of the deal. Exxon declined to comment.  Further delays to the project could also hold back the oil industry in Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer; the country needs to inject water into its wells or risk losing pressure and face severe decline rates, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives.   The Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), which would supply water to more than six southern oilfields, including Exxon’s existing West Qurna 1 field and BP’s (BP.L) Rumaila, was initially planned to be completed in 2013 but has now been delayed until 2022.     “The CSSP would be expensive and challenging but there’s opportunity here (for Exxon) ... to get access to resources on a very large scale and to achieve something and really make a difference to its own business,” said Ian Thom, principal analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Many of the world’s biggest oil companies, like BP, Total (TOTF.PA), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Eni (ENI.MI), have operations in Iraq, where a low-return environment and strict contract terms have squeezed returns in recent years.       With total oil production at West Qurna 1 at around 430,000 bpd, Exxon’s presence in Iraq is small compared with dominant player BP whose Rumaila oilfield accounts for around a third of the country’s total production of around 4.4 million bpd. While the Texas-based firm is looking to grow in Iraq, its geographical focus remains on the Americas, including U.S. shale fields and Brazil, in contrast to rivals like France’s Total and Italy’s Eni who have been significantly expanding their activities in the Middle East in recent years.  The talks between Iraqi authorities and Exxon are still ongoing, according to the industry sources and officials from the Iraqi oil ministry. However the state-run Basra Oil Company (BOC), which is overseeing the project, said it could now tender the project this month in a parallel process with the aim of completing a first phase by 2022. “We have this one approach but we can have another approach as well,” Abdul Mahdi al-Ameedi, head of the Iraqi oil ministry’s licensing and contracts office, told Reuters. Iraq chose Exxon to coordinate the initial studies of the CSSP in 2010 [story here here]. At the time, Baghdad aimed to raise its oil production capacity to 12 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2018, rivaling Saudi Arabia.  That target has been missed and now been cut to 6.5 million bpd by 2022 from around 5 million bpd now. “Iraq can probably get to 5.5 million bpd production without a major seawater supply project, but I think they will struggle to get to 7 million bpd,” said Thom. Negotiations with Exxon fell through in 2012 due to red tape and cost disputes. In 2015, the company reentered talks with the oil ministry, this time in partnership with China's CNPC and with the CSSP folded into a much bigger development project known as the Integrated South Project. [story here here] CNPC did not reply to a request for comment. For Iraq, going down the non-Exxon route raises two major concerns: how to integrate the project between the water treatment facility and the oilfields and how to finance the project, Thom said.  Two Iraqi oil sources told Reuters that taking the non-Exxon path would raise financing concerns for Iraq.  “If you decouple it, it’s not the same project,” one of the industry sources said of a non-integrated project.     Projected costs of the scheme have not been disclosed. ILF Consulting Engineers, which did the front end engineering and design (FEED) for the project in 2014 based on treating 12.5 million bpd of seawater transported to six oilfields, put the cost at $12 billion. The capacity has been revised downwards, with the first phase set to have a 5 million bpd of water, and in the second phase an additional 2.5 million bpd of water will be added for additional fields.

2018-04-19,"(Repeats Wednesday’s story with no changes to text) By Kate Kelland, Health and Science Correspondent LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Gene-editing technologies that alter mosquitoes’ DNA could prove critical in the fight against malaria, Bill Gates said on Wednesday, and ethical concerns should not block progress in such gene-modifying research. Speaking at the Malaria Forum conference in London, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist said that while gene editing raises “legitimate questions”, that should not jeopardise exploration of tools such as CRISPR gene editing and so-called “gene drive” technologies. “I’m very energised about the potential of gene drive. (It’s) the kind of breakthrough we need to support,” Gates said. “It may prove critical here.” Gene drive technologies alter DNA and drive self-sustaining genetic changes through multiple generations by overriding normal biological processes. CRISPR technology enables scientists to find and modify or replace virtually any gene. The techniques are being explored across science - from human medicine to livestock- and crop-breeding. In mosquitoes that transmit malaria, genetic alterations can be used to induce infertility to reduce populations, or alter the insects’ ability to carry and pass on the malaria parasite. The technologies can be extremely powerful, but they are also controversial, since such genetically engineered organisms released into the environment could have an unknown and irreversible impact on the ecosystem. Asked in a interview with Reuters about that controversy, Gates said there were understandable concerns about safety and efficacy that would need to be addressed in research and trials. But he countered: “Malaria itself is quite controversial - it kills about 400,000 kids a year. So we’re definitely not on the side of malaria.” He also noted that at their summit in January, leaders of the African Union endorsed gene drive research as part of the fight against a disease that continues to kill their people. “They spoke out to say that, for them, getting rid of malaria is worth using innovative science,” Gates said. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned late last year that global progress against malaria had stalled and could be reversed if momentum in the fight to wipe it out was lost. The disease infected around 216 million people in 91 countries in 2016, an increase of 5 million cases over the previous year. It killed 445,000 people, about the same number as in 2015, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in babies and young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Gates told the Forum that his almost 20 years of involvement in global efforts to beat malaria had been both gratifying, in terms of progress, and tough, in terms of suffering he witnessed. He described seeing a child in a hospital in Tanzania convulsed with seizures due to cerebral malaria. “With the state of science and the wealth of the world, that really should be an affront,” he said. “We really shouldn’t accept that this disease can continue.” Gates said that ending malaria for good would take many years and a range of tools both new and old - from bednets and mosquito traps to a new vaccine and next generation gene tools. He said he thought it unlikely that creating gene drives in malaria-spreading mosquitoes would have a major impact on the wider ecosystem because it would only target a few species and suppress their populations for a period of time. “None of these (gene technology) constructs will actually wipe out the species,” he said. “It will evolve back. After all, evolutionary pressures always push back.” Dramatically reducing mosquito populations with such technologies could, however, give a window of opportunity to help limit the human reservoir of disease so that transmission of the disease among people is stopped, he said. Gates also said genetic information and data, gathered in the field and transmitted swiftly to sophisticated surveillance systems, is allowing scientists to identify evolving strains of malaria parasites and track drug and pesticide resistance, helping them stay one step ahead of the disease.

2018-04-19,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s war on pollution is at risk of reaching a “stalemate”, with poor weather conditions undermining the country’s efforts to reduce smog, an environment ministry spokesman said on Thursday. Air pollution rose by more than a quarter in parts of northern China in March, and the region has been hit by another bout of smog in the second half of April, which the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) has blamed on weak air circulation. “Weather conditions last month in Beijing were the worst over the past six years with slow wind, little rain and high temperatures, but average pollution readings were able to stay at same level as the past five years,” Liu Youbin, spokesman for the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), said at a regular press briefing.  “The air pollution campaign has entered a stage of stalemate, as Chairman Mao described in his famous book ‘On Protracted War’... The efforts we made have sometimes been offset by unfavourable weather, and it will take time for us to slip the leash of weather conditions to win the war,” he added. China met its 2013-2017 air quality targets after forcing major polluters like steel mills and coal-fired power generators to raise standards and upgrade their technology, and it also shut down thousands of smaller law-breaking enterprises. Liu said China shut down as many as 62,000 small-scale and “dispersed” pollution sources in 2017, noting that they were responsible for around 30 percent of total emissions of PM2.5, small particles that lodge in the lungs.    But experts have warned that China’s anti-smog campaign is getting even harder, with improvements in air quality starting to level off now that relatively straightforward programmes like the desulphurisation of power plant emissions have been completed. While the focus has primarily been on reducing concentrations of PM2.5, experts have also urged the authorities to take action against other hazardous forms of air pollution like ozone, which has been on the rise in northern China.  “The easy actions have been done very well but now there is more that needs to be done,” said Chen Songxi, an expert in environmental statistics at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. “Motor vehicles in cities have to be curbed - so far, there has been little action in that regard, because it will be very unpopular with drivers,” he added.

2018-04-19," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The decision by the government of Australia’s Northern Territory government to allow the resumption of fracking for natural gas will do little to immediately solve the country’s energy woes, but will likely sharpen political battle lines. The territory’s government said on April 17 that it has lifted a near two-year moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, accepting the recommendations of its own commission of inquiry into the practice. Northern Territory is a vast, sparsely-populated 1.4 million square kilometre (540,000 square mile) part of central and northern Australia, and home to two potentially rich basins of natural gas. The remote region is ruled by the centre-left Labor Party, which is in opposition at a federal level. The Labor Party also controls state governments in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. The decision to permit fracking, subject to rigorous regulation, came as a surprise to many observers, given the opposition of many Labor supporters to this method of natural gas production. The territory government was elected on a platform of placing a moratorium on fracking and holding an inquiry into whether it was safe and what were the environmental risks. In some ways the territory’s commission merely confirmed what other similar inquiries in Australia have already found, namely that the risks of fracking can be managed with robust regulation. (For a graphic showing Australia's Northern Territory fracking areas, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2JRs18Z) The government of New Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner must have known, however, that allowing the resumption of fracking would alienate part of its support base, and make it a target for well-funded, well-organised green activists. The natural gas industry has welcomed the lifting of the moratorium and Australian energy major Origin Energy said it aimed to resume plans “as soon as practical” to drill and frack the Beetaloo Basin, which the company says contains as much as 6.6 trillion cubic feet in reserves. Such a level of natural gas reserves would provide a welcome boost to Australia, which is struggling to balance the needs of three large liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants in Queensland with the demands for cheap and reliable supplies from industry and consumers along the populous east coast. It’s this dynamic that is creating political headaches for both state governments and the centre-right Liberal Party of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The natural gas industry maintains there is no actual shortage of the fuel, but says that to ensure that this situation continues, the states and territories will have to permit exploration and production. Currently, four states - New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia - have either bans or moratoriums on at least some forms of natural gas exploration and production. It remains to be seen whether NT’s decision to lift its fracking moratorium will encourage other jurisdictions to do the same, but any politician considering this will be aware of the furious reaction it would generate from environmental activists. The other issue for Australia is that domestic natural gas prices have risen sharply, and are now trading more in line with Asian spot LNG prices. The price of natural gas at the Wallumbilla hub in Queensland, as assessed by Argus Media, was $5.77 per million British thermal units last week, while spot Asian LNG was $7.25. Once the cost of the LNG is netted back to the hub, the two prices are more or less in line, meaning Australia’s domestic customers are paying for their natural gas at values linked to international prices. This is a shift from what happened prior to the three LNG plants being built in Queensland, when domestic natural gas was cheaper and generally sold in long-term contracts. Adding natural gas from the territory to Australia’s supply mix may help lower prices for both feedstock for the LNG plants and domestic customers, but the point is that this extra production is still several years away. In the meantime, pressure is going to mount on domestic natural gas suppliers and consumers, leading to political fallout and seemingly odd solutions, such as bringing a floating re-gasification ship to Melbourne and importing LNG. It seems ludicrous that Australia, which will overtake Qatar as the world’s top exporter of LNG once the last of eight new projects comes online later this year, will turn to importing the super-chilled fuel in order to meet domestic demand. It seems logical to develop onshore natural gas resources rather than import LNG, but this ignores the increasing influence of environmental activists, who are committed to ending all fossil fuel production in favour of renewable energy. While some green groups ignore the scientific evidence that supports fracking, others simply shift to say that natural gas production contributes to climate change and should be banned for this reason. Any company engaged in fracking in Australia can expect to be targeted by activists, which may deter some oil and gas companies, given they have become increasingly publicity shy. The end result of the Northern Territory’s decision to allow fracking may be some additional natural gas supply. But it will certainly up the political temperature and raise the risks of populist policies triumphing over cheap energy supplies that are cleaner than Australia’s existing coal-dominated power plants.

2018-04-19,"(Reuters) - Rating agency Moody’s Investors Service said on Wednesday Russia’s strong public and external finances would shield its economy from the impact of the latest U.S. sanctions.  However, the sanctions will be credit negative for some Russian debt issuers, especially Russian aluminum giant United Company Rusal Plc (0486.HK), Moody’s said in a report. The Russian banking system has enough earnings capacity for absorbing credit losses arising from exposures to sanctioned companies, the rating agency said. Moody’s assessment is in contrast to that of Fitch Ratings, which said last week the U.S. sanctions would limit Russia’s potential economic growth and severely impact targeted companies.   The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions earlier this month on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, as well as 17 senior Russian government officials. Moscow calls these sanctions unlawful and has warned retaliation. “Russia’s sovereign credit profile — its rating is Ba1 with a positive outlook — is well positioned to withstand the impact of new sanctions,” said Kristin Lindow, a Moody’s Senior Vice President and co-author of the report.  “Higher oil prices will help the government to make further progress in rebuilding its fiscal savings.” The risk to Russia’s credit profile comes from the possibility of Russian entities being cut off from the international capital market for some time, Moody’s noted.  Moody’s expects the Russian government to increase support to regions facing a fall in revenues due to the sanctions.  Washington cites Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian civil war and alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election for the sanctions.

The 16 banned products include steel smelting slag containing more than 25 percent of the metal manganese, and ethylene polymer waste, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said in a document published on its website. MEE also listed another 16 items that will be banned by the end of 2019, including timber waste and scrap metals such as stainless steel, tungsten and magnesium. China told the World Trade Organisation last year it would stop accepting imports of 24 types of foreign waste by the end of the year, and that it would phase out shipments of other waste products, including those readily available from domestic sources, by the end of 2019. China’s crackdown on imported waste, which was as much as 47 million tonnes in 2015, is part of its “war on pollution”, and was meant to help upgrade the country’s economy and move it up the global supply chain. The ban has already caused massive pile-ups of trash overseas, but MEE spokesman Liu Youbin said at a press briefing on Thursday it was a “key move to ensure environmental safety and protect public health.” “For the next step, the ecology and environment ministry together with other departments will conscientiously enforce and strictly forbid foreign garbage from crossing the border,” he said. Even before the ban came into effect, the government cancelled the waste import permits of 960 companies in 2017, and shut down another 8,800 firms accused of violating restrictions on imported scrap paper and plastic. The environment ministry said last year’s total waste imports fell 12 percent as a result, but it didn’t give an absolute number. The newly formed Ministry of Ecology and Environment said at its inaugural meeting last month that it would step up the fight against foreign waste, saying it was “a symbolic measure for the creation of an ecological civilisation in China.” Uncovering violations has been a major challenge, however, with smuggling still rife. Customs authorities are also having to step up their detection capabilities in order to identify which shipments violate China’s scrap quality standards. China’s customs department seized 110,000 tonnes of smuggled waste in the first quarter of this year, it said this month.

2018-04-19,"* Oil highest in over 3 yrs on report Saudis wants higher prices * Resource stocks star as most Asian markets move ahead * Risk of inflationary pulse a drag for fixed-income bonds * Dollar mostly range bound, GBP and CAD nurse losses By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, April 19 (Reuters) - Resource stocks were on a roll in Asia on Thursday as oil prices hit heights not seen since late 2014 and ignited a rally across commodities, though the potential boost to inflation globally also put some pressure on fixed-income assets. Brent crude futures climbed another 29 cents to stand at $73.77 a barrel, adding to a 2.7 percent jump overnight. U.S. crude gained 26 cents to $68.73. The surge came on a Reuters report that OPEC’s new price hawk Saudi Arabia would be happy for crude to rise to $80 or even $100, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to a supply-cutting deal even though the agreement’s original target is within sight. “The Saudis and their colleagues in OPEC need higher oil for their fiscal positions and the Kingdom is on a bold – and costly – reform program,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. “So, they might continue to squeeze the lemon while they have the chance and the hand.” The leap in oil combined with fears that sanctions on Russia could hit supplies of other commodities to light a fire under the entire sector. Aluminium prices reached their highest since 2011, alumina touched an all-time peak and nickel jumped the most in 6-1/2 years. Such increases, if sustained, could fuel inflationary pressures and investors hedged by selling sovereign bonds. Yields on U.S. two-year Treasuries stood at levels last visited in 2008 at 2.43 percent. Resource stocks were the big winners driving Australia’s main index up 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.6 percent, led by a 2.9 percent rise in basic materials. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.8 percent, with energy up over 2 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent. Wall Street had also seen hefty gains in the energy and industrial indexes, though that was offset by softness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials. IBM’s 7.5 percent drop was the biggest drag on the S&P after the technology company’s quarterly profit margins missed Wall Street targets. The Dow ended down 0.16 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.08 percent and the Nasdaq 0.19 percent. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar remained range bound with its index a fraction firmer at 89.647. It gained a touch on the yen to 107.40 yen, but stayed short of recent peaks at 107.78. The euro hovered at $1.2384, within striking distance of the week’s top of $1.2413. The Australian dollar took a brief knock after jobs data proved unexpectedly soft in March, with employment rising by a meagre 4,900. Sterling nursed its losses at $1.4195 after a surprisingly tame reading on UK inflation led the market to reconsider the likely pace of future rate rises from the Bank of England. Data out on New Zealand on Thursday showed annual inflation there had slowed to just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, underlining expectations that interest rates would remain at record lows for many more months to come.

2018-04-19,"(Adds comments from Governor Ricardo Rossello) By Nick Brown NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - A power line failure in southern Puerto Rico cut electricity to almost all 3.4 million residents on Wednesday, the latest in a string of operational and political headaches for the U.S. territory’s bankrupt, storm-ravaged power utility. In a statement, the Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, said “technical personnel” were working to determine a cause and expected to restore service in 24 to 36 hours. Puerto Rico’s smaller islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as a pair of microgrids on the main island, were unaffected. PREPA has struggled to escape the headlines since Hurricane Maria wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico last Sept. 20. Maria, the worst storm to hit the island in 90 years, devastated Puerto Rico’s grid and thousands were still without power at the time of Wednesday’s blackout. “This is another example of why Puerto Rico’s energy infrastructure needs to incorporate new forms of power,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Twitter, adding that he is “committed” to reforms to transform the island’s energy sector. Separately on Wednesday, the island’s federally-appointed financial oversight board unveiled a framework for reform that breaks with Rossello’s vision, pushing pension cuts and labor reforms while hinting at layoffs. PREPA has suffered several blackouts since Maria and has been in bankruptcy since last July, owing some $9 billion to mutual funds, hedge funds and other investors. In October, Rossello canceled a $300 million contract awarded by PREPA to a tiny Montana-based company amid political backlash. Three months later, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers discovered undistributed hurricane relief materials in a PREPA warehouse, sparking Rossello to order a separate investigation. A U.S. Congressional committee in March announced its own probe into potential corruption at PREPA, including reports that some officials accepted bribes to restore power to exotic dance clubs ahead of schedule. Rossello is planning to privatize PREPA over the next 18 months, as Puerto Rico navigates a $120 billion bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. government history. In the short-term, though, the grid remains vulnerable ahead of a new hurricane season beginning this summer. Falling revenues, a loss of staff and constant leadership turnover have contributed to an outdated fleet of equipment, which was exposed by Maria’s winds of up to 155 miles per hour. Compounding that, most of the island’s generation is done in the south and trekked through miles of wires to the bulk of the population in the north. “We need to have power to the north to avoid this kind of chain reaction every time we have a power problem,” said Tomas Torres, executive director of the nonprofit Institute for Competitiveness and Sustainable Economy for Puerto Rico. [Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2jYDF9s]] The latest outage came as Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Indians and Minnesota Twins squared off in San Juan on Wednesday night, part of an effort by MLB to bring attention to and raise money for Puerto Rico. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has criticized PREPA and the U.S. response to the power restoration effort, said on Twitter that the city would bring in extra lights and security for the game, which was played as scheduled.

2018-04-19,"(Repeats April 18 item. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * London and Shanghai aluminium prices: tmsnrt.rs/2JWSBO3 By Andy Home LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - The shocks from the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Oleg Deripaska and his UC Rusal aluminium empire are still rolling through the market. After Rio Tinto last week flagged it was declaring force majeure on some raw material contracts, it warned today of potential “adjustments” to its aluminium guidance this year due to the sanctions. Some of Japan’s major trading houses, meanwhile, have asked Rusal to stop shipping aluminium for fear of secondary sanctions. Japan imports around 300,000 tonnes of Russian aluminium every year, equivalent to around 16 percent of its total import needs. Aluminium’s previously well-filled supply chain is starting to crack along multiple fault lines. As supply fears grow, the market’s attention is turning to China as a potential source of aluminium. There are almost a million tonnes of the stuff sitting in warehouses registered with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE). That metal will flow out of China if the price is right. But China’s role as supplier of last resort is heavily laden with irony given the political push back against its exports of aluminium products. The world’s largest producer is also suffering from its own supply-chain turbulence. Graphic on London and Shanghai aluminium relative price performance: tmsnrt.rs/2JWSBO3 In London the price of aluminium has been on a rocket-propelled charge since the U.S. Treasury announced the sanctions on April 6. At a current $2,527 per tonne London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month aluminium has gained over $500 in the space of under two weeks. That has opened up a widening gap with Shanghai prices, which have reacted only mutedly to the excitement in London. However, still higher prices will be needed for Chinese aluminium to leave the country and fill the supply gaps opening up in the rest of the world, according to analysts at CRU. That’s because exports of primary metal from China are subject to a 15 percent export tax, unlike exports of products which qualify for VAT rebates. Depending on market dynamics in both London and Shanghai, CRU is looking for prices to approach $3,000 to unlock the 991,780 tonnes of metal sitting in ShFE warehouses. But this is what will be necessary if Rusal’s own exports out of Russia are blocked. CRU was already anticipating a supply shortfall of around 1.8 million tonnes outside of China before the sanctions, according to CRU’s head of primary and products research, Eoin Dinsmore. Throw in the potential loss of 200,000-230,000 tonnes of monthly exports from Russia and there would be “a critical need” for Chinese metal. Goldman Sachs agrees, arguing that a complete cessation of Rusal exports could lift prices to as high as $3,200. (“Quantifying upside risks from Russian Sanctions”, April 18, 2018). The bank’s view is that Rusal will be restructured to bypass sanctions and allow both production and exports to continue but it has still lifted its price forecasts to factor in the uncertainty. The irony here is that China is already a huge exporter, not of primary aluminium but rather of aluminium in the form of semi-manufactured products. Indeed, such has been the flood of products out of the country that up to now the big issue for everyone else has been how to stop China exporting so much not how to stimulate it to export more. The United States has led the political push back against Chinese product exports, which rose another 4 percent last year to an annual record of 4.24 million tonnes. President Donald Trump has signed off on a 10-percent import tax on all imports of aluminium with China firmly in the administration’s sights. Separately, the United States is still slapping anti-dumping duties on specific Chinese products. Aluminium foil has already been hit with swingeing countervailing duties and the net has just been widened to include aluminium alloy sheet. This is the dilemma for the rest the world. It now desperately needs Chinese exports of primary metal to rebalance the market but simultaneously still needs lower exports of products. China’s own aluminium production sector, meanwhile, is experiencing plenty of its own turbulence. The closure last year of “illegal” capacity, meaning that operating without all the correct permits, and mandated curtailments at some plants during the winter smog campaign have slowed production growth to just 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018. It’s true that the winter heating season cuts have disappointed aluminium bulls. But the environmental pressure on the aluminium smelting sector shows no signs of letting up any time soon. Adding new uncertainty is a draft proposal from the National Development and Reform Commission targeting aluminium producers drawing their power from captive coal plants and stipulating retroactive power payments to the government. Hongqiao, the world’s largest aluminium producer and one that is heavily reliant on coal, could be particularly vulnerable. At this stage the proposal is no more than that and there is likely plenty of wriggle-room for such a big industrial powerhouse and employer. But the key takeaway here is that Beijing’s scrutiny of its aluminium sector is only getting sharper as it targets both excessive capacity and polluting industries. At any other time in recent history China’s giant smelter sector could have been relied upon to lift production in response to rocketing prices. Right now, however, price is only part of a more complex landscape defined by “illegal” capacity closures, winter curtailments and, now, the longer-term viability of coal as a source of the power needed to produce the metal. The global aluminium industry continues to pay the price of Chinese excess. With over half of the world’s aluminium production concentrated in one country, there is no cushion outside of China to compensate for diminished flows of metal from Rusal. Moreover, what is clearly available right now in China, namely the million tonnes sitting in Shanghai warehouses, is trapped behind China’s export tax. What is flowing in ever increasing quantities out of China is in the wrong form for the rest of the world, which now needs more primary aluminium and less product. This problematic reliance on China has been growing for many years but it’s taken the hit on the largest non-Chinese producer to expose the dysfunctional nature of the global aluminium supply chain.

Brent crude oil futures were at $73.79 per barrel at 0028 GMT, up 31 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 29 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $68.76 a barrel. Brent on Wednesday marked its highest level since November, 2014 at $73.93 per barrel. WTI hit its strongest since December, 2014 at $68.91 a barrel. Reuters reported on Wednesday that top oil exporter Saudi Arabia would be happy to see crude rise to $80 or even $100 a barrel, which was seen as a sign that Riyadh will seek no changes to an OPEC supply-cutting deal that was introduced in 2017 to boost prices. “The Saudis and their colleagues in OPEC need higher oil for their fiscal positions and the Kingdom is on a bold – and costly – reform programme. So they might continue to squeeze the lemon while they have the chance,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Led by Saudi Arabia, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of other producers that includes Russia started to withhold output in 2017 to rein in oversupply that had depressed prices since 2014. Since the start of the voluntary restraint, crude inventories have been gradually declining from record levels towards long-term average levels. Further supporting oil prices is an expectation that the United States will re-introduce sanctions against OPEC-member Iran, which could result in further supply reductions from the Middle East. In the United States, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that commercial crude stocks fell by 1.1 million barrels in the week to April 13, to 427.57 million barrels, which is close to the five-year average level around 420 million barrels. With crude prices on the rise, those producers not participating in voluntary restraint are ramping up output. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016, to a record 10.54 million barrels per day (bpd). That’s more than Saudi Arabia produces. Only Russia churns out more oil, at almost 11 million bpd. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-04-19,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The public prosecutor’s office in the northern state of Amapá recommended on Wednesday that Brazil’s environmental regulator Ibama deny French major Total a license to drill for oil near the mouth of the Amazon. The office said in a statement the company’s environmental impact study was insufficient and warned that drilling in the area could result in the destruction of an ecosystem where a coral reef has been found. Scientists aboard a Greenpeace ship have documented the existence of coral in an area off the northern coast of Brazil and Total’s plans to drill for oil should be banned, the environmental organization said on Monday. Greenpeace said on Monday that scientists aboard a ship have established that the reef extends further than previously thought and overlaps the perimeter of two blocks that Total plans to explore. Total led a group including Britain’s BP Plc and Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras in buying five exploration blocks in the Foz do Amazonas basin in 2013, but the discovery of a massive coral reef just 28 kilometers (17 miles) from the blocks has thrown environmental approval for drilling by Ibama into doubt. As the operator, Total is responsible for applying for environmental licenses. Some geologists say the area could hold up to 14 billion barrels of oil or more than the entire proven reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. Environmentalists said potential oil leaks in the Foz do Amazonas basin, named for its location near the mouth of the Amazon river, could wreak havoc in the rainforest in Brazil’s far northern Amapá state in addition to harming the reef.

2018-04-19,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) said on Wednesday that recent events confirm an investment in the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion may be “untenable” and said Ottawa’s pledge of financial support does not resolve political risk related to British Columbia’s opposition. The comments come as the British Columbia (B.C.) government pledged to file a legal challenge by month-end to determine whether it has the jurisdiction to stop the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) project, which was approved by the federal government in 2016 and would nearly triple capacity on the pipeline from Alberta to a Vancouver-area port. Kinder Morgan Canada (KML.TO), a unit of Kinder Morgan, halted most spending on the expansion earlier this month and set a May 31 deadline to decide if it would scrap the project entirely, citing legal and jurisdictional issues. “As we said then, it’s become clear this particular investment may be untenable for a private party to undertake. The events of the last 10 days have confirmed those views,” Chief Executive Steven Kean said on a conference call. While Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada is prepared to offer financial aid to ensure the project goes ahead, Kean dodged a question about whether that support would ensure construction. “They’re really two separate things,” he said. “Most of the investment is in British Columbia, where the government is in opposition to the project ... That is an issue that, in our view, needs to be resolved.”  The Trans Mountain expansion is considered crucial for Alberta’s oil industry which has been beset by transportation bottlenecks. It is fiercely opposed by some B.C. cities, some aboriginal groups, and environmentalists concerned about possible oil spills. The company said while it is not in a position to move on takeovers until the uncertainty around Trans Mountain is resolved, it sees good opportunities in the western Canadian midstream space. “There are some very capable players with good midstream assets,” Kean said, adding: “Intent is, and was, that KML would be the vehicle to invest in those opportunities.”  The company has a strong balance sheet and is well positioned for takeovers, especially if cash earmarked for capital projects is freed up, said M. Paul Bloom, investment manager with Bloom Investment Counsel. “I think you can expect if the Trans Mountain pipeline does not go ahead (Kinder Morgan) will be bidders for various assets here in Canada, and probably fairly quickly as well,” he said. Kinder Morgan Canada, which was spun off from parent Kinder Morgan in May last year, reported a net income of C$44.4 million ($35.17 million) for the first quarter ended March 31, down from C$46.8 million for the same period last year.  Texas-based Kinder Morgan separately reported net income available to common stockholders of $485 million, or 22 cents per share, in the quarter to the end of March, compared with $401 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier.  Shares of Kinder Morgan were up 1.6 percent at $16.43 in after-hours trading. Canadian shares closed up 2.8 percent at C$17.99, while the broader energy index rose 3.57 percent.
