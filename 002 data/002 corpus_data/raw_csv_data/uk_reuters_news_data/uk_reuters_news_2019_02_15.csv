2019-02-15,"DAURA/YOLA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigerian authorities postponed Saturday’s national election by a week, just hours before polls had been due to open, prompting the opposition candidate to accuse President Muhammadu Buhari of seeking to “disenfranchise” voters. The electoral commission said the postponement was due solely to logistical factors and denied political pressure had played any part in the decision. Buhari and his rival, former vice president Atiku Abubakar, both urged voters to stay calm. Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, said the election would now be held on Feb. 23, adding that the date was “sacrosanct” and that campaigning would be suspended until then.  Buhari, in power since 2015, faces a tight election contest against Atiku of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and its top oil producer. Nigerians expressed dismay and anger over the delay, in a country where 84 million people have registered to vote. Past elections have been marred by violence, intimidation and ballot-rigging, and the postponement raised the possibility of unrest. “They (the government) are not following the rule of law... This is a total ploy, it is not true that they are not ready” said opposition supporter Oscar Humphrey, 37, in the northern city of Kano, a key battlefield in the presidential race. In President Buhari’s hometown of Daura in northern Nigeria, student Dauru Balarabi also expressed dismay, saying he had gone there specially to vote. “I spent my morning, my time, my energy for the elections so actually I am not happy,” he said.  The electoral commission’s Yakubu attributed the decision to delays in transporting electoral materials. “(The postponement) has nothing to do with security, nothing to do with political influence, nothing to do with availability of resources,” he told a gathering of foreign election observers and reporters. He said some sensitive election materials had been distributed but all had been retrieved and returned to the central bank and an audit would now be conducted. In Nigeria the central bank stores election materials for safe keeping. PDP chairman Uche Secondus said the postponement was “dangerous to our democracy”. He called it part of an attempt by Buhari to “cling on to power even when it’s obvious to him that Nigerians want him out”. Buhari, who was Nigeria’s military ruler in the early 1980s, expressed disappointment over the delay but urged Nigerians in a statement to “refrain from all civil disorder and remain peaceful, patriotic and united”.  Atiku urged voters to be patient but later said Buhari’s administration was behind the delayed elections, without offering any evidence. “By instigating this postponement, the Buhari administration hopes to disenfranchise the Nigerian electorate in order to ensure that turnout is low on the rescheduled date,” he said on Twitter. Buhari’s spokesman Garba Shehu declined to comment. Observer missions from the European Union, the African Union and other organisations urged Nigerians in a statement “to remain calm and supportive of the election process” and said  the electoral commission must adhere strictly to the new date. “No matter who wins, it is now far more likely that the loser will contest the result and argue that the election has been compromised because sensitive materials are out there,” said Bismarck Rewane, economist and CEO of Lagos-based consultancy Finance Derivatives.  Situation Room, an organisation of more than 70 civil society groups, said the postponement had harmed the credibility of the electoral commission, creating “needless tension and confusion”. Nigeria’s presidential elections in 2011 and 2015 were also delayed over logistics and security issues. Six people were killed in a bomb blast in the northeastern city of Maiduguri by suspected Islamist militants on Saturday morning, the State Emergency Management Agency said, despite increased security measures in much of the country. Maiduguri is the capital of Borno, the state worst hit by the Boko Haram militant group and its offshoot, Islamic State in West Africa Province. Boko Haram had warned people not to vote.

2019-02-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition has no plans to use funds belonging to U.S. refiner Citgo, which is owned by state oil company PDVSA, despite having named a new board for the company this week, the self-declared interim government’s U.S. envoy said on Friday. The opposition will not make changes to the refining company’s management or operations until Juan Guaido, the leader of Venezuela’s opposition-controlled Congress who swore himself in as president last month, has control of state functions, said Carlos Vecchio, Guaido’s representative in Washington. “We are not touching that money. It belongs to Citgo as a corporation,” Vecchio said in an interview. “We want Citgo in financial health and for operations to continue, and for that money to stay there for when we are able to take effective control of power and the state’s institutions, including PDVSA.” Citgo, which owns about 4 percent of U.S. oil refining capacity, has become central to the power struggle between Guaido and embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro since the United States slapped sanctions on state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, last month.  The sanctions require U.S. companies importing Venezuelan crude to make payments into an account held in escrow for Guaido’s government, in a bid to oust Maduro, who has overseen a collapse in oil production in the OPEC nation, which is undergoing a severe economic and humanitarian crisis. Vecchio said the opposition had not yet opened an account with any U.S. financial institution.  The sanctions also complicate Venezuela’s ability to make an April payment on PDVSA’s 2020 bond, for which  part of Citgo has been put up as collateral. That could prompt creditors to attempt to seize the refining company’s assets, a situation Vecchio said Guaido’s team wanted to avoid. PDVSA has also been struggling to refinance a revolving line of credit by a July deadline, people close to the matter said. Guaido has invoked Venezuela’s constitution to claim the presidency, arguing that the May 2018 vote resulting in Maduro’s re-election was a sham. Maduro has called Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet, and vowed that he will not allow Citgo to be “stolen.”  Vecchio said the opposition upon taking power would prioritize attracting private investment to boost oil production, which has fallen to near 70-year lows, but had no plans to privatize PDVSA.  “There is a very clear consensus that PDVSA should be maintained as property of the state,” Vecchio said. “But if we want to increase production as much as we hope, most of the investment is going to have to come from the private sector because the state will not have anything to invest.” He added that Venezuela would not leave OPEC, the oil producers’ cartel of which it is a founding member, but also would not accept any OPEC deals that would limit the South American country’s efforts to boost oil production. “As I see it, OPEC today has a diminished role on the world stage because it does not have the market it once had,” Vecchio said, citing growing U.S. crude output.

2019-02-15,"(Mexican government corrects figure in headline and first paragraph to $3.9 billion from $3.6 billion) By Ana Isabel Martinez and David Alire Garcia MEXICO CITY, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Mexico will inject $3.9 billion into ailing state oil company Pemex, officials said on Friday, promising to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade, although investors saw the plan as only a short-term fix. Falling oil output, corruption and high labor costs have contributed to the decline of the company that was once a symbol of national pride. It now holds roughly $106 billion in financial debt, the highest of any national oil company in Latin America. Fitch and Moody’s rate its credit one notch above junk. Fitch said on Friday that the plan, which includes additional tax cuts, more government spending on the company and debt refinancing, would likely not be enough to prevent “continued deterioration” in Pemex’s credit quality. The agency cited an ongoing “significant level of underinvestment” for Pemex. Pemex will receive $1.8 billion in pension liability monetization as part of the new plan and finances will be helped by a corruption clampdown, officials said in a presentation that was short on details. They vowed the Mexican government will not take on new debt in 2019. Pemex must make more than $27 billion in debt payments over the next three years. Investors said they had expected stronger measures, and while encouraged by government vows of support, they said the plan offered only short-term relief. “The measures are not a long term fix and won’t be enough to stabilize oil output,” said Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics. If oil prices and output decline further, he estimated yields on Pemex bonds could rise by around 1 percent this year. The price fell after the announcement for Pemex’s most heavily traded bond on Friday, maturing in 2047, as its yield rose 14 basis points, according to MarketAxess data. The price on a Pemex bond maturing in 2024 also dropped, with its yield up 32 basis points, reflecting bondholder skepticism of the plan. The Mexican peso weakened by more than half a percent against the dollar after the announcement, before recovering later on Friday. Over time, Pemex taxes will go down and the capital injection will allow debt refinancing over the year, Finance Minister Carlos Urzua told a press conference. If Pemex requires more help, the government will do whatever it takes to keep Pemex’s finances healthy, he added. Fitch downgraded debt issued by Pemex by two steps last month, making it the second agency after Moody’s to put the company just barely within its investment grade category. The move stoked fears that further credit downgrades could significantly raise Pemex’s financing costs and result in dire fiscal consequences for the government. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December and ran on a promise of strengthening Pemex, did not fully detail in his comments at the press conference how the government would finance the company’s lower tax bill and capital injection. He said efforts since late December to battle rampant fuel theft would result in savings of about $1.6 billion, however, while a plan to increase production will generate more resources. “It’s injecting resources, it’s lowering the tax obligation,” Lopez Obrador said. “But above all, it’s cleaning out corruption from Pemex.” Investors had expected a stronger response, said Luis Gonzali, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments. Even so, he praised the administration’s “unconditional support” to double down on relief measures if necessary. Wilbur Matthews, founder of Vaquero Global Investment, also saw the announcement as positive. “It is a good sign that the Lopez Obrador administration recognizes that Pemex needs to change profoundly,” he said. The company is in talks with lenders to potentially raise up to $7 billion this year, Refinitiv IFR reported on Friday. The company has previously said it would refinance around $6.6 billion in 2019.

2019-02-15,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China will resume trade talks next week in Washington with time running short to ease their bruising trade war, but U.S. President Donald Trump repeated on Friday that he may extend a March 1 deadline for a deal and keep tariffs on Chinese goods from rising. Both the United States and China reported progress in five days of negotiations in Beijing this week. Trump, speaking at a White House news conference, said the United States was closer than ever before to “having a real trade deal” with China and said he would be “honored” to remove tariffs if an agreement can be reached. But he added that the talks were “very complicated.” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Friday the two economic superpowers “will continue working on all outstanding issues in advance of the March 1, 2019, deadline.  “These detailed and intensive discussions led to progress between the two parties. Much work remains, however,” Sanders said about the Beijing talks. She added that the two countries agreed to state any commitments they make in a memorandum of understanding. China’s Vice Premier and chief trade negotiator Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would be leading the talks in Washington, a White House source said. U.S. duties on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1 to address U.S. demands that China curb forced technology transfers and better enforce intellectual property rights.  Trump, asked whether he would grant Beijing a 60-day extension to the deadline, said: “There is a possibility that I will extend the date. But if I do that - if I see that we’re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction - I would do that at the same tariffs that we’re charging now, I would not increase the tariffs.” Trump also said he would consider bringing top U.S. Democrats - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer - into the final stages of the talks to minimize their dissent with the deal. Spokespersons for the two lawmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The conclusion of the Beijing talks prompted optimism on Wall Street, where major stock indexes ended higher. The U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies doing business in China, applauded the announcement that the two sides would put specific language in a memorandum of understanding and said its existence could cause the Trump to push back deadline. “It does appear that enough progress has been made to possibly extend the deadline,” said Craig Allen, president of the Washington-based group. “The memorandum of understanding might not finish all the details, but if it contained the final picture ... that would be a huge step forward.” Chinese state news agency Xinhua said on Friday that China and the United States had reached a “consensus in principle” on some key issues, adding they had a detailed discussion on a memorandum of understanding on trade and economic issues. It gave no details. The countries focused this week on technology, intellectual property rights, agriculture, services, non-tariff barriers and currency, and discussed potential Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services to reduce a “large and persistent bilateral trade deficit,” Sanders said.  Chinese President Xi Jinping met Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday after a week of talks at senior and deputy levels, and called for a deal both sides could accept, Chinese state media said. After talks on Thursday, Mnuchin said on Twitter that he and Lighthizer had held “productive meetings” with Xi’s top economic adviser, Liu He.  “The consultations between the two sides’ teams achieved important step-by-step progress,” Xi said, according to state television. “I hope you will continue efforts to advance reaching a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. He added that China was willing to take a “cooperative approach” to settling bilateral trade frictions. Lighthizer told Xi the senior officials had “two very good days” of talks.  “We feel that we have made headway on very, very important, and very difficult issues. We have additional work to do but we are hopeful,” Lighthizer told Xi in a pool video shown to foreign media. Neither country has offered new details on how they might de-escalate the tariff war that has roiled financial markets and disrupted manufacturing supply chains. Although Trump said this week that an extension of the tariff deadline was possible if a “real deal” was close, Larry Kudlow, director of the U.S. National Economic Council, has said the White House had made no such decision.  But several sources informed about the meetings told Reuters there was little indication negotiators had made major progress on sticking points to pave the way for a potential meeting between Xi and Trump in coming weeks to hammer out a deal. “Stalemate on the important stuff,” said one source. All of the sources requested anonymity because the talks are confidential.  “There’s still a lot of distance between parties on structural and enforcement issues,” said a second source. “I wouldn’t quite call it hitting a wall, but it’s not a field of dreams either.” A third source told Reuters the White House was “irate” over earlier reports that the Trump administration was considering a 60-day extension of the tariff deadline.

2019-02-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Progress in the U.S.-China trade talks helped send world stock markets broadly higher on Friday and pulled investors out of the safety of government bonds.  Europe’s broad Stoxx 600 index rallied 1.4 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 443.86 points, or 1.74 percent, to 25,883.25, the S&P 500 gained 29.87 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,775.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.46 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,472.41.  China and the United States reached a consensus in principle on some key issues during the talks, China’s state news agency Xinhua said on Friday. Negotiations will continue next week in Washington as investors hope for an end to the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.  “The next potential steps in the U.S. protectionist push could be pivotal for the global outlook,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists wrote in a note. “With the trade war already starting to hurt the U.S., we expect the Trump Administration to pull its punch.”  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.82 percent. The index is up nearly 10 percent for the year.  Emerging markets were set for their first back-to-back weekly loss since late last year. The MSCIEF index of emerging- market stocks dropped 0.7 percent, leaving it up approximately 7.6 percent for the year.  Though there were signs of progress in the trade discussions, some investors remained cautious on whether tariffs would soon be eliminated.  “We expect that the longer-term direction of tariffs on imports from China is likely to be downward, but we expect this to be a gradual process and believe that some of the recently imposed tariffs might still be in effect through the 2020 election,” economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note.  The broad stock rallies helped pull investors out of the safety of government bonds, sending yields higher. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.6626 percent, from 2.659 percent late on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill Friday that prevented another partial federal government shutdown by funding several agencies that otherwise would have closed on Saturday morning.  The dollar index fell 0.11 percent, with the euro down 0.05 percent to $1.1293. Crude oil reached 2019 highs above $65 per barrel after OPEC-led supply cuts and a bigger-than-expected cut by Saudi Arabia this week encouraged investors. The global Brent benchmark gained 2.2 percent to $66.01 per barrel. It has risen over 4.5 percent this week.

2019-02-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 2 percent to their highest this year on Friday after an outage at Saudi Arabia’s offshore oilfield boosted expectations for tightening supply, while progressing U.S.-Sino trade talks strengthened demand sentiment.  The international Brent crude benchmark rose $1.68, or 2.6 percent, to settle at $66.25 a barrel, its highest since November.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up $1.18, or 2.2 percent, at $55.59 a barrel, and hit their highest this year in post-settlement trade at $55.80. For the week, Brent ended more than 6 percent higher and WTI gained more than 5 percent, partly on tightening supplies since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia started voluntary production cuts last month.  The partial closure of Saudi Arabia’s Safaniya, the world’s largest offshore oilfield, occurred about two weeks ago, a source said on Friday. Safaniya has production capacity of more than 1 million barrels per day. It was not immediately clear when the field would return to full capacity. “It’s another factor that is raising concerns about the availability of crude,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “All of a sudden you don’t have to worry just about OPEC cuts. Now you have a problem with Saudi Arabia’s ability to actually produce as much oil.” Leading OPEC producer Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday it would cut an additional half a million bpd in March more than it previously pledged. Supply has also been curbed by U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan and Iranian crude and reduced Libyan output because of civil unrest. Security threats could threaten Nigerian production after general elections this weekend. Growing confidence that the United States and China will resolve their ongoing trade dispute also supported prices. Those talks will restart next week in Washington, with both sides saying this week’s negotiations in Beijing showed progress. “Optimism surrounding a potential trade deal has really been the big issue here in the United States the last couple days,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.

2019-02-15,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week increased the number of oil rigs operating for a second week in a row amid concerns that crude supplies will swamp global demand as U.S. output keeps growing from record levels. Companies added three oil rigs in the week to Feb. 15, bringing the total count to 857, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.     The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still higher than a year ago when 798 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. Thanks to a shale boom, the United States became the world’s top crude producer last year and record output is expected to rise 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to 12.4 million bpd this year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly forecast on Tuesday. The International Energy Agency warned in its monthly report this week that the global oil market will struggle this year to absorb fast-growing crude supply from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, highlighting U.S. output growth. However, U.S. drillers have removed on average of 28 rigs this year so far as a lack of pipeline capacity in the Permian basin, the largest U.S. oil shale field, landlocked some output and as investors pushed producers to reduce spending and boost shareholder returns. The price of crude in the Permian of West Texas and New Mexico fell sharply last year, selling as much as $18 below U.S. benchmark prices.  More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian where active units fell by five this week to 473, the lowest since June. Pioneer Natural Resources Co, one of the Permian’s largest producers, said this week it plans to reduce 2019 capital expenditures by 11 percent, or about $350 million, slowing its production growth. U.S. crude futures were trading around $55 a barrel on Friday, up about 5 percent for the week as OPEC-led production cuts encouraged investors.  Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $57 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and calendar 2020.  The EIA projected West Texas Intermediate spot crude would average $54.79 in 2019 and $58.00 in 2020, down from an average of $65.06 in 2018. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said this week that early indications from the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks point to a 3 percent decline in capital expenditures for drilling and completions in 2019. In total, Cowen said those E&P companies spent about $93.1 billion in 2018. There were 1,051 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes.

2019-02-15,"LONDON, Feb 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Saying adults were not doing enough to deal with increasingly serious threats from climate change, thousands of school children across Britain missed classes and packed protests Friday, demanding faster action to protect their future. “We will go back to school when you make the climate cool,” read one homemade sign in London’s Parliament Square - one of more than 60 protest locations across the country, organisers of the Youth 4 Climate strike said. Young protesters - some in their school uniforms - whistled, chanted, waved signs and for a time blocked traffic outside Parliament, climbing on top of a red doubledecker tourist bus to demand, “Change! Now!”. Orla de Wardener, 10, said she had been inspired by the example of Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old student whose regular Friday protests outside Sweden’s parliament have led to a spreading international school strike movement. After reading about Thunberg in a children’s science magazine, “I was totally enthralled with her. She’s amazing,” said de Wardener, a student at Weston Park Primary School near Finsbury Park in north London. Adults, she said, do not act on climate change because “they’re involved with their money and their work. They don’t care,” said de Wardener, who sported a polar bear hat and a hand-coloured sign reading, “Your failure, our future”. Politicians, she said, “have had their life. They don’t see much point in fighting for the future”. Her classmate, 9-year-old Iris Adderley, said she was worried about the quickening pace of extinctions in nature, and the risks of sea level rise, including flooding in Britain. “Adults just don’t think about it enough,” she said. Nora Mackay, 15, a student at Graveney School in Tooting, south London, said her school’s administration had discouraged students from attending the protest, “but everyone is here anyway”, she said. “My parents said go on the march. The future of the world is more important than one day of school,” she said, standing with dozens of placard-waving classmates in the square. Christiana Figueres, who was U.N. climate chief when the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change was agreed, said she hoped politicians would heed the “deeply moving voice of youth and schoolchildren, who are so worried about their future”. That children feel they need to strike to draw attention to the problem “is a sign we are failing in our responsibility to protect them from the worsening impacts of climate change,” she said. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said students were taking action because “young people know their lives are going to be changed dramatically by the impacts of climate change”. “The risks that older people hope they might dodge are the problems the young will inherit,” he warned in a press release. “While we’re failing to deliver the changes young people need, we can hardly blame them for taking action themselves.” Global temperatures are on course for a rise of 3 degrees to 5 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, far overshooting a global target of limiting the increase to 2C or less, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization says. That is bringing growing risks from extreme weather - including worsening droughts, floods, fires and storms - as well as threats of worsening hunger, poverty and water shortages, scientists say. Limiting those risks will require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes” to the world’s energy systems and to human behavior, scientists said in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released last October. Friday’s protests are just the latest in an international string of youth strikes and efforts to sue governments to protect future generations, many of them led by people too young to vote. Organisers of the British protests said their demands included more information about the “ecological crisis” in the national curriculum, declaration of a national “climate emergency” and a lowering of the national voting age to 16. Many of the students at the Parliament Square protests said they were taking action in their own lives to cut climate-changing emissions, from eating less meat to cutting out airline flights and walking or biking more. Others said they and many of their classmates were choosing to write speeches and essays on climate change as part of their schoolwork, and that they saw the issue becoming a hot topic on social media. Many of Friday’s protests were organised via social media, with participants saying they had read up on climate change there. Zakiyya, 14, who attends Clapton Girls’ Academy in Hackney in east London and asked that her surname not be used, said she became a vegan last year, after learning how much meat and dairy production drove climate-changing emissions. “This is our lives, our future. If we want to live, we need to make changes now,” she said, carrying a sign pleading, “We are scared. Listen to us!” Bruno Olliffe of Norwich in the east of England said he and his family had taken up recycling, but he thought the most powerful way to bring change was to convince parliamentarians of the need - one reason he’d traveled to London with his mother. Right now, “they’re too stuffed up with Brexit,” said the 12-year-old. When it comes to climate change, “they don’t realise how bad it is. But we do.” Speeches by Thunberg and naturalist David Attenborough had made it clear, he said, that “the impacts will hit the whole world, every corner”. “It’s my future, and I don’t want it to be ruined,” he said.

2019-02-15,"(Reuters) - A Citgo Petroleum Corp refining unit in Aruba plans to dismiss workers following sanctions imposed by the United States on Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA, the parent company of the U.S. refining firm, the island’s prime minister said on Friday. President Donald Trump’s administration last month disclosed  tough sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), barring U.S. customers from paying the company for exports until a team led by Venezuelan congress head, Juan Guaido, arranges its own bank accounts to support his interim government.  Citgo in 2016 signed a 15-year lease with the government of Aruba, agreeing to refurbish and reopen an idled 209,000-barrel-per-day refinery previously run by U.S. refiner Valero Energy. Citgo had hired about 300 workers and four contracting firms for the project, which has faced delays due to lack of financing and sanctions imposed since 2017 on PDVSA.  It was unclear on Friday how many employees could be laid off. Citgo did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  “Our government contacted refinery executives to avoid it (the layoff plan). Unfortunately, it is not entirely in our hands due to the tense and confusing situation in Venezuela,” Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes said in a statement.   The layoff notice was passed by Citgo to the government in a meeting last Thursday, she said.  Wever-Croes also said that the Caribbean nation is not involved in military action related to Venezuela amid U.S. efforts to move humanitarian aid from the nation’s borders.

2019-02-15,"(Updates through midday U.S. trading.) By David Randall NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Progress in the U.S.-China trade talks helped send world stock markets broadly higher on Friday and pulled investors out of the safety of government bonds. Europe’s broad Stoxx 600 index rallied 1.4 percent. In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 359.04 points, or 1.41 percent, to 25,798.43, the S&P 500 gained 24.12 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,769.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 35.31 points, or 0.48 percent, to 7,462.26. China and the United States reached a consensus in principle on some key issues during the talks, China’s state news agency Xinhua said on Friday. Negotiations will continue next week in Washington as investors hope for an end to the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. “The next potential steps in the U.S. protectionist push could be pivotal for the global outlook,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists wrote in a note. “With the trade war already starting to hurt the U.S., we expect the Trump Administration to pull its punch.” MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.65 percent. The index is up nearly 9 percent for the year. Emerging markets were set for their first back-to-back weekly loss since late last year. The MSCIEF index of emerging- market stocks dropped 0.7 percent, leaving it up approximately 7.6 percent for the year. Though there were signs of progress in the trade discussions, some investors remained cautious on whether tariffs would soon be eliminated. “We expect that the longer-term direction of tariffs on imports from China is likely to be downward, but we expect this to be a gradual process and believe that some of the recently imposed tariffs might still be in effect through the 2020 election,” economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note. The broad stock rallies helped pull investors out of the safety of government bonds, sending yields higher. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.6698 percent, from 2.659 percent late on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump was expected to sign a bill Friday that would prevent another partial federal government shutdown by funding several agencies that otherwise would have closed on Saturday morning. The dollar index rose 0.06 percent, with the euro down 0.24 percent to $1.1272. Crude oil reached 2019 highs above $65 per barrel after OPEC-led supply cuts and a bigger-than-expected cut by Saudi Arabia this week encouraged investors. The global Brent benchmark gained 2.2 percent to $66.01 per barrel. It has risen over 4.5 percent this week. U.S. crude rose 2.1 percent to $55.58 per barrel.

2019-02-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Thousands of British children marched out of lessons on Friday to demand action on climate change, earning a mild rebuke from the prime minister’s office for disrupting classes, but praise from the energy minister and activists. Youngsters marched on Parliament Square in London and gathered in other cities carrying banners marked with “Climate change is worse than homework”, “Act now for our future” and other slogans. “My teacher told me kids shouldn’t be going out, but we went because it’s important,” 11-year-old Rio told Reuters. A spokeswoman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said that while the government welcomed the students’ engagement, the disruption to schools and lessons would be difficult for teachers.  Her energy minister Claire Perry however said she was “incredibly proud” of the young people while opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn expressed his support for the “school kids of today whose futures are most on the line”. Earlier this week, 224 academics from Oxford, Cambridge and other universities declared their support for the students in an open letter published in The Guardian.  “(Those taking part in the strike) have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken,” they wrote.  The British protests were part of a global ‘School Strike 4 Climate’ movement, which began in August 2018 when 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg began protesting outside her parliament on school days.

2019-02-15,"MUNICH (Reuters) - U.S. military aircraft are expected to deliver more than 200 tons of humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan border in Colombia, with the shipment likely to take place on Saturday, a U.S. official said on Friday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. State Department planned to make an announcement about the shipment on Friday but provided no further details. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. special envoy on Venezuela last week said the aid effort was being coordinated with the opposition team but said the aid would not be forced into Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has overseen an economic collapse in the oil-rich South American country that has left millions struggling to buy food and medicines and has fueled an unprecedented migration crisis in the region. An aid convoy supplied by the United States and Colombia arrived in the Colombian border town of Cucuta last week, where it is being held in warehouses. Maduro has refused to let supplies in. Self-declared president Juan Guaido, the opposition leader, told a huge rally of supporters on Tuesday that humanitarian aid would enter the country on Feb. 23.  Guaido invoked constitutional provisions to declare himself interim president last month, arguing that Maduro’s 2018 re-election was a sham. Most Western countries, including the United States and many of Venezuela’s neighbours, have recognised Guaido as the legitimate head of state. Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China and control of Venezuelan state institutions including the military. Seeking to strengthen support for Guaido, the United States has said it will try to channel aid to Venezuela via Colombia and possibly Brazil.  Maduro has called the aid a U.S.-orchestrated show and denies any crisis. However, opposition member Gustavo Tarre has said the sole aim is to ease “the suffering of Venezuelans” and has denied any political, economic or military motive.

2019-02-15,"* Indian agreement cements over 8.5 mtpa in committed offtake * Anadarko says another deal expected in “very near” future * Project will turn Mozambique into major gas exporter (Adds Anadarko comment on other agreements, PTT) By Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. independent energy producer Anadarko moved closer to a final investment decision (FID)to build a giant liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Mozambique after signing up an Indian buyer for the gas and saying another deal was imminent. Anadarko and Exxon Mobil are expected to sanction two separate but neighbouring LNG projects in Mozambique this year after finding large offshore gas deposits, turning the African nation into a major global gas exporter. The company said on Friday it had struck a sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with India’s Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd for 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) for 15 years, the fourth such agreement this month. This brings the total commitments Anadarko has for the project to 8.5 mtpa out of a capacity of 12.88 mtpa, a level it has previously said would allow it to make the investment. “We anticipate announcing another SPA in the very near future,” Helen Rhymes, an Anadarko spokeswoman, said in emailed comments, reiterating that the final decision would come in the first half of this year. Other committed buyers, according to Anadarko, are Tokyo Gas and Britain’s Centrica in a joint deal, Royal Dutch Shell, Chinese state energy firm CNOOC, Tohuku Electric and French utility EDF. Anadarko hinted at further supply agreements late on Thursday when it issued its annual report and said “execution of SPAs representing 2.0 mtpa of additional contracted volume is anticipated prior to FID”. Anadarko had penned an non-binding supply agreement with PTTEP, the exploration and production arm of Thailand’s state energy firm PTT, which also holds a 8.5 percent stake in the project. Rhymes said that deal still needed approval from Thai authorities. “Anadarko and its Area 1 co-venturers continue to work with PTT toward the conclusion of the SPA. However, we are not reliant on completing this agreement to take FID in the first half of this year,” she said. Indian state energy firms Bharat, ONGC and Oil India hold a 30 percent equity stake in the project either directly or through subsidiary joint ventures but this is the first offtake agreement with an Indian buyer. India is the world’s fourth largest LNG importer after Japan, China and South Korea - a position it is expected to consolidate in years to come with growing imports.

2019-02-15,"* Police and military deployed nationwide * Past votes marred by violence, intimidation and rigging * Uptick in Islamist attacks in recent months By Lanre Ola MAIDUGURI, Nigeria Feb 15 (Reuters) - Nigeria bolstered security in much of the country on Friday on the eve of a presidential election in Africa’s largest democracy where past ballots have been marred by violence, voter intimidation and vote rigging. The two leading candidates in Saturday’s vote are President Muhammadu Buhari, who took office in 2015, and Atiku Abubakar, a businessman who served as vice president from 1999 to 2007. The country, which has Africa’s largest economy, is dealing with pockets of instability: authorities are trying to tackle a decade-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast and communal violence between farmers and nomadic cattle herders in central states, along with banditry and kidnappings in the northwest. Dozens of combat policemen and members of other security forces were deployed from police headquarters in Maiduguri, capital of Borno state that has been worst hit by Boko Haram and its off-shoot, Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). “There are about 14,000 security personnel deployed for the election purpose. This deployment also includes 11,000 policemen,” said Borno’s police commissioner, Damian Chukwu. Military vehicles and soldiers were seen moving toward volatile parts of the state, which has seen an uptick in attacks by ISWAP in recent months. The group said it carried out an attack on the convoy of Borno’s governor earlier this week. In Kano, a hotly contested state that is the economic hub of the north, police said at least 15,000 officers would be deployed for the election with a further 5,000 from other services. That compares with just over 10,000 officers on duty on a normal day. Muhammad Wakili, commissioner of police for Kano state, promised a “violence-free” poll. Kano is the most populous state in the northwest, a region that accounts for nearly a quarter of Nigeria’s voters. It has been a Buhari stronghold in the last three elections and his posters outnumber those of Atiku. In Adamawa, Atiku’s northeastern home state where he will vote, a police spokesman said more than 7,500 officers had been deployed, significantly more than the usual number on the streets. Atiku spent much of the day in meetings with members of his party in Yola, the state capital of Adamawa. Buhari worshipped at a mosque in Daura, his hometown in the northwest, which sits near the border with Niger. Additional reporting by Aaron Ross in Kano, Paul Carsten in

2019-02-15,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has proposed incentives worth 885 billion rupees ($12.4 billion) to encourage power plants to install equipment to curb emissions and to develop infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs), a government statement said on Friday.   The bulk of the money, 835 billion rupees, would be aimed at curbing sulphur emissions from power plants, with the rest devoted to development of EV infrastructure in 70 cities over five years ending 2025, the statement said. The proposal by India’s power ministry to its finance commission is in addition to an existing proposal that envisages installation costs for emission-cutting equipment to be passed on to consumers. The ministry’s plans come against the backdrop of a utilities sector under financial stress, with loans from mostly state-run lenders turning sour or requiring restructuring, according to an Assocham-Grant Thorton report this month. The Association of power producers, an industry group that represents private companies such as Reliance Power and Adani Power as well as state-run NTPC, had been lobbying for incentives for the past two years. India has already extended a December 2017 deadline for utilities to meet emissions standards by up to six years as power producers struggle to comply with stringent rules set out by the environment ministry in 2015 to cut emissions that cause lung diseases, acid rain and smog. Thermal power companies account for 80 percent of all industrial emissions of particulate matter, sulfur and nitrous oxides in India. The EV incentives, meanwhile, are part of India’s efforts to encourage higher sales of electric vehicles, having said it hopes to electrify all new vehicles by 2030.

2019-02-15,"(Corrects reference in 7th paragraph to Mexico government bond, not Pemex bond) By Ana Isabel Martinez and David Alire Garcia MEXICO CITY, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Mexico will inject $3.6 billion into ailing state-owned oil company Pemex, including by reducing taxes and refinancing debt, officials said Friday, promising to do “whatever is takes” to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade. Falling oil output, corruption and high labor costs have contributed to the decline of the company that was once a symbol of national pride. It now holds roughly $106 billion in financial debt, the highest of any national oil company in Latin America. Fitch and Moody’s rate its credit one notch above junk. Investors said they had expected stronger measures to avoid further downgrades, but were reassured by the commitment to more action in the future if required. “The announcement is positive and could be enough to remedy the company additional financial needs for 2019,” said Edgar Cruz, global markets credit research at BBVA in Mexico, while warning that it would not stave off another crunch next year. Over the next three years, Pemex must make more than $27 billion in debt payments. Pemex will receive $1.8 billion in pension liability monetization as part of the new fiscal assistance plan for the company and finances will be helped by a corruption clamp-down, officials said in a presentation that was short on details. They vowed the Mexican government will not take on new debt. The Mexican peso weakened by more half a percent against the dollar in morning trading after the announcement. Mexico’s 10-year bond was down around half a percent, before recovering slightly. Over time, Pemex taxes will go down, and the capital injection will allow debt refinancing over the year, Finance Minister Carlos Urzua said, adding that if Pemex requires more help, the government will provide it. “This will allow Pemex ... to not need to take on new debt, just refinancing,” Urzua said. “The federal government ... will do what it takes to keep finances healthy in the case of Pemex, starting this year.” Rating agency Fitch downgraded debt issued by Pemex by two steps last month, making it the second agency after Moody’s to put the company just barely within its investment grade category. The move stoked fears further downgrades by Fitch or other credit ratings agencies could significantly raise the oil company’s financing costs and result in dire fiscal consequences for the government. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, did not fully detail how the government will finance Pemex’s lower tax bill and additional capital injection. He said efforts since late December to battle rampant fuel theft in Mexico will result in savings of about $1.6 billion, while a plan to increase production will generate more resources. “It’s injecting resources, it’s lowering the tax obligation,” he said at the press conference. “But above all, it’s cleaning Pemex of corruption, and that will let us take the company forward.” Investors had expected a stronger response, said Luis Gonzalez, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments in Mexico City, noting that the capital boost plus lowered taxes would still barely save Pemex from needing refinancing this year. However, he praised the commitment to double down on relief measures if necessary. “The unconditional support they expressed for the oil company is positive,” he said. The company is in talks with lenders to potentially raise up to $7 billion this year, Refinitiv IFR reported on Friday. The company has previously said it would refinance around $6.6 billion in 2019. The immediate priority, according to the IFR report, is renewing a $1.5-billion revolving credit facility that matures later this year, said three banking sources that have lent to Pemex in the past.

2019-02-15,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has asked one buyer of Venezuelan oil to consider paying the South American nation’s national oil company PDVSA in a way that avoids the U.S. financial system, an Indian government source said, after Washington imposed fresh sanctions on Venezuela last month. The United States is seeking to cut off Venezuela’s oil revenue and pressure the nation’s President Nicolas Maduro to step down after it recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as head of state.  The sanctions mean that if oil buyers pay PDVSA through the U.S. banking system, the funds could be seized by U.S. authorities. There may also be problems for transactions by banks that have a heavy U.S. presence even if they aren’t in U.S. dollars and don’t go through the United States.  The Indian buyer “expressed concern that there could be a problem in payments to PDVSA, so we have advised them to move away from the U.S. banking and institutional mechanism”, said the source, who did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. He declined to name the buyer. Most Western countries have recognised Guaido as Venezuela’s interim head of state, but Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China as well as control of state institutions including the military. The sanctions limit U.S. refiners to paying for Venezuelan oil by using escrow accounts that cannot be accessed by Maduro’s government.  India still recognises Maduro as Venezuela’s leader, which means “it does not make sense to shift to the other (escrow) payment avenue”, the source said. India’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday said the country was monitoring the evolving situation in Venezuela. “We are of the view that it is for the people of Venezuela to find a political solution, to resolve the political differences through constructive dialogue and discussion without resorting to violence,” ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said. Purchases of oil are based on “commercial” factors, he said. India, Venezuela’s second-biggest oil market after the United States, has already restricted oil imports from Iran to win a waiver from U.S. sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear and missiles programmes.  Top importers of Venezuelan crude: tmsnrt.rs/2BIRAqH The U.S. sanctions have forced Venezuela to turn its focus increasingly to Asia to sell its oil.  India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, and Nayara Energy, part-owned by Russian oil major Rosneft and trader Trafigura, are the two Indian buyers of Venezuelan oil. Trafigura itself has decided to stop trading oil with Venezuela due to sanctions. India’s Oil Ministry, Reliance and Nayara did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comment for this story. Venezuelan Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo this week travelled to India in an attempt to convince refiners to boost their purchases. The OPEC member aims to double oil sales to India from the current 300,000 barrels per day, he said. Quevedo told reporters he would like to see the creation of a non-dollar trading bloc involving China, India and Russia. After Quevedo’s visit, White House National Security Advisor John Bolton tweeted: “Nations and firms that support Maduro’s theft of Venezuelan resources will not be forgotten. The United States will continue to use all of its powers to preserve the Venezuelan people’s assets and we encourage all nations to work together to do the same”.     In a note to clients on Tuesday, banking group Barclays said it would be difficult for Venezuela to find new markets in Asia given the stringent nature of the sanctions. “Considering all the difficulties that Venezuela faces in delivering oil to other markets and the legal, reputational and financial risks confronting traders or counterparties that do business with it under the current conditions,” the bank wrote, “It seems unlikely that all production can, in short order, go to other markets.” Reporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Martin Howell and Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-venezuela-oil/exclusive-india-advises-refiner-to-avoid-u-s-system-for-venezuela-oil-buying-source-idUKL3N20A3VS,15 Feb 2019,"India has asked one buyer of

In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 303.2 points, or 1.19 percent, to 25,742.59, the S&P 500 gained 22.14 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,767.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 31.40 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,458.35 in morning trading. China and the United States reached a consensus in principle on some key issues during the talks, China’s state news agency Xinhua said on Friday. Negotiations will continue next week in Washington as investors hope for an end to the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. “The next potential steps in the U.S. protectionist push could be pivotal for the global outlook,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists wrote in a note. “With the trade war already starting to hurt the U.S., we expect the Trump Administration to pull its punch.” MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.57 percent. The index is up nearly 9 percent for the year. Emerging markets were set for their first back-to-back weekly loss since late last year. The MSCIEF index of emerging- market stocks dropped 0.7 percent, leaving it up approximately 7.6 percent for the year. Though there were signs of progress in the trade discussions, some investors remained cautious on whether tariffs would soon be eliminated. “We expect that the longer-term direction of tariffs on imports from China is likely to be downward, but we expect this to be a gradual process and believe that some of the recently imposed tariffs might still be in effect through the 2020 election,” economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note. The broad stock rallies helped pull investors out of the safety of government bonds, sending yields higher. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.6644 percent, from 2.659 percent late on Thursday. The dollar index rose 0.11 percent, with the euro down 0.28 percent to $1.1267. Crude oil reached 2019 highs above $65 per barrel after OPEC-led supply cuts and a bigger-than-expected cut by Saudi Arabia this week encouraged investors. The global Brent benchmark gained 1.5 percent to $65.57 per barrel. It has risen over 4.5 percent this week. U.S. crude rose 1.7 percent to $55.35 per barrel.

2019-02-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Changing gas price dynamics caused by an influx of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe have played into Russian producer Gazprom’s hands and enabled it to increase pipeline flows to the continent so far this year. Gazprom is moving determinedly with spot gas sales in Europe due to a near-fivefold spike in U.S. LNG sales to the continent in October to January compared with a year earlier. But sales within Gazprom long-term contracts are also rising. In January, Gazprom gas flows to Europe totalled 17.6 billion cubic metres (bcm), an almost 0.5 bcm rise from the same month a year earlier, Gazprom data shows. One reason for the rise is a change in time spreads on European wholesale gas contracts, which is enabling some traders to increase purchases in long-term deals with Gazprom or through spot auctions by the company. This trend shows how LNG, which has flooded Europe since October, is reshaping gas prices and flows in the continent, with traders still adjusting to the new market environment. “LNG has really changed the situation,” a gas trader said. “We have to write new textbooks.” A jump in LNG supplies contributed significantly to oversupply in the European gas market, leading to high storage levels and pushing down price spreads. Day-ahead gas prices in most European countries are almost on par with summer contract prices, which makes it more profitable to buy gas on the prompt market rather than withdraw it from storage sites. “When you look at storages, due to the day-ahead pricing (being) flattish (compared) to the summer, it makes sense not to withdraw as you can’t cover the withdrawal fees with the spread between the day-ahead and summer,” a London-based trader said. This week, the day-ahead price on the Dutch hub has traded slightly below the summer 2019 contract price. A year ago it was trading almost 10 percent above the summer contract.     Dutch wholesale gas prices: tmsnrt.rs/2TPsxJq “At the current day-ahead to summer spread it makes sense to reduce withdrawal and keep (the long-term contract with Gazprom) running,” a trader in continental Europe said. Gas traders have a bearish outlook for both contracts, meaning Gazprom’s flows could remain high until the end of March, with Europe entering the summer season with multi-year-high storage levels.     Gazprom’s trading arm, Gazprom Marketing and Trading, has also been more active on European hubs selling gas, traders said. In the spot market, Gazprom has been selling gas in auctions it launched in September.  In February, the majority of gas in auction has been sold for prompt delivery so far, while in January traders bought more February contracts, expecting cold weather.  Traders said the price in auctions is usually very close to that on European hubs, showing Gazprom is becoming more flexible with its price strategy to win buyers on the continent.  Refinitiv analysts expect storage in northwest Europe, excluding Britain, to close the winter season at around 190 terrawatt hours (TWh), against 50 TWh at the end of March 2018.  Gas storage levels in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Germany: tmsnrt.rs/2TShShc This would be the highest stock level since 2016 and pressure summer gas contracts further. The Dutch summer price is 8 percent cheaper this week than a year ago and is showing the biggest discount to the next winter contract in seven years. Summer contracts in Europe are widely forecast to be very weak this year, a trader said.  “(But) what everyone expects is not usually what happens as it’s priced in well.” Reporting by Ekaterina Kravtsova; Additional reporting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Nina Chestney and Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/lng-europe-russia/analysis-european-lng-influx-plays-into-gazproms-hands-this-winter-idUKL5N20983S,15 Feb 2019,"Changing gas price dynamics

2019-02-15,"(Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc was not surprised by renewed opposition from Minnesota’s state government to its C$9 billion Line 3 but still expects the oil pipeline replacement to enter service by year-end, its chief executive said on Friday.  The pipeline passes through Minnesota as it runs from Alberta to Wisconsin. Line 3, opened in 1968, runs at half its capacity because of its age and corrosion. Replacement would allow Enbridge to restore its flow to 760,000 barrels per day. Canadian oil producers say the project is critical to expanding their congested transport options, but some groups in Minnesota say it would harm the environment and indigenous areas. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said this week that the state’s commerce department will ask Minnesota’s Public Utilities Commission to reconsider its Line 3 approval. “It’s common for regulatory decisions to be challenged,” Enbridge Chief Executive Al Monaco said on a quarterly conference call. “Although we certainly don’t agree with (the commerce department’s) views, we’re not surprised by the filing.” Minnesota’s commerce department had argued to the commission in June that Enbridge had failed to prove the pipeline is necessary. Pending the state’s appeal and Enbridge’s applications for federal, state and municipal permits, its construction schedule in Minnesota is flexible to bring the 1,031-mile (1,660-km) pipeline into service as planned, Monaco said.  Construction crews need to be working by June to meet the schedule, said Guy Jarvis, president of Enbridge’s liquids pipelines business. Enbridge shares rose 0.5 percent in Toronto to C$47.57. Enbridge topped analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Friday, as it moved more crude oil and refined products along its pipelines.  The Calgary, Alberta-based company said it transported 2.7 million bpd of crude oil on its Mainline system across Canada and the United States during the quarter, up from 2.6 million bpd in the year-ago quarter.  Net income rose to C$1.09 billion ($820.35 million), or 60 Canadian cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from C$207 million, or 13 Canadian cents per share.    On an adjusted basis, the company earned 65 Canadian cents per share. Analysts had expected 62 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2019-02-15,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian major Eni said it intends to expand in the Middle East after a spree of deals in the Gulf last year,  pressing ahead with plans to reduce its reliance on Africa and oil and gas exploration. Since last March Eni has secured nine deals in the United Arab Emirates, gained a foothold in Bahrain and expanded in Oman to underpin its future growth. Last month it pledged $3.3 billion to buy part of the world’s fourth-biggest refinery in the UAE, increasing its own refining capacity overnight by more than a third. Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said on Friday there were huge opportunities to grow in the Gulf area and rebalance the group’s operational portfolio. “It’s not finished, we’ve just started,” he told analysts on a conference call after its fourth-quarter results, adding long-term the group aimed to produce 100,000 barrels per day in the area. Eni, which generates more than half its output in Africa, produced a record 1.851 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, lifted by operations in Egypt, Indonesia and Kazakhstan. Giant gas discoveries in Mozambique and, more recently, Egypt have given the energy major the strongest discovery record in the industry, boosting its credentials with oil-producing nations. “We’ll be able to enter new markets thanks to our technology and know-how,” Descalzi said. The 63-year-old said that besides the Gulf Eni is also looking to Asia to boost its gas prospects as well as Alaska to increase its oil production. “That’s a main oil target for us,” he said. Eni said it had made a 470 million euro ($529.50 million) writedown on reserves in Venezuela where it has a 50 percent stake in the giant Perla gas field and 40 percent of the Junin 5 oilfield. “Outstanding arrears with the country amount to about $700 million,” said CFO Massimo Monduzzi. A deep economic and social crisis in Venezuela has seen output plummet and the recent move by Venezuela’s opposition to oust president Nicolas Maduro has made matters critical. In the fourth quarter Eni’s adjusted net profit jumped 55 percent to 1.459 billion euros ($1.65 billion), above an analyst consensus forecast of 1.19 billion euros. Free cash flow after dividends was the highest since 2006, with excess cash for the year of 3.8 billion euros. Massimo Bonisoli, oil analyst at Milan-based broker Equita, said that the strong set of results showed the improvement in the group’s asset portfolio. “The improvement of shareholders’ remuneration is likely through buy-back and some dividend increase in 2019,” he said in a note. At 1419 GMT Eni shares were up 2.1 percent while the European oil and gas sector was up 1.2 percent.

2019-02-15,"LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. independent energy producer Anadarko has notched up another long-term commitment to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its proposed Mozambique terminal, moving closer to approving the multi-billion dollar project. Anadarko and Exxon Mobil are expected to sanction two separate but neighbouring LNG projects in Mozambique this year after finding giant offshore gas deposits, turning the African nation into a major global gas exporter. The company said on Friday it had struck a sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with India’s Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd for 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) for 15 years. The deal now gives Anadarko over 8.5 mtpa in offtake commitments from the project, a level it previously stated would allow it to take a final investment decision (FID). The initial capacity of the two-train terminal is 12.88 mtpa. Anadarko has said it would take the FID in the first half of this year and, in an annual report it released late on Thursday, it signalled that another long-term agreement would be announced before it sanctions the project. Other committed buyers, according to Anadarko, are Tokyo Gas and Britain’s Centrica in a joint deal, Royal Dutch Shell, Chinese state energy firm CNOOC, Tohuku Electric and French utility EDF. In its annual report, Anadarko said it had SPAs of more then 7.5 mtpa and that “execution of SPAs representing 2.0 mtpa of additional contracted volume is anticipated prior to FID.” With the Bharat deal adding another 1 mtpa, this indicates Anadarko expects to announce another SPA before approving the project. Indian state energy firms Bharat, ONGC and Oil India hold a 30 percent equity stake in the project either directly or through subsidiary joint ventures but this is the first offtake agreement with an Indian buyer. India is the world’s fourth largest LNG importer after Japan, China and South Korea - a position it is expected to consolidate in years to come with growing imports.

2019-02-15,"PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in French EDF fell almost 6 percent on Friday after the state-controlled utility cut its dividend and said there was no guarantee that it could repeat 2018’s double-digit core earnings growth. EDF forecast core earnings of 15.3 billion to 16 billion euros ($18.1 billion), below analyst expectations for about 16 billion and with the low end of the forecast range only just above last year’s 15.25 billion. “We are not sure some of the positive elements in our 2018 will be repeated in 2019,” EDF CEO Jean-Bernard Levy told reporters on a call.  He said that besides exceptionally good hydropower earnings, 2018 trading results were also above what could be expected in a normal year, but added that wholesale power prices should be slightly higher this year. “It is possible our 2019 results would be close to those of 2018, but we hope that they will not come in at the lower end of our forecast range,” Levy said. EDF shares were down by 5.5 percent at 14.03 euros by 1305 GMT, having fallen as low as 13.94 euros earlier. Investment bank Jefferies, which kept a “buy” rating on EDF, said that EDF’s latest guidance was some 4 percent below consensus expectations. “At first glance, the more moderate year-on-year growth compared to expectations may be due to lower open exposure to power prices, normalization of French hydro output and weaker results in EDF’s UK business,” the bank’s analysts wrote in a note. In a call with analysts, finance chief Xavier Girre said, however, EDF was confident it would be able to grow core earnings in 2019. EDF proposed a 31 cent dividend, in line with forecasts but down from 46 on 2017 earnings, with the option of payment of the dividend balance in new shares. EDF said the state, which owns an 83.7 percent stake, would take the balance of the 2018 dividend in shares and would do the same for dividends on 2019 and 2020 earnings.  Nuclear output in France totaled 393.2 terawatthour, up 3.7 percent on 2017, when several reactors were closed for long safety-related outages. For this year, EDF forecast only a small increase to 395 TWh.  Hydropower output jumped 25.4 percent to 46.5 TWh as a wet 2018 followed a dry 2017.  The utility’s 2018 sales were up 6.3 percent to 68.98 billion euros and core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were up 11.1 percent to 15.25 billion, both in line with forecasts.  But earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) were down 6.3 percent to 5.28 billion and net income plunged 63 percent to 1.18 billion due to a fall in fair value of debt and equity on dedicated assets. EDF said it would again target positive cash flow, excluding costs linked to its Hinkley Point, UK nuclear project and the rollout of its Linky smart meters in France.  Its 2018 cash flow was 1.13 billion before Linky, “new developments” and asset sales, but taking account of these elements and after the payment of its dividend, cash flow fell 271 million euros to minus 480 million euros.

2019-02-15,"(Adds details and context) MUNICH, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Germany is considering changes to the legal framework governing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to make sure that it complies with new European Union regulations, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told Reuters on Friday. The EU this week agreed new rules for gas import pipelines, stipulating that the pipelines should not be owned by gas suppliers and that third parties should also be able to use them. The new EU deal casts doubt over the structure of Russia’s planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which already faces uncertainty after Denmark’s potential ban on its planned route which includes Danish territorial waters. Altmaier said the pipeline could still be built under the new conditions but there would clearly be some changes. “One regarding the ownership of the pipeline, since European law requires ownership of pipeline and production to be separated,” Altmaier said on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. “There may also be changes regarding who has access to the pipeline and who can feed it.” The pipeline, currently under construction under the Baltic Sea and fully owned by Russia’s state-owned Gazprom, is seen by Berlin as a primarily commercial project that is essential to Germany’s ongoing energy security. But Eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries see the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline as increasing EU reliance on Moscow. The project also faces opposition from Washington. Altmaier said it was in Germany’s interest that the pipeline be built “together with our European partners”, but that any amendments to the project to allow it to meet the new conditions had to be Germany’s decision alone.

2019-02-15,"ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Pakistan plans to borrow another 200 billion rupees ($1.44 billion) to help clear power sector debt destabilising the finances of the government and private power producers, a senior official tasked with energy reforms said. Pakistan’s economy and society have been racked by a decade of chronic electricity shortages which have crippled its manufacturing industries and stoked voter anger in the South Asian nation of 208 million people. Electricity shortages have eased in the last 12 months but years of mismanagement and funding shortfalls for subsidies have led to accumulated power sector payment arrears, or “circular debt”, soaring to 1.4 trillion rupees ($10.1 billion). Independent power producers (IPPs) angry with late government payments have warned they face a financial crisis, while economists fear rising circular debt will further widen Pakistan’s yawning fiscal deficit, a key part of ongoing bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund. Pakistan earlier this month raised 200 billion rupees through an Islamic bond to ease a financial crunch in its power sector, but critics say much more needs to be done. Nadeem Babar, head of the Task Force on Energy Reforms created by new Prime Minister Imran Khan, told Reuters the government plans to ease financial pressures on power generation companies by taking another 200 billion rupee loan by April. “That total of 400 billion will not bring the outstanding amount down to zero, but it will pay it down substantially to a point where no generator will be at risk of shutting down or having liquidity issues,” Babar told Reuters on Thursday. The loans are a key part of the government’s strategy to rethink how it deals with power arrears and will give the government breathing room to enact wide-ranging reforms, Babar added. He said Khan’s government is looking to save money by moving power sector arrears from the balance sheet of the independent power producers (IPPs) on to the balance sheet of government-owned distribution companies. Under Pakistan’s power purchasing system, IPPs bill the government monthly for the power they produce, but when the government fails to pay up, power generators take commercial bank loans to stay afloat and the government is hit with financial penalties for late payments. “In the past, to keep debt off the government’s power companies’ balance sheet, the government has allowed a run up of the same debt on IPP balance sheets - but at what cost?,” said Babar, who is currently writing Pakistan’s 25-year future energy policy. “The finance minister has understood and agreed that it is nonsensical that we are paying about 3 percent higher interest rate to keep this debt off our balance sheet when we acknowledge that it is our debt,” said Babar. Pakistan hiked electricity prices in January and the new tariff, set to gradually increase over the next two and half years, will drastically slow the accumulation of circular debt and will eventually help eradicate it, Babar said. Transmission losses and theft are also being aggressively targeted by the government, he added. $1 = 139 rupees

2019-02-15,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Global commodities firm Trafigura has decided to stop trading oil with Venezuela due to U.S. sanctions on the OPEC nation’s energy sector, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.  The decision will come as a blow to Caracas as Swiss-based Trafigura has a long-standing arrangement with state-run PDVSA to take Venezuelan crude and, in exchange, supply the Latin American country with refined products.  Washington imposed fresh sanctions on PDVSA last month to cut off a key source of revenue for President Nicolas Maduro. The move came after congress head Juan Guaido invoked constitutional provisions to become interim president, arguing that socialist Maduro’s re-election last year was a sham.  Last year, trading company Trafigura directly took 34,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan crude and products, which were mostly resold to U.S. and Chinese refineries, according to internal PDVSA trade documents seen by Reuters.  Trafigura will stop business with PDVSA after completing a small number of already-concluded trades, the source said. Due to the size of Venezuela’s oil-for-loan agreements with China and Russia and the weight of previous U.S. sanctions, cash-strapped PDVSA has become increasingly reliant on intermediaries to export its crude and import refined products.  PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trafigura is due to load two cargoes of Venezuelan crude before the end of February, the source with direct knowledge and a shipping source said.  It was not immediately clear whether these two tankers were the last of the already-concluded trades, or how many - if any - product tankers would be sent in return. For the trading firm, the decision means giving up a source of crude supply for Russia-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy, in which Trafigura holds a near 25 percent stake. Nayara would still be able to buy Venezuelan crude through Russia’s Rosneft and other intermediaries.     The U.S. sanctions limit U.S. refiners to paying for Venezuelan oil by using escrow accounts that cannot be accessed by Maduro’s government. Foreign firms that use the U.S. financial system for oil trading or U.S. units are similarly restricted, cutting off avenues for PDVSA to collect revenue.  In an effort to ease domestic fuel shortages, PDVSA’s imports skyrocketed last year. Its own refining system is hobbled by technical failure, a lack of investment, delayed maintenance and insufficient crude supply. In the last three months of 2018, Venezuela exported about 1.45 million bpd of crude and products. Trading houses lifted 225,000 bpd of that, according to the PDVSA documents and Refinitiv Eikon data. Exports to the United States, Venezuela’s primary export customer, have since dried up, as well as those to other destinations, with loaded tankers left stranded off Venezuelan ports.

Europe’s STOXX 600 gained 0.8 percent, with German equities staging a strong recovery from early losses. Talks between China and the United States this week made important progress, President Xi Jinping told top U.S. trade negotiators, and efforts to end their trade war would continue in Washington next week. “The next potential steps in the US protectionist push could be pivotal for the global outlook,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists wrote in a note. “With the trade war already starting to hurt the U.S., we expect the Trump Administration to pull its punch.” Germany’s main stock index, exposed to the Chinese economy because of its large number of exporters, climbed 0.7 percent by late morning after falling as much as 0.5 percent. European car stocks, a bellwether for the continent’s economy, also turned positive, gaining 0.5 percent after earlier falling 1 percent on declining sales and an approaching deadline for a U.S. Commerce Department report that could see tariffs imposed. European stocks had earlier fallen after a U.S. report that retail sales had dropped in December to their lowest since 2009 and data on Chinese producer prices, which were little changed for a seventh straight month in January. {nUSNEDEFQ3] MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, ticked up 0.1 percent after. Emerging markets were set for their first back-to-back weekly loss since late last year. The MSCIEF index of emerging- market stocks dropped 0.7 percent. Asian shares fell after the U.S. retail sales report. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1 percent as markets in Seoul, Tokyo and Shanghai posted losses. “After hot markets of late, a little bit of cold water has been poured on bourses over the last 24 hours,” said Deutsche Bank’s strategist Jim Reid. SPANISH SNAP ELECTION Spanish government bond yields rose after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called a snap election for April 28, potentially spelling months of uncertainty in the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy. In currency markets, the Indian rupee weakened after New Delhi warned Pakistan of a strong response to a car bomb attack in Kashmir. India would remove trade privileges for its neighbour, its finance minister said, a move that could set back annual bilateral trade worth almost $2 billion. The Japanese yen and other safe-haven currencies had gained as markets awaited developments in the U.S.-Sino trade saga. The dollar recovered after the dismal U.S. retail figures, trading up 0.1 percent at 97.055 against a basket of major currencies. The euro was 0.2 percent lower at $1.1272 and headed for a second week of losses. It is down by 1.7 percent so far this year after discouraging economic data from the euro zone. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.6483 percent , wiping out most of its rise this week. Commodities were strong all morning. Crude oil briefly reached 2019 highs above $65 per barrel after OPEC-led supply cuts and a bigger-than-expected cut by Saudi Arabia this week encouraged investors. The global Brent benchmark last traded at $65.01, up 0.7 percent from the last close. It has risen over 4.5 percent this week.

2019-02-15,"NEW DELHI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - India’s oil imports from Iran fell by 45 percent in January to 270,500 barrels per day oil (bpd), ship tracking data reviewed by Reuters showed, below the estimated 300,000 bpd for the month as some cargoes were delayed. The United States introduced sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s oil revenue-dependent economy in November but gave a six-month waiver to eight nations, including India, which allowed them to import some Iranian oil. India is restricted to buying 1.25 million tonnes per month, some 300,000 bpd. January imports from Iran were 10.4 percent lower than December, the tanker arrival data showed. Iran was the seventh biggest oil supplier to India in January compared with sixth in December, and slipped from third position it held a year ago. Last month Tehran’s share in India’s overall oil imports declined to about 6 percent from about 10 percent a year earlier, the data showed. After abandoning the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to end Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile programme and curb its support for militants in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. In the first 10 months of this fisal year that began in April, India’s oil imports from Iran rose by 14.5 percent to 507,000 bpd as refiners boosted purchases ahead of the U.S. sanctions drawn by discounts offered by Tehran, the data showed. Iran was hoping to sell more than 500,000 bpd of oil to India in 2018/19, its oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said last year, and had offered almost free shipping and an extended credit period to boost sales to the country. Indian refiners Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petrolum Corp, Mangalore Refinery and Petroleum Corp and Indian Oil Corp would lift same volume in March as they took in February, a governemnt official said. In February, IOC placed an order for 5 million barrels, MRPL for 2 million barrels and HPCL and BPCL for 1 million barrels each. None of the companies responded to a Reuters email seeking comments. In the previous fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2018 Indian refiners cut purchases from Iran due to a dispute on the award of development rights of a giant gas field. Government sources say Reuters’ calculations showing India’s oil imports from Iran in this fiscal year would be higher than the 452,000 bpd, or 22.6 million tonnes, it imported in the previous year, were correct. India’s total oil imports in January were about 4.6 million bpd, a decline of about 10.4 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.

Jet will receive 15 billion rupees ($210 million) from the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund in return for a 20 percent stake and it may also seek to raise 45 billion rupees via a rights issue priced at 125-150 rupees per share, the news channel reported, citing unnamed sources. The funds would come as a huge relief for the airline that is in dire need of money to pay off debt, pilots and aircraft lessors as it also grapples with competition from budget rivals, high oil prices and a weaker rupee. Jet and the fund were not available for comment on Friday. On Thursday, Jet said its board had approved a rescue plan in which a consortium led by State Bank of India would swap some of Jet’s debt for 114 million shares, doubling the company’s outstanding stock. Jet shares were volatile, dropping as much as 4.8 percent when trading opened on Friday and rising up to 7.5 percent later. The stock was at 232 rupees by 1022 GMT. Jet’s short Thursday filing with the stock exchange lacked detail but investors read it as a sign of improvement. “There is expectation that the company will survive,” said Gagan Dixit, an analyst with Elara Capital. “We believe that most bankers, lenders and lessors believe in the long-term sustainability of the company if they can gradually reduce their costs.” For an interactive graphic on the airline's market value, click tmsnrt.rs/2V2ef8x Jet, whose financial woes are set against the backdrop of wider aviation industry problems, has been in the red for four straight quarters. Flag carrier Air India is also struggling to stay afloat. Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces the tough decision of whether to bail it out as his government fights for a second term in general assembly polls come May. Under Jet’s rescue deal with lenders, it is unclear how much debt will be swapped for equity or how much money the lenders will infuse. Analysts, however, estimate lenders will hold a nearly 50 percent stake. The dilution is likely to halve stakes of Chairman Naresh Goyal and second-largest shareholder Etihad Airways, who currently own 51 percent and 24 percent, respectively. The plan needs to be approved by shareholders at a special meeting on Feb. 21 and by regulators. “There is a prospect of dilution for minority shareholders,” said Ansuman Deb, an analyst with ICICI Securities. But “if banks are willing to forego some debt and take 50 percent stake, that will be a good thing”, he added. An Etihad spokeswoman declined to comment. The Abu Dhabi carrier saved Jet the last time it was in trouble, pumping in $600 million for a stake in the airline, three take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow and a share in Jet’s frequent flyer programme.

After opening lower, Europe’s STOXX 600 nudged up 0.2 percent despite weakness in German equities. Demand for safe-haven currencies remained strong. Stocks fell after a U.S. report that retail sales had dropped in December to their lowest since 2009 and by data on Chinese producer prices, which were little changed for a seventh straight month in January.

Investors in Asia took fright early after the U.S. retail sales report. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1 percent as market in Seoul, Tokyo and Shanghai all lost ground. Worries about the United States, which many considered a bright spot in the world economy, offset some optimism over trade talks in Beijing between the United States and China.

2019-02-15,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to buy German residential solar battery maker sonnen, as the oil and gas major expands its electricity business in its bid for a bigger role in the global transition to low-carbon energy. Sonnen, which has 40,000 battery systems worldwide and in 2017 had sales of 65 million euros ($73 million), is the German market leader in home storage batteries and has expanded into electric vehicle charging systems. Regulatory approval and completion of the transaction, involving Shell New Energies, was expected in the first quarter of 2019, a sonnen spokesman said, without giving a value. Sonnen would continue to operate from the Bavarian town of Wildpoldsried and its top management would stay on, he said. Germany has 1.5 million solar systems whose subsidized sales tariffs are due to be phased out in coming years. By acquiring batteries, householders can store home-produced power and use it for themselves or sell it to the grid. Shell, the world’s second largest listed oil and gas producer, has accelerated investment in renewable energy and power markets, betting on a rapid rise in electricity demand due to electric vehicle use and a switch to cleaner energy sources. It has acquired vehicle charging technologies, solar power producers and retail energy supplier First Utility. Shell injected cash into sonnen last year to help it grow.

2019-02-15,"* Kotak says India needs to remove infrastructure logjam * Govt needs to create bigger local private equity pool * Analysts say India heading for consumption-led slowdown * Cenbank has trimmed growth forecast for April-Sept qtr MUMBAI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - India should kick-start private investment via policy measures or tax breaks if it does not want to stay stuck at a 7 percent growth rate, Uday Kotak, managing director and chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, told CNBCTV18 in an interview. “India has the fundamental capacity and we need to create a situation where the ground capacity will be growing at somewhere between 8 and 9 percent,” he said on the sidelines of an event organised by Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. The Reserve Bank of India earlier in the month moderated its growth forecast to 7.2-7.4 percent for the April-September period, after economic growth in the country fell to a worse-than-expected 7.1 percent in the July-September quarter. “We have got to really fix that piece because the key is private investment,” Kotak said, late on Thursday in the interview. Sluggish private investment growth is a blot on the five-year rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is often seen as pro-industry. Modi’s decision in November 2016 to suddenly ban large banknotes, so-called demonetisation, and the abrupt implementation of goods and services tax (GST) six months later, hit businesses hard. The infrastructure logjam that has occurred due to a lack of liquidity in the system, also needs to be removed, said Kotak, whom the government hand-picked to lead major infrastructure financing and construction firm IL&FS after a string of defaults from the firm triggered fears of a liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector.. The IL&FS imbroglio dried up lending from NBFCs at a time when private companies were already dealing with reluctant banks wary of lending due to their massive bad debt woes. Kotak said that due to the IL&FS debacle, the current situation was fragile, but he added that it was more due to investor fears than a systemic problem. Still, analysts at brokerage firm Ambit said in a report on Friday that India was headed for a consumption-led slowdown as seen from multiple sector indicators.

2019-02-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - EDF Energy, one of Britain’s big six energy suppliers, lost 200,000 customers in 2018, French parent company EDF said in its group results on Friday. Britain’s large energy suppliers are facing competition from more than 60 smaller challengers which now control around 25 percent of the market, up from just 1 percent around seven years ago. EDF Energy’s residential accounts for gas and electricity fell to 4.9 million combined, the company said. EDF’s UK arm also said the suspension of payments under Britain’s capacity market, to provide electricity during high demand, had cost the company 69 million pounds. A European Union court ruling last year forced Britain to halt payments under the scheme, but Britain’s government says it expects to make retrospective payments once it is reinstated. “We are confident the Capacity Market suspension will be lifted and that these payments will be made in due course,” EDF said in a statement. Generation at EDF’s British nuclear fleet fell 7.5 percent to 59.1 terrawatt hours mainly due to prolonged outages at four of its 15 UK reactors.

2019-02-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - New York State said on Thursday it had received proposals from Norway’s Equinor and three joint ventures to build its first offshore wind power park of at least 800-megawatt capacity. The three joint ventures are Bay State Wind, between Danish Orsted and Eversource Energy; Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, consisting of France’s EDF and Shell; and Vineyard Wind, between Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid Renewables, the New York States Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) said in a statement. New York state closed bidding on.ny.gov/2E54m5q for the park on Thursday, a part of its push to increase renewable energy production, and will choose a supplier in the spring. “The response to New York’s inaugural solicitation for 800 megawatts or more of offshore wind is unprecedented and historic,” NYSERDA said.  Proposals include projects to build up to 1,200 MW of capacity, which if constructed would be the largest offshore wind project in the United States, it added. Equinor, which won a U.S. federal auction in 2016 to lease 80,000 acres south of Long Island, said the area could potentially allow it to build an offshore wind park of up to 2,000 MW. The company says on its website that investments for a 1 GW offshore wind project would typically be about $3 billion.  EDPR, a renewable energy arm of Portuguese energy firm EDP, had been among the companies which expressed preliminary interest to bid by the Dec. 20 deadline.  EDPR was not immediately available to comment. NYSERDA said the first offshore wind solicitation should help advance New York State’s plans to reach a goal of building 9,000 MW of offshore wind capacity by 2035. Unlike Europe, the United States is taking initial steps in developing the country’s offshore wind capacity, but its huge market has already attracted key players. Equinor, previously known as Statoil, has also said it was looking at possibility of building floating offshore wind turbines in deeper waters off the U.S. coastline.

2019-02-15,"(Adds detail, context) JOHANNESBURG, Feb 15 (Reuters) - South Africa’s struggling state power firm Eskom suspended electricity cuts on Friday but said the power system remained vulnerable, after five days of rolling outages which weakened the rand and hurt businesses across the country. Eskom supplies over 90 percent of the power in Africa’s most industrialised economy but has been grappling with power station breakdowns and diesel shortages which have curbed its ability to run backup power sources. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who faces a parliamentary election in May, has pledged to reform the utility by splitting it up and providing financial support but has ruled out privatisation. The rand was on course for a loss of more than 3 percent against the dollar this week, largely because of Eskom’s woes, which risk derailing a sluggish economic recovery. “Due to further improvement in generation performance and the notable strides made in replenishing water and diesel reserves, Eskom is not likely to implement load-shedding on Friday,” Eskom said in a statement, using a local term for power cuts. Eskom started the power cuts on Sunday and intensified them to 4,000 megawatts (MW) of cuts on Monday in the worst outages South Africa has seen since 2014/15. The power cuts had been reduced to 2,000 MW by Thursday. The power crisis has caused traffic gridlock in major cities as traffic lights stop working and frustration for ordinary South Africans. Businesses like miner Harmony Gold are exploring strategies to reduce their dependence on Eskom. The government has promised more details about how it will support Eskom’s balance sheet on Feb. 20, when the finance minister will deliver a budget speech in parliament. One of Eskom’s major issues is its unsustainable debt mountain of around 419 billion rand ($30 billion). $1 = 14.1358 rand

2019-02-15,"PARIS (Reuters) - A French wind power tender has attracted interest from a slew of international energy heavyweights, signalling that France’s offshore wind industry could finally be taking off after years of missteps. While Britain and Germany have already built 8,200 and 6,400 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind capacity - enough to power millions of homes - France does not have a single turbine in the water. In two previous French tenders, in 2012 and 2014, a bumper 3,000 MW of capacity worth 11 billion euros (9.7 billion pounds) was awarded, but the projects have not materialised because of public opposition and contract wrangles. Now, France is making a new start, auctioning a modest 600 MW in the northern town of Dunkirk in a tender it hopes will finally exploit some of the best offshore wind potential in Europe.  So far, investors appear to like the prospects.  Ten interested companies or consortia, including some of Europe’s leading offshore wind developers, have been shortlisted to submit bids by a March 15 deadline, although one has pulled out, according to three industry sources.  However, despite the investor interest, strong public opposition to wind farms in France that has constrained the development of the industry for years remains a major obstacle and could yet derail the planned schemes. The shortlist includes French power giants EDF, in partnership with Germany’s Innogy and Canada’s Enbridge; and Engie with Portugal’s EDPR.  Among the foreign bidders are Norwegian oil major Equinor; Royal Dutch Shell with France’s Quadran and Belgium’s DEME; Swedish utility Vattenfall with French state bank CDC and German wind developer WPD; and Dutch utility Eneco in a consortium including Canada’s Boralex. “This tender will set the tone for the future of offshore wind in France,” said Tako Keja, director of Moulins de Flandre, the Shell-Quadran-DEME consortium. Those six parties have either made public their interest, or confirmed to Reuters that they would bid. Belgian firm Elicio, Belgian-French consortium ParkWind-Valeco and Belgian-Danish owned InControl will also take part in the tender, according to the industry sources. Dunkirk is close to Belgium, which already has 1,200 MW offshore capacity. Spain’s Iberdrola was also shortlisted but has since withdrawn, but Denmark’s Orsted - Europe’s top offshore wind developer - was in talks to join one of the consortia, one source said. Iberdrola and Orsted declined to comment, as did the French energy regulator CRE, which is running the tender.   France has one of Europe’s biggest coastlines as well as good wind speeds, with about 40,000 square km of viable wind farm area on its Atlantic coast alone, European Environment Agency data shows.  But with 75 percent of its electricity produced by nuclear, France has long been a laggard in renewable energy rollout and lacks big wind energy champions like Denmark’s Vestas or German-Spanish firm Siemens Gamesa.  When the previous socialist government finally gave thego-ahead for offshore wind, it not only wanted to build turbines but thought it could use the tenders to kickstart an offshorewind export industry.  The criteria of the 2012 and 2014 tenders favoured French-based manufacturing of turbines, and the winning bids, awarded at prices way above market levels, duly selected turbines made by French groups Areva and Alstom. But seven years, later not a single one has been built in France as the projects have been blocked by public opposition, authorities have cut planned subsidies for budget reasons and Areva and Alstom’s wind units have both been bought by foreign firms - Siemens Gamesa and GE respectively.  Trying to move on from the two first tenders’ problems, French President Emmanuel Macron’s draft long-term energy plan, announced last month, targets relatively modest offshore wind capacity of 2,400 MW by 2023 and about 5,000 MW by 2028. That is well below earlier targets and half what industry lobby group FEE recommended, but the government hopes that by creating a level playing field and focussing on price, it will be third time lucky. The criteria of the new Dunkirk tender, which have not been made public, do not require French-made turbines, according to two industry sources involved in the bids, with the overriding emphasis placed on pricing. Two sources close to the bids said financial criteria will have an 80 percent weighting, of which 70 percent is purely about price and 10 percent based on the “robustness” of the offers.  In initial talks with prospective bidders the state had imposed a 60 to 100 euro per megawatt hour (MWh) range in an effort to balance a competitive price with the need to invite serious bidders.  In the final version it dropped that requirement, so consortia can bid as low as they want, one source said.  The 10 percent “robustness” criteria evaluates to what extent the French state can be certain that what is proposed will effectively be executed on schedule and within budget.  The remaining 20 percent of the bid weighting is based on environmental and land use criteria, which will force developers to optimise turbine size and placement so as to get maximum power production with minimal environmental impact. The CRE regulator is set to recommend a winning bidder by mid April.  If the government accepts the recommendation, the tender could be awarded before summer, if the “yellow vest” protest movement that has rocked the country in recent months does not perturb the process.  “With Macron’s reform plans shaken by the yellow vests, he may be wary of announcing expensive renewable energy projects,” an official at one of the consortia said.

2019-02-15,"(Repeats Feb. 14 story; text unchanged) * Vitol replaces SOCAR as main shipper of Turkmen oil * SOCAR refuses to provide tankers to Vitol * Vitol scrambles for tankers, charters 44-year-old ship * Turkmen oil exports plummet in Jan-Feb By Alexander Ershov, Olga Yagova and Dmitry Zhdannikov MOSCOW/LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - A clash between trading house Vitol and Azerbaijan’s SOCAR over Caspian Sea oil shipments is forcing Turkmenistan to slash exports of crude due to a lack of tankers. Turkmenistan typically exports about 200,000 tonnes of oil per year via the Caspian to world markets, mainly from fields operated by the UAE’s ENOC and Italy’s Eni, but flows have halved in recent weeks, six traders involved in operations said. That happened after Turkmen producers decided to export oil via Russia with the help of Swiss trader Vitol and ditch the previous Azeri route, operated by state-owned SOCAR. The reasons behind the change are not fully clear but trading sources attributed it to pricing disagreements. Three trading sources said SOCAR had raised tariffs, while one source said Vitol had offered lower tariffs. “The only problem was that Vitol was lacking tankers,” one of the sources involved in operations said. Vitol said it would not comment on commercial activity or trading. SOCAR, ENOC and the Turkmen Energy Ministry declined to comment. Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft did not respond to a request for comment. Eni said it had not been forced to reduce exports or production and that “the situation was stable”. Russian Energy Ministry data shows that no exports of Turkmen oil occurred via Russia in January. In February, only 80,000 tonnes will be loaded from the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk. Eni declined to say why its production and exports were stable after such a drop in shipments or whether it was stockpiling oil in Turkmenistan. SOCAR controls the Caspian’s largest fleet of small and mid-sized tankers, which used to ship Turkmen oil to Baku. From there, it was loaded into the BTC pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. In Turkmenistan, ENOC’s Dragon Oil is developing the Cheleken oilfield, with annual output of some 2.4 million tonnes. Eni produces nearly 300,000 tonnes per year from the Okarem field. In 2018, crude from Dragon Oil was exported via BTC through SOCAR. Eni also sold volumes to Vitol, which in turn resold it to SOCAR. Under new long-term deals for this year, Dragon and Eni chose Vitol to export oil to the Russian port of Makhachkala, where Transneft is taking it to Novorossiisk. Upset by the development, SOCAR refused to let Vitol use its tankers, the six traders said. “Everyone is free to defend their commercial interests,” said a source at SOCAR when asked about tankers. Vitol has secured several tankers, but these will be able to transport only around 120,000 tonnes a month until the Russian river-canal system becomes ice-free and opens to navigation in April, trading sources said. Shipments can then increase. The Caspian tanker shortage was such that Vitol had to charter old ships, including the Grigoriy Bugrov, a 44-year-old vessel that sank in 2011 and was later repaired. “These vessels were chartered on an exceptional basis and only after physical inspection by an experienced professional. Vitol is extremely mindful of its responsibilities in respect of customers, stakeholders and the environment,” Vitol said when asked about the Bugrov tanker. The slowness of crude exports has forced Turkmen producers to stockpile oil throughout January and February, the six trading sources said. “Storage tanks are full so the Turkmens now face the risk of suspending some production,” a market source familiar with the matter said. Despite their modest volumes, Turkmen oil exports have always been a high-stakes, high-margins game. Oil is bought in Turkmenistan at a discount of several dollars per barrel to the dated Brent benchmark. Crude is then sold in the Mediterranean at a premium to dated Brent as Azeri BTC - in case of shipments via Azerbaijan - or as Siberian Light, which also normally trades at a premium to dated Brent if it flows via Russia’s Novorossiisk. “Losing Turkmen crude means lower exports via BTC and lower crude quality,” a trader with a European refiner said. For Russia, getting Turkmen volumes does the opposite - it helps improve the quality of oil in the pipeline system. Azeri BTC crude oil loadings are scheduled to fall some 10 percent in March versus February. The situation regarding quality was not critical, the SOCAR source said. “Negotiations about getting oil from Turkmenistan are not over ... We hope there is a chance that we will get some Turkmen oil volumes,” the SOCAR source added.

The bearish impulse appeared likely to be passed on to European stocks, with spreadbetters expecting Britain’s FTSE to open 0.1 percent lower, Germany’s DAX 0.3 percent down and France’s CAC 0.2 percent down. Data released on Friday showed China’s factory-gate inflation slowed for a seventh straight month in January to its weakest pace since September 2016 amid cooling domestic demand. The broader equity markets had already been under pressure after Thursday’s weak U.S. retail sales figures triggered fresh doubts about the strength of the world’s largest economy. That offsetting some cautious optimism over trade talks in Beijing between the United States and China. Also casting a shadow, the White House said U.S. President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency to try to obtain funds for his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, drawing immediate criticism from Democrats. Aside from the data, immediate focus was on a meeting on Friday between the Trump administration’s top two negotiators and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. There has been no decision to extend a March 1 deadline for a deal that could forestall a further increase in U.S. tariffs on some imports from China, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which had scaled a four-month high midweek on factors including expectations for reduced U.S.-China trade tensions, was down 1 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.8 percent following Friday’s discouraging data. “With factory-gate deflation likely to deepen in the coming months, we expect policymakers to roll out further measures to ease financial pressure on industrial firms, including cuts to benchmark lending rates,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. Japan’s Nikkei dropped more than 1 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI shed 1.45 percent. In the United States, the S&P 500 lost about 0.3 percent on Thursday, a day after it hit a 10-week high on rising hopes that Washington and Beijing could reach a trade deal. U.S. retail sales tumbled 1.2 percent in December, recording their biggest drop since September 2009 as receipts fell across the board. The shockingly weak report led to economic growth estimates for the fourth-quarter being cut to below a 2.0 percent annualised rate, with the Atlanta Fed forecasting a 1.5 percent growth, much below its previous forecast of 2.7 percent about a week ago. U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank should stop paring its balance sheet by the end of this year. The U.S. central bank built a 4 trillion dollar balance sheet over years of bond purchases aimed at lowering longer-term borrowing costs to stimulate the economy when near-zero rates were not delivering enough of a boost. Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, said the Fed “appears to be laying the ground work to end its balance sheet reduction early”. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.655 percent , wiping out most of their rise this week. In the currency market, the weak U.S. data dented the dollar. The U.S. currency fetched 110.34 yen, stepping back from Thursday’s seven-week peak of 111.13. The dollar’s weakness saved the euro from testing its 2018 low of $1.1216. The common currency stood at $1.1285 after having fallen to $1.1248 on Thursday following economic data showing Germany’s economy stalled in the fourth quarter. The British pound traded a shade lower at $1.2797 following a descent to a near one-month low of $1.2773 overnight after Prime Minister Theresa May lost a symbolic Brexit vote in parliament, weakening her hand as she seeks to renegotiate her withdrawal agreement with Brussels. Oil prices soared as top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut crude exports and deliver an even deeper output cut. Brent crude futures stretched an overnight rally rose to as high as $65.10 per barrel, their highest level in nearly three months. The contracts have gained nearly 5 percent this week. “Brent should average 70 dollars per barrel in 2019, helped by voluntary (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE) and involuntary (Venezuela, Iran) declines in OPEC supply,” wrote commodity strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Oil exports from Venezuela and Iran have been the target of U.S. sanctions. U.S. crude futures rose 0.35 percent to $54.60 per barrel and were headed for a weekly gain of roughly 4 percent.

2019-02-15,"* Thermal coal and LNG supply hits multi-year highs in January * Demand outlook from power generation tepid short and longer term * Falling coal & LNG prices: tmsnrt.rs/2EcWpdv * Rising coal & LNG supply: tmsnrt.rs/2BAqzFL By Henning Gloystein and Nina Chestney SINGAPORE/LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Thermal coal and natural gas prices are tumbling, with both falling their lowest since 2017, as the outlook for the most used power generation fuels darkens due to tepid demand. Feeding an emerging glut is a surge in exports. Refinitiv trade data showed shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from key exporters Australia, Qatar, Malaysia and the United States rose to a record 19.5 million tonnes in January, up from 14.5 million tonnes two years ago. Meanwhile, exports of thermal coal from prominent suppliers Australia, Colombia, Indonesia and South Africa climbed to 54.5 million tonnes in January, the highest in at least two years. The supply surge is occurring just as heating demand is starting to taper off with the end of the Northern Hemisphere winter approaching and that is weighing on prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen by more than 40 percent since June to around $6.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). That is the lowest since September 2017, and a three-year low for the winter season. Spot coal cargo prices for exports from Australia’s Newcastle terminal have fallen by a quarter since the middle of 2018, to below $90 per tonne for the first time since 2017. 2020 European coal futures, known as API2, have also lost almost a quarter of their value since their $100 peak in 2018, dropping below $80 per tonne for the first time in a year. Coal and gas markets are moving in the opposite direction of oil, which usually influences the two generation fuels, with crude prices rising on Friday to their highest this year. “With coal on course to see a sharp reduction in underlying demand from the power sector, further weakness cannot be ruled out,” consultancy Energy Aspects said in a note, adding that milder spring weather and ample storage could also further pull down gas prices. Beyond the end of winter, commodities brokerage Marex Spectron said “a significant slowdown in manufacturing activity” also weighed in coal and gas prices. The high supplies and tepid demand have resulted in swelling inventories. Vishal Thiruvedula, coal analyst at Refinitiv, said coal inventories at import terminals in China, the world’s biggest consumer of the fuel, were at 15.39 million tonnes in early February, 5 million tonnes higher than this time last year. The situation is similar in natural gas, where storage facilities hold ample supply. “Mild weather and ample storage have led to a weaker Asian market with overflow cargoes pouring into Europe,” James Taverner, energy analyst at IHS Markit, said earlier this month. More fundamentally, demand for thermal fuels for power generation has declined because of improving energy efficiency and the rise of renewable power generation, which is eating into the market share of coal and gas. “Our main concern remains the outright bearish energy intensity of key LNG consuming economies,” said Marex Spectron, adding that “the pickup in renewable power generation ... would imply weaker coal consumption.” The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said in its 2018 report that “renewable power accounted for 70 percent of net additions to global power generating capacity.” Reporting by Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE and Nina Chestney

2019-02-15,"* Growth picks up from 5.3 pct in 2017, beats expectations * Foreign trade up 22.3 pct on year (Adds background, analyst quote) ULAANBAATAR, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Mongolia’s economy grew 6.9 percent in 2018, beating expectations and accelerating from a 5.3 percent pace the previous year, the statistics office said on Friday. An increase in foreign trade revenues, particularly from resources such as coal and copper helped drive the expansion, which was higher than an Asia Development Bank forecast of 6.3 percent. “Increased mineral export revenues due to the higher commodity prices, and improved domestic demand, helped Mongolia’s economy perform better than expected,” said Lakshmi Boojoo, director of the Economic Policy and Competitiveness Research Center in Mongolia, an independent think tank. Coal and copper generate almost 70 percent of Mongolia’s total export revenues. Most of its mining output is sold to neighboring China. Mongolia’s total trade turnover rose 22.3 percent last year to hit $12.9 billion, with exports at $7 billion and imports $5.9 billion. The 2017 growth rate was revised up from the previous 5.1 percent. After double-digit expansion from 2011-2013, driven by a mining boom, Mongolia’s growth plummeted to just 1.2 percent in 2016 following a collapse in foreign investment and commodity prices. It was forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for assistance in 2017 amid heavy government debt and a collapse in the value of its currency, the tugrik. The two sides agreed to a three-year restructuring programme that committed the government to spending cuts and financial reforms. The IMF warned last year that while Mongolia was recovering more quickly than expected, it remained heavily in debt and vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations, and needed to maintain its commitment to structural reform.

Also casting a shadow, the White House said U.S. President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency to try to obtain funds for his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, drawing immediate criticism from Democrats. A wait-and see mood ensued for markets ahead of the results of a meeting on Friday between the Trump administration’s top two negotiators and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. There has been no decision to extend a March 1 deadline for a deal, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which had scaled a four-month high midweek on factors including expectations for reduced U.S.-China trade tensions, was down 0.8 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1.2 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI shed 1.5 percent. In the United States, the S&P 500 lost about 0.3 percent on Thursday, a day after it hit a 10-week high on rising hopes that Washington and Beijing could reach a trade deal. U.S. retail sales tumbled 1.2 percent in December, recording their biggest drop since September 2009 as receipts fell across the board. The shockingly weak report led to economic growth estimates for the fourth-quarter being cut to below a 2.0 percent annualised rate, with the Atlanta Fed forecasting a 1.5 percent growth, much below its previous forecast of 2.7 percent about a week ago. Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at State Street in Tokyo, said he was “very surprised” by the U.S. retail sales data. “The extraordinary weakness, however, appears to be owing in part to the government shutdown, though the exact extent of its impact is not clear,” he said. “It would be premature to think the U.S. economy has lost steam completely. We have to wait for figures in the next couple of months,” Kaida said. The collapse in retail sales came along with data showing an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week. The closely-watched four-week average of the volatile data rose to the highest level in more than a year. That prompted Fed fund futures to price in a small chance, about 15 percent, of a rate cut this year. U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank should stop paring its balance sheet by the end of this year. Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, said the Fed “appears to be laying the ground work to end its balance sheet reduction early”. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.653 percent , wiping out most of their rise this week. In the currency market, the weak U.S. data dented the dollar. The U.S. currency fetched 110.32 yen, stepping back from Thursday’s seven-week peak of 111.13. The dollar’s weakness saved the euro from testing its 2018 low of $1.1216. The common currency stood at $1.1289 after having fallen to $1.1248 on Thursday following economic data showing Germany’s economy stalled in the fourth quarter. The British pound traded a shade lower at $1.2794 following a descent to a near one-month low of $1.2773 overnight after Prime Minister Theresa May lost a symbolic Brexit vote in parliament, weakening her hand as she seeks to renegotiate her withdrawal agreement with Brussels. Oil prices soared as top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut crude exports and deliver an even deeper output cut. Brent crude futures stretched an overnight rally rose to as high as $65.10 per barrel, their highest level in nearly three months. The contracts have gained nearly 5 percent this week. “Brent should average 70 dollars per barrel in 2019, helped by voluntary (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE) and involuntary (Venezuela, Iran) declines in OPEC supply,” wrote commodity strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Oil exports from Venezuela and Iran have been the target of U.S. sanctions. U.S. crude futures rose 0.5 percent to $54.68 per barrel and were headed for a weekly gain of roughly 4 percent.

2019-02-15,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican state oil firm Pemex will make all its debt payments, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday, promising to shore up its finances after Moody’s and Fitch downgraded its credit rating to one notch above junk. Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who took office in December, said he would present a plan on Friday to strengthen Pemex’s finances. One source of funding will be savings from the government’s fight against fuel theft, he said. “Pemex will never fail to fulfill an obligation,” Lopez Obrador said at a regular morning news conference, responding to a question on whether his government would refinance or restructure Pemex’s debt. “We will pay all of the obligations punctually.” The plan to help Pemex’s finances is expected to include a reduction in the taxes the company pays to the government and a capital injection.  Lopez Obrador said the government would not take on additional debt to help Pemex. “We will not resort to debt,” he said. “We will have no problems resolving our obligations.” The company said in a presentation viewed by Reuters that it expects to receive a capital infusion of at least $1.25 billion before year’s end. In addition, the government foresees injecting $1.8 billion to monetize labor liabilities and $600 million for “additional fiscal aid 2019-2014.” The government also hopes to save Pemex $1.6 billion in its fight against fuel theft. “The direct injection of capital will reduce the financing needs of Pemex and will provide additional liquidity to support the company’s investment program,” according to the presentation. Obrador’s administration previously spoke of reducing the Pemex tax burden to free up the firm to invest more in exploration and production.  Rating agency Fitch downgraded Pemex’s credit rating in late January, citing the company’s high leverage and tax burden. Pemex holds roughly $103 billion in financial debt, the highest of any state oil firm in Latin America.  Fitch rated Pemex’s long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for foreign and local currency at BBB-, the lowest investment-grade rating. Rival rating agency Moody’s also has Pemex at one notch above junk.  Investors worry that if the company loses investment grade status, Mexico’s sovereign debt could also be downgraded.

2019-02-15,"SYDNEY, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose on Friday, gaining for a fourth day on hopes of further supply cuts by major exporters, despite uncertainty about U.S.-China trade talks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.79 per barrel at 0038 GMT, up 40 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last settlement. They rose 51 cents, or 0.95 percent, on Thursday. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing up 1.5 percent in the previous session. “The crude oil market shrugged off concerns about the trade talks as signs of further reduction from OPEC+ continue to mount,” ANZ Bank said in a research note. The producer group known as OPEC+ has agreed to cut crude output by a joint 1.2 million barrels per day. Top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut even more in March than the deal called for. Russia has cut its oil production by 80,000-90,000 barrels per day from its level in October, Moscow’s reference level for its cuts, the country’s energy minister said. Still, U.S. government data on Wednesday showed U.S. crude stocks last week rose to their highest since November 2017 as refiners cut runs to the lowest since October 2017.

2019-02-15,"(Repeats without changes) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2V4bGD1 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Oil traders no longer expect the market to be over-supplied this year, amid optimism a full-blown U.S.-China trade war will be averted, and oil production growth will slow thanks to OPEC cuts and sanctions on Venezuela. Front-month Brent futures prices have jumped to almost $65 per barrel, up from just $50 in late December, and the highest for nearly three months (tmsnrt.rs/2V4bGD1). Brent’s six-month calendar spread has swung into a backwardation of almost 70 cents per barrel, from a contango of more than $1.50 late last year, the strongest for almost four months. Crude prices and spreads are being propelled higher by an almost perfect storm of increasing economic optimism (or at least reducing pessimism), OPEC cuts and unplanned supply disruptions. In recent days, senior policymakers from both the United States and China have signalled trade negotiations are making good progress, as fear of recession makes both sides more eager for a deal. More importantly, the U.S. president has indicated the deadline for the next round of tariff increases could be extended based on recent progress even if not all issues have been resolved by March 1. Oil consumption growth is likely to slow this year from the very rapid rates reported between 2014 and 2017 but if tariff increases can be avoided oil use should continue increasing at a moderate pace. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and its closest allies in OPEC have also acted early and aggressively to reduce production which should help eliminate the incipient surplus in the market. Saudi Arabia’s oil minister has said the kingdom’s production will fall to just 9.8 million barrels per day in March from 11.1 million in November (“Saudi Arabia goes on hunt for global oil and gas”, Financial Times, Feb. 12). Saudi Arabia’s willingness to act as swing producer has more than offset the limited cuts made by other members of the organisation and its allies led by Russia. The kingdom has demonstrated its commitment to eliminating the market surplus and pushing prices higher, even if it means tolerating poor compliance by other members of the OPEC+ group. At the same time, Iran’s exports remain crimped by U.S. sanctions imposed in November, with the expectation they will be lowered further from May, when sanctions waivers are likely to become less generous. And U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA have reduced the country’s crude exports and tightened the global oil market even further. U.S. policymakers probably expected the Venezuela sanctions would have little impact on global production since they were expected to result in the rapid removal of President Nicolas Maduro. But with the Maduro administration digging in for a long confrontation, traders have been forced to reappraise the possibility of a long disruption of exports that could last weeks or even months. Production and consumption risks, concentrated on the downside at the start of the year, have therefore shifted to the upside in recent weeks. Hedge fund positioning could accelerate the rise in prices and shift to backwardation. Hedge funds and other money managers held an overall bullish position in Brent futures and options equivalent to just 234 million barrels at the start of February down from almost 500 million at the end of September. Portfolio managers’ overall bullish position has already risen by nearly 100 million barrels over the last nine weeks but remains close to the lowest level for the last three years. Funds hold just 5 long bullish contracts for every short bullish one, down from a ratio of almost 20:1 just over four months ago, so there is scope for more fund buying. Production and consumption fundamentals as well as hedge fund positioning all suggest the balance of risks in oil has shifted to the upside, but only if trade talks are successful or extended, and recession is avoided.

The world’s fifth-largest crude importer won a six-month waiver in November from U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil exports, but did not immediately start imports, mainly due to payment and insurance issues. South Korea, one of Iran’s biggest Asian customers, imported 227,941 tonnes of Iranian crude in January, or 53,676 barrels per day (bpd), data from the country’s customs office showed. This was well down on 950,013 tonnes of Iranian crude a year earlier. Overall, South Korea shipped in 12.46 million tonnes of crude oil in January, or 2.94 million bpd, down 5.9 percent from 13.25 million tonnes from a year earlier, according to the customs data. Oil shipments from Saudi Arabia, the country’s top oil supplier, fell 4.8 percent to 3.51 million tonnes in January year on year, as the kingdom continued to curb its output under a supply deal led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In January, OPEC’s oil output fell by about 800,000 bpd to 30.81 million bpd, and the biggest supply drop came from Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the oil cartel. Meanwhile, South Korea’s imports of U.S. crude oil nearly tripled to 1.12 million tonnes in January from 394,331 tonnes a year earlier, reflecting a firm appetite for U.S. oil on the back of tight Middle East supplies. State-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) will issue final crude oil import data later this month.

2019-02-15,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Houston ordered a former Venezuelan oil minister this week to pay the owners of a defunct Houston oil company $1.4 billion in damages in a fraud suit, although it is unclear if or how the payment will ever be made. U.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal issued the default judgment on Wednesday after Rafael Ramirez did not contest Harvest Natural Resources’ claims, according to an opinion accompanying the ruling. James Edmiston, Harvest Natural’s former chief executive and director, said on Thursday he was pleased with the order. Whether the shareholders of Harvest will ever receive a payment from Ramirez “is the $1.4 billion question,” he said. Ramirez, in a message to Reuters, said he was not surprised by the order, but declined further comment. Harvest’s suit claimed Venezuela refused to allow the company to sell its assets in the country from 2012, leading it to lose $472 million. It accused Ramirez and others of seeking a $10 million bribe to approve the transaction.  Rosenthal initially awarded Harvest $472 million in damages in December, an amount he tripled this week. Ramirez was appointed energy minister by late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, serving in that job until 2014. He later was the country’s ambassador to the United Nations, but left after being accused of corruption by Venezuelan officials amid a purge of executives at state oil firm PDVSA.

2019-02-15,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Drilling curbs by oil producers in the largest U.S. shale field will continue until transport bottlenecks ease and investors stop punishing companies for increasing capital spending, executives at an energy conference said on Thursday. The price of crude in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico fell sharply last year, selling as much as $18 below U.S. benchmark prices, as a lack of pipeline capacity landlocked some oil output and as investors pushed producers to reduce spending and boost shareholder returns. On Thursday, the regional price of crude was at a $1.10 a barrel premium to U.S. crude futures, the strongest in more than a year as companies including Parsley Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Goodrich Petroleum Corp have pared their exploration budgets, easing the constraints.     Pioneer Natural Resources Co, one of the Permian’s largest producers, said this week it plans to reduce 2019 capital expenditures by 11 percent, or about $350 million, slowing its production growth from prior years. “There aren’t nearly as many drilling dollars available,” said Bobby Whiteside, president of Midland, Texas-based oil producer Regions Permian LLC. “If Wall Street wants you to drill within cash flow, you’re going to have slower growth.” The Permian is the nation’s largest and fastest growing oil field. Its output has driven U.S. crude production to near 12 million barrels per day (bpd), forcing OPEC and allies to cut their output. Oil and gas officials interviewed at the Houston conference say the recent shale cutbacks will remain until three proposed pipelines from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast come online over the next 18 months.  Executives said the recent strengthening of regional crude prices suggest that producers can expect oil sold at Midland, Texas, to slip from the current premium to a $1 to $3 per barrel discount to U.S. benchmark crude in the second quarter.  “I don’t think you’ll see a big differential again unless they grow production over capacity,” said Jacob Daniels, an employee of Texas oil producer Chisholm Energy, which drills in the Permian. “We’re about at breakeven now, and that has really helped us,” added Brett Bracken, an exploration manager at Permian oil producer Ares Energy Ltd. The U.S. oil industry could easily meet the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s oil-production forecasts over the next two years if Wall Street still rewarded production growth over returns, said Allen Gilmer, founder of market intelligence provider DrillingInfo. “But with investors insisting on free cash flow and dividends, maybe we won’t,” Gilmer said. “These guys have amazing assets but their stock prices haven’t benefited at all from growing reserves or production.” Reporting by Collin Eaton in Houston; Editing by James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-shale-production/u-s-shale-executives-predict-oil-production-constraints-to-remain-idUKL1N20924M,15 Feb 2019,"Drilling curbs by oil producers
