2018-10-06,"MAPUTO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi on Saturday launched an initiative to disarm and reintegrate the military wing of the country’s main opposition party, Renamo, as part of efforts to bolster peace and security. Renamo and Nyusi’s ruling Frelimo party fought on opposing sides of a 16-year civil war that killed an estimated 1 million people before a peace accord ended the fighting in 1992. Violence has flared up sporadically since, including after Renamo challenged the results of the natural gas-rich southern African country’s 2014 elections. “The end goal of this process is to rid the country of unconstitutional armed forces ... in the quest for an effective, sustainable and transparent peace,” Nyusi said at the launch of the demobilisation and reintegration initiative in Maputo, Mozambique’s capital. Nyusi said international experts from countries such as the United States, India and Germany would oversee the initiative, which will see some Renamo fighters getting jobs in the army and police. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama died earlier this year. He had been due to run for the presidency in next year’s elections.

2018-10-06,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) has been granted a permit in Brazil to use new technology to extend the life of a disposal area for its troubled Alunorte alumina refinery, the world’s largest, which should lead to the restart of operations at 50 percent, the firm said on Saturday. The decision came on Friday, two days after Hydro said it would halt production and layoff 4,700 people at Brazil’s Alunorte, which has been operating at half capacity since March due to an environmental dispute. “Hydro’s alumina refinery Alunorte was granted an exceptional authorization... which will extend the life of its DRS1 bauxite residue disposal area and allow Alunorte to continue operations on safe conditions,” it said in a statement. The authorisation was granted by Brazil’s federal environmental agency IBAMA and it allows the utilisation of a press filter technology that provides stackable residues with considerably less water content than the drum filter. Hydro will now work with Brazil’s Secretary of State for Environment and Sustainability (SEMAS) to get a second authorisation that will permit the use of the technology in Alunorte’s DRS1 bauxite residue disposal area. “After receiving this (second) authorization, Alunorte will be able to re-start the operation at 50 percent of capacity,” said the firm. Resuming 50 percent production at Alunorte would also allow Hydro’s bauxite mine Paragominas and its joint-venture primary aluminium smelter Albras to continue operating at half capacity, rather than being shut down, its Bauxite and Alumina head, John Thuestad, said. Three days ago, when Hydro said it would halt production at Alunorte, shares fell 12 percent to a 21-month low, making it the worst performer in the European STOXX 600 Index. The price of aluminium, the product made from alumina, climbed 5.5 percent to its highest since June. Closures of Alunorte, Paragominas and Albras would have “significant operational and financial consequences” Hydro said at the time. The decision to halt all production had been taken as the refinery’s waste deposit area is close to full capacity due to an embargo on the new press filter and as an ongoing dispute with Brazil’s authorities had been preventing Hydro from using a newly created residue facility, the firm said on Wednesday. On Thursday, a day after Hydro’s decision to halt operations at Alunorte, the Brazilian state of Para said it was surprised with the move and asked for a report explaining the decision. Alunorte made 6.4 million tonnes of alumina in 2017, about 10 percent of global production outside China and enough to make some 3 million tonnes of aluminium. Its partial shutdown earlier this year drove up market prices for alumina and aluminium.

2018-10-06,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Saturday sought to assure investors that the government would not go back to regulating fuel prices, a day after oil company shares tumbled on concerns about a return to a regime that has hurt their profits in the past. The government said on Thursday it was cutting gasoline and diesel by 2.50 rupees per liter to help Indians struggling to pay fuel prices that had climbed on the back of a rise in global crude prices and a weakening rupee. The move was seen as a reversal of a 2014 decision to scrap regulated fuel prices - a regime that was blamed for deterring state oil marketing firms from expanding and for choking off investment in domestic oil fields by India’s biggest oil producer. ""Let me categorically assure all that there is no going back on deregulation of oil prices,"" India's finance minister Arun Jaitley said in a Facebook post on Saturday. bit.ly/2Cuykza Prime Minister Narendra Modi freed up the price of diesel in October 2014 after a decade of regulation, saying it would encourage competition among vehicle fuel retailers and enhance efficiency in oil company services. Experts said it was one of his most far reaching reforms after previous governments failed to free the price of diesel, India’s most widely used transport fuel. Petrol prices were freed up by the former government of the Congress party in 2010. The price cut reduced the government’s excise duty by 1.50 rupees per liter and cut one rupee per liter on the amount charged by state-run oil marketing firms Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL.NS) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL.NS). Shares in the companies fell more than 20 percent to multi-year lows on Friday before recovering marginally.

2018-10-06,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s central bank governor sought to reassure the public on Saturday as people again formed long queues to fill up their cars in the capital, with others panic-buying basic goods like cooking oil and sugar. The panic has been caused by recent changes introduced by the government and a worsening U.S. dollar crunch, but the governor, John Mangudya, told Reuters that people should not be worried and that he expected an improvement in the next 48 hours “The problem is that we did not explain things. This economy is a sentiment driven economy so we need to communicate more with the society,” he said.     The southern African nation dumped its hyperinflation-wrecked currency in favor of the U.S. dollar in 2009 but a shortage of cash dollars has worsened following a disputed election won by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in July. Fuel queues started building up this week and on Saturday outlets in Harare had either run out or had long queues as drivers patiently waited for their turn to fill up their tanks. “I have been here for an hour because the queue is moving slowly. I have no choice because I need the petrol,” said one motorist, who identified himself as Pascal, at a service station in the Avondale suburb in Harare.  At some outlets owned by Total, attendants only served motorists with pre-paid cards. Other outlets refused mobile payments, preferring bank cards and cash. Zimbabwe spends $80 million on fuel imports every month. Mangudya told Reuters the fuel shortages had been caused by an introduction of a 2 percent tax on electronic payments last Monday, which meant oil firms would incur weekly bank charges of $400,000 for fuel imports but were not allowed to pass the cost to consumers. The companies had stopped supplying fuel as a result, Mangudya said, but he added the situation would improve in the next 48 hours because the government on Friday night scrapped the tax on foreign payments. Zimbabweans were also stocking up on basic goods like rice, cooking oil, sugar and juice. At some branches owned by Zimbabwe’s biggest grocery chain OK Zimbabwe OK.ZI, management limited sales of sugar, cooking oil and a popular local juice. “Management reserves the right to limit quantities,” read a notice to customers.   A shortage of U.S. dollars in banks has forced importers to purchase them on the black market, which has pushed up premiums and the price of imports.  On the black market, the premium for the U.S. dollar spiked to a new record on Saturday, reaching 165 percent from 120 percent on Monday, traders said. That means buying $100 in cash via a bank transfer cost  $265, up from $220 earlier this week.  The situation has not been helped by Mangudya’s decision early this week to order banks to open accounts for clients who earn foreign currency and separate their money from dollars in the local banking system, known as “Zollars”. Analysts said the move effectively makes the dollar surrogates Zimbabwe’s de-facto local currency. There are $9.3 billion of Zollars in banks compared to $200 million in reserves, official data showed, a mismatch that creates a premium for the U.S. dollar and fans the black market.

2018-10-06,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main opposition party, which this weekend selects its candidate to challenge President Muhammadu Buhari in an election in February, is aiming to make his northwestern power base a main battleground in the contest. To do so, however, it needs to secure the backing of powerful figures in the northwest and to ensure the party does not fracture over its choice of candidate, analysts said. Many of the 13 candidates for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) nomination defected from Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in recent months.  Seven have ties with states in the northwest, mostly as current or past governors, bolstering the party in a traditional  Buhari stronghold.  At stake in the primary election is the chance to face him in a presidential contest which will determine who controls a country that is Africa’s top oil producer, has one of the continent’s biggest economies, and plays a key role in regional wars against Islamist insurgents.  The northwest, the most densely populated region in the country of 190 million people, is shaping up to take centre stage in the race. “In past elections, Buhari got almost half of his vote from the northwest and the region will be even more important this time,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, West Africa analyst at Teneo Intelligence. “A lot of people from other regions who voted for Buhari first-time in 2015 are likely to turn their back on him.” The region is traditionally the centre of the Muslim voter base as Nigeria’s three most senior Islamic leaders - the sultan of Sokoto, the emir of Kano and the emir of Gwando - are based there. Buhari, a northern Muslim, who won the 2015 election at the fourth attempt, took 1.9 million votes in Kano state compared to 215,779 secured by Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner. An unofficial agreement aimed at rotating power between the mainly Muslim north and mostly Christian south, means a northern candidate is likely to be selected by the opposition.  The northerners in the primary contest include the governor of northwestern Sokoto state Aminu Tambuwal, former Kano governor Ibrahim Shekarau, ex-Kaduna governor Ahmed Makarfi, and former Sokoto governor Attahiru Bafarawa.  “Assuming that the PDP remains united, this could put them back on the map in the northwest, a region where the party scored on average merely 16 percent in 2015,” Teneo’s  Liewerscheidt said. PDP national publicity secretary Kola Ologbondiyan dismissed the suggestion that supporters of unsuccessful candidates may not back the person selected. “We are all going to work together to ensure the victory of our candidate,” he said. The dent in Buhari’s popularity can largely be attributed to the economy. Nigeria entered its first recession in 25 years in 2016, mainly caused by lower oil prices and attacks in the Niger Delta crude production region. It emerged from recession early last year but growth remains sluggish and inflation has remained high, above the central bank’s single digit target range.   The impact of the economic downturn of recent years is, for some on the streets of the north’s commercial hub Kano, a reason to reject Buhari. “Everything went back under Buhari, there’s no progress or development,” said Yusuf Yakubu, who left Buhari’s party in June 2017 and joined the PDP. “If you go to the market, the traders will tell you the economy has collapsed under this administration. There is really nothing Kano can hold up and say ‘This is how we’ve benefited under Buhari’,” he said.  But many others on the streets of the city felt that the president, who is from the neighbouring state of Katsina, should be given a second term.  “Perhaps we all would not be in Kano state by now if not for his administration. Maybe, we would have all been chased out of this state by Boko Haram,” said Abdullmuminu Gezewa, praising the government’s security record.
