2018-04-13,"(Reuters) - The United States Coast Guard said on Friday it reopened the Mississippi River near New Orleans after it was closed due to an oil spill on Thursday. The Coast Guard had shut a 10-mile (16.1 km) stretch of the Mississippi River in downtown New Orleans after a vessel spilled oil into the river. The closing stalled 12 commercial vessels on the river. New Orleans, which sits near the mouth of the Mississippi, is an important transit point for energy, metals and agriculture commodities moving to overseas and domestic markets.

2018-04-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, making the largest weekly gain since July, supported by concerns about the possibility of Western military action in Syria and reports of dwindling global oil inventories. The prospect of military action in Syria that could lead to confrontation with Russia hung over the Middle East but there was no sign a U.S.-led attack was imminent.  Traders sought to lock in long crude oil positions ahead of the weekend, said John Kilduff, Partner at hedge fund Again Capital Management. “The geopolitical jitters just keep getting priced in here more and more, as we get closer to the moment of the strikes, if there are any,” Kilduff said, noting Syria posed a risk to global stability because of its relationship with other powerful oil producers. “Syria is a client state of both Russia and Iran and the risk for escalation is quite high and I think that is what the market is worried about.”   Brent crude LCOc1 recovered from losses early in the session and settled up 56 cents at $72.58 a barrel, with a $5.48 weekly gain, or 8 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 32 cents to $67.39 a barrel, up 8 percent for the week. Hedge funds and money managers cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude for the second week in a row in the week to April 10, data showed on Friday [L1N1RQ1RU]. The move came even as prices rose, according to data released by the CFTC.  On Wednesday this week, both oil benchmarks hit their highest since late 2014 after U.S. President Donald Trump warned missiles “will be coming” in response to a suspected gas attack in Syria and after Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles over Riyadh. On Thursday, Trump tweeted that an attack on Syria “could be very soon or not so soon at all.”     “The Syrian escalation risk cannot be fully written off, but we view that it deserves less of a premium than three days ago,” Petromatrix said in a note. A surplus in global oil inventories is also close to evaporating, OPEC said on Thursday, adding its collective output fell to 31.96 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, down 201,000 bpd from February. Vienna-based OPEC and its oil producer allies are expected  to extend their supply reduction pact into 2019 even though the global glut of crude looks set to be eradicated by September, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters. The International Energy Agency (IEA), which coordinates the energy policies of industrialized nations, signalled on Friday that markets could become too tight if supply remains restrained. “It is not for us to declare on behalf of the Vienna agreement countries that it is ‘mission accomplished’, but if our outlook is accurate, it certainly looks very much like it,” the IEA said. Meanwhile, China’s March crude oil imports climbed to the second-highest level on record.  U.S. drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to April 13, bringing the total count to 815, the highest since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.

2018-04-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices extended recent gains and a gauge of global stocks eased on Friday as concern over a broader conflict in Syria left investors nervous, while U.S. bank shares led Wall Street lower. The State Department said on Friday that it had proof that Syria carried out a recent chemical weapons attack in the town of Douma. The prospect of Western military action in Syria that could lead to confrontation with Russia hung over the Middle East. Oil prices added to recent gains that drove them to highs not seen since late 2014 and posted their biggest weekly gain since July. “The geopolitical jitters just keep getting priced in here more and more, as we get closer to the moment of the strikes, if there are any,” said John Kilduff, partner at hedge fund Again Capital Management. He noted that Syria poses a large risk to global stability because of its relationship with powerful oil producers. On Wall Street, fear of broader conflict in Syria further unnerved investors, while financial stocks led the day’s declines. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) were down 2.7 percent after its earnings missed estimates, while Citigroup (C.N) dropped 1.6 percent despite beating profit estimates. An S&P 500 index of bank stocks .SPXBK fell 2.6 percent. Weak loan growth weighed on bank shares, said RJ Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. “If you didn’t own financials going into the quarter, there was nothing in the numbers today that would make you excited about owning them,” Grant said. The banks’ results kicked off the U.S. earnings reporting period. Tax cuts are expected to help corporate America post its biggest quarterly profit growth in seven years. Earnings at S&P 500 companies are estimated to grow by 18.4 percent from a year earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 122.91 points, or 0.5 percent, to 24,360.14, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 7.69 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,656.3 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 33.60 points, or 0.47 percent, to 7,106.65.

In the oil market, U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 32 cents to settle at $67.39 a barrel, while Brent crude LCOcv1 rose 56 cents to $72.58.  The dollar was little changed against a basket of major currencies as traders waited for more clarity on a possible Western military intervention in Syria. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was 0.03 percent higher at 89.78. The Japanese yen weakened 0.01 percent versus the greenback at 107.36 per dollar.

2018-04-13,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts’ top court on Friday rejected Exxon Mobil Corp’s bid to block the state’s attorney general from obtaining records to investigate whether the company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company’s marketing or sale of fossil fuel products violated the state’s consumer protection law. The ruling marked another setback for Exxon after a federal judge in March dismissed a related lawsuit it filed seeking to block investigations by Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, both of whom are Democrats. Exxon argued that because it is incorporated in Texas and New Jersey, Healey had no basis to issue a demand for documents in 2016 to conduct a Massachusetts-based investigation of whether it misled consumers and investors. But Justice Elspeth Cypher, writing for a 6-0 court, said jurisdiction existed because of Exxon’s control over advertising conducted for about 300 franchise gas stations operating under the Exxon and Mobil brands in Massachusetts. She said Healey’s probe related to how manmade greenhouse gas emissions had caused climate change, “a distinctly modern threat that grows more serious with time, and the effects of which are already being felt in Massachusetts.” Healey said she hoped Exxon would now turn over documents it has fought hard against disclosing, showing what it knew about climate change and when it knew it. “I hope this decision will encourage Exxon to end their scorched earth campaign,” she said. Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Exxon, said the company was  considering its next steps. Healey and Schneiderman launched their investigations following news reports in 2015 saying Exxon’s own scientists determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contended that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions. Exxon has called the investigations politically motivated and in a separate lawsuit filed in federal court claimed that Schneiderman and Healey were conspiring to “silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate.” But U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan dismissed that case in March, rejecting as “implausible” Exxons’ claim Healey and Schneiderman were pursuing bad faith investigations in order to violate its constitutional rights.

2018-04-13,"SAO PAULO, April 13 (Reuters) - The lineup of vessels to load sugar in Brazil currently is around 60 percent smaller than seen in the same period a year earlier because of lower output and tepid foreign demand, midway through the first month of the country’s new cane crop. Ten vessels were at Brazilian ports in the first week of April to load 393,500 tonnes of sugar, according to data from shipping agency Williams. At this time last year, 23 ships were at port to take on 950,400 tonnes. “The main reason for that is the smaller production in Brazil,” said Julio Maria Borges, a sugar analyst at consultancy JOB Economia e Planejamento. “We are going to see lineups smaller than last year during the crop.” Brazilian mills have been producing much more ethanol as this year’s cane crop begins than seen last year, as the fuel is currently more profitable than sugar and demand for ethanol in Brazil is strong. At the same time, Borges says, mills are avoiding closing large export deals as international sugar prices remain low. Brazil, the world’s largest producer and exporter of sugar, is finding increasing competition abroad, as Europe, Thailand and India boost output. Michael McDougall, vice president at ED&F MAN Capital Markets in New York, says China’s tariff increase on sugar instituted last year is also hurting Brazil volumes. Brazil’s cane industry group Unica said exports to China, which in the past would amount to around 6 million tonnes per year, reached only 115,000 tonnes last season because of the restriction. China in May last year started to charge a 45 percent duty on top of 50 percent tariff it already had in place for sugar imports beyond a quota of 1.94 million tonnes that applies to many countries, including Brazil. An increase in white sugar production in Europe also weighed on premiums for that category compared with raw sugar, leading to lower demand from refiners for raw product, the experts said.

2018-04-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United Nations shipping agency reached an agreement on Friday to cut carbon emissions, following years of slow progress. The compromise plan, which will cut emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 compared with 2008 levels, fell short of more ambitious targets. Kitack Lim, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), said the adoption of the strategy “would allow future IMO work on climate change to be rooted in a solid basis”. The IMO said it would also be pursuing efforts toward phasing out CO2 emissions entirely.              Delegates said opposition from some countries - including the United States, Saudi Arabia and Panama - had limited what could be achieved at the IMO session this week in London. “The IMO should and could have gone a lot further,” said Bill Hemmings, shipping director with green campaigners Transport & Environment. “This decision puts shipping on a promising track.” Greenpeace International political adviser Veronica Frank said the plan was “far from perfect but the direction is now clear - a phase-out of carbon emissions”.  “This decarbonisation must start now and targets improved along the way, because without concrete, urgent measures to cut emissions from shipping now, the Paris ambition to limit warming to 1.5 degrees will become swiftly out of reach,” Frank said.  Shipping association BIMCO in contrast described it as a “landmark achievement”.  Kathi Stanzel, managing director of tanker association INTERTANKO, added: “It is the culmination of international efforts to develop both ambitious and concrete plans to respond to the challenge of our century.”  The shipping sector, along with aviation, avoided specific emissions-cutting targets in a global climate pact agreed in Paris at the end of 2015, which aims to limit a global average rise in temperature to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius from 2020. European Union countries along with the Marshall Islands, the world’s second-biggest ship registry, had supported a goal of cutting emissions by 70 to 100 percent by 2050, compared with 2008 levels. Europe’s transport commissioner Violeta Bulc and climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said in a joint statement while the EU had “sought a higher level of ambition, this is a good starting point that will allow for further review and improvements over time”.      British-based research group InfluenceMap said an emissions cut of 70 percent would have been “much closer to what is needed if shipping is to be in line with the goals of the Paris agreement”. Shipping accounts for 2.2 percent of world CO2 emissions, according to the IMO, the U.N. agency responsible for regulating pollution from ships. This is around the amount emitted by Germany, according to the latest EU data available, and is predicted to grow significantly if left unchecked. The IMO has adopted mandatory rules for new vessels to boost fuel efficiency as a means of cutting CO2 from ship engines. A final IMO plan is not expected until 2023. According to the text produced by the IMO working group submitted to member states, the initial strategy would not be legally binding for member states. The text separately pointed to possible medium-term measures to address emissions that could include low-carbon and zero-carbon fuels, improved energy efficiency for new and existing ships and possible market-based mechanisms to encourage the shift to lower-carbon fuels. It also said its final strategy should be subject to a review in 2028.     Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine said the country’s delegation had “fought hard” for the outcome. “While it may not be enough to give my country the certainty it wanted, it makes it clear that international shipping will now urgently reduce emissions and play its part in giving my country a pathway to survival,” Heine said.

Oil prices rose and were headed for their largest weekly gain since July on support from lingering concerns about geopolitical risk and reports of dwindling global oil stocks. “The geopolitical jitters just keep getting priced in here more and more, as we get closer to the moment of the strikes, if there are any,” said John Kilduff, partner at hedge fund Again Capital Management. He noted that Syria poses a large risk to global stability because of its relationship with powerful oil producers. “Syria is a client state of both Russia and Iran and the risk for escalation is quite high and I think that is what the market is worried about.” U.S. crude rose 0.57 percent to $67.45 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.70, up 0.94 percent on the day. Trade tensions also were not far from the surface, with analysts at Citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open Asian economies such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority stepped into the currency market and bought another HK$3.038 billion ($387.01 million) in Hong Kong dollars on Friday as the local currency hit the weaker end of its trading range. The U.S. dollar hit a seven-week high against the Japanese yen. The yen tends to benefit from geopolitical uncertainty and risk aversion. The dollar index fell 0.04 percent, with the euro up 0.14 percent to $1.2342. The Japanese yen weakened 0.04 percent versus the greenback at 107.39 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.4253, up 0.20 percent on the day. Aluminum hit a six-year high on Friday and posted its biggest weekly gain since the current contract was launched after the United States imposed sanctions on Russia’s UC Rusal , the world’s second-biggest producer. London Metal Exchange aluminum hit its highest since March 2012 at $2,340 a tonne before retreating to close at $2,285, down 1.7 percent. Spot gold added 0.8 percent to $1,346.26 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.57 percent to $1,349.60 an ounce. Copper rose 0.23 percent to $6,836.50 a tonne.

2018-04-13,"MEXICO CITY, April 13 (Reuters) - Norway’s Statoil will evaluate new offshore projects in Mexico, including potential tie-ups with state oil company Pemex, the firm’s top executive said, adding that a first deepwater well in an existing Gulf project will likely be drilled next year. Statoil is focused mostly on future deepwater opportunities in Mexico but does not rule out others, CEO Eldar Saetre said in an interview late on Thursday. The executive, visiting Mexico City with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, said he met with both finance ministry and Pemex officials. “We will look for further opportunities that might come from ordinary licensing rounds or through portfolio management from Pemex’s portfolio,” he said, without giving further details. Statoil, one of the world’s largest deepwater operators, won stakes in two Gulf of Mexico projects in Mexican waters at a licensing round in late 2016 with partners BP and Total. Saetre said the first deepwater exploration well at the Statoil-operated Block 3 in the Gulf’s Salina basin will likely be drilled in 2019, adding that company aimed to get into such frontier opportunities “very early.” Two-thirds owned by Norway’s government, Statoil has offshore oil and gas projects spread across Latin America, including partnerships with Brazil’s state-controlled Petrobras. Asked why Statoil has entered equity partnerships with Petrobras but not Pemex, Saetre said Brazil has been open to foreign producers much longer. “It’s very early days (in Mexico) when it comes to industrial activities and upstream activities,” he said, referring to a Mexican oil sector opening enacted in 2013-2014. “We relate quite easily to companies like Pemex and understand where they come from, so it’s a very good discussion,” said Saetre, who has served in various roles at Statoil since 1980. He downplayed any future political risk of operating in Mexico, which many sector analysts see increasing as the front-runner in the July presidential election, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged to review all contracts and put the oil opening to a public vote. “Stability and continuity is really important in the industry... but we are here to have dialogues with whoever is in power,” Saetre said. The 2013-2014 energy reform ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly and allowed foreign and private producers to operate projects alone for the first time. While Saetre described the offshore upstream business as most appealing, he said midstream projects, including energy infrastructure, or retail fuel ventures, could be of interest if it helped “unlock” exploration and production work. “We might do that,” he said. “We’ve done that in many places, but not in its own right.” (Reporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Dan Grebler)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-statoil/norwegian-major-statoil-eyes-future-projects-with-mexicos-pemex-idUKL1N1RQ12E,13 Apr 2018,"Norway's Statoil will

2018-04-13,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Europe’s carmakers are not looking to challenge fines if they fail to meet the European Union’s 2020 CO2 emissions goals, but want governments to do more to help them hit targets, the head of the main industry lobby group said. The decline of diesel, long used to boost efficiency, and the slow pace of investment in electric car networks is hampering efforts to meet the EU goals, European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said. Asked if there was any consensus building within ACEA on the idea of a suspension of penalties for failing to meet the carbon targets, Jonnaert said: “No. This is an idea but it not something which we as a sector are currently pushing for.”   “We rather want to link the challenges and issues we are facing now to meet the 2020 targets... to the discussion on the how the future will look like, instead of challenging the 2020 targets,” Jonnaert said in an interview on Friday. EU rules in effect from 2020-21 will force new cars to average 95 grammes of CO2 per kilometre, with carmakers facing hundreds of millions of euros in potential fines for non-compliance. The current EU-mandated average is 130 g/km.  Peugeot maker PSA Group’s (PEUP.PA) chief executive Carlos Tavares, who chairs ACEA, has called for the EU penalties to be suspended until governments roll out adequate electric car charging networks, saying last month he planned to raise the proposal at a meeting of Brussels-based ACEA on March 7. Jonnaert, whose group represents 15 global vehicle makers with plants in Europe, told Reuters on the sidelines of an automotive conference in Prague that the 2020 targets were challenging, but the car sector was committed to meeting them. “What we are questioning in this is there are no targets for countries,” he said. “We are asked to meet targets but the countries are not.” The European Commission aims to curb greenhouse gases from transport as part of a drive to cut emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.  It has proposed a 30 percent reduction in the average CO2 emission of carmakers’ fleets by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. It also wants an interim goal of a 15 percent reduction by 2025 to help ensure automakers start investments early. ACEA is seeking a reduction of 20 percent overall. Jonnaert said EU governments needed to help the industry by creating incentives for consumers to use electric cars in addition to building up the network to power them. He also underlined a warning from PSA’s Tavares that a Chinese buyer could to step in with its own electric vehicle technology if European companies were crippled by fines. “It is not just a phantom idea,” Jonnaert said, noting the auto industry employs 12.6 million workers in Europe.  There is rising concern about foreign influence over European manufacturers, jobs and technology, which have escalated since China’s Geely (0175.HK) snapped up 10 percent of Germany’s Daimler (DAIGn.DE) in February.

2018-04-13,"MEXICO CITY, April 13 (Reuters) - Mexico’s energy minister on Friday rejected calls by the frontrunner in the country’s upcoming presidential race to freeze gasoline prices, saying the government must find better ways to avoid price spikes. Leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is leading most polls by double digits ahead of the July 1 vote, said this week he would mandate a three-year fuel price freeze if elected. While a promise to fix gasoline and diesel prices might seem attractive, consequences of such a government-mandated policy would be unpredictable, said Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell at an event in the capital. “It’s easy to freeze but, on the other hand, the challenge is how you unfreeze,” he said. “When you unfreeze, buckle your seat belts because prices are going to jump.” Mexico, which has over the past couple years gradually ended a policy of government-set gasoline prices, was rocked by protests early last year after a double-digit increase. The so-called “gasolinazo,” which officials defended at the time as a necessary measure to end costly fuel subsidies, helped sink President Enrique Pena Nieto’s approval rating to historic lows. The liberalization of fuel prices in Mexico is part of a landmark energy reform finalized in 2014. The energy minister said the government should instead find ways to make prices for motor fuels, as well as electricity rates, as low as possible through what he described as “technology and competence.” The longtime politician whose family also owns several Pemex gas stations said the finance ministry’s current policy of weekly adjustments to a key tax applied to fuel sales is a better way to keep volatile prices swings at bay. “That permits you to cushion the volatility without the need to manipulate the market,” he said.

2018-04-13,"MOSCOW, April 13 (Reuters) - Alexei Miller, head of Russian gas giant Gazprom, will have to lower his public profile and delegate to someone else his powers to clinch deals and raise financing now that he has been added to a U.S. sanctions blacklist, analysts said. Washington last week imposed sanctions against several Russian businessmen, companies and government officials, striking at associates of President Vladimir Putin to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. While Gazprom was not affected, Miller himself was added to the so-called Specially-Designated Nationals List, which bars U.S. individuals and entities from having any dealings with him. Firms outside U.S. jurisdiction can be punished if Washington deems they are helping a sanctioned entity. “It is possible, that to soothe the worries of the European partners, Miller will have to delegate his powers to an attorney,” Fitch Ratings analyst Dmitry Marinchenko said. Gazprom did not respond to a request for comment. Miller said last week he was proud to be included on the sanctions list. Gazprom has no direct tie-ups with U.S. firms, but it has a web of commercial relationships in Europe, where it supplies around a third of the bloc’s natural gas needs. Uniper, Shell, Engie, OMV and Wintershall are among Gazprom’s key European partners. “Technically speaking, unlike for U.S. persons, foreign persons from the EU can meet and negotiate with Mr Miller short of signing anything material for their companies and Gazprom,” George Voloshin, from Aperio Intelligence consultancy in Paris, said. “But, since we are walking a very fine line here in terms of jurisprudence, they will most likely prefer the safest option, excluding Mr Miller from all business-related dealings,” he said. Miller worked with President Putin in the St Petersburg city administration in the early 1990s, when Putin was an advisor to the mayor. Miller has been at the helm of Gazprom since 2001. Gazprom’s annual investments are almost 1.3 trillion roubles ($21 billion), while its international borrowings total around 0.5 trillion roubles, the largest among all Russian companies. According to Fitch, in 2018-2019 Gazprom will have to redeem $20 billion of debt.

2018-04-13,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - France’s Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA) aims to take the lead on the development of a new European fighter jet, its chief executive told a German magazine.  “Experience has shown, if you want a defense project to be successful it needs someone to be responsible, a leader,” German weekly WirtschaftsWoche quoted Eric Trappier as saying in an interview. France and Germany are expected to announce initial details about the planned new warplane development program at the ILA Berlin Air Show, which starts on April 25. The two countries are due to sign a 10-page common operational requirements document at the airshow that outlines their militaries’ basic needs for future air combat systems, one of several planned Franco-German defense projects. The new combat system could involve a mixture of manned and unmanned aircraft and would eventually replace Dassault’s Rafale, and the Eurofighter, built by Airbus (AIR.PA), Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Italy’s Leonardo (LDOF.MI). The companies involved - Dassault, MBDA, Thales (TCFP.PA) and Safran (SAF.PA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) - are racing to prepare some kind of initial memorandum of understanding as well, but no details have yet been finalised, according to industry sources. The scale of the development effort points to a cooperative approach, although some have called for the naming of one lead nation and contractor to avoid the problems seen on the multinational A400M military transport program.  “We can take the lead role,” Dassault’s Trappier told WirtschaftsWoche. “The fact is: We are the only company in Europe that can build a complete fighter jet from A to Z and are the only ones who have 70 years of experience and skills,” he said. He said he did not expect resistance from Airbus if it was given a junior role in the project, according to the magazine. Airbus Defence and Space Chief Executive Dirk Hoke last year also laid claim to the leading role on the program, given the importance of the program for the European aerospace industry. “It’s a joint German-French program, and it’s clear to everyone in the industry that it must also be a joint effort on the part of industry,” said Airbus spokesman Florian Taitsch, when asked about the Trappier interview. A spokesman for the German defense ministry declined to comment on the Dassault comments. Germany and France are also expected to launch a program at the Berlin air show to develop a successor to their ageing marine surveillance aircraft, the German navy announced this month. An initial life-sized model of a new Euro-drone to be developed by France, Germany and Italy will also be unveiled at the Berlin air show.

2018-04-13,"LONDON, April 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ships carrying goods around the world produce more than 2 percent of the world’s climate-changing emissions – as much as Germany, the European Union says. But shippers – much like aviation companies – until now have not had to set clear targets to slash those emissions. That changed Friday as the International Maritime Organization, meeting in London, agreed a first strategy to cut emissions - in part as a result of pressure from tiny, remote nations such as the Marshall Islands. The country’s low-lying atolls are hugely vulnerable to sea level rise from climate change, it is heavily dependent on shipping – 90 percent of its food arrives that way – and it is home to the world’s second biggest ship registry, behind Panama. That meant “we had a very unique opportunity to shape the outcome” of negotiations, said David Paul, the Marshall Islands’ environment minister. “We are by far dependent, almost entirely, on shipping, one way or the other,” the 43-year-old minister told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. “We’re a small country but when it comes to shipping we are a force to reckon with.” The Marshall Islands, a Pacific nation where the United States carried out nuclear tests in the 1940s and 1950s, is home to 75,000 people, the majority of them living in Majuro, the capital, and Ebeye, the second largest city. Already it is struggling with climate change pressures, from stronger “king tides” that flood homes and fields and seep into the country’s underground fresh water, to worsening droughts, said Paul, who represents Kwajalein Atoll, the country’s largest island, in the country’s legislature. “In the Marshall Islands we’re at the forefront of climate change. We are experiencing it day in and day out,” he said. As saltwater destroys fields and water supplies, “it’s becoming far harder for us to live in certain parts of the country than ever before”. Such creeping losses don’t attract the international attention that powerful cyclones do, but “the frequency of these events adds up, and it really takes a toll on the country”, he said. Despite that, “there’s no way we’re going to migrate and leave the country”, he said. Instead, the country aims to put pressure on bigger nations to cut their emissions and, at home, “to adapt and adjust, to build a community far more resilient than before”. So far the Marshall Islands government is promoting water harvesting, trying out new roof designs aimed at capturing and channeling rain, and experimenting with solar-powered desalination, among other efforts. But the biggest push is to reduce the islands’ own emissions, particularly from diesel-fueled generators that still provide much of the country’s electricity. Home solar power systems are already in widespread use in some remote atolls, and the country is developing a step-by-step plan to install solar power more widely and become carbon neutral by 2050. That will happen largely by cutting fossil fuel use from electricity production and transport, and burning trash to produce electricity, Paul said. The plan, expected to be in place by the end of the year, would be a first for an island nation, said the minister, who formerly managed the country’s utilities and now also serves as minister-in-assistance, standing in as needed for President Hilda Heine. “We absolutely believe we can” become carbon neutral by mid-century, he said. But finding funding to make the switch remains a frustration, not least because the Marshall Islands – like many small island nations – lacks the bureaucratic muscle to make complex funding applications, and because it needs smaller sums which big donors trying to move billions can find challenging. Working through the World Bank, the country received a first grant from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) – the main channel for billions of dollars in climate finance – to build a protective sea wall on Kwajalein Atoll, which is also home to a U.S. military garrison. But getting successful applications together to shift the country’s energy systems has proved harder, Paul said. “There’s a level of frustration we feel. We know what we need and what needs to be done. We just don’t have the resources,” he said. Globally, however, Paul has no doubt a shift to clean energy is coming. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than fossil fuel energy in many parts of the world, and set to get cheaper still, with fast-improving batteries poised to solve the problem of storing renewable energy, he said. Investors and businesses will turn to clean energy “because it makes sense. They will change not to clean the atmosphere but because they want to make money and make their shareholders happy”, he said. But making that happen fast enough to keep the Marshall Islands above water may require financial institutions, governments or other entities stepping in to absorb some of the early risks investors face in switching to clean energy, he said. That could include things like guaranteeing set rates to buy clean power, setting national policies that prioritise buying renewable energy, simplifying permits or offering public loans or tax credits for clean energy investment. “There’s so much (investment) money that’s sitting idle. People don’t know what to do with it,” Paul said. If some of the risk is removed, clean energy investment “could really exponentially take off”.

2018-04-13,"MOSCOW, April 13 (Reuters) - Russian lawmakers said on Friday they had drafted legislation in response to new U.S. sanctions that would give the authorities the power to ban or restrict imports of a raft of U.S. goods and services to Russia. Below are the goods that can be banned and cooperation areas which could be affected by the legislation: Many U.S. agricultural imports to Russia have been banned since 2014 as part of wider restrictions Moscow imposed on Western food in retaliation for international sanctions over Ukraine. The products banned include milk and dairy, beef, pork, poultry, fish, fruit, vegetables, and nuts. New restrictions could affect food products which have not been targeted by the existing ban, such as tea, coffee, confectionery, although no detailed list was unveiled. According to the Russian Agriculture Ministry, U.S. imports of agricultural products stood at $930 million in 2017. Russia imports U.S. spirits including whiskeys Jim Beam and Brown-Forman’s Jack Daniels. U.S. cigarette brands are mostly produced locally. U.S. imports of tobacco products and hard liquor to Russia amounted to $76 million and $53 million respectively last year, the Russian Agriculture Ministry said. The proposed measures envisage a full or partial ban on imports of U.S. pharmaceutical products, with the exception given to drugs that have no alternatives produced in Russia or elsewhere. The lawmakers said “any other” U.S.-made products could be banned, without elaborating. The list has to be defined by the Russian government. Russia may ban state entities from procuring U.S. technological equipment and software, potentially targeting Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Cisco and others. The measures include a proposed ban for U.S. companies or companies in which U.S. direct or indirect ownership exceeds 25 percent to provide consulting, audit and legal services to Russian state and municipal entities. The measures include restrictions on Russian exports of products and equipment made of rare earth metals. A Russian senator said on Friday that could mean a ban on titanium exports from VSMPO-Avisama to Boeing. The proposed measures suggest Russia should suspend cooperation with the United States on atomic energy, rocket engines and aircraft manufacturing. The latter could have an impact on Irkut’s MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, powered by engines supplied by Pratt & Whitney which is owned by Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. Irkut’s state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation declined comment. Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom is also a major supplier of enriched uranium to the United States. Russia supplies meet around 20 percent of U.S. uranium needs. Rosatom also cooperates with General Electric Co on turbines through GE’s French subsidiary Alstom. The new legislation could also hurt the U.S.-Russia initiative to prevent nuclear terrorism. Russian lawmakers suggest Russia should ban U.S. companies or entities in which U.S. companies have more than 25 percent from taking part in privatisation of state and municipal assets. Such companies also should not help arrange Russian privatisation deals - a measure likely targeting U.S. investment banks J.P.Morgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley The lawmakers suggested raising air navigation services charges for U.S. planes using the Russian airspace.

2018-04-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies appear to have accomplished their mission of reducing global oil stocks to desired levels, the International Energy Agency said on Friday, signalling that the market could become too tight if supply remains restrained. The IEA, which coordinates the energy policies of industrialised nations, said stocks in developed countries could fall to their five-year average - a metric used by OPEC to measure the success of output cuts - as early as May. “It is not for us to declare on behalf of the Vienna agreement countries that it is ‘mission accomplished’, but if our outlook is accurate, it certainly looks very much like it,” the IEA said in its monthly report. Vienna-based OPEC has reduced production in tandem with Russia and other allies since January 2017 to prop up oil prices, which soared above $70 per barrel this month, giving a new boost to booming U.S. output of shale oil. GRAPHIC: OECD stocks vs. five-year average - reut.rs/2HofgVn GRAPHIC: Stocks as days of forward demand vs. five-year average  - reut.rs/2GSOBAi But as oil production has collapsed in OPEC member Venezuela and still faces hiccups in peers such as Libya and Angola, the oil exporter group is producing below its targets, meaning the world needs to use stocks to meet rising demand. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in a monthly report that oil stocks in the developed world were only 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average. The Paris-based IEA put the figure at just 30 million barrels as of the end of February. The IEA said that even though non-OPEC output was set to soar by 1.8 million barrels per day this year on higher U.S. production, it was not enough to meet global demand, expected to rise by 1.5 million bpd or around 1.5 percent. OPEC was producing 31.83 million bpd in March, below the call on its crude for the rest of the year at 32.5 million bpd. “Our balances show that if OPEC production were constant this year, and if our outlooks for non-OPEC production and oil demand remain unchanged, in 2Q18-4Q18 global stocks could draw by about 0.6 million bpd,” the IEA said. The figure would represent 0.6 percent of global supply or around half of OPEC’s current production cuts of nearly 1.2 million bpd.  The output-limiting pact runs until the year-end. OPEC meets in June to decide its next steps. The organisation’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has said it would like the agreement to extend into 2019. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters on Thursday OPEC and its allies were poised to extend the pact into next year even as a glut of crude should evaporate by September. “OPEC is within rapid reach of its first announced goals and will have to come up with a new metric for the June meeting if it wants the agreement to last into the second half of the year,” said Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix consultancy. Qatar’s energy minister told Reuters last week that even though stocks around the world were falling, an investment drought continued to afflict the oil industry and hence the price of crude could spike in the long run. Reuters market analyst John Kemp argues that recent statements from OPEC members indicate the organisation appears to be reformulating its target in terms of upstream investment rather than inventories.

2018-04-13,"(Adds detail, comments) By Vladimir Soldatkin MOSCOW, April 13 (Reuters) - Moscow tightened its grip on Russia’s biggest port operator on Friday, making a government official chairman and ousting representatives of the only private shareholder from the board. The changes follow the arrest last month on organised crime and embezzlement charges of Ziyavudin Magomedov, head of the Summa conglomerate which with a joint venture partner owns a 50.1 percent stake in the port operator. He denies the charges. Several senior Russian business executives have said the prosecution would allow the state to extend its control over the Russian economy, after bringing most of the oil sector back into state hands since Vladimir Putin became president 18 years ago. Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (NCSP), controls Russia’s Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea, and the Primorsk port on the Baltic. Both are major terminals for exports of oil and oil products to world markets. The new chairman of the NCSP board is Dmitry Pristanskov, head of the federal property agency who succeeds Rashid Sharipov from state-owned pipeline monopoly Transneft. Summa representatives previously had two seats on NCSP’s board, but after Friday’s changes, Russian state pipeline monopoly Transneft has four out of seven board positions. Summa and Transneft jointly control Novoport Holding company, which owns 50.1 percent of NCSP. Transneft also has 10.5 percent in NCSP, while the Russian state property fund controls 20 percent. Transneft has for some time been seeking to acquire Summa’s stake in NCSP and gain control of the port. Although Russia’s state anti-trust regulator approved Transneft’s bid in February, talks on the deal have been suspended. Pyotr Aven, president of Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest private lender, in comments about Magomedov’s arrest and growing government control over the economy, said earlier this month that the growing state has been stifling competition.

The world’s top oil importer has spent the past 15 years creating what the IEA called “the world’s most ambitious strategic crude reserves programme” since the 1970s. But its purchasing pace slid by half last year, the IEA said, slowed by technical problems and “reduced urgency in an era of plentiful supply”. In 2018, the IEA said it expects the amount of oil flowing to these sites to rise by 34.5 million barrels, or 95,000 barrels per day (bpd), up by roughly 28 percent from 2017’s fill of 27 million barrels. The urgency to build and fill sites after this year could get a fillip, the IEA said, from the growing rift between China and the United States - a newly important oil exporter whose President Donald Trump has angered China by threatening to impose billions of dollars in trade tariffs. “If current trade tensions between the U.S. and China were to escalate, and given that the U.S. is a growing supplier of crude to Chinese refiners, it is possible that the SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) programme will benefit from renewed impetus,” the IEA said. China’s oil buying plans, and the level of crude stored in strategic sites dotted across the nation, are closely watched by the oil industry as a signal of how much more the key consumer is likely to absorb. The country’s March imports hit 9.22 million bpd, the second highest on record, with first-quarter imports 7 percent higher at roughly 9.09 million bpd. But information on strategic stocks is shrouded in secrecy, with government reports on the fill level coming only with several months’ lag, and the IEA said the latest report did not include all the sites that are part of the programme. IEA estimates showed China’s strategic reserves at 287 million barrels at the end of 2017, putting them at 57 percent of the government’s 500 million barrel target for the first three phases of purchasing set in 2004. It added that stocks at Tianjin Phase 2 drew last year, and that information from data analytics company Kayrros showed that CNPC’s Dushanzi reserve also drew to two-thirds of its capacity during 2017. The Chinese government’s reporting put strategic reserves at 274 million barrels by mid-2017, 33 million barrels higher than the middle of 2016.

2018-04-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (TAMO.NS) will cut around 1,000 jobs and production at two of its English factories due to a fall in sales caused by uncertainty around Brexit and confusion over diesel policy, a source told Reuters.  Output will be cut at its central English Solihull and Castle Bromwich plants, affecting some 1,000 agency workers, the source said.  A spokesman at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) declined to comment on the number of jobs which would be lost but the firm said it would be making changes to its output plans.  “In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some adjustments to our production schedules and the level of agency staff,” the company said in a statement. It is not renewing the contracts of a number of agency staff at the Solihull site and would be informing staff on Monday of its plans for the 2018-19 financial year.  In January, the firm said it would temporarily reduce production at its other British plant of Halewood later this year in response to weakening demand due to Brexit and tax hikes on diesel cars but did not detail any job losses.  Jaguar sales are down 26 percent so far this year whilst Land Rover demand dropped 20 percent in its home market as buyers shun diesel, concerned over planned tax rises and possible bans and restrictions in several countries.  “It’s been obvious to everyone that sales have been dropping,” the source said.  British new car registrations have been falling for a year which the car industry body has partly blamed on weakening consumer confidence in the wake of the Brexit vote, after record demand in 2015 and 2016.

2018-04-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is the world’s most profitable oil company, Bloomberg reported on Friday, but its huge earnings and cash flows may still fail to justify its desired $2 trillion valuation. Financial performance at Aramco has long been one of the best kept secrets in the oil industry but as the company prepares for a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) this year or next it needs to tell investors what it earns and how it operates. Bloomberg news agency cited company accounts as saying Aramco had net income of $33.8 billion in the first six months of 2017 and cash flows of $52.1 billion.  Aramco said: “This is inaccurate, Saudi Aramco does not comment on speculation regarding its financial performance and fiscal regime.” The accounts, prepared to the IFRS standard, showed the firm made $7.2 billion in net income in the first of half of 2016, when crude averaged $41 a barrel, Bloomberg said.  Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has made the Aramco IPO a cornerstone of Saudi economic reform to 2030, wants to raise a record $100 billion by selling a 5 percent stake in Aramco on local and foreign exchanges.  That would give Aramco a market capitalization of $2 trillion, the biggest achieved by any company and dwarfing peers such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L). By comparison, Shell’s current cost of supplies earnings excluding one-offs - the closest equivalent to net income - stood at $7.4 billion in the first half of 2017, the same as Exxon’s. Exxon had cash flow from operations and asset sales at $16 billion in the first half of 2017, compared with Shell cash flows of $20.8 billion. Exxon’s current market capitalization stands at $327 billion and Shell is worth $285 billion. Even though Aramco’s cash flows are two to three times bigger, its desire for a market value six to seven times higher than those of Exxon or Shell might look too ambitious to many investors and analysts who have said the company could be worth more than $1 trillion.

2018-04-13,"(Adds quote, background) OSLO, April 13 (Reuters) - The world’s northernmost oilfield was shut on Friday when a fire broke out in a sauna in the oil platform’s living quarters, Eni, the Italian oil company that operates the field, said. The Arctic Goliat field is in the Barents Sea about 88 kilometres off the coast of Norway and inside the Arctic Circle. The platform has floating production, storage and offloading facilities and can produce close to 100,000 barrels of crude per day. The fire was quickly put out, and no crew members were injured, although some smoke did develop, Eni said. “All safety procedures worked appropriately: the production was shut down and the crew mustered to the lifeboats,” the company said in a statement. Eni said the rig has a crew of about 120 people. Output from the platform remains shut and it was not yet clear when it will resume, a company spokesman told Reuters. The spokesman also said it was quite common for offshore oil rigs to have saunas. The Goliat field has had a series of problems and has been shut several times because of technical glitches, including a more than two-month outage in late 2017.

Global stock markets have had a whipsaw week, largely fuelled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tendency to change his mind over key policy and political issues. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries was up nearly 0.1 percent on the day. It has gained nearly 2 percent this week, its best weekly showing since March. -European hit new one-month highs, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index on track for its third straight week of gains, its longest winning streak since January. The beginnings of European companies’ first-quarter results were largely positive, though misses were badly punished. Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up a slim 0.1 percent, still up about 2 percent on the week. Overall, Friday’s performance in stocks seemed to suggest investors were relieved at apparent suggestions from Trump that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent. However, the threat of a strike remained after Washington’s earlier warnings against the Syrian government for what is said was a suspected poison gas attack on its civilians. “It would be naïve in the extreme to suggest that the events of the last 24 hours means that the threat of an escalation of geopolitical factors has passed,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “But for now while the background noise is driving the short-term direction as markets gyrate higher and lower, recent price action might suggest that we could look to head towards the upper end of the trading range in the coming days, particularly if U.S. earnings come in ahead of expectations.” The earnings season begins in earnest on Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Wall Street was set to open higher. Analysts expect quarterly profit for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, in what would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors had other reasons to fret, however. Mixed data from China showed March exports unexpectedly fell 2.7 percent from a year earlier while imports jumped more than forecast. While the figures pointed to robust demand from the world’s top consumer of crude, copper and iron ore, they left the country with a rare trade deficit of $4.98 billion for the month, the first since last February. Trade tensions also were not far from the surface, with analysts at Citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open Asian economies such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. In the most recent change of tack, Trump Thursday asked his advisers to look at re-joining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact he withdrew the United States from early last year. But he later tweeted that the United States would only join the TPP if the deal were substantially better than the one offered to former President Barack Obama. The return of risk appetite also played out in the currencies and commodities complex. The dollar hit a seven-week high against the Japanese yen. The yen tends to benefit from geopolitical uncertainty and risk aversion. The Australian dollar, considered a proxy for risk sentiment, rose to a four-week high against its U.S. counterpart. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1 percent. Aluminium hit a six-year high on Friday and remained on track for the biggest weekly gain on record after the United States imposed sanctions on Russia’s UC Rusal, the world’s second-biggest producer of the metal. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,337.04 an ounce and was set for a weekly gain of almost 0.4 percent. Oil prices edged lower, but were set for their biggest weekly gain since last July. Brent crude futures fell 0.4 percent to $71.75 per barrel. U.S. WTI crude futures fell 0.3 percent to $66.84. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Hideyuki

2018-04-13,"JAKARTA, April 13 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has asked Indonesia to rethink a policy allowing the government to control domestic fuel pricing, a company official said, an area “fundamental” to its fuel distribution business. Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources announced on Monday that President Joko Widodo wanted to issue rules allowing the government to regulate fuel prices to control inflation. Non-subsidised fuel prices are currently set by retailers, but under a planned regulation the government would have the right to decide whether retailers can change fuel prices. Shell operated in many countries and understood “government concerns related to the impacts of increasing consumer fuel prices on inflation,” PT Shell Indonesia Retail Director Wahyu Indrawanto said in an emailed statement reviewed by Reuters late on Thursday. Shell had observed several alternative policies to control inflation and had “passed them on to the government hoping this can be given further consideration,” Indrawanto said. “In principle, certainty of being able to sell consumer fuel at economic prices is fundamental to maintaining an investment climate and sustainability in Shell’s fuel distribution business,” Indrawanto said. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Thursday that maintaining commodity supplies and prices were important elements in maintaining low and stable inflation to keep Indonesian economic growth above 5 percent. Indonesia was “not going back to what we call a practice that is going to subsidise everything, or in this case curtailing the market mechanisms,” Indrawati said in response to questions on the subsidy policy at a press conference. “Of course, just like in transport, there is always healthy and non-healthy competition, excessive profit and non-excessive profit.” The fuel pricing policy would follow an existing rule on the retail fuel sector that governed pricing and operations, she added. “We are focussing on enforcement and policy instruments that can protect our people’s confidence that our economy is growing (and) that we can guard against external fluctuations, be it oil prices, Fed interest rates (or) a trade war,” Indrawati told reporters separately while attending meetings at the parliament. President Joko Widodo won international praise and sovereign bond rating upgrades for Southeast Asia’s largest economy after cutting government fuel spending by more than 90 percent and shifting the burden of petroleum subsidies to Pertamina shortly after taking office in 2014. But the latest energy policies contrast with Widodo’s earlier moves to eliminate subsidies and have raised concerns among some economists. Net oil importer Indonesia’s fuel subsidies have been blamed for creating a false economy, widespread smuggling and corruption. $1 = 13,760 rupiah

2018-04-13,"* MSCI All Country World Index set for best week in a month * Easing fear of imminent U.S. attack on Syria * China trade data mixed, runs a rare deficit in March * Dollar jumps to six-week high vs. yen * Oil set for highest weekly gain since July * Gold set for second week of gains * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - World stocks and commodities rose on Friday, with stocks set to post their biggest weekly gain in over a month as investors seemed to shrug off the uncertainty over tension in the Middle East and the prospect of a global trade war. Global stock markets have had a whipsaw week, largely fuelled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tendency to change his mind over key policy and political issues. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries was up nearly 0.1 percent on the day. It has gained nearly 2 percent this week, its best weekly showing since March. European bourses opened positive, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index on track for its third straight week of gains, its longest winning streak since January. The beginnings of European companies’ first-quarter results were largely positive, though misses were badly punished. Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up a slim 0.1 percent, still up about 2 percent on the week. Overall, Friday’s performance in stocks seemed to suggest investors were relieved at apparent suggestions from Trump that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent. However, the threat of a strike remained after Washington’s earlier warnings against the Syrian government for what is said was a suspected poison gas attack on its civilians. “It would be naïve in the extreme to suggest that the events of the last 24 hours means that the threat of an escalation of geopolitical factors has passed,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “But for now while the background noise is driving the short-term direction as markets gyrate higher and lower, recent price action might suggest that we could look to head towards the upper end of the trading range in the coming days, particularly if U.S. earnings come in ahead of expectations.” The earnings season begins in earnest on Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Analysts expect quarterly profit for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, in what would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors had other reasons to fret, however. Mixed data from China showed March exports unexpectedly fell 2.7 percent from a year earlier while imports jumped more than forecast. While the figures pointed to robust demand from the world’s top consumer of crude, copper and iron ore, they left the country with a rare trade deficit of $4.98 billion for the month, the first since last February. Trade tensions also were not far from the surface, with analysts at Citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open Asian economies such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. In the most recent change of tack, Trump Thursday asked his advisers to look at re-joining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact he withdrew the United States from early last year. But he later tweeted that the United States would only join the TPP if the deal were substantially better than the one offered to former President Barack Obama. The return of risk appetite also played out in the currencies and commodities complex. The dollar hit a six-week high against the Japanese yen. The yen tends to benefit from geopolitical uncertainty and risk aversion. The Australian dollar, considered a proxy for risk sentiement, rose to a three-week high. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.1 percent. London aluminium slipped on Friday but was on track for its biggest weekly gain on record after the United States imposed sanctions on Russia’s UC Rusal, the world’s second biggest producer of the metal, raising supply concerns. Spot gold was up 0.4 percent at $1,340.37 an ounce and was set for a weekly gain of almost 0.4 percent. Oil prices edged higher and were set for their biggest weekly gains since last July. Brent crude futures rose 0.3 percent to $72.21 per barrel. U.S. WTI crude futures rose 0.2 percent to $67.19. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Hideyuki

2018-04-13,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Comments by OPEC ministers: tmsnrt.rs/2GU0ZQL By John Kemp LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - OPEC appears to be reformulating its target in terms of upstream investment rather than oil inventories, according to an analysis of recent statements made by ministers from member countries. “There is no such thing as a target price by Saudi Arabia,” the kingdom’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, told reporters on Wednesday (“Saudi Arabia happy with oil market, won’t let another glut form”, Reuters, April 11). “We’re seeing (production in) many regions declining. The only way to offset this is for the financial markets to start financing and funding upstream projects,” Falih observed. “I don’t know what is the price that will provide that equilibrium. All we know is in 2018 we’re still not seeing that.” Falih’s comments suggest the kingdom is now targeting a sustainable level of exploration and production – and prices will have to rise further to incentivise it. The new weight attached to sustainable investment echoes comments made by other ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in recent weeks. “We will know we have a good price when the market is balanced and we have enough investments. We need to have more investments coming”, the UAE energy minister said on April 11 (“UAE says producers trying to define structure for long-term alliance”, Reuters, April 11). “There has been a clear recovery in oil prices. But it has not been met with an increase in investments ... Investment has been very low,” Qatar’s energy minister said on April 5. “Investors are still cautious and over-conservative. We need to restore investments,” he added (“Qatar says too early to exit OPEC oil cuts as investment still low”, Reuters, April 5). The emphasis on investment stands in marked contrast to the previous focus on reducing oil inventories in the OECD industrialised countries to the five-year average. “Almost the single metric that we look at is global inventories and of course the most transparent and trustworthy is the OECD inventories,” Falih said as recently as December. The recent shift from inventories to investment is consistent across multiple ministers, which suggests it is the result of private discussions within OPEC (tmsnrt.rs/2GU0ZQL). Focusing on investment is not new for the organisation. The need for prices high enough to support sustainable investment in production has been acknowledged since OPEC was created. OPEC’s founding statute, approved in 1961, commits the organisation to stabilising prices, securing a steady income for producing countries, and ensuring a fair return on capital to investors in the petroleum industry. OPEC members have often stated the need for “security of demand” and for prices to be high enough to justify investment in new capacity. As a practical matter, the overriding target for OPEC members has always been to maximise government revenues from the sale of petroleum. But the organisation has rarely stated its objective so bluntly and has normally preferred to declare a less controversial intermediate or operational target such as tax rates, sustainable investment, inventories or price stability. In the early years, OPEC began by focusing on raising royalties and tax rates (1960s), then increasing prices and obtaining equity ownership of oil production (1970s). By the early 1980s, OPEC members had obtained complete ownership of production on their territories and the focus shifted more explicitly to revenue maximisation. Since that time, OPEC has alternated regularly between trying to raise prices and trying to protect its market share against rivals. In the most recent cycle, OPEC focused on maintaining prices above $100 per barrel between 2011 and the middle of 2014. From mid-2014 to mid-2016, OPEC switched to defending market share against competition from U.S. shale and other producers, and was prepared to allow prices to slump to protect its exports. Since the end of 2016, OPEC’s priority has reverted to raising prices and it has been willing to sacrifice some market share to attain that goal. FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE In the early stages of its current price-protection strategy, OPEC formulated its goal in terms of the need to reduce excess inventories that had built up during the slump. Higher prices were merely an incidental benefit of cutting stockpiles back towards the five-year average - at least in theory. In practice, higher prices and revenues have been the main benefit of the strategy, with benchmark Brent prices increasing from $46 to $72 since OPEC announced it would cut production. Inventories are now close to the five-year average, and have actually fallen below it in terms of forward cover, but OPEC members still appear to want to continue curbing output and raising prices. So the inventory target has been swapped for an investment objective to justify continued production restraint. Saudi officials remain coy about the kingdom’s target for oil prices and the energy minister has flatly denied there is one. But the kingdom’s comments and supply behaviour suggest it is reasonable to infer that it has an undeclared target of around $80 +/- $5 per barrel (“Saudi Arabia signals ambition for $80 oil price”, Bloomberg, April 10). Prices around $80 would balance the kingdom’s budget, help pay for the government’s ambitious reform programme, and make it easier to achieve a notional $2 trillion valuation when shares in state oil producer Saudi Aramco are sold. OPEC’s ambitions for prices have steadily increased from around $60 to $70 and now $80 over the last 18 months, based on comments made by ministers and other senior officials. The escalation in the organisation’s price target fits a familiar pattern in which the more prices rise, the more OPEC hopes they will increase further. For OPEC members, the sustainable equilibrium price is almost always at least $10 higher than the current price. But by chasing higher prices, the organisation risks increasing rival supplies from U.S. shale and other producers as well as slower growth in oil consumption. OPEC members have said they want to see more investment - but that implies higher output from U.S. shale as well as other non-OPEC sources. Before prices dropped in June 2014, the problem was too much investment, which had caused excessive supply growth and created the conditions for the slump. By pushing for higher prices, OPEC may be on the verge of making the same mistake again.

2018-04-13,"* IEA says stocks could reach five-year average by May * OPEC still planning to extend supply cuts into 2019 * IEA says stocks could fall sharply if cuts maintained By Dmitry Zhdannikov LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies appear to have accomplished their mission of bringing global oil stocks to desired levels, the International Energy Agency said on Friday, signalling that the markets could become too tight if supply remains restrained. The IEA, which coordinates the energy policies of industrialised nations, said global stocks in developed countries could fall to their five-year average - a metric used by OPEC to measure the success of output cuts - as early as May. “It is not for us to declare on behalf of the Vienna agreement countries that it is ‘mission accomplished’, but if our outlook is accurate, it certainly looks very much like it,” the IEA said in its monthly report. Vienna-based OPEC has reduced production in tandem with Russia and other allies since January 2017 to prop up global oil prices, which soared above $70 per barrel this month, giving a new boost to booming U.S. shale oil output. But as oil production collapsed in OPEC member Venezuela and still faces hiccups in countries such as Libya and Angola, the oil exporter group is producing below its targets, meaning the world needs to use stocks to meet rising demand. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in its monthly report that oil stocks in the developed world were only 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average. The Paris-based IEA put the figure at just 30 million barrels as of the end of February. The IEA said that even though non-OPEC output was set to soar by 1.8 million barrels per day this year on higher U.S. production, it was not enough to meet global demand, expected to rise by 1.5 million bpd or around 1.5 percent. With production declines in Venezuela and Africa, OPEC was producing 31.83 million bpd in March, below the call on its crude for the rest of the year at 32.5 million bpd. “Our balances show that if OPEC production were constant this year, and if our outlooks for non-OPEC production and oil demand remain unchanged, in 2Q18-4Q18 global stocks could draw by about 0.6 million bpd,” the IEA said. The figure would represent 0.6 percent of global supply or around half of OPEC’s current production cuts of nearly 1.2 million bpd. The output-limiting pact runs until the end of the year and OPEC meets in June to decide its next course of action. OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has said it would like the pact to be extended into 2019. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters on Thursday OPEC and its allies were poised to extend the pact into 2019 even as a global glut of crude was set to evaporate by September.

2018-04-13,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s trade surplus with the United States surged nearly 20 percent in the first quarter, with some analysts speculating exporters were rushing out shipments to get ahead of threatened tariffs that are spurring fears of a full-blown trade war. The latest readings on the health of China’s trade sector  are unlikely to ease tensions following weeks of tit-for-tat tariff threats by Washington and Beijing, though they suggest China’s economy is still in relatively solid shape. Even as China’s trade surplus narrowed overall in the first three months of the year, its surplus with the U.S. surged 19.4 percent to $58.25 billion (£40.8 billion) from a year earlier, customs data showed on Friday. While China was busy selling more to the U.S., it was buying more from other countries, and ran a $9.86 billion deficit with the rest of the world in the quarter. China’s overall exports and imports both grew at a strong double-digit clip early in the year, and while exports unexpectedly fell in March — resulting in a rare trade deficit —  most analysts chalked it up to seasonal factors and said it was too early to call a trend. Still, while no hard timeline has been set by either Washington or Beijing for the actual imposition of tariffs, analysts said China’s exporters may already be adapting their strategies as punitive trade measures loom. China’s first-quarter exports to the U.S. rose 14.8 percent from a year earlier, despite a 5.6 percent drop in March. Its imports from the U.S. rose 8.9 percent in the quarter and 3.2 percent in March. That helped narrow its surplus with the U.S. in March alone to $15.43 billion from $20.96 billion in February, but that was still nearly 18 percent higher than March 2017. “The sharp decline in March export growth after very solid performance in January and February suggests some exporters may have front-loaded exports (early) this year due to concern over the possibility of a Sino-U.S. trade war after the U.S. hiked tariffs on global imports on solar panels and washing machines,” said Lisheng Wang, an economist at Nomura in Hong Kong. “We believe export growth will slow due to yuan appreciation and rising trade tensions...China’s imports could be more resilient than exports in our view as China has pledged to increase imports,” Wang said. China’s total aluminium exports in March rose to their highest since June, just as the United States imposed tariffs on imports of the metal and steel on March 23.  For the first quarter as a whole, China’s exports grew a hearty 14.1 percent from a year earlier. March shipments fell 2.7 percent, however, lagging analysts’ forecasts for a 10.0 percent increase, and down from a sharper-than-expected 44.5 percent jump in February, which economists believe was heavily distorted by seasonal factors. “Most of (the March) drop is seasonal – Chinese New Year was later than usual this year, meaning more of the holiday disruptions will have dragged into March than in 2017,” Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note.  March import growth of 14.4 percent beat expectations, however, suggesting China’s domestic demand may still be solid enough to cushion the blow from any trade shocks. Analysts had expected imports to grow 10.0 percent in March, picking up from 6.3 percent growth in February.  That produced an unexpected trade deficit of $4.98 billion for the month, but such shortfalls are not uncommon for China early in the year, again likely due to holiday distortions. For Jan-March, imports rose a strong 18.9 percent on-year.  Imports of commodities continued to lead the way in March as manufacturers replenished inventories ahead of a seasonal pick-up in demand. Shipments of copper, crude oil, iron ore and soybeans all rose from the previous month.          Analysts are still expecting China’s economic growth to slow later in the year, however, as a cooling property market weighs on demand for building materials from cement to steel. GRAPHIC - Trends in China's trade and other key economic indicators: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a China’s exports rode a global trade boom last year, expanding at the fastest pace since 2013 and serving as one of the key drivers behind the economy’s forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion. But the sudden spike in trade tensions with the United States is clouding the outlook for both China’s “old economy” heavy industries and “new economy” tech firms alike. Washington says China’s $375 billion trade surplus with the United States is unacceptable, and has demanded Beijing reduce it by $100 billion immediately. In a move to further force China to lower the billions of goods trade surplus running with the U.S., Trump unveiled tariff representing about $50 billion of technology, transport and medical products early this month, drawing an immediate threat of retaliatory action from Beijing. China’s tech sector, which is key part of Beijing’s longer-term “Made in China 2025” strategy to move from cheap goods to higher-value manufacturing, may be particularly vulnerable. Hi-tech products have been among its fastest growing export segments. China exported $137.8 billion worth of high-tech products in the first quarter, up 20.5 percent on-year.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tendency to change his mind over key policy and political issues has fuelled wild market gyrations in recent weeks. Spreadbetters pointed to a largely muted start for Europe, with FTSE futures a shade higher and DAX futures up 0.2 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P500 were unchanged as were Dow futures. Investors were also reviewing mixed data from China which showed March exports unexpectedly fell 2.7 percent from a year earlier while imports jumped more than forecast. While the figures pointed to robust demand from the world’s top consumer of crude, copper and iron ore, they left the country with a rare trade deficit of $4.98 billion for the month, the first since last February. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up a slim 0.1 percent, having risen as much as 0.5 percent in morning trading. It is still up about 2 percent on the week. Chinese shares took a knock, with both the blue-chip CSI300 index and Shanghai’s SSE Composite falling 0.8 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index inched lower too while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.55 percent. The earnings season begins in earnest on Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Analysts expect quarterly profit for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, in what would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Still, investors also had reason to fret. “The worry-list for investors remains long with another military strike on Syria after yet another chemical attack looming large and the Mueller inquiry getting even closer to Trump,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist at AMP Capital. Markets heaved a sigh of relief over suggestions from Trump that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent. However, the threat of a strike remained after Washington’s earlier warnings against the Syrian government for what is said was a suspected poison gas attack on its civilians. Trade tensions also wasn’t far off the surface, with analysts at Citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open Asian economies such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. In the most recent change of tack, Trump Thursday asked his advisers to look at re-joining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact he withdrew the United States from early last year. But he later tweeted that the United States would only join the TPP if the deal were substantially better than the one offered to former President Barack Obama. “Markets have been pushed around by Trump,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings. “His modus operandi seems to do anything that seems to be good for his re-election. If protectionism doesn’t work, he may switch to international trade,” he added. “Markets are still not yet convinced yet if the U.S. is really re-joining the TPP. But if it does, it’s very positive for the global economy and stock markets will like it.” In the currency market, the dollar gained to at 107.57 yen , a level not seen since Feb.22. The euro was flat at $1.2326, though on the week it has kept gains of 0.4 percent. Oil prices edged lower but are still set for their biggest weekly gains since last July.

2018-04-13,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A major smog indicator in China’s heavy industrial Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region rose by more than a quarter in March, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said on Friday, raising concerns that pollution is increasing with the end of winter output restrictions. Concentrations of particulate matter of less than 2.5 microns, known as PM2.5, climbed to 80 micrograms per cubic metre in the region last month, an increase of 27 percent from a year ago, the ministry said.  The region includes China’s capital and Tangshan, the world’s largest steel producing city.  A six-month anti-pollution campaign that ended on March 15 required 28 Chinese cities to reduce PM2.5 levels by as much as 25 percent by slashing industrial output, restricting traffic and cutting coal use. During the first quarter, the levels of PM2.5 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, which has been under heavy political pressure to tackle pollution, dropped 22.1 percent to 74 micrograms per cubic metre, down from near record highs in the same period of last year.  That indicates the output cuts were working as intended but their expiration has increased concerns that pollution levels are rebounding as factories, freed from restrictions, ramp up output. Nationwide, during the first quarter, PM2.5 concentrations fell 9.7 percent from a year ago to 56 micrograms per cubic metre in the 338 cities monitored by the ministry. However, in March, average concentrations climbed 2.1 percent from the year before to 48 micrograms per cubic metre.  Seven of China’s 10 most polluted cities in March were in Hebei province, China’s biggest steel producing region. Tangshan and the city of Handan have already decided to extend the winter curbs until November.  However, Xuzhou, an industrial city in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, was also on the list of the 10 smoggiest cities in March and during the first quarter, a sign that China’s smog is shifting from its northern heartlands as a result of the crackdown. The Yangtze river delta region, which comprises Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces and the city of Shanghai, saw PM2.5 levels fall 4 percent in March, but average levels rose 1.8 percent in the first quarter as a whole. China is currently working on a new 2018-2020 action plan to tackle pollution, and experts have urged the government to introduce more targeted measures to tackle rising ground-level ozone, which has become a growing urban health threat. Chinese authorities are working to reduce PM2.5 concentrations because the small size of the particles allows them to be inhaled deep into the lungs and their accumulation eventually can cause lung and heart disorders.

Coal imports last month climbed 20.9 percent from a year ago to 26.7 million tonnes, data released by the General Administration of Customs showed on Friday. That was up from 20.9 million tonnes in February. For the first quarter, China imported 75.41 million tonnes of coal, up 16.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. “Demand was strong in March driven by stockpiling activities from power plant and steel mills,” said Ma Chong, an analyst with Shanghai LS Asset Management Center. China’s six largest coal-fired power plants have boosted their inventories as of April 12 to 14 million tonnes of inventory, equivalent to 20 days of consumption, from only 10 million tonnes at the beginning of this year, equal to 14 days of demand, data from China Sublime Information Group showed.

Investors were also left digesting mixed data from China which showed March exports unexpectedly fell 2.7 percent from a year earlier while imports grew more than forecast. That left the country with a rare trade deficit of $4.98 billion for the month, the first since last February. China is the world’s biggest net crude oil consumer and top buyer of copper, coal, iron ore and soy. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up a slim 0.07 percent, having risen as much as 0.5 percent in morning trading. It is still up about 2 percent on the week. Chinese shares took a small knock, with both the blue-chip CSI300 index and Shanghai’s SSE Composite off 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index eased 0.1 percent while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, futures pointed to a weak start for U.S. shares with E-Minis for S&P 500 down 0.3 percent. The earnings season begins in earnest on Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Analysts expect quarterly profit for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, in what would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Our U.S. equity strategists think that this earnings season should be a significant support for equities as companies deliver stronger than expected earnings growth and provide guidance on shareholder return from the tax windfall,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note. “Our Asia equity strategists agree.” However, trade tensions dominated conversations with analysts at Citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open Asian economies such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. In a change of tack, Trump Thursday asked his trade advisers to look at re-joining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact he withdrew the United States from early last year. But he later tweeted that the United States would only join the TPP if the deal were substantially better than the one offered to former President Barack Obama. “Markets have been pushed around by Trump,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings. “His modus operandi seems to do anything that seems to be good for his re-election. If protectionism doesn’t work, he may switch to international trade,” he added. “Markets are still not yet convinced yet if the U.S. is really re-joining the TPP. But if it does, it’s very positive for the global economy and stock markets will like it.” In the currency market, the dollar was a shade firmer at 107.35 yen, edging near to a five-week high of 107.49 touched on April 5. The yen is sought when investors turn risk averse because Japan’s hefty current surplus and massive offshore assets provide protection against the capital outflows deficit-running countries are vulnerable to. The euro was flat at $1.2328, though on the week it has kept gains of 0.4 percent. Oil prices edged lower following suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent. They are still set for their biggest weekly gains since last July.

2018-04-13,"(Adds fuel exports, comment) * March crude imports at second highest on daily basis * Purchases seen slowing in April/May on overhauls, tax rule * Q1 imports 595,000 bpd above year-earlier - calculations * Refined fuel exports at record high of 6.69 mln T By Chen Aizhu BEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - China’s March crude oil imports climbed from a month earlier to the second highest on record, calculated on a daily basis, as refiners replenished stocks on generous government quotas and ahead of peak maintenance season. March shipments came in at 39.17 million tonnes, or 9.22 million barrels per day (bpd), the General Administration of Customs said on Friday. That compared with 8.41 million bpd in February, and January’s record 9.57 million bpd. Imports for the first quarter grew 7 percent from a year ago to 112.07 million tonnes, or about 9.09 million bpd. That marked an increase of nearly 595,000 bpd on average compared with the same period in 2017. The first-quarter growth was fueled by higher government quotas for independent plants. But a new tax regulation targeted at small refiners and blenders, as well as planned plant overhauls, is seen capping buying for April and May. “Independents remain the largest contributors to the imports growth. We estimate their imports expanded at 30 percent in the first quarter,” said Seng Yick Tee of consultancy SIA Energy. The commissioning of the expanded East Siberia Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline, PetroChina’s newly commissioned Yunnan refinery and CNOOC’s new Huizhou plant also contributed growth, Tee added. At least three large state-run refineries have kicked off major maintenance that will last 40-60 days between April and May. The three plants - Sinopec’s Zhenhai and PetroChina’s Sichuan and Jilin - have a combined daily processing capacity of 860,000 bpd and will reduce China’s imports from Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and Russia. Four independent refineries with a combined capacity of 200,000 bpd also started maintenance this month. Analysts said that was in part triggered by a new consumption tax regulation as crude oil prices have risen. Friday’s customs data also showed China’s March refined fuel exports shot to a new high at 6.69 million tonnes, 43 percent higher than the same month a year earlier. Imports only inched up 2 percent at 2.76 million tonnes. State refiners have stepped up exports to help cope with a growing surplus of refined barrels. In one example, Sinopec is lining up its third very large crude carrier (VLCC) shipment of diesel from China to Europe or West Africa, people familiar with the matter said. “Even in large shipments exports are not profitable, but it helped bolster domestic margins,” said one official with a state-run refiner who declined to be identified because he wasn’t authorised to discuss the matter with media.

2018-04-13,"* Resumption of output, exports comes weeks ahead of expectations * Announcement expected to drag on spot Asia LNG prices near term (Adds comment, detail, prices) MELBOURNE April 13 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp has resumed production at the Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project a fortnight ahead of schedule after it was shut down in the wake of a deadly earthquake in February, its Australian partners said on Friday. Production at the PNG LNG project was halted after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Papua New Guinea’s energy-rich interior on Feb. 26, causing landslides, damaging buildings and killing 100 people. Australia’s Oil Search Ltd and Santos Ltd said they had been advised that one train at the LNG plant near Port Moresby has re-started operations and the second train is expected to resume as gas production ramps up. LNG exports, which were expected to resume shortly, will come weeks ahead of schedule and may put pressure on spot LNG prices, traders said. Exxon Mobil Corp had earlier advised that production would restart in May 2018. “The recommencement of operations at the PNG LNG Project, ahead of ExxonMobil’s previously guided eight week timeframe, is a major achievement by the operator,” said Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten. Exxon Mobil was able to restart production earlier than expected because damage to hundreds of kilometres of pipelines that run through the mountains between gas output facilities and the LNG terminal was much less than initially feared, a source involved with the project told Reuters. Santos is a foundation partner and holds a 13.5 percent interest in PNG LNG. Oil Search has a 29 percent stake. Exxon Mobil declared force majeure on exports from PNG in March and the resulting uncertainty over supply drained liquidity from Asia’s spot LNG markets, traders said. “At the time the project was halted in late February, it was a time in the year when LNG prices were to gradually fall down as demand eases,” said one industry source in Tokyo. “The halt did have some impact in that it took longer for (Asian benchmark) prices to fall, but the impact was rather limited because demand was weak at the time,” he said. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have lost almost 70 percent from their 2014 peak to around $7 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), driven lower by a global supply overhang that developed as new production came online, especially in Australia and the United States. Worry about the surplus has been tempered somewhat by unexpectedly strong demand out of China, India and Southeast Asia, especially over this past winter. Before the quake, the PNG LNG project had been producing at around 20 percent above its rated capacity of 6.9 million tonnes a year. Another trader said that although the announcement would likely weigh on prices, any fall “will be limited by summer demand expected soon from Asia.” (Reporting by Sumeet Gaikwad in BENGALURU, Melanie Burton in MELBOURNE, Jessica Jaganathan, Henning Gloystein and Roslan Khasawneh in SINGAPORE, Osamu Tsukimori in TOKYO; Editing by Richard Pullin and Tom Hogue)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/papua-quake-lng/update-2-exxonmobil-resumes-quake-hit-png-lng-production-ahead-of-schedule-idUKL3N1RQ0C8,13 Apr 2018,"* Resumption of output, exports comes weeks ahead of

Soybean imports for the first quarter, however, edged slightly higher, supported by healthy demand. The March decline also came as trade tensions between China and the United States escalated last month. Beijing announced last week it would slap a 25 percent import duty on soybeans from the United States in response to Trump’s tariffs on Chinese exports. “Imports are expected to go up in the coming months, despite the Sino-U.S. trade spat, as we have entered the Brazil season and are mainly buying Brazilian beans,” said Tian Hao, senior analyst with First Futures. China’s March imports of 5.66 million tonnes were down from last year’s 6.33 million tonnes, but up slightly from last month’s 5.42 million tonnes, according to customs data. China’s week-long Lunar New Year holiday fell later this year, in mid-February. Soy imports SB-CN-IMP in the first three months of the year rose 0.2 percent to 19.57 million tonnes, driven by healthy demand from the livestock industry and good crush margins, customs data showed. China is the world’s top soybean buyer and imports 60 percent of the oilseed traded worldwide to make meal for its massive livestock herds. About a third of its imports come from the United States.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.1 percent while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.8 percent. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets also edged up 0.1 percent after hitting a three-week high on Thursday. In New York, the S&P 500 gained 0.83 percent, led by a 1.83 percent gain in financials after strong quarterly results from BlackRock Inc boosted optimism for corporate earnings. The earnings season begins in earnest on Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Analysts expect quarterly profit for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, in what would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The mood improved also after Trump tweeted an attack on Syria “could be very soon or not so soon at all,” allaying fears of an immediate military action that investors fear could lead to wider conflict between Washington and Moscow. In another change of tack, Trump has asked his trade advisers to look at re-joining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact he withdrew the United States from early last year. “Markets have been pushed around by Trump.

2018-04-13,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government should not rule out requiring retrofits of heavily-polluting diesel cars, center-left Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said, underscoring differences among the parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition. Schulze, a Social Democrat (SPD), said Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, a member of the CSU Bavarian conservatives, was too optimistic when he said Germany could meet emissions targets without imposing driving bans and requiring carmakers to modify the exhaust systems of existing diesel cars. Disagreements over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions - known to cause respiratory disease - threaten to further strain already difficult relations between Merkel’s conservatives and the SPD.  Merkel on Wednesday had played down the possibility of forcing carmakers to make expensive modifications to diesel car exhaust systems, as her new government tries to avoid driving bans in cities with air quality problems. The German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. exhaust tests. Schulze told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper it would “would be nice” if German cities could meet NOx targets without retrofits. “But I don’t share this optimism when it comes to big cites like Munich, Stuttgart and several others,” Schulze said in an interview published on Friday. She said an expert commission set up by the transport ministry to examine the feasibility of retrofits should complete its work quickly, and then implement what is “technically possible and economically reasonable.” Schulze joined Scheuer in rejecting government funding for possible retrofits, adding, “It cannot be that taxpayers should have to pay for what the automakers screwed up.” Merkel told reporters on Wednesday she would do everything possible to avoid driving bans, saying that in 2-3 years only about 10 cities would have excess levels of NOx, compared with about 70 cities originally. The issue came to a head in February when a court allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel vehicles. Experts say bans could cut the resale value of up to 15 million diesel vehicles in Europe’s biggest car market. Merkel’s government has been criticized for having too cozy ties with the auto industry due to its importance for jobs and exports. France and Britain have said they will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040.

2018-04-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global energy giants Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil have asked  U.S. regulators for exemptions to the nation’s biofuels policy that have historically been reserved for small companies in financial distress, according to sources familiar with the matter. The requests will add fuel to a raging dispute between Big Oil and Big Corn over how the Trump administration should manage the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard - a 2005 law that requires oil refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply, or buy government-awarded credits from other energy firms who do the blending. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has already issued an unusually high 25 hardship waivers to small refineries in recent months, according to an agency source, driving blending credit prices down and helping the oil industry reduce compliance costs. But the agency won’t name the firms receiving the exemptions, citing a concern over disclosing private company information. Both Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon (XOM.N), among the world’s most profitable energy companies, have asked EPA for waivers for their smallest facilities - Chevron’s 54,500 barrel-per-day refinery in Utah and the Exxon’s 60,000 bpd refinery in Montana, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  The exemptions would free the plants from their obligation to hand in blending credits earned or purchased for 2017, which came due this year, the sources said. The disclosure of the Chevron and Exxon applications, which have not been previously reported, follow a Reuters report this month that the EPA has exempted three of ten refineries owned by Andeavor ANDV.N, one of the biggest U.S. refining companies.  The waivers could save Andeavor $50 million or more in regulatory costs for the company’s 2016 obligations under the biofuels law. Husky Energy - a Canadian oil giant backed by a Hong Kong billionaire - will also be seeking an exemption, this one covering the 2018 requirements for its small Superior, Wisconsin plant, spokesman Mel Duval told Reuters, disclosing the waiver for the first time. Duval said Husky inherited a 2017 exemption when it bought the 50,000 bpd Superior refinery from Calumet Specialty Products Partners (CLMT.O) for $435 million in November. The waivers are intended for facilities producing less than 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) that can also prove compliance with the policy would cause them “disproportionate economic hardship.” A spokesman for Chevron, Braden Reddall, declined to confirm or deny the application, but said waivers provide an edge. “Several competitors have reportedly received exemptions from the RFS,” he said in a written statement to Reuters. “If true, any refinery which has not been exempted from the RFS will be at a competitive disadvantage.”  Exxon spokesman Dan Carter declined to comment. The exceptions and the EPA’s refusal to disclose them have infuriated the corn lobby, which argues the waivers hurt farmers by undermining demand for corn and should be used only sparingly for tiny facilities in dire straits. “EPA is hiding behind poor excuses about proprietary business information to shield big oil companies from public scrutiny,” five Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst from Iowa, wrote in a joint statement Thursday.  “This looks like just another backdoor attempt by (EPA) Administrator (Scott) Pruitt to destroy the Renewable Fuel Standard and circumvent congressional intent.”  Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association said there is nothing ‘small’ about Exxon and Chevron, both of which rank in the top 20 of the Fortune 100.  “For these two behemoth oil companies to claim economic hardship is downright offensive and insulting to the hard-working farm families and ethanol producers that depend on the RFS,” Dinneen said. It’s unclear whether the EPA has approved the Exxon or Chevron application. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on which firms have applied for or received exemptions.  She said the agency considers any application to exempt a refinery of less than 75,000 bpd - regardless of the size of the company that owns it. “EPA decisions on waivers are based on refinery-specific information,” she said in an email. “We continue to work through petitions received for 2017.” Exxon reported net profits of $19.7 billion last year. Chevron reported earning $9.2 billion. Both bill themselves as globally integrated companies, and neither breaks out the financial details for their individual facilities in the public disclosures they are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Republican Senator John Barrasso, of Wyoming, home to several small refineries, praised the expansion of the exemption program in a statement on Thursday. He did not address the controversy over the exemptions granted to some of the nation’s largest refiners. “I applaud Administrator Pruitt and Secretary Perry for recognizing the burdens of this program. They know that we can’t allow it to hurt our nation’s small refineries,” Barrasso said.  The EPA has historically doled out fewer than ten hardship exemptions per year to U.S. refineries, according to a former U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. A current EPA official, however, said the number reached 20 for 2016. The EPA has come under pressure for being stingy with the waivers in the past. A successful lawsuit last year by Sinclair Oil Corporation led a federal court to order EPA to expand its definition of “economic hardship” - opening the door for more facilities to be eligible. The Trump administration has also signaled a willingness to help refining companies reduce their biofuels compliance costs - which industry players say has encouraged a surge in recent applications. Trump hosted a series of meetings with advocates for the corn and oil industries at the White House since late last year aimed at reforming biofuels regulations in a way that cuts costs for refiners without reducing overall biofuels demand. The effort failed to yield a deal due to protests from corn industry representatives. Obtaining a waiver helps refiners in two ways: they no longer have to earn or purchase blending credits, called RINs, to prove compliance, and they can sell any RINs they have on hand into the open market. That can provide a company with a benefit ranging into the tens of millions of dollars. Other big oil companies including Phillips 66 (PSX.N) also own refineries small enough to be eligible for a waiver, as does CVR Energy (CVI.N) which is owned by billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn.  Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment on whether they are seeking exemptions. Icahn’s efforts last year to overhaul the biofuels program - while acting as an adviser to Trump on regulatory issues - drew scrutiny from federal investigators after lawmakers said it raised ethical concerns. Biofuels proponents including U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has criticized the use of RFS exemptions as “demand destruction” for corn-based ethanol. Ethanol demand has been vital to farmers who are buffeted by low commodities prices and the threat of a global trade war. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents big oil companies like Exxon and Chevron, has also opposed small refinery exemptions in the past, arguing for a level competitive playing field.
