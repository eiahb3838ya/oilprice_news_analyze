2018-12-22,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said that the U.S. military presence in Syria had been “a mistake, illogical and a source of tension”, in Tehran’s first reaction to President Donald Trump’s planned pull-out. Trump has begun what will be a total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, saying on Wednesday they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed in the country. “From the start, the entry and presence of American forces in the region has been a mistake, illogical and a source of tension, and a main cause of instability,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state media on Saturday.  Trump said in a tweet on Thursday that “Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy” about the planned U.S. withdrawal. Iran, a key supporter of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war, has sent military “advisers” as well as military equipment and regional Shi’ite militias to fight anti-government groups. Tehran has opposed the presence of foreign forces in Syria, except those — from Iran and Russia — which have been invited by the Assad government.

2018-12-22,"BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China’s carbon industry will face severe overcapacity from the second-half of 2020, after producers rushed to expand capacity amid fat profit-margins, an official from the China Carbon Industry Association (CCIA) said on Saturday. Carbon products are widely used in sectors such as metallurgy, chemicals, aviation and renewable energy due to their strong resistance to corrosion and good conductivity. “Extravagant profits have lured companies who shut down in bleak years to resume operations and even expand capacity,” Sun Qing, CCIA’s general secretary, said at an industry conference. “Meanwhile, some who don’t have carbon capacity are planning to launch new production lines.” Beijing’s aggressive environmental protection campaign has tightened supplies of carbon products, but has also boosted demand for products such as graphite electrodes used to melt scrap in electric arc furnaces (EAF). EAFs emit less toxic air compared to other steelmaking equipment. Net profits at Fangda Carbon New Material, China’s biggest producers of graphite electrodes, surged 5,267.7 percent in 2017 from the year before to 3.6 billion yuan ($521 million), while average profit-margins in the Chinese carbon industry last year jumped more than 3,000 percent, according to CCIA data. China is expected to have graphite electrode capacity totalling 1.5 million tonnes by 2020, up 66.7 percent from 900,000 tonnes in 2017, said Sun. That will exceed demand of less than 800,000 tonnes in 2020, he added. Prebaked anode, a raw material used at aluminium smelters, will also see a glut in supply, with redundant capacity set to reach 9 million tonnes in 2018, before climbing more in the coming three years, according to Sun. Unlike China’s steel and coal industry whose capacity is strict controlled by the central government, carbon producers do not need to acquire approvals from authorities to add new capacity as long as they are able to meet environmental standards. However, despite the capacity expansion, China will still face tight supply of high-quality carbon products such as needle-coke, which is used to make lithium-ion batteries. “Carbon makers must not only focus on short-term interest and blindly expanding capacity ... but should seize this rare opportunity to improve technology and upgrade their products,” said Sun.

2018-12-22,"CAIRO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi that the U.S. is still committed to fighting Islamic State in Iraq and other areas despite its planned troop withdrawal from Syria, Abdul Mahdi’s office said on Saturday. President Donald Trump has begun what will be a total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, declaring on Wednesday they had succeeded in their mission to defeat Islamic State and were no longer needed. The plan has drawn criticism from allies such as Britain and France who say the militants are not fully beaten. “Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi received a phone call from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who explained the details of the upcoming withdrawal from  Syria and affirmed the United State’s is still committed to fight Islamic State and terrorism in Iraq and other areas,” Abdul Mahdi’s office said in a statement. Abdul Mahdi and Pompeo also discussed Washington’s decision to extend for 90 days a waiver granted to Iraq from sanctions against Iran that would allow Baghdad to keep importing Iranian gas that is critical for Iraqi power production. The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran’s energy exports in November, citing its nuclear programme and meddling in the Middle East, but has granted waivers to several buyers to meet consumer energy needs. Washington gave Iraq a 45-day waiver for imports of gas from Iran when it reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil sector on Nov. 5. Iraqi officials have said they need around two years to find an alternative source. Iraq relies heavily on Iranian gas to feed its power stations, importing roughly 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day via pipelines in the south and east.
