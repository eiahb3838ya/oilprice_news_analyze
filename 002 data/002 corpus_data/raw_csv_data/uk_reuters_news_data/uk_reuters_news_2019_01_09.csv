2019-01-09,"* U.S-China trade talks finish in Beijing after extra day * Hopes of a trade deal underpin risk assets * China’s yuan at strongest in five weeks, dollar softens * Markets show little reaction to Trump’s address on border wall By Karin Strohecker LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - World stocks extend their gains to hit a near-four week high and oil prices rose on Wednesday on optimism that the United States and China may be inching towards a trade deal, soothing fears an all-out trade war could hit a slowing global economy. Delegations from China and the U.S. ended talks that had lasted longer than expected in Beijing on Wednesday amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased access to China’s markets. Officials said details will be released soon. MSCI’s all-country index sailed 0.4 percent higher in a fourth straight day of gains. Asian bourses saw a strong finish with Japan’s Nikkei and China’s blue-chip CSI 300 closing up 1 percent while the tech-heavy South Korean KOSPI jumped nearly 2 percent. European bourses took the cue with the pan-European STOXX 600 gaining 0.6 percent with both German and French benchmarks jumping 1 percent. U.S. stock futures also firmed, pointing to another strong day on Wall Street after the S&P 500 gained nearly 1 percent on Tuesday. “The positive news around the trade talks is giving a boost to risk assets – it’s what the global economy needs to see,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. “There are also reports of new initiatives by China to boost spending and that’s desirable from the perspective of Chinese and global growth.” A senior Chinese official said Beijing plans to introduce policies to boost domestic spending on items such as autos and home appliances this year. Meanwhile on the trade talks, sources said the two sides were still far apart from U.S. demands for structural reforms in China. The rally in riskier assets has accelerated since last Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was aware of risks to the economy and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. Oil prices extended their gains, rising nearly 1 percent with U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures rising above $50 per barrel overnight for the first time in 2019. U.S. bond yields also climbed, with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield rising to 2.7404 percent, compared with its one-year low of 2.543 percent hit just before Friday’s strong payrolls data. In another sign of subsiding worries about the U.S. economic outlook, Fed funds rate futures show traders are now pricing in a small chance of a rate hike in 2019, a change from late last week when futures markets had priced in a cut by the end of the year. “Slowly but surely, the numerous headwinds that contributed to the market sell-off in the final quarter of 2018 are becoming less gale force and more strong breeze,” Craig Erlam at OANDA wrote in a note. “There is a clear risk that conditions could deteriorate quickly but at the moment, the storm is passing and investors are seeing opportunities in the wreckage.” In currency markets, the dollar index softened 0.2 percent to 95.69 against a basket of currencies, hovering close to a 2-1/2 month low hit on Monday. The euro traded at $1.1464 while the dollar stood at 108.85 yen. China’s yuan strengthened in offshore trading by 0.4 percent to its strongest level in five weeks. There was little market reaction to Trump’s prime-time televised address where he made his case that a U.S.-Mexico border wall is urgently needed, despite opposition from Democrats. That suggests the dispute on the issue, which has sparked a government shutdown since late December and already caused some delays in the release of key U.S. economic data, is nowhere near a resolution.

2019-01-09,"SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil exports to Asia are set to rise in the second quarter as sellers cut prices following sharp drops in freight rates and expected weaker demand in the United States, trading and shipping sources said. Offers for U.S. crude arriving in Asia in the second-half of March or April are about 50 cents a barrel lower than a month earlier, they said, making it more competitive against oil from the Middle East. U.S. crude grades popular with Asian buyers include light oils such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland and Eagle Ford, as well as Mars and Southern Green Canyon among heavier grades.  The United States has boosted crude sales to Asia, helped by a steep discount for U.S. oil to the global benchmark Brent. CL-LCO1=R “There is the potential for Q2 U.S. crude exports to Asia to be higher year-on-year if the WTI/Brent spread remains in the range it has in recent months and with the lower freight rates,” said David Arno, oil analyst at analytics firm Genscape. “There are a few variables, though, with the ongoing U.S-China trade war and the potential for the waivers for Iranian crude exports to Asian countries to not be extended.” A U.S. decision not to extend waivers allowing some Asian countries to import Iranian oil despite sanctions would boost demand from South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, China, and India. The rate for chartering a Very Large Crude Carrier, to ship 2 million barrels of oil from the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) in Houston to Singapore has fallen more than 40 percent from late-October to about $5 million, data on Refinitiv’s Eikon shows. TD-LPP-SIN VLCC prices spiked late last year during the winter season and as buyers boosted imports ahead of renewed Iran sanctions. Enquiries for ships to send oil from the U.S. Gulf coast or South America to Asia have picked up, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Houston - also known as MEH - and Mars are seeing strong demand from Asia, U.S.-based trade sources said. Companies looking for ships include P66 (PSX.N), Mercuria, Reliance (RELI.NS) and Vitol [VITOLV.UL] while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) has a VLCC on the way to Asia, said one source. More U.S. crude could also be freed up for exports as U.S. refineries prepare to shut for seasonal maintenance from February before ramping up for the summer driving season, the sources said. In Asia, offers of WTI Midland crude for delivery to North Asia have fallen by 50 cents a barrel to about a $2.50 a barrel premium to the Dubai benchmark, while Eagle Ford crude can be delivered to Asia at about $3 a barrel premium, the sources said. U.S. Mars crude has become cheaper than Oman on delivery, they said. The U.S. price cuts have also depressed spot prices for Middle East grades such as Murban and Oman, the sources said. While demand from big U.S. oil importers - South Korea and Taiwan - is expected to remain strong, Chinese buyers are likely to stay cautious amid trade talks with the United States. “Right now, we see one cargo headed for China, which set sail on Dec. 31 and is set to land in mid-February. It marked the first U.S. crude export to China since late September, and only the second one since late July,” Genscape’s Arno said. Two VLCCs that loaded U.S. crude in December had been scheduled to head to China, shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed. But VLCC Nasiriyah is now heading to Rotterdam and VLCC Manifa is set for Singapore, Refinitiv analyst Emma Li said.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.5 percent after Sino-U.S. trade talks in Beijing were extended for an unscheduled third day, suggesting some progress was being made. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei rose 1.1 percent, while China’s Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 rebounded 0.8 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. Chinese markets were also boosted after Beijing signalled more support for domestic spending on items from autos to home appliances. Financial spread-betters expect London’s FTSE Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC to gain between 1.0 and 1.1 percent when they open. U.S. stock futures firmed 0.3 percent. The U.S. trade delegation in Beijing is “wrapping up” meetings with Chinese officials after a “good few days”, a U.S. official said. “I think they went just fine,” U.S. Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, Ted McKinney, said of the talks. “It’s been a good one for us,” he said without elaborating. President Donald Trump also wrote on Twitter overnight that “Talks with China are going very well!” “Markets are scaling back some of their extreme nervousness after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell effectively did some easing, with his words. Hopes on U.S.-China trade talks are helping,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. But he predicted short-covering could run its course soon and added, “some sort of deals are likely to increase Chinese imports of natural gas, soybeans and so on from the U.S. Yet, it should be hard to resolve more structural issues such as intellectual property rights.” Wall Street’s S&P 500 gained nearly 1 percent on Tuesday, extending its rebound from 20-month lows touched around Christmas to more than 9 percent. The so-called fear-gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, dipped to 20.09, its lowest in a month, from an 11 month-high of 36.20 touched just two weeks ago. A reading below 20 is widely considered as calm. Trade hopes also spurred further gains in oil prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures rose above $50 per barrel overnight for the first time in 2019. They advanced another 1.2 percent in Asian trade to $50.38. U.S. bond yields also climbed, with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield rising to 2.720 percent, compared with its one-year low of 2.543 percent hit just before Friday’s strong payrolls data. In another sign of subsiding worries about the U.S. economic outlook, Fed funds rate futures show traders are now pricing in a small chance of a rate hike this year, a change from late last week when a rate cut was almost fully priced in. In currency markets, the dollar was little changed against major currencies. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six of its peers, stood at 95.78, not far off an 11-week low of 95.638 touched on Monday. Against the yen, the dollar gained one-tenths of a percent to 108.84 yen per dollar. The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.1461, but its rebound was not big enough to recover a loss in the previous session on concerns about the slowing euro zone economy. The drop was modest, but it underscored concerns about a slowdown and the European Central Bank’s caution as it tries to wean the region off stimulus. China’s yuan rose to a five-week high of 6.8340 against the dollar, buoyed by trade hopes. There was little market reaction to Trump’s prime-time televised address where he made his case that a U.S.-Mexico border wall is urgently needed, despite opposition from Democrats. That suggests the dispute on the issue, which has sparked a government shutdown since late December and already caused some delays in the release of key U.S. economic data, is nowhere near a resolution. “For now, I’m not considering taking fresh exposure to stocks at current price levels,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. “People who are buying stocks today are mainly tactical players.

2019-01-09,"* Q4 revenues grow to $188 mln vs forecast $205 mln * Co sees uncertainty around 2019 spending by oil firms (Adds background, details) OSLO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Oslo-listed seismic surveyor TGS posted a smaller-than-expected increase in fourth-quarter revenues on Wednesday and said a recent fall in crude prices created uncertainty around the spending plans of its customers in the oil industry. The company sells its geological surveys to exploration and production (E&P) companies seeking to drill for hydrocarbons, as the data helps them determine the presence of oil and gas in offshore and onshore reservoirs. Preliminary revenues for the October-December period stood at $188 million, up from $157 million a year ago but lagging a analyst consensus estimate of $204.6 million, according to Refinitiv data. While oil companies have increased their exploration investments after years of cost cuts, the recent crude price volatility impacted their spending on seismic data in late 2018, and may also impact the coming year, TGS said in a statement. “With oil prices currently trading below $60 per barrel, there continues to be some uncertainty on 2019 E&P spending, particularly offshore,” TGS Chief Executive Officer Kristian Johansen said. “However, I’m confident that our quality data library and pipeline of new projects position TGS for another successful year,” he added. On Monday, competitor Petroleum Geo Services reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales and earnings numbers, driving its shares sharply higher. TGS’ shares rose 20 percent in the last week, closing at 249.8 Norwegian crowns on Tuesday.

2019-01-09,"(Repeats story earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - India has begun paying Iran for oil in rupees, a senior bank official said on Tuesday, the first such payments since the United States imposed new sanctions against Tehran in November. Washington gave a six-month waiver to eight countries, including India, allowing them to import some Iranian oil. India, the world’s third biggest oil importer, wants to continue buying oil from Iran as it offers free shipping and an extended credit period, while Iran will use the rupee funds to mostly pay for imports from India. “Today we received a good amount from some oil companies,” Charan Singh, executive director at state-owned UCO Bank told Reuters. He did not disclose the names of refiners or how much had been deposited. New Delhi recently issued a notification exempting payments to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for crude oil imports from steep withholding taxes, enabling refiners to clear an estimated $1.5 billion in dues. An industry source said India’s top refiner Indian Oil Corp and Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals have made payments for Iranian oil imports. Neither was immediately available for comment. Iran is devising payment mechanisms including barter with trading partners like India, China and Russia following a delay in the setting up of a European Union-led special purpose vehicle to facilitate trade with Tehran, its foreign minister Javad Zarif said earlier on Tuesday. In the previous round of U.S. sanctions, India settled 45 percent of oil payments in rupees and the remainder in euros but this time it has signed deal with Iran to make all payments in rupees as New Delhi wants to fix its trade balance with Tehran. Indian imports from Iran totalled about $11 billion between April and November, with oil accounting for about 90 percent. Singh said Indian refiners had previously made payments to 15 banks, but they will now be making deposits into the accounts of only 9 Iranian lenders as one had since closed and the U.S has imposed secondary sanctions on five others. The nine banks are Saman Bank Corp., Bank Pasargad, Bank Eghtesad Novin, Karafarin Bank, Bank Samayeh, Middle East Bank, City Bank, Bank Hekmat Iranian, and Tourism Bank.

2019-01-09,"WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - As a partial U.S. government shutdown neared the three-week mark, Democrats on Wednesday were set to test Republicans’ resolve in backing President Donald Trump’s drive to build a wall on the border with Mexico, which has sparked an impasse over agency funding. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats who took control of the chamber last week plan to advance a bill to immediately reopen the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and several other agencies that have been in partial shutdown mode since Dec. 22. Democrats are eager to force Republicans to choose between funding the Treasury’s Internal Revenue Service - at a time when it should be gearing up to issue tax refunds to millions of Americans - and voting to keep it partially shuttered. In a countermove, the Trump administration said on Tuesday that even without a new shot of funding, the IRS would somehow make sure those refund checks get sent. But it was the Republican president’s insistence on a massive barrier on the border that dominated the Washington debate and sparked a political blame game. In a nationally televised address on Tuesday night, Trump asked: “How much more American blood must be shed before Congress does its job?” referring to murders he said were committed by illegal immigrants. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, responding to Trump, said he and the president both wanted stronger border security but disagreed over the most effective approach. “Most presidents have used (White House) Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration,” Schumer said. Later this week, Pelosi will force votes that one by one provide the money to operate departments ranging from Homeland Security and Justice to State, Agriculture, Commerce and Labor. By using a Democratic majority to ram those bills through the House, Pelosi is hoping enough Senate Republicans back her up and abandon Trump’s wall gambit. The political maneuvering comes amid a rising public backlash over the suspension of some government activities that has resulted in the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Other “essential” employees are being required to report to work, but without pay for the time being. With tempers running high over Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion just for this year to fund wall construction, there are doubts Pelosi’s plan will succeed in forcing the Senate to act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has not budged from his hard line of refusing to bring up any government funding bill that does not have Trump’s backing. The funding fight stems from Congress’ inability to complete work by a Sept. 30, 2018, deadline on funding all government agencies. It did manage, however, to appropriate money for about 75 percent of the government by that deadline - mainly military and health-related programs. As House Democrats plow ahead, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will go to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to attend a weekly closed lunch meeting of Senate Republicans. They are expected to urge them to hold firm on his wall demands, even as some are publicly warning their patience is wearing thin. Later in the day, Trump is scheduled to host bipartisan congressional leaders to see if they can break the deadlock. On Thursday, Trump travels to the border to highlight an immigration “crisis” that his base of conservative supporters wants him to address. But so far, there have been few signs that either Trump or his Democratic opponents in Congress are moving toward a deal. Reporting by Richard Cowan; Additional reporting by Amanda

2019-01-09,"* Saudi’s proven oil reserves at 268.5 bln barrels at end 2017 * External audit began as part of Aramco IPO preparations * Details on Saudi deposits had been shrouded in secrecy * Energy minister says Aramco IPO planned by 2021 (Adds detail on audit results, production costs) By Rania El Gamal RIYADH, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia announced a slight rise in its crude oil reserves on Wednesday after they were independently audited, providing more detail about the size of deposits shrouded in secrecy for decades. Saudi Arabia’s reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been the world’s largest but few details were public. The external audit was started as part of preparations for the initial public offering of state oil company Saudi Aramco. The Saudi Energy Ministry said in a statement carried by state news agency SPA that Saudi Arabia’s proven oil and gas reserves stood at around 268.5 billion barrels of oil and 325.1 trillion standard cubic feet of gas as of the end of 2017. “The results point out that the kingdom’s reserves of oil and gas are bigger than what we have been announcing,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told a news conference in Riyadh. The audit will dispel scepticism in the oil industry about the size of Saudi reserves and provide assurance for potential investors in Aramco investors, should the initial public offering which has been delayed eventually go ahead. Falih’s news conference took place hours later than initially scheduled and SPA corrected its initial announcement of the reserves figures. The 2017 figure for crude reserves is larger than the total 260.8 billion barrels Aramco reported in its 2016 annual review. “This certification underscores why every barrel we produce is the most profitable in the world and why we believe Saudi Aramco is the world’s most valuable company,” Falih said in the statement. Aramco’s cost of production is a mere $4 a barrel, he said, giving a rare insight into a key metric not usually disclosed. Industry experts say it can cost between $30 to $50 to produce a barrel of U.S. shale oil. Saudi Arabia confirmed for the first time that Dallas-based consultants DeGolyer and MacNaughton carried out the audit. The consultant evaluated 54 major oil reservoirs operated by Aramco, out of 368 in its portfolio. In DeGolyer’s view, these contained 213.1 billion barrels of proved oil reserves, compared to 210.9 billion as estimated internally by Aramco. For almost 30 years - despite rising production, large swings in oil prices and improved technology - Riyadh had annually reported the same number for reserves at around 261 billion barrels, according to a statistical review by BP. Plans for the Aramco IPO were shelved last year for the forseeable future, sources told Reuters. Falih said on Wednesday the kingdom would still go ahead, and list the company by 2021.

2019-01-09,"* U.S-China trade talks end in Beijing after extra day * Hopes of a trade deal underpin risk assets * More Fed officials say caution needed before more rate hikes * Oil rises 3 pct on U.S.-China trade talk optimism By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Stocks around the world extended recent gains and oil prices jumped on Wednesday on optimism that the United States and China may be inching towards a trade deal, soothing fears of an all-out trade war and its possible impact on global growth. Optimism that the United States would reach a trade agreement with China boosted U.S. Treasury yields to their highest this year. Delegations from China and the U.S. ended talks in Beijing on Wednesday amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased access to China’s markets. China has pledged to purchase “a substantial amount” of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services from the United States, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said on Wednesday. MSCI’s all-country index climbed 0.68 percent for a fourth day of gains. That added to advances since last week in equity markets around the world, following strong U.S. employment report and comments from the Federal Reserve chief that calmed worries that U.S. interest rate hikes would hurt growth. On Wednesday, a clutch of U.S. Federal Reserve officials said they would be cautious about any further increases in interest rates so that the central bank could assess growing risks to an otherwise-solid U.S. economic outlook. Adding to the upbeat mood were reports that Beijing plans to introduce policies to boost domestic spending on items such as autos and home appliances this year. These come on the back of Friday’s monetary easing by the People’s Bank of China. The U.S. stock market was supported by energy and technology sectors, and the benchmark S&P 500 index clung to gains that have lifted it by about 10 percent from 20-month lows hit around Christmas. “There’s a solid uptrend that’s come off the Christmas Eve downturn. So any development that looks like it might be leading to an eventual resolution will be helpful to the markets,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 57.06 points, or 0.24 percent, to 23,844.51, the S&P 500 gained 1.15 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,575.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.91 points, or 0.32 percent, to 6,918.90. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark rose 0.46 percent to a nearly four-week high, with trade deal hopes boosting the region’s export-oriented autos and tech sectors. Optimism that the trade standoff would be resolved also lifted oil prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $50.8 per barrel, up $1.02, or  2.05 percent, the first time this year that WTI has topped $50. International Brent crude futures were up $1.07, or 1.82 percent, at $59.79 per barrel. The dollar sank to its lowest since October, with gains led by the euro and sterling, as risk appetite improved and investors reduced their safe-haven bets. “As long as you don’t see a situation where there is a negative turn much like what we saw over the last quarter, markets will probably view any trade development, even if they’re not concluded by the March 1 deadline, with modest optimism just because it reduces the downside risk to the outlook,” said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist, at TD Securities in New York. Improved risk appetite sent U.S. Treasury yields to their highest this year, ahead of the sale of new 10-year supply by the Treasury Department. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 5/32 in price to yield 2.7315 percent after earlier rising to 2.747 percent, the highest since Dec. 28. Gold prices rose on Wednesday, with spot gold rising 0.41 percent to $1,290.1 per ounce.

2019-01-09,"(Adds price reaction, analyst comment) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell less than expected last week according to a largely bearish report on Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration, which also showed that gasoline and distillate inventories rose more than expected. Crude inventories fell by 1.7 million barrels in the week to Jan. 4, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a decrease of 2.8 million barrels. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose 10.6 million barrels, more than five times the expected 1.9 million-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. Gasoline stocks rose 8.1 million barrels, the largest weekly rise since December of 2016. Analysts had forecast a 3.4 million-barrel gain. U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline inventories rose to 89.4 million barrels, hitting fresh record highs, EIA data showed. “The report is bearish given the smaller-than-expected decline in crude oil inventories and the very large increase in refined product inventories,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “Refiners continue to operate at a high level, but they appear to be playing to increasingly empty theatre, in that, demand and export levels continue to be lackluster, especially for gasoline.” Distillates may have seen lower demand due to warmer than normal temperatures. “The milder temperatures have hurt distillate demand a little bit,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures rose 330,000 barrels, EIA said. Crude benchmarks and refined products futures pared gains after the EIA report. U.S. crude traded at $50.97 a barrel, up $1.19, by 10:52 a.m. EST [1552 GMT] after earlier trading at a session high of $51.50. Refinery crude runs fell by 194,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 1.1 percentage point to 96.1 percent of total capacity. Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 626,000 bpd while crude production was steady at 11.7 million bpd.

2019-01-09,"QUITO, Jan 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indigenous leaders from tropical forest nations have urged Californian regulators to reject a proposed international carbon trading scheme, arguing it would violate forest peoples’ rights. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is due to decide in April whether to adopt the California Tropical Forest Standard (TFS), a controversial plan focused on protecting large forested areas through the use of carbon credits. At a November meeting in Sacramento, the board heard hours of testimony from more than 80 climate scientists, indigenous representatives and activists, both for and against the proposal. A decision was postponed until this spring. The TFS would resemble existing carbon market mechanisms, allowing companies to offset their planet-warming emissions by paying to keep forests - which absorb and store carbon - standing abroad rather than reducing emissions at home. Supporters believe protecting tropical forests is essential to limit climate change, since deforestation and forest degradation account for about 17 percent of emissions worldwide. But the TFS has many critics, particularly among scientists and indigenous communities familiar with the failings of programs like REDD+, a donor-backed effort launched by the United Nations to curb emissions from deforestation. “We think it’s a big lie that the governments say they are going to save the forest,” said Daniel Santi, an indigenous Kichwa leader from Ecuador. “The real people who have been conserving, protecting and fighting (for forests) have been indigenous people,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at an indigenous assembly outside Puyo, capital of the Amazon province of Pastaza, in December. Santi said Ecuador’s indigenous communities were already seeing repercussions from the TFS, similar to those experienced with REDD+. After creating the Pastaza Ecological Area of Sustainable Development in 2017, local officials wrote to CARB in support of the TFS. The Pastaza reserve covers more than 2.5 million hectares (6.2 million acres) of rainforest - about 90 percent of the province - a perfect size for the TFS, which would concentrate on large-scale forest areas. Indigenous organizations have denounced the project, saying the seven indigenous nationalities that live in Pastaza were never consulted. They must now adhere to provincial conservation regulations, which include limitations on hunting and cutting down trees for community use, harming their way of life, said Santi. Meanwhile, Ecuador’s government continues to promote extraction activities in at least three oil blocks inside the protected area, which have been opposed by most indigenous communities living there. In November, indigenous leaders from Ecuador, Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria travelled to California to persuade the U.S. state to abandon the TFS. They said other forest protection mechanisms like REDD+ had divided communities, violated their territorial rights, and failed to gain their consent in advance. Neither had the schemes kept forests safe from fossil fuel extraction, the main cause of forest degradation and displacement of indigenous communities, the local leaders said. In a letter, 110 scientists who have studied REDD+ and other carbon offset programs advised CARB not to adopt the standard. Such programs have curtailed livelihoods with minimal compensation, constrained community access to forest resources, and undermined local governance, the letter said. Contra Costa County Supervisor John Gioia, one of CARB’s 16 members, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the testimonies had raised concerns about the impact of the TFS on indigenous communities and whether it could protect both them and forests. CARB should focus on reducing emissions at home, he noted. But Steve Schwartzman, senior director of tropical forest policy with the Environmental Defense Fund and a strong TFS supporter, dismissed negative comparisons with REDD+. “All of the criticism I’ve heard that was specific at all was directed toward standalone REDD projects,” he said. The California TFS would back much larger conservation programs in tropical forest nations, whether jurisdictional, state-wide or national, he added. Their bigger size would make it “easier and more accurate” to monitor deforestation and measure emissions, he noted. The TFS also includes rigorous safeguards for indigenous rights, such as assigning independent auditors and requiring jurisdictions to set up reporting systems, said Schwartzman. The TFS was created to set a global standard for carbon-offset programs, and if approved, could serve as a model for other states and countries. Eduardo Garcia, a California Assembly member and CARB board member, has argued California can play a role in reducing emissions in other parts of the globe. Another letter signed by more than 100 scientists, economists and anthropologists, encouraged the board to “unlock” California’s international potential by approving the TFS. Santi, the Ecuadorian indigenous leader, branded carbon trading programs a “deception”, however - especially the TFS proposed by California, which is one of the largest importers of Amazon crude oil. According to California’s energy commission, the state imports more crude oil from the Amazon than anywhere else, accounting for 38 percent of its imports in 2017. Crude from Ecuador makes up a fifth of California’s oil imports. “TFS could allow oil refiners, which are purchasing oil from Ecuador to turn around and buy offset credits from the same regions in Ecuador that have been devastated by oil drilling,” said Zoe Cina-Sklar of advocacy group Amazon Watch. Instead of carbon trading, California should curb Amazon crude imports and take immediate measures to wean itself off fossil fuels, such as freezing new oil and gas permits in the state, she added.

2019-01-09,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian man facing allegations of bribing officials at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) on behalf of Vitol Group [VITOLV.UL], Glencore (GLEN.L) and other major oil trading firms has been arrested in the United States, authorities said Tuesday.  Luiz Eduardo Loureiro Andrade was detained in the United States on Dec. 20, an arrest that was disclosed in a Brazilian court document seen by Reuters. He was arrested with the help of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Besides handling deportation cases, ICE investigates transnational crime.  An email included in the court document from a Brazilian federal police official based in Miami indicated that Andrade is being held in an undisclosed location in the United States and that Brazil has requested his extradition. It was not clear when he may be sent back to Brazil.  ICE did not respond to requests for comment. An investigator with Brazil’s federal police confirmed the arrest on condition that they not be named as they were not authorized to speak with the press, but declined to provide more details.                      Andrade was charged in Brazil for acting as a middleman between top executives at Vitol, allegedly funneling bribes to Petrobras officials in exchange for sweetheart deals from the state-run firm. Officials allege that he also carried out the same services for Glencore and other big oil trading firms to win sweetheart contracts with Petrobras. Two former executives of Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] were charged in the same scheme on Dec. 14. The cases are the latest part of Brazil’s “Car Wash” investigation, launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras. The probe and resulting trials have toppled scores of powerful business and political figures, including construction industry moguls and former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Brazilian prosecutors have said they will pressure the middlemen charged and arrested to turn state’s witness and testify against powerful executives at the oil trading firms, the same method they have used for years to take down top targets. Prosecutors alleged in their charges against Andrade that Vitol’s head of U.S. operations Mike Loya and its Latin American and Caribbean boss Antonio Maarraoui, had full knowledge of the scheme. Neither Loya nor Maarraoui has been charged. Neither of the executives has replied to repeated requests for comment.         Prosecutors said at least $2.85 million in bribes were involved in the cases involving the oil traders, and have called their discoveries so far the “tip of the iceberg.”   A Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday, but said the company would always cooperate with investigators.  A Glencore spokesman said the firm took ethics and compliance seriously but could not comment further. He added that Glencore would cooperate with Brazilian authorities.  The stakes are high for both trading firms. Brazilian prosecutors allege some of the crimes were carried out by Petrobras traders based in Houston and that some illicit funds moved through the U.S. and European banking systems, raising the chance that jurisdiction for investigating the case could widen. Brazilian and U.S. prosecutors have worked closely in the past on Car Wash cases.     The probe has already frozen current business for the trading firms in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer, but not yet a major source of revenue for the firms. Trafigura said its turnover in Brazil last year was $300 million, a fraction of its overall revenue of $136 billion in 2017. Glencore and Vitol would not provide revenue details, but said Brazil was a minor market.  Vitol has a deal pending to purchase a stake in Petrobras’ prized Nigerian oilfields. Petrobras has said there are no indications of wrongdoing in that deal, but it would be up to Brazilian regulators to make the final determination.

2019-01-09,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Iran will continue with its aerospace programme despite U.S. warnings, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Wednesday, adding there was no international law prohibiting such a programme. Zarif, who is in New Delhi on a bilateral visit, also told Reuters that leaving a 2015 nuclear deal agreed with world powers is an option available with Tehran but is not the only option on the table.  The United States earlier this month issued a pre-emptive warning to Iran against pursuing three planned space rocket launches that it said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution because they use ballistic missile technology. Under the U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which enshrined the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran is “called upon” to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. Iran has ruled out negotiations with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly the missile programme run by the Revolutionary Guards. It says the programme is purely defensive and denies missiles are capable of being tipped with nuclear warheads. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme in May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.

2019-01-09,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday sacked the chiefs of Sui Natural Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGC) over a severe winter energy crisis that has seen repeated supply outages.  Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, the government’s main spokesman, said Khan took the decision after an inquiry committee found that the two companies were responsible for the crisis. Since the start of the winter, Pakistanis using natural gas for cooking and heating, as well as factories and power plants that rely on the fuel, have experienced significant inconvenience due to low gas pressure or no supply at all.  Factories and business in the port city of Karachi, Pakistan’s commercial hub, have been badly affected, threatening jobs and the livelihoods of workers. “Recently, people have faced a severe gas supply crisis,” Chaudhry said in a statement...The prime minister has announced the immediate sacking of the heads Sui Southern and Sui Northern,” the statement said.  Pakistan has suffered from chronic energy supply problems for years, with regular power blackouts and gas outages caused by a mix of poorly maintained distribution networks, inefficient regulation and poor governance. The country has significant natural gas reserves that can fill almost half its energy requirements but supply constraints have led to increasing demand for LNG imports. Khan’s critics say the natural gas companies are not solely responsible for the recent energy crisis, pointing to decisions made by his government which have discouraged the importing of LNG.  In October, the new government announced it would renegotiate agreements for two liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals as part of a wider investigation into deals struck by the previous government. The rapid adoption of LNG infrastructure made Pakistan one of the industry’s fastest-growing markets in Asia, sparking interest from the world’s major energy producers and traders.   As part of moves to increase energy generation, Pakistan and the World Bank on Wednesday signed a financing agreement worth $100 million for a solar energy project in the southern part of the country, a finance ministry statement said.

2019-01-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas prices have fallen sharply as the unusual cold weather of late November and early December has given way to warmer-than-normal temperatures in the last four weeks. Futures prices for gas delivered at Henry Hub in February 2019 have fallen below $3 per million British thermal units from a peak of almost $4.80 in the middle of November. The exceptional rally in gas prices during the late summer and early autumn has unwound, leaving gas prices back at the low level that has prevailed for the last three years. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2RIgtvy) Cumulative heating demand for the 2018/19 heating season was around 6 percent higher than the long-run average through Dec. 12, according to the U.S. government Climate Prediction Center. But the sustained period of cold in late autumn and early winter has been replaced by an extended period of mild weather and cumulative heating demand has now dropped 4 percent below normal (“Degree days statistics”, CPC, Jan. 8). Government forecasts show average or above-average temperatures expected across most of the major population centres of the United States for much of the next three months. So far this winter, gas stocks have fallen much less for any given level of heating demand than in the previous heating seasons, which has also helped rebalance the market. Surging gas prices have encouraged electricity generators to run gas-fired units for fewer hours in the fourth quarter and turn to coal-fired units instead, cutting gas consumption and making scarce stocks go further. Working gas stocks in underground storage were 726 billion cubic feet (20 percent) below the previous five-year average in mid-December, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By the end of the year, however, the deficit had eased to just 561 billion cubic feet (14 percent) due to warmer weather and a reduction in hours by gas-fired generators (“Weekly natural gas storage report”, EIA, Jan. 4). The rise and fall in gas prices has been accentuated by the accumulation and subsequent liquidation of hedge fund positions since the end of July and especially since the end of September. Hedge fund managers correctly anticipated a shortage of gas this winter and the likelihood price spikes would be needed to eke out the low stocks left at the end of the refill season. Fund managers were net buyers of futures and options equivalent to 2,229 billion cubic feet of gas between late July and mid-November, according to position data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. By the middle of November, fund managers held almost 7 bullish long positions for every one bearish short positions, the most biggest bullish imbalance since at least 2010. Between Nov. 13 and Dec. 18, however, as electric generators curbed their gas consumption and temperature forecasts became milder, portfolio managers turned net sellers of 715 billion cubic feet of gas. Funds probably continued to liquidate bullish positions in the last two weeks of the year – though there is no way to tell yet because publication of updated numbers has been delayed by the U.S. government shutdown. Hedge fund accumulation of bullish positions likely accelerated and exaggerated the rise in gas prices early in the fourth quarter, but it also enforced the necessary conservation of gas stocks and avoided worse shortages. As the seasonal gas deficit has been reduced and those bullish positions have unwound, selling pressure has intensified the subsequent price plunge. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2019-01-09,"(Adds details) AMSTERDAM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The Dutch High Court said on Wednesday it would consider demands on Jan. 17 seeking an immediate end to gas production from the Groningen field, after the government said it would cut output gradually. The government has capped Groningen production at 19.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year starting October 2018 and said it would reduce output to zero in the coming decade. The High Court said it had received 26 objections to the plan, ranging from civilians to local and regional authorities, expressing concerns about seismic risks caused by drilling and demanding that production is stopped at once. Two of the objections would be heard this month and the rest were expected to be dealt with in April, the court said, adding that it would take several weeks to reach a verdict after the Jan. 17 hearing. The petitioners in the January hearing have demanded an immediate production halt, at least until the court has made a final decision on the production plan. Analysts say the court was unlikely to grant an immediate halt in output because the Netherlands still depends on Groningen gas for a significant part of its energy supply. Years of gas extraction have led to a string of minor earthquakes in the Groningen region, damaging thousands of houses and buildings in the northern Dutch province. The government said last year that production would end completely by 2030, after already being cut by more than 60 percent since its peak in 2013.

2019-01-09,"(Repeats story published Tuesday to widen distribution) By Adriana Barrera MEXICO CITY, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Super Bowl fans may have to go without guacamole this year if avocado farmers in Mexico cannot send their fruit to the United States because of a prolonged fuel shortage. Like clockwork, Mexican producers ship thousands of tonnes of avocado to the United States in early February every year, where guacamole is a staple living room snack on Super Bowl Sunday. But the Mexican government’s efforts to clamp down on years of mounting fuel theft has a prompted a week-long fuel shortage that has left many states in central and western Mexico high and dry. Among those states is Michoacan, the country’s main avocado grower. Producers there expect to ship 120,000 tonnes for this Super Bowl, 20,000 tonnes more than last year. “Our three most important weeks of the year are this one and the next two. This is when we ship for Super Bowl week,” said Ramon Paz, spokesman for APEAM, a business association representing Mexican avocado producers and exporters. “We have from now to January 24, 25 to ship all that volume. If we don’t ship it (by then), we can’t do so later,” Paz said. So far, 27,000 tonnes have been sent to the United States for the Super Bowl, which will be held on Feb. 3 in Atlanta, Georgia. The annual football championship is the most-watched U.S. television broadcast of the year, regularly drawing more than 100 million viewers. The fuel shortage has not yet affected exports to the United States, but it has begun to hamper transportation in Mexico for workers and harvested avocados, Paz added. In addition to the Super Bowl, Mexican producers also have to meet commitments with supermarkets and restaurants in the United States. The crackdown on fuel theft, which has drained billions of dollars from state coffers and is blamed for rising violence in some regions, is leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s first major move against criminals and corruption since taking office on Dec. 1. The move risks angering consumers and hurting the economy.

2019-01-09,"* U.S-China trade talks finish in Beijing after extra day * Hopes of a trade deal underpin risk assets * European export-focussed tech, auto sectors record healthy gains * China’s yuan at strongest in five weeks, oil jumps 2 percent (Updates prices) By Karin Strohecker LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - World stocks extended their gains to hit a near-four week high and oil prices rose on Wednesday on optimism that the United States and China may be inching towards a trade deal, soothing fears of an all-out trade war. Delegations from China and the U.S. ended talks that had lasted longer than expected in Beijing on Wednesday amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased access to China’s markets. Officials said details would be released soon. MSCI’s all-country index sailed 0.5 percent higher in a fourth day of gains. Hopes for a trade deal boosted Europe’s export-oriented autos and tech sectors and lifted the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark to a three-week high. Germany’s DAX, France’s CAC 40 and the UK’s FTSE 100 all gained around 1 percent to hover at multi-week highs. U.S. stock futures   firmed between 0.2 and 0.4 percent, pointing to another upbeat session ahead for Wall Street after the S&P 500 gained nearly 1 percent on Tuesday. Asian bourses saw a strong finish with Japan’s Nikkei and China’s blue-chip CSI 300 closing up 1 percent while the tech-heavy South Korean KOSPI jumped nearly 2 percent. “The positive news around the trade talks is giving a boost to risk assets – it’s what the global economy needs to see,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. Adding to the upbeat mood were reports that Beijing plans to introduce policies to boost domestic spending on items such as autos and home appliances this year. These come on the back of Friday’s monetary easing by the People’s Bank of China. “China are now firmly off the brakes and back on the accelerator,” said Karen Ward, chief market strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management. “The sugar rush that’s fading in the U.S., we are going to get that rush coming through in China.” However, details on the outcome of the latest trade talks were scant and sources said the two sides were still far from U.S. demands for structural reforms in China. The rally in riskier assets has accelerated since last Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was aware of risks to the economy and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. Oil prices roared 2 percent higher in their eight day of gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures have soared more than 20 percent since hitting an 18-month low in late December and have now broken through the $50 per barrel overnight for the first time in 2019. U.S. bond yields also climbed, with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield rising to 2.7386 percent, compared with its one-year low of 2.543 percent hit just before Friday’s strong payrolls data. In another sign of subsiding worries about the U.S. economic outlook, Fed funds rate futures showed traders are now pricing in a small chance of a rate hike in 2019, a change from late last week when futures markets had priced in a cut. In currency markets, the dollar index softened to 95.835 against a basket of currencies after flirting in early trading with a 2-1/2 month low hit on Monday. The euro traded at $1.1452 while the dollar stood at 108.86 yen. China’s yuan strengthened in offshore trading by 0.4 percent, hitting its strongest level in five weeks. Sterling gained 0.2 percent against the dollar and strengthened against the euro following a media report that British Prime Minister Theresa May is attempting to win over the Northern Irish DUP party in a crucial vote next week on her Brexit deal. The British parliament is due to vote on the EU withdrawal bill on Jan. 15 and the issue is likely to dominate sterling trade in the run-up. May will lose the vote unless she can convince opponents both within and outside her Conservative Party to back the deal.

2019-01-09,"AMSTERDAM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The Dutch High Court said on Wednesday it would consider demands on Jan. 17 seeking an immediate end to gas production from the Groningen field, after the government said it would cut output gradually. The government has capped Groningen production at 19.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year starting October 2018 and said it would reduce output to zero in the coming decade. The High Court said it had received 26 objections to the plan, ranging from civilians to local and regional authorities, expressing concerns about seismic risks caused by drilling and demanding that production is stopped at once. Two of those objections would be heard this month and the rest were expected to be dealt with in April, the court said. Years of gas extraction have led to a string of minor earthquakes in the Groningen region, damaging thousands of houses and buildings in the northern Dutch province. The government said last year that production would end completely by 2030, after already being cut by more than 60 percent since its peak in 2013. Reporting by Bart Meijer

2019-01-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Canada-based Carbon Engineering said on Wednesday it had received investment from a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and the venture capital arm of Chevron Corp. for its technology that removes carbon dioxide directly from the air. Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, and Chevron Technology Ventures, the venture capital division of Chevron Corporation, have invested an undisclosed sum in Carbon Engineering’s so-called direct air capture (DAC) technology. Founded in 2009, Carbon Engineering developed technology that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere and converts it into low-carbon fuels for transport and for use in enhanced oil recovery. The firm has been removing CO2 from the atmosphere since 2015 at a pilot plant in British Columbia and converting it into fuel since 2017. Carbon Engineering expects to reach its financing target of $60 million by the end of the first quarter, putting it on track to accelerate the commercialization of its technology, the firm told Reuters.  “(...) These new investments will allow us to accelerate the deployment of our DAC and AIR TO FUELS technologies,” said Steve Oldham, chief executive of Carbon Engineering (CE). “With an increasing focus worldwide on the need for aggressive emissions reductions, CE’s technology can play a major role, and energy industry leaders like Occidental and Chevron will greatly accelerate commercialization of CE’s technology,” he added. Extracting vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere could help to limit global warming, blamed for causing more heatwaves, wildfires, floods and rising sea levels. The costs of such technologies are high, however, and a huge number of plants would be needed to make a dent in manmade CO2 emissions.

2019-01-09,"(Adds PetroChina comment starting in 5th paragraph) BEIJING, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Natural gas supplies to China from Turkmenistan’s state-owned energy major Konzern were expected to return to planned levels from Jan. 8, after a supply disruptions in November, the Chinese state planner said. Gas imports from China’s largest supplier of piped natural gas fell several times in November, but the volumes and durations were small, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on its website late on Tuesday. “Supplies from Konzern were unstable in November, but it had limited impact on domestic gas,” the NDRC said, adding that supplies would soon return to planned levels. It denied a report in Chinese media that Konzern would slash gas exports by 35 million cubic metres a day from Tuesday, which could drive up prices. Later on Wednesday, top state oil and gas producer PetroChina said on its social media blog that gas supplies from Turkmenistan have been restored to normal rates in the morning, adding that the recent supply fluctuations were only 1 percent of the pipeline system’s monthly average volumes. PetroChina also said it will cap its domestic sales prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) below the peak levels recorded in the last heating season. Earlier on Wednesday, Sinopec said would put a ceiling on prices of LNG sold form its Qingdao and Tianjin import terminals. Domestic gas consumption has been robust this winter as China keeps up a campaign to switch household and industrial coal boilers to gas. Daily consumption reached a peak of 1.037 billion cubic metres (bcm) for two consecutive days in November, the NDRC said. Energy majors PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC had 9 bcm of gas stored in underground tanks and LNG storage facilities by Tuesday, the agency said.

2019-01-09,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - China Three Gorges Corp (CTGC), operator of the world’s largest hydropower plant, is turning to projects offshore, a senior official said, as domestic costs soar and space runs out on the country’s crowded rivers. “We don’t have any plans to build more hydropower projects in China but will develop more projects overseas,” said Sun Zhiyu, the company’s vice-president, on the sidelines of a meeting on Tuesday. “We already have business in more than 40 countries, and will focus mostly on South Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America,” he added. The 22.5-gigawatt (GW) Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze river was completed in 2012 after a dam-building boom throughout China. Its turbines generate 100 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. CTGC, parent of listed China Yangtze Power Corp, has since completed other giant dams on the Yangtze upstream and its total hydropower generation capacity - including projects under construction - stands at nearly 70 GW, more than the total power capacity of Australia. China’s total hydropower capacity hit 350 GW last year, accounting for a fifth of total generation, but its reliance on large and disruptive dam projects has been controversial. Advocacy groups claim capacity could safely be doubled, but the government has slowed down hydro approvals amid concerns about its devastating impact on communities and ecosystems. While hydropower produces no emissions during generation, opponents say it contributes to global warming by submerging forest and plant life under water. Giant dams and reservoirs also cause biodiversity loss and put quake-prone regions like Sichuan under greater seismic pressure. Worried about potential unrest, China has sought to improve the way “hydropower migrants” are compensated. Payments to displaced residents now account for half of a project’s total costs, and tougher rules are set to be implemented next year. China has also cracked down on small hydropower, said to have caused untold damage to aquatic ecosystems throughout the country. However, industry advocates said at an industry meeting in Beijing on Tuesday that hydropower must still play a vital role in China’s clean energy goals. Wang Yinan, researcher with the Development and Research Center, a cabinet think tank, said new rules had raised costs and eroded investment incentives, and transmission capacity was also insufficient. “Fake environment protection ideas and ignorant ecological views are flooding society and demonising hydroelectric projects, which will mislead national policies, national security and ecological protection, “ she said.

2019-01-09,"SALAMANCA, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday an army-assisted crackdown on fuel theft was “not in vain” despite shortages that spread to the capital after the government closed pipelines and refineries to choke the black market.  Fuel theft has dropped from 787 truck loads per day to 177 since thousands of soldiers were sent to state-oil company Petroleos Mexicanos’ (Pemex) installations last month, Lopez Obrador said at a daily news conference. The crackdown on a crime that has drained billions of dollars from state coffers and is blamed for rising violence in some regions is the leftist president’s first major move against criminals and corruption since taking office on Dec. 1, but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy.  By closing off pipelines and refineries while it traced leakages, the government has triggered shortfalls and long lines at gas stations in at least six states. Worried motorists in Mexico City rushed to fill their tanks on Tuesday, causing some gas stations to shut their doors and lines at others. Critics said that with pipelines closed there was less theft only because less fuel was available to steal. One internet meme likened the strategy to closing banks in order to tackle bank robbery. Criminal groups linked to drug cartels have long been blamed for a fuel black market, but Lopez Obrador said last month that far more was being stolen directly from Pemex installations by an internal network of corrupt officials. On Tuesday he said the military had discovered a 3-kilometer-long (1.9 mile) “hose” that was funneling fuel out of storage tanks at Pemex’s Salamanca refinery in the state of Guanajuato, a major car-manufacturing hub in central Mexico, into a secret storage area. Lopez Obrador admitted there were complaints, but said shortages were not widespread. He urged an end to “panic” buying and said the problem was distribution, not supply. “This is not in vain,” Lopez Obrador said. “We are going to end corruption.”  Within sight of the Salamanca refinery’s metal towers, hundreds of people waited for fuel to arrive for up to five hours at two Mobil-branded gas stations operated by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).  Federico Garcia, a 63-year-old construction company manger waiting at one of the stations, said his business was beginning to feel the pinch and would have to slow activities if normal supply did not resume in a couple of days.  “We are already beginning to stop work precisely because of the lack of fuel,” said Garcia, wearing sunglasses and with sweat visible on his forehead under a bright midday sun. At the refinery, convoys of military vehicles transporting armed soldiers could be seen approaching the facility, and inside the refinery gates uniformed soldiers could be seen inspecting tanker trucks both entering and leaving.  Juan Pablo Gonzalez, who heads a gas station owners association, said Pemex had reopened a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery for a few hours on Monday, but shut it quickly because officials immediately detected a drop in pressure as thieves opened up illegal taps on the line. Lopez Obrador said the government was investigating members of the previous administration who were involved in the fuel distribution system for signs they had taken part in the black market.  The list of people under investigation includes the former head of security at Pemex, a military general close to former President Enrique Pena Nieto, he said.  Local media showed images of tanker trucks, escorted by federal police, heading from oil-rich coastal states to the country’s interior. It was not immediately clear what impact the crackdown will have on imports of fuel. Mexico is the top export destination for U.S. energy products, importing about 1.4 million barrels every day, or nearly a quarter of all U.S. overseas sales.

2019-01-09,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump urged Congress in a televised speech on Tuesday to give him $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) this year to help build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico but stopped short of declaring a national emergency to pay for the barrier with military funds. Facing Democratic opposition in Congress to a wall that he promised to build as a presidential candidate, Trump said in his first prime-time address from the Oval Office that there was a growing security and humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. Using blunt language in an attempt to win public support, the Republican president said illegal immigrants and drugs flowing across the southern border posed a serious threat to American safety.  “How much more American blood must be shed before Congress does its job?” he said, recounting gruesome details of murders he said were committed by illegal immigrants.  But after days of hinting he might use presidential powers to declare an emergency as a first step towards directing money for the wall without congressional approval, Trump said he would continue seeking a solution to the impasse with Congress. Trump’s speech came 18 days into a partial government shutdown precipitated by his demand for the wall. Public opposition to the shutdown is growing and that could hurt Trump, as he said last month he would be proud to close the government to fight for the wall. Democratic leaders, in a rebuttal also carried live on national television, accused the president on Tuesday night of using fear tactics and spreading misinformation about the situation along the border. “The president has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives.  “The fact is, President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation, many of them veterans,” she said. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found that 51 percent of adults mainly blamed Trump for the shutdown, up 4 percentage points from late December, while 32 percent blamed congressional Democrats and 7 percent faulted Republicans in Congress. Republican lawmakers have increasingly expressed concerns about Trump’s handling of the long-running dispute. But he has shown no signs of giving up. He is scheduled to visit the southwest border on Thursday and may still choose to make the national emergency declaration.  Vice President Mike Pence told reporters on Monday the president was considering the possibility and the White House counsel’s office was studying its legality. Democrats and other opponents of a wall have threatened to take legal action if Trump issues an emergency order. They say he is manufacturing a crisis in a bid to meet his 2016 presidential campaign promise for a wall that he said at the time would be paid for by Mexico. The Mexican government has refused to provide such funds. Trump was to meet at the White House on Wednesday with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders. Politics coloured the remarks from both sides on Tuesday. Trump said African-Americans and Hispanics were especially hard hit by the border crisis; both groups are key Democratic constituencies. Pelosi pointedly mentioned that veterans were hurt by the shutdown; Trump has courted veterans as a candidate and as president. Trump at times tried to adopt a softer tone. “This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,” he said, suggesting that women and children were among the migrants often victimized by trafficking across the border.  Hoping to demonstrate flexibility during his nearly 10-minute speech, Trump said of the border barrier he wants built: “At the request of the Democrats it will be a steel barrier and not a concrete wall.” But Democrats have opposed not just the construction materials to be used, but the extent of a project that could end up costing more than $24 billion over the long run. Democrats also argue that a mix of fencing, which already has been constructed in many parts of the border, and higher-tech tools would be cheaper and more effective in securing the border. Pelosi said Trump rejected bipartisan legislation to reopen the government agencies shuttered as a result of the fight over the wall, and that he was obsessed with “forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall.” She has previously called the wall immoral. Trump took issue with that in his speech. “The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized,” he said. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who delivered a rebuttal along with Pelosi, urged the president to reopen the government while the debate over immigration policies continued. “The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30-foot wall,” he said. “So our suggestion is a simple one.  Mr. President: Reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now.” Reporting by Jeff Mason and Richard Cowan; Additional reporting by Amanda Becker, Eric Beech and David Alexander in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-shutdown/update-10-in-oval-office-speech-trump-demands-a-wall-but-does-not-declare-emergency-idUKL1N1Z80C3,09 Jan 2019,"President Donald Trump urged

2019-01-09,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Super Bowl fans may have to go without guacamole this year if avocado farmers in Mexico cannot send their fruit to the United States because of a prolonged fuel shortage. Like clockwork, Mexican producers ship thousands of tonnes of avocado to the United States in early February every year, where guacamole is a staple living room snack on Super Bowl Sunday. But the Mexican government’s efforts to clamp down on years of mounting fuel theft has a prompted a week-long fuel shortage that has left many states in central and western Mexico high and dry. Among those states is Michoacan, the country’s main avocado grower. Producers there expect to ship 120,000 tonnes for this Super Bowl, 20,000 tonnes more than last year. “Our three most important weeks of the year are this one and the next two. This is when we ship for Super Bowl week,” said Ramon Paz, spokesman for APEAM, a business association representing Mexican avocado producers and exporters. “We have from now to January 24, 25 to ship all that volume. If we don’t ship it (by then), we can’t do so later,” Paz said. So far, 27,000 tonnes have been sent to the United States for the Super Bowl, which will be held on Feb. 3 in Atlanta, Georgia. The annual football championship is the most-watched U.S. television broadcast of the year, regularly drawing more than 100 million viewers.      The fuel shortage has not yet affected exports to the United States, but it has begun to hamper transportation in Mexico for workers and harvested avocados, Paz added. In addition to the Super Bowl, Mexican producers also have to meet commitments with supermarkets and restaurants in the United States.

2019-01-09,"* Trump tweets that China trade talks are going well * Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal underpin risk assets * Markets show little reaction to Trump’s address on border wall * Oil prices also extend rally on trade deal hopes By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Asian shares climbed to a 3-1/2-week high on Wednesday, supported by growing optimism that the United States and China can strike a trade deal to avoid an all-out confrontation that would severely disrupt the global economy. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.5 percent to its highest level since Dec. 14. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.3 percent, while China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 rebounded 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. U.S. stock futures also firmed. Wall Street’s S&P 500 gained nearly 1 percent on Tuesday, extending its rebound from 20-month lows touched around Christmas to more than 9 percent. The United States and China agreed to extend trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day on Wednesday, amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased access to China’s markets. But sources said the two sides were still far apart from U.S. demands for structural reforms in China. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter overnight that “Talks with China are going very well!” Bloomberg reported Trump is increasingly eager to strike a deal with China soon in an effort to perk up financial markets that have slumped on concerns over the trade war, citing people familiar with internal White House deliberations. The rally in riskier assets has accelerated since last Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was aware of risks to the economy and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. “Markets are scaling back some of their extreme nervousness after Powell effectively did some easing, with his words. But short-covering could run its course soon,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “Hopes on U.S.-China trade talks are helping. Some sort of deals are likely to increase Chinese imports of natural gas, soybeans and so on from the U.S. Yet, it should be hard to resolve more structural issues such as intellectual property rights,” he added. Oil prices also extended a rally on hopes of progress in the trade talks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures rose above $50 per barrel overnight for the first time in 2019. They rose 1.5 percent in Asia to $50.51. U.S. bond yields also climbed, with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield rising to 2.733 percent, compared with its one-year low of 2.543 percent hit just before Friday’s strong payrolls data. In another sign of subsiding worries about the U.S. economic outlook, Fed funds rate futures show traders are now pricing in only a small chance of a rate hike this year, a change from late last week when a rate cut was almost fully priced in. In currency markets, the dollar was little changed against major currencies. The euro traded at $1.1452 while the dollar stood at 108.89 yen.

2019-01-09,"* Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal underpin risk assets * Investors await Trump’s televised address on border wall * Oil prices extend rally on trade hopes By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Asian shares inched up on Wednesday, supported by optimism the United States and China can strike a trade deal to avoid an all-out confrontation that will severely disrupt the global economy. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.9 percent while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3 percent. Wall Street’s S&P 500 gained 0.97 percent on Tuesday, extending its gains from 20-month lows touched around Christmas to more than 9 percent. The United States and China will continue trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day on Wednesday, amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased access to China’s markets. Bloomberg also reported on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump is increasingly eager to strike a deal with China soon in an effort to perk up financial markets that have slumped on concerns over the trade war, citing people familiar with internal White House deliberations. The rally in risk assets has accelerated since last Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was aware of risks to the economy and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. “Markets are scaling back some of their extreme nervousness after Powell effectively did some easing, with his words. But short-covering could run its course soon,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “Hopes on U.S.-China trade talks are helping. Some sort of deals are likely to increase Chinese imports of natural gas, soybeans and so on from the U.S. Yet, it should be hard to resolve more structural issues such as intellectual property rights,” he added. Oil prices also extended their rallies on hopes of progress in the trade talks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures rose above $50 per barrel for the first time in 2019 to stand at $50.17, up 0.7 percent. U.S. bond yields also rose further, with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield rising to 2.730 percent, compared with its one-year low of 2.543 percent hit just before Friday’s strong payrolls data. In another sign of subsiding worries about the U.S. economic outlook, Fed funds rate futures have priced in a small chance of a rate hike this year, a sea change from late last week when a rate cut was almost fully priced in. In the currency market, the dollar was little changed against major currencies. The euro traded at $1.1455 while the dollar stood at 108.81 yen. Traders are looking to Trump’s prime-time televised address at 9 p.m. (0200 GMT Wednesday), where he is expected to make his case that a border wall is urgently needed despite opposition from Democrats. That suggests the dispute on the issue, which has sparked a government shutdown since late December, is nowhere near a resolution. Trump has considered declaring the border situation a national emergency, which could enable him to bypass Congress’ mandate to approve federal spending and to build the wall without its approval. Such a step, however, would likely face an immediate legal challenge and could lead to further polarisation in the U.S. political environment.

2019-01-09,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday it would complete a rule to boost sales of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline by the summer driving season, despite a partial government shutdown. The statement from the environmental regulator came after the agency warned at least two lawmakers that the shutdown had delayed its timeline for initially rolling out the rule, according to two sources briefed on the matter. President Donald Trump pledged in the run-up to November’s congressional elections to lift the summer ban on sales of so-called E15 gasoline, in a boost to an ethanol industry upended by trade wars and weak demand growth at home.  The Trump administration hoped to have the rule published by February and approved by June, but the EPA recently told lawmakers that the timeline would be delayed because of the partial government shutdown, said the two sources, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. An EPA spokesman said the agency would still complete the rule before the summer driving season. “This is a priority for both President Trump and Acting Administrator Wheeler. The ongoing partial shutdown will not impede EPA’s ability to keep to our deadline,” Michael Abboud said in an emailed statement in response to a request for comment. The acting EPA administrator is Andrew Wheeler. The EPA currently bans the higher ethanol blend, called E15, during summer because of concerns it contributes to smog on hot days - a worry biofuels advocates say is unfounded. E15 gasoline contains 15 percent ethanol, versus the 10 percent found in most U.S. gasoline.  Trump’s decision to lift the ban of summer sales of E15 was applauded by corn-belt farmers and lawmakers and criticized by the oil lobby as an illegal overreach by the EPA and its acting administrator. The proposal is expected to be coupled with a slew of reforms to the credit-trading market that underpins the nation’s renewable fuel policy. Brooke Coleman, executive director of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said the EPA had been drafting the E15 proposal for a long time and should have no issues meeting its June 1 target. He said the EPA should delay the trading reforms if they are slowing the process down. “That would keep the president’s promise to rural communities while taking some pressure off regulators,” Coleman said.

2019-01-09,"* Third day of trade talks to be held on Wednesday * U.S. officials say trade talks with China going well * China says any deal must involve compromise on both sides * OPEC-led supply cuts also prop up crude prices By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil prices on Wednesday rose above $50 per barrel for the first time in 2019 on hopes that Washington and Beijing can resolve a trade dispute that has triggered a global economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $50.14 per barrel as at 0021, up 36 cents, or 0.7 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. “The mood was ... boosted by signs of further progress in trade talks between the U.S. and China,” ANZ bank said on Wednesday. The world’s two biggest economies will continue trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day on Wednesday, U.S. officials said, amid signs of progress on issues including purchases of U.S. farm and energy commodities and increased U.S. access to China’s markets. State newspaper China Daily said on Wednesday that Beijing is keen to put an end to its trade dispute with the United States, but that it will not make any “unreasonable concessions” and that any agreement must involve compromise on both sides. If no deal is reached by March 2, Trump has said he will proceed with raising tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports at a time when China’s economy is slowing significantly. Oil prices have also been receiving support from supply cuts started at the end of 2018 by a group of producers around the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as non-OPEC member Russia. “Crude oil prices continued to march higher, with investors becoming increasingly confident that the OPEC cuts would tighten the market,” ANZ said.
