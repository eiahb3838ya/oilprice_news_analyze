2018-07-28,"BAGHDAD, July 28 (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi sacked five local election officials on Saturday on charges of corruption during the May 12 parliamentary election, a spokesman for the Independent High Elections Commission (IHEC) said. The move comes as Iraq conducts a manual recount of the ballots - a move likely to speed up the ratification of the final result and the formation of a new government. Abadi had appointed a special committee to investigate claims of vote-rigging in several regions, and on Saturday he approved its recommendation to dismiss local election chiefs in Kirkuk, Anbar and Salahuddin, Judge Laith Jabr Hamza said in a statement. Those in charge of overseas election offices in Turkey and Jordan were also dismissed. “The decision to sack the officials was approved by the prime minister after they committed violations, manipulation and financial corruption,” said Judge Laith Jabr. The announcement comes the day after Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani urged for government action to fight corruption amid further protests sweeping the southern provinces - Iraq’s Shi’ite heartland - over the lack of proper government services and jobs. Vote-rigging allegations centered on the city of Kirkuk, although there have been reports of irregularities in multiple provinces. Opposition politicians have claimed that the tabulation system in electronic voting machines that were used for the first time during the election were not secure enough from tampering. In response to the claims, the outgoing parliament in June ordered a nationwide manual recount of the votes. The law also called for IHEC’s leadership to be replaced by a panel of judges.

2018-07-28,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian truckers have called off their strike after eight days as the government agreed to consider their demands to cut levies on diesel fuel, an official of the protesting group said on Saturday. The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), an organization of transporters that organized the strike, had demanded a cut in federal and state levies on diesel by bringing the fuel under the scope of the nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST). India’s Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari late on Friday said the government was sympathetic toward truckers’ concerns and had formed a committee to look into their demands. AIMTC’s secretary general Naveen Gupta confirmed the strike had ended, adding that the organization hoped the government will quickly address their issues. The strike, which began on July 20, had disrupted production and sales of vehicles in the country and affected deliveries for e-commerce firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O).
