2018-11-15,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) By Chen Aizhu BEIJING, Nov 15 (Reuters) - PetroChina will merge its wholesale natural gas sales unit with retail provider Kunlun Energy to shore up profits though the move worries independent gas sellers that fear the combination will create a monopoly. PetroChina announced the restructuring internally last week to merge PetroChina Natural Gas Sales Company, the country’s largest natural gas wholesaler, with Kunlun Energy Co Ltd , said three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The three sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. A spokesman with China National Petroleum Corp, parent of PetroChina, said he could not immediately confirm the restructuring. Hong Kong-listed Kunlun operates Petrochina’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminals and distributes gas to households and factories. PetroChina Natural Gas Sales Company markets the state-owned company’s domestic gas production, imports of pipeline gas from Turkmenistan and Myanmar, and LNG shipped in from Qatar and Australia. But the firm, which supplies 70 percent of China’s gas, has suffered losses in its import business as the global prices it pays are often above state regulated domestic prices. In the first nine months of 2018, PetroChina booked a net loss of nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.88 billion) on gas imports compared with net losses of 16.99 billion yuan during the same period a year earlier. Kunlun during the first six months of 2018 reported net profit of 5.04 billion yuan, up 1.4 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to its financial report. “This shall boost PetroChina’s lagging gas retail business and cut heavy losses at the wholesale department,” said one of the three executives. On Nov. 6, Kunlun released a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange discussing “Natural Gas Business Development Strategies” that states PetroChina’s wholesale and retail sales businesses will be operated independently. The statement adds that as of the date of the announcement Kunlun has no intention to transfer any PetroChina assets in connection with the strategy. Kunlun did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on the restructuring sent after business hours. Still, the restructuring worries smaller independent firms such as China Resources Gas Group, China Gas Holdings and ENN Energy Holdings that are fearful the move could squeeze supplies in a fast growing market and create a monopoly wholesaler. “(It will) dramatically alter the market structure as PetroChina will no doubt prioritize Kunlun as its top customer at the expense of other buyers,” said another of the executives, who is with an independent gas distributor. The move is Petrochina’s response to a government plan to create a national gas pipeline company by consolidating the country’s trunk pipeline assets of which PetroChina controls nearly 80 percent. “The integration means Kunlun will receive support from the supply side, and vice versa the sales group will have a deeper penetration into the retail including city gas distribution, gas refilling stations,” said the third source. Nearly 30 provincial wholesale operations of the gas sales company will be merged with the similar number of provincial outlets under Kunlun, the sources said.

2018-11-15,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Mexico’s oil regulator approved drilling plans on Thursday for five offshore projects with investment commitments totaling about $380 million, more than half of which was pledged for a shallow water block operated by Talos Energy. The projects are among more than 100 oil and gas contracts awarded by the regulator since 2015. They could lead to significant new streams of production despite President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s frequent criticisms of a 2013 constitutional energy reform that made the projects possible. “These exploration plans are basically the bet that the international market has made on the potential of these projects,” said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst. The Talos Energy-led consortium will drill at least one new well in January as part of its Area 7 contract, next to its Zama discovery announced last year, according to the presentation approved by the regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH). The consortium, which also includes Britain’s Premier Oil and Mexico’s Sierra Oil & Gas, will invest some $251 million in 2019 in the block, and also included a second “contingent” well in its drilling plans. U.S.-based McDermott International said on Thursday it was awarded a contract by Talos for design work and engineering services for the Zama project, which plans to be executed with IO Oil & Gas Consulting, a joint venture between McDermott and service company Baker Hughes. The CNH approved a separate plan by Russia’s Lukoil to drill its Otomi-Oeste well between September and November of 2019, and spend nearly $72 million on its Area 12 block over the course of the year. Italy’s Eni, meanwhile, plans to drill its Saasken-1 well in its Area 10 block and invest about $51 million on the project in 2019. A second Eni block, Area 14, will see investment of about $5 million next year, but will not see any drilling activity. A plan was also approved for Spain’s Repsol for its Area 11 block, but does not include any new wells. Lopez Obrador, a leftist who takes office in December, has been a sharp critic of the landmark energy reform championed by outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto. While he has said he will not authorize any new oil auctions until a review of already-awarded contracts has been completed by his team, he has vowed to respect existing contracts.

2018-11-15,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) company Cheniere Energy Inc officially opened its $15 billion Corpus Christi LNG export facility in Texas on Thursday. The company, however, would not say when the first cargo will actually leave the facility, which produced its first LNG on Wednesday. There is an LNG vessel, the LNG Golar Tundra, docked at the plant that analysts say will take the project’s first cargo soon. At a celebration marking the opening of the facility, Cheniere’s President and CEO Jack Fusco was joined by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and other state and local officials. Corpus Christi is the third big LNG export terminal to enter service in the lower 48 U.S. states. The first was Cheniere’s Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, which sent out its first cargo in February 2016. Since then, Sabine has delivered almost 500 cargoes to 29 countries and regions around the world, Fusco said at the celebration. The company has said it expects Corpus 1 and the fifth liquefaction train at its Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana to enter commercial service in the first quarter of 2019, followed by Corpus 2 in the second half of 2019 and Corpus 3 in the second half of 2021. Each of Cheniere’s trains is capable of liquefying about 0.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. U.S. LNG exports have almost quadrupled from 183.9 billion cubic feet (bcf) in 2016 to 706.4 bcf in 2017, worth about $3.3 billion, and are on track to rise to over 1,000 bcf in 2018, making the United States one of the world’s biggest exporters of the super-cooled gas. Total U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to jump to 5.2 bcfd by the end of 2018, 8.9 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10.3 bcfd by the end of 2020 from 3.8 bcfd now, which should make the United States the world’s third-biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019. Cheniere has said it is also developing a sixth 0.7-bcfd train at Sabine Pass and seven smaller 0.2-bcfd trains and other opportunities at Corpus.

2018-11-15,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has cut prices on its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in a bid to lift lagging sales after the company streamlined its sales and marketing organization, a company official told Reuters on Thursday. Effective on Thursday, price quotes for potential solar customers will be between $3,000 and $5,000 lower, representing savings of about 15 to 25 percent, according to Sanjay Shah, the company’s senior vice president of energy operations. Tesla said the $3,000 to $5,000 in savings was an average and that the actual amount could be lower or higher depending on the size of the rooftop system and where a home is located. Since Tesla’s acquisition two years ago of SolarCity, which at the time was the largest U.S. residential solar company, the company has sharply cut the vast sales organization that underpinned its rapid growth. Last year, Tesla stopped selling solar door-to-door, and earlier this year it ended a long-standing deal to sell solar at 800 Home Depot Inc (HD.N) stores - a relationship that some analysts estimated brought in roughly half of Tesla’s solar sales but added up to $7,000 to the cost of a residential system. That has come alongside a big drop in installations. Tesla deployed just 93 megawatts of solar in the third quarter, down from SolarCity’s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016. Shah said that with lower prices, customers will seek out Tesla at its stores and online.  “Every customer wants a greater value in terms of price,” he said. “When you do that the customer comes to you rather than you going to the customer.” He said the price cuts should make Tesla “highly competitive” and added that the company ultimately wants to be the lowest-cost solar provider in the United States. Solar energy systems from large installers on average are about 10 percent more expensive than those sold by smaller companies, according to a 2017 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a U.S. government research lab. Shah said Tesla’s premium solar products are more efficient than most other panels, and should not be compared with standard systems on price. The price cuts are made possible in part by the savings Tesla has produced from streamlining its sales operations. By selling directly through its website and roughly 100 retail stores, Tesla has been able to cut sales and marketing costs in half, Shah said. Shah joined the company six months ago from Amazon.com Inc  (AMZN.O) and has focused on making its solar supply chain more efficient, reducing sales and marketing costs, and bringing down the time it takes for rooftop systems to be installed, he said. Tesla shares closed 1.3 percent higher at $348.44 on the Nasdaq on Thursday.

2018-11-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks climbed on Thursday after five sessions of declines as Wall Street surged on trade optimism, while sterling tumbled as political developments in Britain rippled through markets. Oil prices rose modestly, as the commodity recouped some losses from a recent steep plunge. U.S. stock indexes surged after a Financial Times report that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has told some industry executives that another round of tariffs on Chinese imports has been put on hold as the two nations pursue talks.  A spokesperson for Lighthizer later denied the report, one of several news developments involving trade during the day that swung stocks. “The market right now is just very reactionary,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. “One headline turns the Dow around 400 points. It speaks to the sensitivity around the issue.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 208.77 points, or 0.83 percent, to 25,289.27, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 28.62 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,730.2 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 122.64 points, or 1.72 percent, to 7,259.03. Investors are now focusing on the G20 meeting later this month, when leaders of the United States and China are expected to meet, and the Federal Reserve meeting in December, following investor optimism that recent inflation data may cause the central bank to be less aggressive with rate hikes. “In terms of catalysts for the rest of the year, we have the G20 meeting and we have the Fed meeting,” said Sunitha Thomas, regional portfolio adviser at Northern Trust Wealth Management. “Now that we have finished earnings, that is pretty much what everyone is focused on.” In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight for her draft divorce deal with the European Union after the resignation of her Brexit secretary and other ministers put her strategy and her job in peril. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2775, down 1.69 percent on the day, and also fell steeply against the euro. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 1.06 percent, while Britain's FTSE 250 .FTMC dropped 1.3 percent. “The Brexit news acted as a catalyst ... I think that what investors are acting upon is uncertainty,” said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist for Makor Capital Markets. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.66 percent, after five sessions of losses. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.26 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.18 percent to $1.1328. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 2/32 in price to yield 3.114 percent, from 3.12 percent late on Wednesday. Oil futures rose for the second consecutive session after this week’s steep losses as U.S. fuel stockpiles declined and a possible cut in OPEC output helped support prices. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.37 percent to settle at $56.46 a barrel, and Brent LCOcv1 settled ay $66.62 a barrel, up 0.76 percent.

2018-11-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures rose for the second consecutive session on Thursday after this week’s steep losses as U.S. fuel stockpiles declined and a possible cut in OPEC output helped support prices. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 50 cents to settle at $66.62 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 21 cents to settle at $56.46 a barrel. On Tuesday, U.S. futures marked their steepest one-day loss in more than three years due to ongoing worries about weakening global demand and oversupply. WTI also posted a record 12th straight decline. U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed crude inventories USOILC=ECI jumped 10.3 million barrels last week, the biggest weekly build since February 2017. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected an increase of 3.2 million barrels. But gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell 1.4 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI drew down by 3.6 million barrels, the EIA data showed. While the larger-than-expected crude build was “shocking,” the drops in refined product supplies helped buoy prices, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The products are definitely supporting us right now.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, is considering a cut of up to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) next year to avoid the kind of build in global inventories that prompted oil prices to crash between 2014 and 2016. “Oil prices shrug the (EIA) data off so far,” Commerzbank commodities analyst Carsten Fritsch said. “One explanation could be that a substantial production cut by OPEC becomes more likely.” Earlier in the day, two-high ranking Russian sources told Reuters that Russia wanted to stay out of any oil-production cuts touted by some of its partners in the OPEC-led supply pact. The head of Libyan state oil firm NOC said in a statement on Thursday that it was important for OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cooperate to maintain oil market stability. The International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC this week warned of a sizeable surplus at least in the first half of 2019, and possibly beyond, given the pace of growth in non-OPEC production and slower demand in heavy consumers such as China and India. [IEA/M] [OPEC/M] Oil prices have lost about a quarter of their value in only six weeks, pressured by a slowing global economy and soaring crude output led by the United States. U.S. crude production climbed to 11.7 million bpd, the highest on record, according to EIA data on Thursday. (For a graphic on 'Benchmark crude oil futures structure' click tmsnrt.rs/2QP7ZPS) “Asian refiners and consumers we speak with are mentioning initial concerns of slowing demand,” said Mike Corley, president of Mercatus Energy Advisors. U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday that China’s economic “conditions deteriorated materially” in the third quarter, while analysts at Capital Economics said China’s “near-term economic outlook still remains downbeat.” China is the world’s biggest oil importer and the second-largest crude consumer.

2018-11-15,"BARCELONA, Nov 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Renting a pair of jeans, working on an abandoned houseboat renovated as an office, or living in a portable home made from a shipping container - these are just a few ways residents of the Dutch capital Amsterdam can play their part to save the planet. Three years ago, the city launched a quest to become a “circular economy” - reusing products and materials, and minimising waste - by 2050. It now has 73 related projects underway, according to Eveline Jonkhoff, a strategic advisor on the initiative. The circular-economy push is part of a wider effort by Amsterdam to help meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change, she told a conference on smart cities in Barcelona this week. Other climate targets for Amsterdam focus on ending the use of natural gas by mid-century and putting in place a clean public transport system that does not contribute to planet-warming emissions by 2025. But key to the success of the city’s push toward carbon neutrality is enabling everyone to participate, Jonkhoff emphasised. “All these changes require very high investments, and we need to make sure this transition is affordable for everyone,” she said. Financial instruments will be needed to help residents buy solar panels and electric cars so they are “not just for the happy few”, she added. How to make often high-tech measures to limit global warming available and appealing to much of the public - including the elderly and the poor, who are often left out despite being most vulnerable to climate stresses - has been a key focus of the Barcelona conference this week. In Oslo, city authorities are introducing a new congestion charge in rush hours and adding more than 50 new road toll stations in a bid to deter polluting traffic. But “many people experience this as a challenge if they don’t have the money to pay,” noted Daniel Rees, political advisor to the Norwegian capital’s deputy mayor. Shifting to cleaner modes of getting around will require sufficient public transport, safe bicycle lanes and a network of charging points for electric vehicles, he said. And if cities start using autonomous buses in the future, alternative jobs will need to be found for drivers, he added. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, meanwhile, highlighted “climate justice” as one of four pillars of the Catalan city’s climate plan, adopted earlier this year. The city aims to boost support for the tenth of residents who struggle to pay for energy, and to improve housing to save on energy costs and reduce health risks from extreme weather. Barcelona - which faces more intense heatwaves, rain storms and droughts - is also doubling its bicycle lanes, adding 1.6 square metres of greenery per person by planting trees and creating public gardens, and pedestrianising some city blocks, among other measures. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for ecological transition, told the conference urban policies on climate change can improve citizens’ lives in the form of cleaner air, better-insulated buildings, energy savings and more parks. “Greener and healthier cities are also safer cities, and more attractive places to live,” she said. But Spain’s Socialist-led government, which came into power in June, is also aware that not everyone will win if it steps up action to decarbonise its economy, as it is promising. Last month, in a push to close most of Spain’s coal mines by the end of this year, Madrid made a deal with unions to invest 250 million euros ($283 million) over the next five years in affected provinces, mainly in the northwest. The money will support environmental restoration, early retirement, and training for miners to take up green energy jobs. It would be spent under a proposed system of “just transition contracts” between the central government and local authorities that would bring in businesses, universities and others. In Barcelona, Ribera told journalists that modern society must “pay attention to those groups who feel menaced by the transformation” to a low-carbon economy, and should offer solidarity. “We need to help those regions see a positive, constructive future,” she said on the sidelines of the conference. In December, the European Union launched a platform to support 41 regions in 12 countries that employ 185,000 people in coal mining to shift the focus of their economies away from producing the dirty fuel and towards clean energy. “The just transition concerns us all,” said Elena Visnar Malinovska, head of adaptation in the European Commission’s climate action division. ""Countries and cities have to start designing (climate) policies that minimise the economic and social disruptive impacts... and really maximise the benefits,"" she said.

2018-11-15,"HOUSTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf Coast crude oil imports in October fell to the lowest level in more than a year as the nation’s production and exports soared, data from Refinitiv Eikon and market intelligence firm Kpler show. Crude imports in the Gulf Coast, or PADD 3 region, averaged 2.35 million barrels per day (bpd) in October, down from 2.71 million bpd the month before and the lowest since September 2017, Refinitiv data show. Booming U.S. shale oil production has triggered pipeline bottlenecks in the Permian Basin and Bakken fields, pushing domestic light, sweet crude prices $10 per barrel cheaper than the global benchmark Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1. U.S. refiners have boosted their purchases in response. “They can’t process that much of the lighter crude, but if it’s cheap enough, they’ll figure out how to blend it in and use more of it,” said Sandy Fielden, an energy analyst at research firm Morningstar. U.S. crude production last week reached a record 11.7 million bpd, and nationwide refinery utilization was 90.1 percent, up from 88.8 percent a month ago, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Crude exports loaded at ports along the Gulf Coast rose to 1.9 million bpd last month from 1.7 million bpd the previous month and the highest level since June. Shipments from the Gulf Coast to Europe was the highest since May, at 457,000 bpd, Refinitiv data showed. “At a certain price, the lighter crude makes sense” for Gulf Coast refiners, said John Auers, executive vice president at consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. “If a domestic barrel is more economic to process than a foreign barrel, they’ll definitely process that domestic barrel.” (Reporting by Collin Eaton Editing by Marguerita Choy)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-crude-imports/u-s-gulf-coast-crude-imports-fall-to-1-year-low-as-exports-surge-idUKL2N1XQ1AJ,15 Nov 2018,"U.S. Gulf Coast crude oil

2018-11-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee to join a key panel of independent energy regulators, who helped roll out a Department of Energy (DOE) directive to bail out aging coal and nuclear plants, told senators on Thursday he did not know if he would recuse himself if the issue reappears before the commission.   Last month Trump nominated Bernard McNamee, currently a lawyer at the DOE, to a vacant seat on the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is meant to be a politically independent office. When he was the DOE’s deputy general counsel last year, McNamee helped to role out a directive from Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize aging coal and nuclear plants for attributes including making the U.S. power grid resilient. The plan was bashed by a mix of natural gas, renewable power, and consumer advocates. FERC ultimately rejected the plan.   McNamee, a Republican, this year wrote an editorial on the virtues of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil. The piece said renewable energy like wind and solar power was important, but questioned whether they could replace other energy resources. Critics say McNamee’s participation in Perry’s directive and his editorial make him biased toward fossil fuels, a claim he rejected.  Asked at a Senate hearing on his nomination whether he would recuse himself if he is confirmed and if the resilience issue comes up again at FERC, McNamee said he was not sure. “I don’t know if anything is going to be proposed ... so I can’t say what I would or would not do,” McNamee said. “I commit I will talk with ethics counsel to find out if I need to recuse myself.”  McNamee said his “decisions will be based on the law and the facts, not politics.”  “Markets are the best way to allocate resources and set prices and I am committed to continuing FERC’s independence,” he added. Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said U.S. law dictates that McNamee should disqualify himself on the issue because he had participated in U.S. government counsel on it with the DOE.  King told McNamee he was “surprised and disappointed that you feel that you have to consult with counsel on something that’s so clear.”   Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican and chair of the Senate energy committee told McNamee that if he is confirmed, she expected him to make sure FERC was not “tipping the scales for any energy source based on a political perspective.” Reporting by Timothy Gardner",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-ferc-mcnamee/trumps-ferc-nominee-to-seek-counsel-if-coal-bailout-plan-returns-idUKL2N1XQ1DX,15 Nov 2018,"U.S. President Donald Trump's

2018-11-15,"(Reuters) - If OPEC thought the 26 percent drop in oil prices since October might rein in U.S. shale production like the last sharp drop did four years ago, it might have to think again. U.S. shale firms are more profitable than ever after a strong third quarter, according to a Reuters analysis of results for 32 independent producers. These companies are producing more efficiently, generating more cash flow and consolidating in a wave of mergers, the data show. Results at 32 independent shale explorers show nearly a third generated more cash from operations than they spent on drilling and shareholder payouts, a group including Devon Energy, EOG Resources and Continental Resources. A year ago, there were just three companies on that list.  The group’s cash flow deficit has narrowed to $945 million as U.S. benchmark crude hit $70 a barrel and production soared. The group overspent by three times as much as recently as June and was $4.92 billion in the hole a year ago, according to Reuters’ analysis of Morningstar data provided by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.          The change is evidence shale firms have moved to “harvest mode” after shareholders pressured them to rein in spending and increase payouts, said Shawn Reynolds, a portfolio manager at asset firm VanEck. “The industry is starting to do that.”    OPEC’s WORRY  While shale producers have fortified their finances, OPEC and allied producing countries this week began discussing an output cut of 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) to stem the sharp slide in crude prices. U.S. crude was trading at $57 a barrel on Thursday, down $20 from its October high. OPEC last sought to drive out shale producers by flooding the market with oil in 2014. That production free-for-all lasted nearly two years, sending crude to below $27 a barrel, but while it bloodied shale, it led the industry to become among the globe’s lowest-cost oil producers.  Now, any OPEC output cuts that lift global prices should benefit U.S. shale producers. They have become so lean they can profit on each new barrel of oil pumped from West Texas shale fields at $36 a barrel and from North Dakota’s Bakken field at $43 a barrel, according to RS Energy Group.  Rather than slowing shale production, the latest price drop could hasten industry consolidation as bigger producers snap up weaker rivals. “The small guys are going to go away” through mergers, said John Groton Jr., director of equity research at Thrivent Asset Management, which invests in shale operators. He said he believes the companies missing cash flow targets will become prime buyout candidates. “You have buyers who want to grow.” There have been several blockbuster buyouts this year, using stock instead of cash. Encana this month offered $5.5 billion in stock for Newfield Exploration Co. Concho Resources kicked off this year’s merger wave with an $8 billion all-stock deal for RSP Permian. Investment banker Tudor Pickering Holt & Co predicted another 10 shale deals worth $40 billion will surface in 2019.  Consolidation can spread costs over more production, boosting cash. Chesapeake Energy’s recent $4 billion cash-and-stock offer for WildHorse Resource Development will allow the Oklahoma City-based company to hit cash flow goals in 2020, “much sooner” than it would otherwise, Chief Executive Doug Lawler said last month.  Other shale firms are selling acreage or service arms to finance production and cover dividends. Pioneer Natural Resources this month raised $400 million from a pressure pumping unit. It will sell more assets and expects to generate more cash than it consumes next year, CEO Timothy Dove said during a third-quarter earnings call.    Not everyone thinks the historically boom-or-bust shale business will be able control spending. Moving to expand drillable reserves and raise production “is in these companies’ DNA,” said Roy Martin, analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “The future of their business hinges on more barrels coming out,” he said.  Clark Williams-Derry, director of energy finance at sustainability think tank Sightline Institute, said producers are trying to restrain spending while still pumping more oil to meet investor demands for cash flow. “It’s an industry that’s struggling to maintain production while pleasing investors,” Williams-Derry said.

2018-11-15,"OSLO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Norwegian power trader Einar Aas has reached an agreement with creditors, including Nasdaq Clearing, after his default in September forced members of the clearing house to stump up around 100 million euros ($113 million) to cover his losses. Nasdaq Commodities, which operates the Nordic power exchange, said on Thursday that Aas had agreed to sell his assets to help the clearing house and its members recover the money they had to put into a default fund. It said proceeds from the assets would be distributed to participants of the default fund on a pro rata basis, but did not estimate how much the assets might raise. One member of the clearing house, Norwegian power firm Agder Energi, disagreed with the deal, but has decided not to raise further objections, Nasdaq Commodities added. “We can confirm that a legally binding agreement for a consensual arrangement with creditors has today been finalised between Mr. Aas and his creditors, including Nasdaq Clearing,” Nasdaq Commodities said in a statement. Nasdaq Commodities and Nasdaq Clearing are both part of U.S. exchanges operator Nasdaq Group.

2018-11-15,"KIEV, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman expects to get new loans from the International Monetary Fund as early as December once parliament passes a budget of stability that refrains from making pre-election populist moves, he said on Thursday. Securing IMF assistance will also unlock loans from the World Bank and the European Union, while Groysman also said Ukraine was in negotiation with Washington for a new loan guarantee for sovereign debt. Groysman negotiated a new deal with the IMF last month aimed at keeping finances on an even keel during a choppy election period next year. The new loans are contingent on him steering an IMF-compliant budget through parliament. “This budget is a budget of stability and continuation of reforms,” Groysman said in an interview with Reuters. “This is fully consistent with our IMF programme.” “Yes. We are counting on a tranche in December,” he added, when asked about when IMF loans were expected, though he did not elaborate on the possible size of the loan. Ukraine’s government approved a draft budget in September but it will typically undergo a slew of amendments before parliament finally approves it. Groysman said a proposal to change how companies are taxed — on withdrawn capital rather than profits — had been dropped from the budget because of the IMF’s concerns. He also said he would not bow to opposition parties’ demands to reverse a recent increase in household gas tariffs, a step which his government reluctantly took in order to qualify for more IMF assistance. “Populism led to the weakness of Ukraine,” he said. “This should not be allowed.” The IMF and Kiev’s foreign allies came to Ukraine’s rescue after it plunged into turmoil following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatist rebels occupying the eastern industrial Donbass region. The United States has also sold coal to plug a domestic shortage caused by rebels taking control of mines in the east. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Ukraine this week. In response to a question on whether Ukraine would continue to buy coal from the United States and potentially also liquefied natural gas (LNG), Groysman said: “Liquefied gas is very interesting for Ukraine. We talked about the whole spectrum of our cooperation in the energy sector,” he said, adding: “As for coal, we will buy it from our international partners until we cover the domestic deficit.” Washington has also previously issued loan guarantees for Ukrainian debt. Groysman said another such guarantee was “under discussion.” (Editing by Richard Balmforth)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ukraine-primeminister/ukraine-pm-upbeat-on-imf-loan-in-december-after-budget-passes-idUKL8N1XQ7GU,15 Nov 2018,"Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr

2018-11-15,"(Adds details on run cuts, ethanol market) By Jarrett Renshaw and Michael Hirtzer Nov 15 (Reuters) - Green Plains Inc, the nation’s fourth-largest ethanol producer, has permanently shuttered a Virginia production plant and cut output at several other facilities as it tries to navigate a supply glut that has pummeled biofuel profits. Green Plains announced on Thursday that it was closing a plant in the town of Hopewell that had capacity to produce 60 million gallons annually. Thirty-one jobs will be cut, it said in a news release. With ethanol plants in Corn Belt states such as Iowa and Illinois struggling to make money, further-flung facilities have been under even more pressure as bringing in corn from far away boosts feedstock costs. Ergon BioFuels LLC, a subsidiary of privately held Ergon Inc, in September said it would permanently shut down its only ethanol plant in Mississippi, while Conestoga Energy Holdings LLC last week said it would temporarily halt ethanol output at its plant in Texas. Green Plains, whose shares were down nearly 2 percent to $16.82 in late-morning trading, had purchased the Virginia plant just three years ago for $18.25 million. The company has taken some of the most drastic measures in the industry to reduce debt and rein in production, including a recent sale of three ethanol plants to Valero Energy Corp. The measures come as ethanol prices have hit decade-year lows on flat domestic demand and a trade war with China that has left a major buyer of excess production on the sidelines. Green Plains has idled plants in Superior, Iowa; Atkison, Nebraska; Madison, Illinois, and Fairmount, Minnesota, to help deal with weak margins, two sources familiar with the plant’s operations said this month. The Fairmount plant, a key export facility, could be down for as long as four months, one of the sources said. “What you hear today, could be wrong tomorrow. We make decisions regularly to flex our production up and down, which is the main reason why we do not openly discuss our production rate at any given time,” Jim Stark, a spokesman for Green Plains, said in response to an email. Plants go idle for many reasons, such as mechanical failures and planned work, Stark said, adding that the company has not made any decisions on idling plants long-term.

Crude inventories soared 10.3 million barrels in the week to Nov. 9 to 442.1 million barrels, the highest level since early December 2017, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels. That was the biggest weekly increase since February 2017. U.S. crude production also climbed by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 11.7 million bpd, the highest on record, while net U.S. crude imports rose 268,000 bpd, the data showed. “A good chunk of the crude build occurred on the Gulf Coast, as refining activity dropped,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, referring to the region’s 5.2 million-barrel build. “Common themes are threaded through this report as in recent weeks - another SPR release and another increase to domestic production.” The U.S. Department of Energy had offered about 11 million barrels of oil for sale from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), to be delivered between Oct. 1 through Nov. 30 and those barrels have now been arriving in the market, traders said. Inventories in the SPR dropped by about 1.4 million barrels last week to the lowest level since 2004, according to EIA data. Oil prices, however, held gains after the bearish build in crude as the market focused instead on the decline in fuel stockpiles. “Obviously the headline crude build was shocking but the market is not falling apart in part due to the fact that we saw big drops in gasoline supplies ... and distillate fuels. The products are definitely supporting us right now, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Gasoline stocks fell by 1.4 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.5 million-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.6 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.7 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 1.17 million barrels, EIA said. Refinery crude runs rose by 24,000 bpd, EIA data showed.

Wall Street’s main stock indexes opened lower after mixed corporate earnings. Oil prices rose as they continued to recoup some losses form a recent steep plunge. In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May battled to save a draft divorce deal with the European Union after her Brexit secretary and other ministers quit in protest and lawmakers stepped up efforts to topple her.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257.38 points, or 1.03 percent, to 24,823.12, the S&P 500 lost 25.3 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,676.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 44.31 points, or 0.62 percent, to 7,092.08.

U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in October as purchases of motor vehicles and building materials surged, likely driven by recovery efforts in areas devastated by Hurricane Florence. U.S. Treasury prices rose, sending yields to two-week lows across the curve, as concerns about a weak stock market and Britain’s exit from the European Union prompted investors to seek the safety of government bonds. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 10/32 in price to yield 3.0848 percent, from 3.12 percent late on Wednesday.

2018-11-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain must halt a back-up power scheme aimed at avoiding electricity shortages pending a further investigation by European Union regulators, an EU court ruled on Thursday, which sent shares in UK energy companies tumbling. The judgement by the EU’s General Court annuls a decision by the European Commission, which had said Britain’s so-called power capacity market was compatible with EU state aid rules.     Britain began power capacity auctions in 2014, offering to pay providers for making supplies available at short notice, and so avoid shortages that might occur as coal plants close and low prices dissuade investors from building new power plants. However, British energy company Tempus Energy launched an appeal against the capacity market, saying it amounted to subsidies for fossil fuel generators and discriminated against technology designed to cut electricity demand during peak times. In Thursday’s judgement, the General Court said the European Commission did not carry out enough checks and that payments under the British scheme should be halted until further due diligence could be carried out. The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) department said the ruling imposes a “standstill period”, which prevents it from holding capacity auctions or making any capacity payments under existing agreements until the scheme can be approved again. Shares in British power firms SSE, Drax and Centrica, which won contracts under the scheme, fell between 5 and 7 percent, underperforming the wider FTSE 100 index, which was little changed. Greg Clark, Secretary of State for BEIS, said the judgement was a matter of procedure rather than one on the government’s policy of capacity markets. The British government is working with its European counterparts to find a swift resolution, he said at a government energy briefing in London. National Grid said it has been asked to postpone indefinitely upcoming auctions for capacity to be delivered in the winter of 2022/23 and a nearer-term one for 2019/20. The government will seek separate approval from the Commission to run a replacement nearer-term auction, while the postponed one for four winters ahead could be run in next year’s auction round, subject to Commission approval for the main capacity scheme, National Grid added. Tom Glover, chief commercial officer at RWE Generation, said the company was “deeply disappointed” by the court ruling. “There is a material negative impact for RWE and we will be reviewing our obligations under the capacity market,” he told reporters at a government energy event. Analysts at Bernstein said the Commission’s formal investigation will take time and create uncertainty for the UK power market.  “Given that a number of European countries have capacity market schemes that have no demand-side participation, we fail to see how the UK capacity market can be singled out,” they said, adding that the decision can be appealed by Britain.

Front-month gas futures rose as high as $4.929 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on Wednesday, their highest since February 2014. Traders said the cold this week would force utilities to start withdrawing gas from storage caverns that are already around 16 percent below normal for this time of year, prompting concerns of possible gas shortages in some parts of the country later this winter. Next-day prices for Thursday, meanwhile, rose to their highest since January at the Henry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL benchmark in Louisiana, Dominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL in Pennsylvania and Chicago citygate NG-CG-CH-SNL. Next-day gas at the Henry Hub rose to $4.57/mmBtu, their highest since January for a fifth day in a row, due to cold weather nationally and as demand at nearby liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals rose to new highs with the start of new liquefaction trains. Cheniere Energy Inc expects new liquefaction trains at its LNG export terminals in Sabine Pass in Louisiana and Corpus Christi in Texas to enter service in the near future. Next-day prices at the Dominion South hub rose to $3.68/mmBtu, their highest since January for a seventh day in a row, with the cold weather and as more pipelines entered service in recent weeks, allowing gas trapped in the Marcellus and Utica shale to flow to the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions where prices are higher. The new pipes, including Rover, Atlantic Sunrise, Nexus and Mountaineer, have enabled drillers to boost production in Appalachia and the country as a whole to record highs.

2018-11-15,"DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - A German administrative court on Thursday ruled that the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia must ban older diesel vehicles from parts of the nation’s industrial heartland, including a busy motorway, in the latest extension of such bans in the country.   The ban affects Gelsenkirchen and Essen, including part of the A40 motorway, which are located in the Ruhr region, one of Germany’s most densely populated areas. The ban, which will come into effect next year, follows a lawsuit brought by the DUH environmental lobby group.  It has called for a ban of diesel vehicles in various German cities, invoking legal thresholds of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air.  Scandals involving schemes to conceal the true levels of pollutant emissions from diesel cars have dealt repeated blows to the global reputation of Germany’s car industry in recent years. DUH’s lawyer Remo Klinger praised the ruling, saying that “Clean air is a human right that the state must guarantee.” Other German cities also face the risk of diesel driving bans imposed by judges, including Aachen, Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Duesseldorf and Mainz.

2018-11-15,"(Repeating without changes for wider distribution) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil market is scrambling to adjust to a deep selloff over the last several weeks, with forward prices signaling a supply glut which could upend plans for producers and traders through 2019. U.S. crude futures plunged 7 percent on Tuesday, to settle at $55.69, their lowest level this year, down from a four-year high only a month ago. Tuesday marked a 12th straight session of declines, which is the longest losing streak on record, shaking a market that was bracing for supply shortfalls just a month ago. “We were definitely in the bullish narrative for the past three months, and now we’re seeing that narrative shift,” said Michael Cohen, head of energy markets research at Barclays. “If the narrative gets unwound or undermined, so, too, does the positioning by the market.” In the biggest sign of the shift, an increasing number of later-dated futures contracts are trading at a premium to current prices. That is a signal that the market expects supply to outpace demand next year and into 2020. That trend could inhibit producers from drilling and deal a blow to shale companies, which have raked in profits as U.S. production surged to a weekly record of 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in early November. Already, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is considering a production cut to boost prices. Adding to concerns, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday that supply will outpace demand in 2019. “I think there’s a genuine shift,” one trader at a top commodities merchant said. “Everyone is talking about global oil builds in 2019.” Many traders saw $100 oil on the horizon just a month ago, but oil is now closer to $50 a barrel. U.S. production is expected to surpass the 12 million bpd milestone by mid-2019, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts. As prices fall and market structure weakens, U.S. shale producers may pare their drilling plans for 2019, said R.T. Dukes, research director for U.S. lower 48 upstream at Wood Mackenzie. “I think, instead of a big ramp-up into next year, we get flatter activity than what we might have seen otherwise,” he said. Still, any changes would take time to alter the trajectory of production, especially as the largest oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, are increasing activity in U.S. shale plays. The weakening in 2019 contracts pushes the market’s structure, or curve, more firmly into contango, where forward prices are higher than spot prices. Contango is a symptom of an oversupplied oil market or rising levels of inventories. It makes it more profitable for crude traders to store large volumes of oil for later, rather than sell for immediate use. The spread between U.S. crude futures expiring in December 2019 and December 2020 CLZ9-Z0, a popular trade in oil markets, flipped from a premium to a discount of about 42 cents on Tuesday. It is the first time the spread traded in negative territory since October 2017. U.S. crude for delivery in December 2018 plunged to trade as much as $1.43 a barrel below futures for delivery in June 2019 CLZ8-M9 last week, the widest spread on record. The December 2018 contract dropped to trade as much as $2.10 per barrel below the December 2019 CLZ8-Z9 contract last week, the widest since early 2016. A change in the market structure has ramifications for investors as well. When far-dated contracts trade below the spot price, funds and other investors benefit from what is known as “positive roll yield.” In that situation, funds holding a contract shift into the next month’s contract before it expires, profiting from buying the cheaper later-dated futures. But with those contracts now more expensive, rolling the long positions forward is less lucrative and is one reason why traders have pulled back on bullish bets.

2018-11-15,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron, hit by a slump in popularity, faces a nationwide protest this weekend over rising fuel taxes that threatens to gridlock France’s roads and show the depth of discontent with his reforms to reshape the economy. Dubbed the “yellow vest” movement, demonstrators are threatening to block motorways and access roads to some oil depots, including in Calais near the Channel Tunnel, a major passenger and freight link into Britain.  The protest is the latest confrontation between Macron and voters in the countryside and provincial cities which view the former investment banker as the representative of an urban elite out of touch with ordinary people. In 18 months in power, Macron has stared down muscular trade unions and street demonstrations as he liberalised labour laws and overhauled the heavily indebted state rail operator SNCF, unflinching in his resolve to bring economic and social renewal. He has tried to shrug off accusations he is a “president of the rich”, a tag milked by rivals after he scrapped a wealth tax. This time his administration - which appeared caught off guard by how fast the protest movement grew as word spread on social media - has sought to soothe poorer motorists. “I hear the anger, and it’s a fundamental right in our society to be allowed to express it,” Macron said in a television interview late on Wednesday.  But he added the protest movement, embraced by Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally party and receiving tentative support from other parties on the left and right, had been hijacked by opponents and their supporters bent on obstructing reforms without a clear vision of their own. The price of diesel, the most commonly used car fuel in France, at the pump increased by 20 percent in the past year to an average of 1.49 euros ($1.68)/litre, according to website www.carbu.com.  The higher taxes, approved in late 2017, started biting as oil prices surged in October though they have eased off somewhat since.  Increases in taxes on gasoline and tobacco as well as an increase to a social welfare levy before other tax cuts came into force left many voters feeling Macron’s reforms had eroded their purchasing power.  Their anger is reflected in opinion polls showing support for Macron falling to new lows of 21 percent.  The government is standing firm on the fuel tax hikes but on Wednesday announced a 500 million euro plan to help motorists with the lowest incomes, seeking to take the sting out of the protest movement. The diesel tax increases are designed to encourage drivers to switch to more environmentally-friendly automobile models, part of Macron’s “energy transition” plan.  But critics say that while the government hits people’s  wallets, it lacks a clear vision on switching to greener energy sources, citing foot-dragging by Macron’s administration on reducing France’s reliance on nuclear power. Rural voters are also angered by a speed limit reduction on countryside roads. “What do you do with the dough, aside from changing the crockery at the Elysee palace or building yourselves swimming pools?” exclaimed Brittany resident Jacline Mouraud in a Facebook post viewed more than six million times.   “If that’s what the money is used for, we might as well change, there’s no point in you staying on.”  Reporting by Sarah White; editing by Richard Lough and Marie-Louise Gumuchian",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-politics-fuel/refile-macron-braces-for-motorist-revolt-on-frances-highways-idUKL8N1XP8XE,15 Nov 2018,"President Emmanuel Macron, hit by

2018-11-15,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - When U.S. President Donald Trump asked Saudi Arabia this summer to raise oil production to compensate for lower crude exports from Iran, Riyadh swiftly told Washington it would do so. But Saudi Arabia did not receive advance warning when Trump made a U-turn by offering generous waivers that are keeping more Iranian crude in the market instead of driving exports from Riyadh’s arch-rival down to zero, OPEC and industry sources say.Angered by the U.S. move that has raised worries about over supply, Saudi Arabia is now considering cutting output with OPEC and its allies by about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) or 1.5 percent of global supply, sources told Reuters this week. “The Saudis are very angry at Trump. They don’t trust him any more and feel very strongly about a cut. They had no heads-up about the waivers,” said one senior source briefed on Saudi energy policies. Washington has said the waivers are a temporary concession to allies that imported Iranian crude and might have struggled to find other supplies quickly when U.S. sanctions were imposed on Nov. 4. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Nov. 5 that cutting Iranian exports “to zero immediately” would have shocked the market. “I don’t want to lift oil prices,” he said. A U.S. source with knowledge of the matter said: “The Saudis were going to be angry either way with the waivers, pre-briefed or even after the announcement.” A U.S. State Department official said: “We don’t discuss diplomatic communications.” The U.S. shift toward offering waivers adds to tension between the United States and Saudi Arabia, as Washington pushes for Riyadh to shed full light on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. “The Saudis feel they were completely snookered by Trump. They did everything to raise supplies assuming Washington would push for very harsh Iranian sanctions. And they didn’t get any heads up from the U.S. that Iran will get softer sanctions,” said a second source briefed on Saudi oil thinking. Saudi energy ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.     Since the summer, Riyadh has led the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers to hike supplies by over 1 million bpd to keep a lid on prices as U.S. sanctions were imposed. Brent oil had surged above $86 a barrel in October on tight supply worries, but prices have since slid to $66 on concerns about oversupply. Trump had wanted lower oil prices before the U.S. midterm elections earlier this month. Washington gave waivers in November to eight buyers to purchase Iranian oil for 180 days. This was more waivers than were initially expected. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a key Trump administration ally, wants prices at $80 or more for his economic reforms, sources familiar with Saudi thinking say. “The waivers were totally unexpected, especially after calls to raise output. A few people are upset,” said a senior Gulf oil source familiar with the discussions among OPEC and its allies on output policy. While the United States set a time limit for the waivers, it did not tell the eight recipients how much oil they could buy and has not eased payment restrictions, complicating purchases. Iran’s oil exports are expected to drop sharply to about 1 million bpd in November from a peak of 2.8 million bpd earlier this year. Although output is expected to recover from December thanks to waivers, it is still not clear by how much. Riyadh’s concern is to avoid the kind of oversupply in the market that led to a price collapse in 2014 to below $30. But the lack of clarity about the level of Iran’s supplies makes it tough for Saudi Arabia to work out appropriate production levels, especially after Russia raised output steeply in recent months and has said it wanted to produce more in 2019. Saudi Arabia would need to convince Russia to join in any move for new supply cuts. “First the Saudis let oil prices rise to $86 per barrel and then flooded the market. Can they now cut back enough going into a seasonally weak time of the year? Without Russia it won’t be credible,” said Gary Ross, CEO of Black Gold investors. Saudi Arabia must also contend with rising U.S. production that has hit record levels above 11 million bpd and is set to climb further next year. U.S. exports could surge from the second part of 2019 when new pipeline infrastructure opens. Rapidan Energy Group said it saw a supply glut now lasting much more than just a few months in 2019. “Now that the market has correctly priced weaker-than-anticipated Iran sanctions and much bigger inventory builds next year, we wish to emphasize that ‘OPEC plus’ officials face more than a single-year supply tsunami in 2019,” Rapidan said.

2018-11-15,"* Sterling tumbles a cent after Brexit deal hopes crumble * Asia rose overnight on U.S.-China trade hopes * Oil nudges higher for second day after 12-day losing streak * Dollar gets going after soft start, Wall Street seen edging high * Bunds rally, Italian bond yields dip as budget remains in focus By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Sterling tumbled and the rest of Europe’s share markets groaned on Thursday after a long-awaited Brexit agreement was thrown into chaos as Britain’s chief negotiator for the deal quit just hours after it had been unveiled. Up until that point markets had looked relatively calm. Asia had cheered news that China and the United States were back in contact about their trade dispute, and oil was inching up again having halted a record losing streak. But then came the hammer blow with Brexit minister Dominic Raab quitting in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal for leaving the European Union. “No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,” he said in his resignation letter. Cue a sterling meltdown. The currency slumped a full 2 cents to $1.2750 and though that made the FTSE stronger — a weaker pound makes life easier for exporters on the index — big UK banks the rest of Europe sank swiftly into the red. “The reaction is sterling shows that the chance of no Brexit deal has spiked,” said Tim Graf, Head of Macro Strategy for EMEA at State Street Global Markets. “It also introduces thoughts of a leadership challenge (for British Prime Minister Theresa May) which seems likely now.” The turmoil also boosted demand for safe-haven German government bonds. Ten-year yields on what is regarded as one of the safest assets in the world, fell over three basis points to 0.36 percent — its lowest in over two weeks. UK government bonds saw a rush of demand too with the reflex dive for cover and the sight of state owned bank RBS stocks down almost 9 percent, drove the biggest fall in 5-year yields since just after the June 2016 Brexit vote. EU leaders had said they would meet on Nov. 25 to endorse the divorce deal, but May now faces the much more perilous struggle of getting parliament to approve what was agreed. “We are basically trading the headlines.” said Ned Rumpeltin European Head of Currency Strategy at TD Securities in London. “I think a leadership challenge is imminent.” Investors were also starting to look ahead to U.S. trading where futures were pointing to a modestly higher start as forecast topping earnings from Walmart provided a welcome appetiser ahead of U.S. retail sales later. In the commodity markets, where Brexit may be a sideshow but turbulence is still acute after a 12-day losing streak was set this week, the mood was much calmer. U.S. oil futures steadied at $56.35 a barrel, after a slight bounce overnight. Brent was up 0.4 percent at $66.42. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had also ended up 0.8 percent having fallen the previous day as the sharp slide in oil prices had heightened anxiety about the global growth outlook. Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.8 percent on the China-U.S. communications, while Australian stocks inched up 0.05 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.2 percent. “While it’s difficult to pin-point a specific event for the risk-off move, recent themes appear to be keeping markets cautious include oil’s recent plummet, Apple’s fall, U.S. political gridlock, China’s slowing growth, tightening liquidity, a hawkish Fed, earnings peak, Italian jitters, and Brexit uncertainty,” wrote economists at ANZ. The S&P 500 had fallen for a fifth straight day overnight too, with financial stocks hit by fears of tighter regulations once the Democratic Party takes control of the House of Representatives. U.S. equities have also been pressured by concerns that earnings growth might be peaking, trade tensions and a slowing global economy - factors that had triggered a rout in riskier assets in October. “If U.S. stocks are to bounce back, economic indicators will be key,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “Focus will be on today’s U.S. retail sales data, which will provide a view of how private consumption -the main component of economic growth- is faring.” U.S. retail sales for October will be released at 1330 GMT.

2018-11-15,"* Partnership hopes to use the design for UK plant * Assessment process expected to take around four years (Adds comment from EDF Energy) By Susanna Twidale LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The first Chinese-designed atomic reactor for use in Britain moved a step closer to fruition on Thursday as the UK nuclear regulator said it had completed the second stage of its assessment of the technology. General Nuclear Services, an industrial partnership between China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN) IPO-CGNP.HK and French utility EDF, hopes to use the design at a nuclear plant planned to be built at Bradwell in Essex, eastern England. CGN intends to make a number of investments in Britain’s nuclear power sector, most notably the new Hinkley Point C project in southwest England. Britain’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said the Chinese HPR1000 reactor had completed stage two of its generic design assessment (GDA) - the formal process for approving a new reactor. The four-stage assessment process is expected to take around four years in total and was started around two years ago. The project will now move to stage three of the process. “The regulators have not identified at this stage of the GDA process any fundamental safety, security or environmental issues that would prevent the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation,” the ONR said in a statement. EDF Energy said the approval is a “key step” for a new nuclear power station at Bradwell, which will use a British version of the HPR1000 reactor following full approval. However, the project is still in an early pre-planning stage, which will involve years of investigative work and public consultations before detailed proposals are produced to allow a planning application to be made, the company added. Britain needs to fill an electricity supply gap in the next decade. Many of its ageing nuclear plants are due to close by 2030 and the government plans to shut its coal plants by 2025 to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices. Last week, Japan’s Toshiba Corp said it would scrap a proposed nuclear plant project at Moorside, in northwest England, after failing to find an investment partner.

2018-11-15,"* Russia pumped 11.41 mln bpd in Oct, a post-Soviet high * Saudi Arabia proposed Oct level as reference for combined cut * Moscow wants to avoid any cuts as its output grows - sources By Vladimir Soldatkin and Olesya Astakhova MOSCOW, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Russia wants to stay out of any oil-production cuts being touted by some of its partners in an OPEC-led supply pact, two high-ranking Russian sources told Reuters. Worried by a drop in oil prices due to slowing demand and record supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is talking about a policy U-turn just months after increasing production. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday avoided giving a direct answer on whether production should be limited, but said he had discussed the situation in global oil markets with U.S. President Donald Trump. “We need to be very accurate here, each word matters,” Putin told reporters in Singapore. “But the fact that the cooperation (with OPEC) is needed is obvious and we will cooperate.” This week, Trump said he hoped Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC would not cut production. Putin said an oil price of around $70 per barrel suited Russia. A steep slide in prices has surprised many oil market participants. Brent crude has fallen from a four-year high of $86 a barrel in early October to $66 as of Thursday. Just weeks ago, some trading firms were talking of $100 oil. “I think (oil) production should not be lowered. Yes, we have done this in the past but this was not the right systematic approach,” a senior Russian government source said. “Oil production in Russia has been on the rise in recent years, by around 100,000 barrels per day each year, and it will continue to do so in future.” Earlier this week, three sources familiar with the issue said OPEC and its partners were discussing a proposal to cut oil output by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), although Russia may not be on board for such a large reduction. Another source familiar with Russian thinking said Moscow may support smaller cuts, most likely by other producers. “We think 1 million bpd (cuts) is more realistic, not 1.4 million bpd ... But who is going to do this is another question,” the source said. Putin said last month that Russia was able to add another 200,000–300,000 bpd to its production. Russia pumped 11.41 million bpd in October, a post-Soviet high. October’s level was proposed by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih as the reference point for any cut. Russia’s October level was around 460,000 bpd more than the 10.947 million bpd it had initially been bound to produce under the supply pact agreed with OPEC and other allies. A small reduction from the October level would be a “win-win” for Moscow, the second source said. Alternatively, Russia may propose not to increase output further, instead of a cut, the source said. Saudi-led OPEC and a group of non-OPEC nations, dominated by Russia, have been cooperating to limit oil supply since the start of 2017. They partially unwound their reduction in June after pressure from Trump, who wanted lower oil prices. The producers, known informally as “OPEC+”, will convene in the first week of December in Vienna to decide further steps. Another indication of the likelihood of any Russian output cut can be gleaned from the head of Kremlin-controlled energy giant Rosneft, Putin ally Igor Sechin. He eschewed a direct response on Wednesday on whether curbs were needed, saying oil prices were adjusting after being hit by initial uncertainty about production in Iran, which later benefited from export waivers from U.S. sanctions. “It (the oil price) is already growing,” he said, as Brent rebounded from a steep sell-off the previous day. “I believe that this uncertainty which affected the oil price was largely due to Iran. Now everything is being adjusted.” Rosneft, which accounts for 40 percent of Russian oil production, plans to raise its liquid hydrocarbon output further next year, to 241 million tonnes, or 4.8-4.9 million bpd, from 4.73 million bpd in the third quarter. Another large Russian oil producer, Gazprom Neft, is ready to lift output by a further 20,000-30,000 bpd this year and by 50,000 bpd next year. The head of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, voiced opposition this week to any cut. Surging U.S. production is a headache for OPEC+. The country’s crude output is expected to average 12.06 million bpd in 2019, passing 12 million bpd sooner than expected on surging shale supply, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said this month. “U.S. oil production will soon plateau. It can’t grow indefinitely,” the Russian government source said. In the previous round of global production cuts, Russian oil companies first opposed the move but then relented under orders from Putin. The Russian Energy Ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for a comment.

2018-11-15,"MELBOURNE, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Australia has readied its stretched power grid to cope with a hotter-than-normal summer, with extra electricity supply lined up for the system in case of disruptions, the energy market operator said in a statement on Friday. This is the second year the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has taken extra steps to prepare for summer by beefing up power reserves to offset intermittent wind and solar generators and outages at ageing coal-fired plants. Blackouts hit the country’s southeastern states in 2016 and 2017, the worst of which hit the entire state of South Australia and shut top global miner BHP’s Olympic Dam copper mine for two weeks, costing it $105 million. “The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting a hotter and drier summer, which - coupled with other risks we have identified - suggests we have a challenging summer awaiting us,” AEMO Chief Executive Audrey Zibelman said. Australian power demand typically soars in the southern hemisphere summer as households and businesses crank up air conditioning. At the same time, generation, transmission and distribution networks can be hit by bushfires and storms. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said in a seasonal forecast on Thursday that the summer will be hotter than normal. “Warmer-than-average days and nights are likely for almost all of Australia for December to February,” it said. AEMO said in August the states of Victoria and South Australia were most at risk for outages this summer, with some threat in the most populous state of New South Wales, where drought has depleted hydropower dams. To help prevent blackouts, the operator has secured 930 megawatts (MW) of reserve power, in part by making agreements with some energy users to curb use when supplies are tight. “AEMO is confident the plans we have made ... have appropriately equipped us to tackle any unforeseen events the upcoming summer might bring,” Zibelman said in the statement. Last summer, lining up and activating reserve supplies cost the market operator A$52 million ($38 million), which it then passed on in fees to customers in South Australia and Victoria. Costs for the reserves are expected to fall this year, AEMO said, partly because it has not had to line up as much back-up supply as last year, as 2,100 MW of new generation capacity has come onto the market over the past year. Australia’s drought is not expected to impact power generation this summer, AEMO said. $1 = $1.3746 Australian dollars

2018-11-15,"(Adds details on sanctions bill, comments by senators) By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced legislation on Thursday seeking to strike back at Saudi Arabia over the death of a Saudi journalist at a consulate in Turkey and for its role in Yemen’s devastating civil war. If it were to become law, the bill would suspend weapon sales to Saudi Arabia and prohibit U.S. refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft for Riyadh’s campaign in Yemen against the Houthis, Shi’ite Muslim fighters that Yemen’s neighbors view as agents of Iran, the lawmakers said. It also would impose sanctions on anyone blocking humanitarian access in Yemen and anyone supporting the Houthis in Yemen. Sponsored by three Republican and three Democratic senators, the legislation reflects continued dissatisfaction in the U.S. Congress over the Yemen war, which has killed more than 10,000 people and created the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. That frustration was exacerbated by the killing in October at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote for the Washington Post. Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said sanctions on 17 Saudis announced earlier on Thursday by President Donald Trump’s administration were not enough to ensure a credible investigation of Khashoggi’s death and an end to hostilities in Yemen. “We are putting teeth behind these demands with regular oversight, sanctions and suspension of weapons sales and refueling support,” he said in a statement. “This legislation is an important way to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for various acts in Yemen as well as the death of Jamal Khashoggi,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor. The bill’s other sponsors include Republican Senators Todd Young and Susan Collins and Democrats Jack Reed and Jeanne Shaheen.

2018-11-15,"(Repeats item with no changes to text) * 15-20 LNG tankers floating in Asian waters * Most float off Singapore, some Malaysia, S China Sea * Last time tankers used for storage was in 2014 -trade By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Tankers storing liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asian waters have more than doubled in number since late October as traders have been caught off guard by warmer-than-expected temperatures that have capped demand and pulled down prices. Spot market demand ahead of winter has been slowed by the forecasts for warmer temperatures this year in North Asia, with onshore storage tanks filling up. “People were expecting China to buy as much as last year in the spot market, but the weather so far has been quite mild and I don’t think they were anticipating that,” a Singapore-based LNG trader said. LNG prices LNG-AS last year climbed steadily from mid-July to January as China’s gasification push for winter heating sparked higher imports. But this year, buyers from the world’s top natural gas importer - via pipeline and tanker - have been spreading out their purchases more. Now about 15 to 20 LNG tankers holding at least 2 million cubic metres of LNG worth more than $400 million at spot market prices are floating in Asian waters, industry sources said. That’s up from a half-dozen tankers being used for storage in Asia three weeks ago. Globally, the number of such LNG tankers stands at 20 to 30, one of the sources said. This has helped to drive up LNG tanker rates to record highs, the ship broking and trading sources said. Most of the traders storing cargoes in the tankers are “seeking better winter pricing ... holding out against rising charter rates to achieve an acceptable profit on the molecules,” shipbroking firm Braemar said in a weekly LNG report last week. This is “creating pain for those producers who are still forced to lift cargoes from terminals which are approaching tank tops.” Refinitiv Eikon data shows at least eight tankers storing LNG in Singapore waters while two were in Malaysian waters. More than five vessels that had been storing LNG are now on the move or have discharged the cargoes, the data shows. Storing LNG on tankers out at sea, unlike crude oil, is generally seen as a risky bet, given the high costs of storage and the fact that cargoes degrade over time by evaporating. As with other commodities, the play is typically triggered by a market structure known as contango, in which prices for immediate delivery are cheaper than later months. The contango, which was at about $1 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) last month, has since narrowed to about 50 cents or less, traders said. The last time LNG was put into floating storage on a large scale was in 2014, though the number of tankers was lower, the Singapore LNG trader said. Not all the cargoes are stranded without buyers. Some of the companies likely secured the tankers during the summer when shipping rates were far lower, and stored them in anticipation of a pick-up in prices, traders said.

2018-11-15,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) By Chen Aizhu BEIJING, Nov 15 (Reuters) - PetroChina will merge its wholesale natural gas sales unit with retail provider Kunlun Energy to shore up profits though the move worries independent gas sellers that fear the combination will create a monopoly. PetroChina announced the restructuring internally last week to merge PetroChina Natural Gas Sales Company, the country’s largest natural gas wholesaler, with Kunlun Energy Co Ltd , said three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The three sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. A spokesman with China National Petroleum Corp, parent of PetroChina, said he could not immediately confirm the restructuring. Hong Kong-listed Kunlun operates Petrochina’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminals and distributes gas to households and factories. PetroChina Natural Gas Sales Company markets the state-owned company’s domestic gas production, imports of pipeline gas from Turkmenistan and Myanmar, and LNG shipped in from Qatar and Australia. But the firm, which supplies 70 percent of China’s gas, has suffered losses in its import business as the global prices it pays are often above state regulated domestic prices. In the first nine months of 2018, PetroChina booked a net loss of nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.88 billion) on gas imports compared with net losses of 16.99 billion yuan during the same period a year earlier. Kunlun during the first six months of 2018 reported net profit of 5.04 billion yuan, up 1.4 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to its financial report. “This shall boost PetroChina’s lagging gas retail business and cut heavy losses at the wholesale department,” said one of the three executives. On Nov. 6, Kunlun released a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange discussing “Natural Gas Business Development Strategies” that states PetroChina’s wholesale and retail sales businesses will be operated independently. The statement adds that as of the date of the announcement Kunlun has no intention to transfer any PetroChina assets in connection with the strategy. Kunlun did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on the restructuring sent after business hours. Still, the restructuring worries smaller independent firms such as China Resources Gas Group, China Gas Holdings and ENN Energy Holdings that are fearful the move could squeeze supplies in a fast growing market and create a monopoly wholesaler. “(It will) dramatically alter the market structure as PetroChina will no doubt prioritize Kunlun as its top customer at the expense of other buyers,” said another of the executives, who is with an independent gas distributor. The move is Petrochina’s response to a government plan to create a national gas pipeline company by consolidating the country’s trunk pipeline assets of which PetroChina controls nearly 80 percent. “The integration means Kunlun will receive support from the supply side, and vice versa the sales group will have a deeper penetration into the retail including city gas distribution, gas refilling stations,” said the third source. Nearly 30 provincial wholesale operations of the gas sales company will be merged with the similar number of provincial outlets under Kunlun, the sources said.

2018-11-15,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Mexico’s oil regulator approved drilling plans on Thursday for five offshore projects with investment commitments totaling about $380 million, more than half of which was pledged for a shallow water block operated by Talos Energy. The projects are among more than 100 oil and gas contracts awarded by the regulator since 2015. They could lead to significant new streams of production despite President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s frequent criticisms of a 2013 constitutional energy reform that made the projects possible. “These exploration plans are basically the bet that the international market has made on the potential of these projects,” said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst. The Talos Energy-led consortium will drill at least one new well in January as part of its Area 7 contract, next to its Zama discovery announced last year, according to the presentation approved by the regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH). The consortium, which also includes Britain’s Premier Oil and Mexico’s Sierra Oil & Gas, will invest some $251 million in 2019 in the block, and also included a second “contingent” well in its drilling plans. U.S.-based McDermott International said on Thursday it was awarded a contract by Talos for design work and engineering services for the Zama project, which plans to be executed with IO Oil & Gas Consulting, a joint venture between McDermott and service company Baker Hughes. The CNH approved a separate plan by Russia’s Lukoil to drill its Otomi-Oeste well between September and November of 2019, and spend nearly $72 million on its Area 12 block over the course of the year. Italy’s Eni, meanwhile, plans to drill its Saasken-1 well in its Area 10 block and invest about $51 million on the project in 2019. A second Eni block, Area 14, will see investment of about $5 million next year, but will not see any drilling activity. A plan was also approved for Spain’s Repsol for its Area 11 block, but does not include any new wells. Lopez Obrador, a leftist who takes office in December, has been a sharp critic of the landmark energy reform championed by outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto. While he has said he will not authorize any new oil auctions until a review of already-awarded contracts has been completed by his team, he has vowed to respect existing contracts.

2018-11-15,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) company Cheniere Energy Inc officially opened its $15 billion Corpus Christi LNG export facility in Texas on Thursday. The company, however, would not say when the first cargo will actually leave the facility, which produced its first LNG on Wednesday. There is an LNG vessel, the LNG Golar Tundra, docked at the plant that analysts say will take the project’s first cargo soon. At a celebration marking the opening of the facility, Cheniere’s President and CEO Jack Fusco was joined by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and other state and local officials. Corpus Christi is the third big LNG export terminal to enter service in the lower 48 U.S. states. The first was Cheniere’s Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, which sent out its first cargo in February 2016. Since then, Sabine has delivered almost 500 cargoes to 29 countries and regions around the world, Fusco said at the celebration. The company has said it expects Corpus 1 and the fifth liquefaction train at its Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana to enter commercial service in the first quarter of 2019, followed by Corpus 2 in the second half of 2019 and Corpus 3 in the second half of 2021. Each of Cheniere’s trains is capable of liquefying about 0.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. U.S. LNG exports have almost quadrupled from 183.9 billion cubic feet (bcf) in 2016 to 706.4 bcf in 2017, worth about $3.3 billion, and are on track to rise to over 1,000 bcf in 2018, making the United States one of the world’s biggest exporters of the super-cooled gas. Total U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to jump to 5.2 bcfd by the end of 2018, 8.9 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10.3 bcfd by the end of 2020 from 3.8 bcfd now, which should make the United States the world’s third-biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019. Cheniere has said it is also developing a sixth 0.7-bcfd train at Sabine Pass and seven smaller 0.2-bcfd trains and other opportunities at Corpus.

2018-11-15,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has cut prices on its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in a bid to lift lagging sales after the company streamlined its sales and marketing organization, a company official told Reuters on Thursday. Effective on Thursday, price quotes for potential solar customers will be between $3,000 and $5,000 lower, representing savings of about 15 to 25 percent, according to Sanjay Shah, the company’s senior vice president of energy operations. Tesla said the $3,000 to $5,000 in savings was an average and that the actual amount could be lower or higher depending on the size of the rooftop system and where a home is located. Since Tesla’s acquisition two years ago of SolarCity, which at the time was the largest U.S. residential solar company, the company has sharply cut the vast sales organization that underpinned its rapid growth. Last year, Tesla stopped selling solar door-to-door, and earlier this year it ended a long-standing deal to sell solar at 800 Home Depot Inc (HD.N) stores - a relationship that some analysts estimated brought in roughly half of Tesla’s solar sales but added up to $7,000 to the cost of a residential system. That has come alongside a big drop in installations. Tesla deployed just 93 megawatts of solar in the third quarter, down from SolarCity’s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016. Shah said that with lower prices, customers will seek out Tesla at its stores and online.  “Every customer wants a greater value in terms of price,” he said. “When you do that the customer comes to you rather than you going to the customer.” He said the price cuts should make Tesla “highly competitive” and added that the company ultimately wants to be the lowest-cost solar provider in the United States. Solar energy systems from large installers on average are about 10 percent more expensive than those sold by smaller companies, according to a 2017 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a U.S. government research lab. Shah said Tesla’s premium solar products are more efficient than most other panels, and should not be compared with standard systems on price. The price cuts are made possible in part by the savings Tesla has produced from streamlining its sales operations. By selling directly through its website and roughly 100 retail stores, Tesla has been able to cut sales and marketing costs in half, Shah said. Shah joined the company six months ago from Amazon.com Inc  (AMZN.O) and has focused on making its solar supply chain more efficient, reducing sales and marketing costs, and bringing down the time it takes for rooftop systems to be installed, he said.

2018-11-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks climbed on Thursday after five sessions of declines as Wall Street surged on trade optimism, while sterling tumbled as political developments in Britain rippled through markets. Oil prices rose modestly, as the commodity recouped some losses from a recent steep plunge. U.S. stock indexes surged after a Financial Times report that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has told some industry executives that another round of tariffs on Chinese imports has been put on hold as the two nations pursue talks.  A spokesperson for Lighthizer later denied the report, one of several news developments involving trade during the day that swung stocks. “The market right now is just very reactionary,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. “One headline turns the Dow around 400 points. It speaks to the sensitivity around the issue.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 208.77 points, or 0.83 percent, to 25,289.27, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 28.62 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,730.2 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 122.64 points, or 1.72 percent, to 7,259.03. Investors are now focusing on the G20 meeting later this month, when leaders of the United States and China are expected to meet, and the Federal Reserve meeting in December, following investor optimism that recent inflation data may cause the central bank to be less aggressive with rate hikes. “In terms of catalysts for the rest of the year, we have the G20 meeting and we have the Fed meeting,” said Sunitha Thomas, regional portfolio adviser at Northern Trust Wealth Management. “Now that we have finished earnings, that is pretty much what everyone is focused on.” In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight for her draft divorce deal with the European Union after the resignation of her Brexit secretary and other ministers put her strategy and her job in peril. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2775, down 1.69 percent on the day, and also fell steeply against the euro. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 1.06 percent, while Britain's FTSE 250 .FTMC dropped 1.3 percent. “The Brexit news acted as a catalyst ... I think that what investors are acting upon is uncertainty,” said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist for Makor Capital Markets. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.66 percent, after five sessions of losses. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.26 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.18 percent to $1.1328. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 2/32 in price to yield 3.114 percent, from 3.12 percent late on Wednesday. Oil futures rose for the second consecutive session after this week’s steep losses as U.S. fuel stockpiles declined and a possible cut in OPEC output helped support prices.

2018-11-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures rose for the second consecutive session on Thursday after this week’s steep losses as U.S. fuel stockpiles declined and a possible cut in OPEC output helped support prices. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 50 cents to settle at $66.62 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 21 cents to settle at $56.46 a barrel. On Tuesday, U.S. futures marked their steepest one-day loss in more than three years due to ongoing worries about weakening global demand and oversupply. WTI also posted a record 12th straight decline. U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed crude inventories USOILC=ECI jumped 10.3 million barrels last week, the biggest weekly build since February 2017. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected an increase of 3.2 million barrels. But gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell 1.4 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI drew down by 3.6 million barrels, the EIA data showed. While the larger-than-expected crude build was “shocking,” the drops in refined product supplies helped buoy prices, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The products are definitely supporting us right now.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, is considering a cut of up to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) next year to avoid the kind of build in global inventories that prompted oil prices to crash between 2014 and 2016. “Oil prices shrug the (EIA) data off so far,” Commerzbank commodities analyst Carsten Fritsch said. “One explanation could be that a substantial production cut by OPEC becomes more likely.” Earlier in the day, two-high ranking Russian sources told Reuters that Russia wanted to stay out of any oil-production cuts touted by some of its partners in the OPEC-led supply pact. The head of Libyan state oil firm NOC said in a statement on Thursday that it was important for OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cooperate to maintain oil market stability. The International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC this week warned of a sizeable surplus at least in the first half of 2019, and possibly beyond, given the pace of growth in non-OPEC production and slower demand in heavy consumers such as China and India. [IEA/M] [OPEC/M] Oil prices have lost about a quarter of their value in only six weeks, pressured by a slowing global economy and soaring crude output led by the United States. U.S. crude production climbed to 11.7 million bpd, the highest on record, according to EIA data on Thursday. (For a graphic on 'Benchmark crude oil futures structure' click tmsnrt.rs/2QP7ZPS) “Asian refiners and consumers we speak with are mentioning initial concerns of slowing demand,” said Mike Corley, president of Mercatus Energy Advisors. U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday that China’s economic “conditions deteriorated materially” in the third quarter, while analysts at Capital Economics said China’s “near-term economic outlook still remains downbeat.” China is the world’s biggest oil importer and the second-largest crude consumer.

2018-11-15,"BARCELONA, Nov 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Renting a pair of jeans, working on an abandoned houseboat renovated as an office, or living in a portable home made from a shipping container - these are just a few ways residents of the Dutch capital Amsterdam can play their part to save the planet. Three years ago, the city launched a quest to become a “circular economy” - reusing products and materials, and minimising waste - by 2050. It now has 73 related projects underway, according to Eveline Jonkhoff, a strategic advisor on the initiative. The circular-economy push is part of a wider effort by Amsterdam to help meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change, she told a conference on smart cities in Barcelona this week. Other climate targets for Amsterdam focus on ending the use of natural gas by mid-century and putting in place a clean public transport system that does not contribute to planet-warming emissions by 2025. But key to the success of the city’s push toward carbon neutrality is enabling everyone to participate, Jonkhoff emphasised. “All these changes require very high investments, and we need to make sure this transition is affordable for everyone,” she said. Financial instruments will be needed to help residents buy solar panels and electric cars so they are “not just for the happy few”, she added. How to make often high-tech measures to limit global warming available and appealing to much of the public - including the elderly and the poor, who are often left out despite being most vulnerable to climate stresses - has been a key focus of the Barcelona conference this week. In Oslo, city authorities are introducing a new congestion charge in rush hours and adding more than 50 new road toll stations in a bid to deter polluting traffic. But “many people experience this as a challenge if they don’t have the money to pay,” noted Daniel Rees, political advisor to the Norwegian capital’s deputy mayor. Shifting to cleaner modes of getting around will require sufficient public transport, safe bicycle lanes and a network of charging points for electric vehicles, he said. And if cities start using autonomous buses in the future, alternative jobs will need to be found for drivers, he added. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, meanwhile, highlighted “climate justice” as one of four pillars of the Catalan city’s climate plan, adopted earlier this year. The city aims to boost support for the tenth of residents who struggle to pay for energy, and to improve housing to save on energy costs and reduce health risks from extreme weather. Barcelona - which faces more intense heatwaves, rain storms and droughts - is also doubling its bicycle lanes, adding 1.6 square metres of greenery per person by planting trees and creating public gardens, and pedestrianising some city blocks, among other measures. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for ecological transition, told the conference urban policies on climate change can improve citizens’ lives in the form of cleaner air, better-insulated buildings, energy savings and more parks. “Greener and healthier cities are also safer cities, and more attractive places to live,” she said. But Spain’s Socialist-led government, which came into power in June, is also aware that not everyone will win if it steps up action to decarbonise its economy, as it is promising. Last month, in a push to close most of Spain’s coal mines by the end of this year, Madrid made a deal with unions to invest 250 million euros ($283 million) over the next five years in affected provinces, mainly in the northwest. The money will support environmental restoration, early retirement, and training for miners to take up green energy jobs. It would be spent under a proposed system of “just transition contracts” between the central government and local authorities that would bring in businesses, universities and others. In Barcelona, Ribera told journalists that modern society must “pay attention to those groups who feel menaced by the transformation” to a low-carbon economy, and should offer solidarity. “We need to help those regions see a positive, constructive future,” she said on the sidelines of the conference. In December, the European Union launched a platform to support 41 regions in 12 countries that employ 185,000 people in coal mining to shift the focus of their economies away from producing the dirty fuel and towards clean energy. “The just transition concerns us all,” said Elena Visnar Malinovska, head of adaptation in the European Commission’s climate action division. ""Countries and cities have to start designing (climate) policies that minimise the economic and social disruptive impacts... and really maximise the benefits,"" she said.

2018-11-15,"HOUSTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf Coast crude oil imports in October fell to the lowest level in more than a year as the nation’s production and exports soared, data from Refinitiv Eikon and market intelligence firm Kpler show. Crude imports in the Gulf Coast, or PADD 3 region, averaged 2.35 million barrels per day (bpd) in October, down from 2.71 million bpd the month before and the lowest since September 2017, Refinitiv data show. Booming U.S. shale oil production has triggered pipeline bottlenecks in the Permian Basin and Bakken fields, pushing domestic light, sweet crude prices $10 per barrel cheaper than the global benchmark Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1. U.S. refiners have boosted their purchases in response. “They can’t process that much of the lighter crude, but if it’s cheap enough, they’ll figure out how to blend it in and use more of it,” said Sandy Fielden, an energy analyst at research firm Morningstar. U.S. crude production last week reached a record 11.7 million bpd, and nationwide refinery utilization was 90.1 percent, up from 88.8 percent a month ago, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Crude exports loaded at ports along the Gulf Coast rose to 1.9 million bpd last month from 1.7 million bpd the previous month and the highest level since June. Shipments from the Gulf Coast to Europe was the highest since May, at 457,000 bpd, Refinitiv data showed. “At a certain price, the lighter crude makes sense” for Gulf Coast refiners, said John Auers, executive vice president at consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. “If a domestic barrel is more economic to process than a foreign barrel, they’ll definitely process that domestic barrel.” (Reporting by Collin Eaton Editing by Marguerita Choy)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-crude-imports/u-s-gulf-coast-crude-imports-fall-to-1-year-low-as-exports-surge-idUKL2N1XQ1AJ,15 Nov 2018,"U.S. Gulf Coast crude oil

2018-11-15,"* British PM May battles to save Brexit deal and her job * World stocks gauge set to snap five-day losing streak * Wall St erases losses amid trade optimism * Oil rises despite potential looming supply glut (Updates with afternoon U.S. trading) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Sterling tumbled on Thursday as political developments in Britain rippled through currency, bond and equity markets, while the major U.S. stock indexes erased losses from earlier in the session helped by optimism over U.S.-China trade. Fueled by Wall Street’s reversal, a gauge of global stock markets was on track to snap a five-day streak of declines. Oil prices rose to recoup some losses from a recent steep plunge. In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight for her draft divorce deal with the European Union after the resignation of her Brexit secretary and other ministers put her strategy and her job in peril. Sterling was last trading at $1.2773, down 1.70 percent on the day, and also fell steeply against the euro. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.06 percent, while Britain’s FTSE 250 dropped 1.3 percent. “The Brexit news acted as a catalyst ... I think that what investors are acting upon is uncertainty,” said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist for Makor Capital Markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 205.23 points, or 0.82 percent, to 25,285.73, the S&P 500 gained 25.45 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,727.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.82 points, or 1.57 percent, to 7,248.21. investors said they were encouraged by recent news, including a modest inflation number perhaps leading to less aggressive rate-hike path by the Federal Reserve and that U.S. and China leaders were set to meet at a G20 summit later this month. “In terms of catalysts for the rest of the year, we have the G20 meeting and we have the Fed meeting,” said Sunitha Thomas, Regional Portfolio Advisor at Northern Trust Wealth Management. “Now that we have finished earnings, that is pretty much what everyone is focused on.” Stocks also seemed to be rising on a Financial Times report that the U.S. trade representative has told some industry executives the next tranche of tariffs on Chinese imports has been put on hold. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.59 percent, set to snap a five-session streak of losses. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.18 percent, with the euro up 0.33 percent to $1.1345. U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in October as purchases of motor vehicles and building materials surged, likely driven by recovery efforts in areas devastated by Hurricane Florence. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 3.1232 percent, from 3.12 percent late on Wednesday. Nerves among Britain government bond investors forced the country’s debt agency to accept low-ball bids for a 20-year bond at auction. Oil rose, steadying after steep recent declines as fuel stockpile declines in the United States helped offset concerns about a potentially oversupplied market next year. U.S. crude rose 0.53 percent to $56.55 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.74, up 0.94 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Josephine Mason, Helen Reid and Marc

2018-11-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee to join a key panel of independent energy regulators, who helped roll out a Department of Energy (DOE) directive to bail out aging coal and nuclear plants, told senators on Thursday he did not know if he would recuse himself if the issue reappears before the commission.   Last month Trump nominated Bernard McNamee, currently a lawyer at the DOE, to a vacant seat on the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is meant to be a politically independent office. When he was the DOE’s deputy general counsel last year, McNamee helped to role out a directive from Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize aging coal and nuclear plants for attributes including making the U.S. power grid resilient. The plan was bashed by a mix of natural gas, renewable power, and consumer advocates. FERC ultimately rejected the plan.   McNamee, a Republican, this year wrote an editorial on the virtues of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil. The piece said renewable energy like wind and solar power was important, but questioned whether they could replace other energy resources. Critics say McNamee’s participation in Perry’s directive and his editorial make him biased toward fossil fuels, a claim he rejected.  Asked at a Senate hearing on his nomination whether he would recuse himself if he is confirmed and if the resilience issue comes up again at FERC, McNamee said he was not sure. “I don’t know if anything is going to be proposed ... so I can’t say what I would or would not do,” McNamee said. “I commit I will talk with ethics counsel to find out if I need to recuse myself.”  McNamee said his “decisions will be based on the law and the facts, not politics.”  “Markets are the best way to allocate resources and set prices and I am committed to continuing FERC’s independence,” he added. Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said U.S. law dictates that McNamee should disqualify himself on the issue because he had participated in U.S. government counsel on it with the DOE.  King told McNamee he was “surprised and disappointed that you feel that you have to consult with counsel on something that’s so clear.”   Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican and chair of the Senate energy committee told McNamee that if he is confirmed, she expected him to make sure FERC was not “tipping the scales for any energy source based on a political perspective.” Reporting by Timothy Gardner",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-ferc-mcnamee/trumps-ferc-nominee-to-seek-counsel-if-coal-bailout-plan-returns-idUKL2N1XQ1DX,15 Nov 2018,"U.S. President Donald Trump's

2018-11-15,"(Reuters) - If OPEC thought the 26 percent drop in oil prices since October might rein in U.S. shale production like the last sharp drop did four years ago, it might have to think again. U.S. shale firms are more profitable than ever after a strong third quarter, according to a Reuters analysis of results for 32 independent producers. These companies are producing more efficiently, generating more cash flow and consolidating in a wave of mergers, the data show. Results at 32 independent shale explorers show nearly a third generated more cash from operations than they spent on drilling and shareholder payouts, a group including Devon Energy, EOG Resources and Continental Resources. A year ago, there were just three companies on that list.  The group’s cash flow deficit has narrowed to $945 million as U.S. benchmark crude hit $70 a barrel and production soared. The group overspent by three times as much as recently as June and was $4.92 billion in the hole a year ago, according to Reuters’ analysis of Morningstar data provided by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.          The change is evidence shale firms have moved to “harvest mode” after shareholders pressured them to rein in spending and increase payouts, said Shawn Reynolds, a portfolio manager at asset firm VanEck. “The industry is starting to do that.”    OPEC’s WORRY  While shale producers have fortified their finances, OPEC and allied producing countries this week began discussing an output cut of 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) to stem the sharp slide in crude prices. U.S. crude was trading at $57 a barrel on Thursday, down $20 from its October high. OPEC last sought to drive out shale producers by flooding the market with oil in 2014. That production free-for-all lasted nearly two years, sending crude to below $27 a barrel, but while it bloodied shale, it led the industry to become among the globe’s lowest-cost oil producers.  Now, any OPEC output cuts that lift global prices should benefit U.S. shale producers. They have become so lean they can profit on each new barrel of oil pumped from West Texas shale fields at $36 a barrel and from North Dakota’s Bakken field at $43 a barrel, according to RS Energy Group.  Rather than slowing shale production, the latest price drop could hasten industry consolidation as bigger producers snap up weaker rivals. “The small guys are going to go away” through mergers, said John Groton Jr., director of equity research at Thrivent Asset Management, which invests in shale operators. He said he believes the companies missing cash flow targets will become prime buyout candidates. “You have buyers who want to grow.” There have been several blockbuster buyouts this year, using stock instead of cash. Encana this month offered $5.5 billion in stock for Newfield Exploration Co. Concho Resources kicked off this year’s merger wave with an $8 billion all-stock deal for RSP Permian. Investment banker Tudor Pickering Holt & Co predicted another 10 shale deals worth $40 billion will surface in 2019.  Consolidation can spread costs over more production, boosting cash. Chesapeake Energy’s recent $4 billion cash-and-stock offer for WildHorse Resource Development will allow the Oklahoma City-based company to hit cash flow goals in 2020, “much sooner” than it would otherwise, Chief Executive Doug Lawler said last month.  Other shale firms are selling acreage or service arms to finance production and cover dividends. Pioneer Natural Resources this month raised $400 million from a pressure pumping unit. It will sell more assets and expects to generate more cash than it consumes next year, CEO Timothy Dove said during a third-quarter earnings call.    Not everyone thinks the historically boom-or-bust shale business will be able control spending. Moving to expand drillable reserves and raise production “is in these companies’ DNA,” said Roy Martin, analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “The future of their business hinges on more barrels coming out,” he said.  Clark Williams-Derry, director of energy finance at sustainability think tank Sightline Institute, said producers are trying to restrain spending while still pumping more oil to meet investor demands for cash flow. “It’s an industry that’s struggling to maintain production while pleasing investors,” Williams-Derry said.

2018-11-15,"OSLO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Norwegian power trader Einar Aas has reached an agreement with creditors, including Nasdaq Clearing, after his default in September forced members of the clearing house to stump up around 100 million euros ($113 million) to cover his losses. Nasdaq Commodities, which operates the Nordic power exchange, said on Thursday that Aas had agreed to sell his assets to help the clearing house and its members recover the money they had to put into a default fund. It said proceeds from the assets would be distributed to participants of the default fund on a pro rata basis, but did not estimate how much the assets might raise. One member of the clearing house, Norwegian power firm Agder Energi, disagreed with the deal, but has decided not to raise further objections, Nasdaq Commodities added. “We can confirm that a legally binding agreement for a consensual arrangement with creditors has today been finalised between Mr. Aas and his creditors, including Nasdaq Clearing,” Nasdaq Commodities said in a statement. Nasdaq Commodities and Nasdaq Clearing are both part of U.S. exchanges operator Nasdaq Group.

2018-11-15,"KIEV, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman expects to get new loans from the International Monetary Fund as early as December once parliament passes a budget of stability that refrains from making pre-election populist moves, he said on Thursday. Securing IMF assistance will also unlock loans from the World Bank and the European Union, while Groysman also said Ukraine was in negotiation with Washington for a new loan guarantee for sovereign debt. Groysman negotiated a new deal with the IMF last month aimed at keeping finances on an even keel during a choppy election period next year. The new loans are contingent on him steering an IMF-compliant budget through parliament. “This budget is a budget of stability and continuation of reforms,” Groysman said in an interview with Reuters. “This is fully consistent with our IMF programme.” “Yes. We are counting on a tranche in December,” he added, when asked about when IMF loans were expected, though he did not elaborate on the possible size of the loan. Ukraine’s government approved a draft budget in September but it will typically undergo a slew of amendments before parliament finally approves it. Groysman said a proposal to change how companies are taxed — on withdrawn capital rather than profits — had been dropped from the budget because of the IMF’s concerns. He also said he would not bow to opposition parties’ demands to reverse a recent increase in household gas tariffs, a step which his government reluctantly took in order to qualify for more IMF assistance. “Populism led to the weakness of Ukraine,” he said. “This should not be allowed.” The IMF and Kiev’s foreign allies came to Ukraine’s rescue after it plunged into turmoil following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatist rebels occupying the eastern industrial Donbass region. The United States has also sold coal to plug a domestic shortage caused by rebels taking control of mines in the east. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Ukraine this week. In response to a question on whether Ukraine would continue to buy coal from the United States and potentially also liquefied natural gas (LNG), Groysman said: “Liquefied gas is very interesting for Ukraine. We talked about the whole spectrum of our cooperation in the energy sector,” he said, adding: “As for coal, we will buy it from our international partners until we cover the domestic deficit.” Washington has also previously issued loan guarantees for Ukrainian debt. Groysman said another such guarantee was “under discussion.” (Editing by Richard Balmforth)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ukraine-primeminister/ukraine-pm-upbeat-on-imf-loan-in-december-after-budget-passes-idUKL8N1XQ7GU,15 Nov 2018,"Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr

2018-11-15,"(Adds details on run cuts, ethanol market) By Jarrett Renshaw and Michael Hirtzer Nov 15 (Reuters) - Green Plains Inc, the nation’s fourth-largest ethanol producer, has permanently shuttered a Virginia production plant and cut output at several other facilities as it tries to navigate a supply glut that has pummeled biofuel profits. Green Plains announced on Thursday that it was closing a plant in the town of Hopewell that had capacity to produce 60 million gallons annually. Thirty-one jobs will be cut, it said in a news release. With ethanol plants in Corn Belt states such as Iowa and Illinois struggling to make money, further-flung facilities have been under even more pressure as bringing in corn from far away boosts feedstock costs. Ergon BioFuels LLC, a subsidiary of privately held Ergon Inc, in September said it would permanently shut down its only ethanol plant in Mississippi, while Conestoga Energy Holdings LLC last week said it would temporarily halt ethanol output at its plant in Texas. Green Plains, whose shares were down nearly 2 percent to $16.82 in late-morning trading, had purchased the Virginia plant just three years ago for $18.25 million. The company has taken some of the most drastic measures in the industry to reduce debt and rein in production, including a recent sale of three ethanol plants to Valero Energy Corp. The measures come as ethanol prices have hit decade-year lows on flat domestic demand and a trade war with China that has left a major buyer of excess production on the sidelines. Green Plains has idled plants in Superior, Iowa; Atkison, Nebraska; Madison, Illinois, and Fairmount, Minnesota, to help deal with weak margins, two sources familiar with the plant’s operations said this month. The Fairmount plant, a key export facility, could be down for as long as four months, one of the sources said. “What you hear today, could be wrong tomorrow. We make decisions regularly to flex our production up and down, which is the main reason why we do not openly discuss our production rate at any given time,” Jim Stark, a spokesman for Green Plains, said in response to an email. Plants go idle for many reasons, such as mechanical failures and planned work, Stark said, adding that the company has not made any decisions on idling plants long-term.

Crude inventories soared 10.3 million barrels in the week to Nov. 9 to 442.1 million barrels, the highest level since early December 2017, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels. That was the biggest weekly increase since February 2017. U.S. crude production also climbed by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 11.7 million bpd, the highest on record, while net U.S. crude imports rose 268,000 bpd, the data showed. “A good chunk of the crude build occurred on the Gulf Coast, as refining activity dropped,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, referring to the region’s 5.2 million-barrel build. “Common themes are threaded through this report as in recent weeks - another SPR release and another increase to domestic production.” The U.S. Department of Energy had offered about 11 million barrels of oil for sale from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), to be delivered between Oct. 1 through Nov. 30 and those barrels have now been arriving in the market, traders said. Inventories in the SPR dropped by about 1.4 million barrels last week to the lowest level since 2004, according to EIA data. Oil prices, however, held gains after the bearish build in crude as the market focused instead on the decline in fuel stockpiles. “Obviously the headline crude build was shocking but the market is not falling apart in part due to the fact that we saw big drops in gasoline supplies ... and distillate fuels. The products are definitely supporting us right now, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Gasoline stocks fell by 1.4 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.5 million-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.6 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.7 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 1.17 million barrels, EIA said. Refinery crude runs rose by 24,000 bpd, EIA data showed.

2018-11-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain must halt a back-up power scheme aimed at avoiding electricity shortages pending a further investigation by European Union regulators, an EU court ruled on Thursday, which sent shares in UK energy companies tumbling. The judgement by the EU’s General Court annuls a decision by the European Commission, which had said Britain’s so-called power capacity market was compatible with EU state aid rules.     Britain began power capacity auctions in 2014, offering to pay providers for making supplies available at short notice, and so avoid shortages that might occur as coal plants close and low prices dissuade investors from building new power plants. However, British energy company Tempus Energy launched an appeal against the capacity market, saying it amounted to subsidies for fossil fuel generators and discriminated against technology designed to cut electricity demand during peak times. In Thursday’s judgement, the General Court said the European Commission did not carry out enough checks and that payments under the British scheme should be halted until further due diligence could be carried out. The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) department said the ruling imposes a “standstill period”, which prevents it from holding capacity auctions or making any capacity payments under existing agreements until the scheme can be approved again. Shares in British power firms SSE, Drax and Centrica, which won contracts under the scheme, fell between 5 and 7 percent, underperforming the wider FTSE 100 index, which was little changed. Greg Clark, Secretary of State for BEIS, said the judgement was a matter of procedure rather than one on the government’s policy of capacity markets. The British government is working with its European counterparts to find a swift resolution, he said at a government energy briefing in London. National Grid said it has been asked to postpone indefinitely upcoming auctions for capacity to be delivered in the winter of 2022/23 and a nearer-term one for 2019/20. The government will seek separate approval from the Commission to run a replacement nearer-term auction, while the postponed one for four winters ahead could be run in next year’s auction round, subject to Commission approval for the main capacity scheme, National Grid added. Tom Glover, chief commercial officer at RWE Generation, said the company was “deeply disappointed” by the court ruling. “There is a material negative impact for RWE and we will be reviewing our obligations under the capacity market,” he told reporters at a government energy event. Analysts at Bernstein said the Commission’s formal investigation will take time and create uncertainty for the UK power market.  “Given that a number of European countries have capacity market schemes that have no demand-side participation, we fail to see how the UK capacity market can be singled out,” they said, adding that the decision can be appealed by Britain.

2018-11-15,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - Cold weather blanketing much of the United States this week boosted spot natural gas prices for Thursday to their highest since January in several regions, while natural gas futures slid 10 percent as investors took profits after a rally that had lifted them to their highest levels in nearly four years. Front-month gas futures rose as high as $4.929 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on Wednesday, their highest since February 2014. Traders said the cold this week would force utilities to start withdrawing gas from storage caverns that are already around 16 percent below normal for this time of year, prompting concerns of possible gas shortages in some parts of the country later this winter. Next-day prices for Thursday, meanwhile, rose to their highest since January at the Henry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL benchmark in Louisiana, Dominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL in Pennsylvania and Chicago citygate NG-CG-CH-SNL. Next-day gas at the Henry Hub rose to $4.57/mmBtu, their highest since January for a fifth day in a row, due to cold weather nationally and as demand at nearby liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals rose to new highs with the start of new liquefaction trains. Cheniere Energy Inc expects new liquefaction trains at its LNG export terminals in Sabine Pass in Louisiana and Corpus Christi in Texas to enter service in the near future. Next-day prices at the Dominion South hub rose to $3.68/mmBtu, their highest since January for a seventh day in a row, with the cold weather and as more pipelines entered service in recent weeks, allowing gas trapped in the Marcellus and Utica shale to flow to the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions where prices are higher.

2018-11-15,"DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - A German administrative court on Thursday ruled that the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia must ban older diesel vehicles from parts of the nation’s industrial heartland, including a busy motorway, in the latest extension of such bans in the country.   The ban affects Gelsenkirchen and Essen, including part of the A40 motorway, which are located in the Ruhr region, one of Germany’s most densely populated areas. The ban, which will come into effect next year, follows a lawsuit brought by the DUH environmental lobby group.  It has called for a ban of diesel vehicles in various German cities, invoking legal thresholds of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air.  Scandals involving schemes to conceal the true levels of pollutant emissions from diesel cars have dealt repeated blows to the global reputation of Germany’s car industry in recent years. DUH’s lawyer Remo Klinger praised the ruling, saying that “Clean air is a human right that the state must guarantee.” Other German cities also face the risk of diesel driving bans imposed by judges, including Aachen, Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Duesseldorf and Mainz.

2018-11-15,"(Repeating without changes for wider distribution) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil market is scrambling to adjust to a deep selloff over the last several weeks, with forward prices signaling a supply glut which could upend plans for producers and traders through 2019. U.S. crude futures plunged 7 percent on Tuesday, to settle at $55.69, their lowest level this year, down from a four-year high only a month ago. Tuesday marked a 12th straight session of declines, which is the longest losing streak on record, shaking a market that was bracing for supply shortfalls just a month ago. “We were definitely in the bullish narrative for the past three months, and now we’re seeing that narrative shift,” said Michael Cohen, head of energy markets research at Barclays. “If the narrative gets unwound or undermined, so, too, does the positioning by the market.” In the biggest sign of the shift, an increasing number of later-dated futures contracts are trading at a premium to current prices. That is a signal that the market expects supply to outpace demand next year and into 2020. That trend could inhibit producers from drilling and deal a blow to shale companies, which have raked in profits as U.S. production surged to a weekly record of 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in early November. Already, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is considering a production cut to boost prices. Adding to concerns, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday that supply will outpace demand in 2019. “I think there’s a genuine shift,” one trader at a top commodities merchant said. “Everyone is talking about global oil builds in 2019.” Many traders saw $100 oil on the horizon just a month ago, but oil is now closer to $50 a barrel. U.S. production is expected to surpass the 12 million bpd milestone by mid-2019, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts. As prices fall and market structure weakens, U.S. shale producers may pare their drilling plans for 2019, said R.T. Dukes, research director for U.S. lower 48 upstream at Wood Mackenzie. “I think, instead of a big ramp-up into next year, we get flatter activity than what we might have seen otherwise,” he said. Still, any changes would take time to alter the trajectory of production, especially as the largest oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, are increasing activity in U.S. shale plays. The weakening in 2019 contracts pushes the market’s structure, or curve, more firmly into contango, where forward prices are higher than spot prices. Contango is a symptom of an oversupplied oil market or rising levels of inventories. It makes it more profitable for crude traders to store large volumes of oil for later, rather than sell for immediate use. The spread between U.S. crude futures expiring in December 2019 and December 2020 CLZ9-Z0, a popular trade in oil markets, flipped from a premium to a discount of about 42 cents on Tuesday. It is the first time the spread traded in negative territory since October 2017. U.S. crude for delivery in December 2018 plunged to trade as much as $1.43 a barrel below futures for delivery in June 2019 CLZ8-M9 last week, the widest spread on record. The December 2018 contract dropped to trade as much as $2.10 per barrel below the December 2019 CLZ8-Z9 contract last week, the widest since early 2016. A change in the market structure has ramifications for investors as well. When far-dated contracts trade below the spot price, funds and other investors benefit from what is known as “positive roll yield.” In that situation, funds holding a contract shift into the next month’s contract before it expires, profiting from buying the cheaper later-dated futures. But with those contracts now more expensive, rolling the long positions forward is less lucrative and is one reason why traders have pulled back on bullish bets.

2018-11-15,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron, hit by a slump in popularity, faces a nationwide protest this weekend over rising fuel taxes that threatens to gridlock France’s roads and show the depth of discontent with his reforms to reshape the economy. Dubbed the “yellow vest” movement, demonstrators are threatening to block motorways and access roads to some oil depots, including in Calais near the Channel Tunnel, a major passenger and freight link into Britain.  The protest is the latest confrontation between Macron and voters in the countryside and provincial cities which view the former investment banker as the representative of an urban elite out of touch with ordinary people. In 18 months in power, Macron has stared down muscular trade unions and street demonstrations as he liberalised labour laws and overhauled the heavily indebted state rail operator SNCF, unflinching in his resolve to bring economic and social renewal. He has tried to shrug off accusations he is a “president of the rich”, a tag milked by rivals after he scrapped a wealth tax. This time his administration - which appeared caught off guard by how fast the protest movement grew as word spread on social media - has sought to soothe poorer motorists. “I hear the anger, and it’s a fundamental right in our society to be allowed to express it,” Macron said in a television interview late on Wednesday.  But he added the protest movement, embraced by Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally party and receiving tentative support from other parties on the left and right, had been hijacked by opponents and their supporters bent on obstructing reforms without a clear vision of their own. The price of diesel, the most commonly used car fuel in France, at the pump increased by 20 percent in the past year to an average of 1.49 euros ($1.68)/litre, according to website www.carbu.com.  The higher taxes, approved in late 2017, started biting as oil prices surged in October though they have eased off somewhat since.  Increases in taxes on gasoline and tobacco as well as an increase to a social welfare levy before other tax cuts came into force left many voters feeling Macron’s reforms had eroded their purchasing power.  Their anger is reflected in opinion polls showing support for Macron falling to new lows of 21 percent.  The government is standing firm on the fuel tax hikes but on Wednesday announced a 500 million euro plan to help motorists with the lowest incomes, seeking to take the sting out of the protest movement. The diesel tax increases are designed to encourage drivers to switch to more environmentally-friendly automobile models, part of Macron’s “energy transition” plan.  But critics say that while the government hits people’s  wallets, it lacks a clear vision on switching to greener energy sources, citing foot-dragging by Macron’s administration on reducing France’s reliance on nuclear power. Rural voters are also angered by a speed limit reduction on countryside roads. “What do you do with the dough, aside from changing the crockery at the Elysee palace or building yourselves swimming pools?” exclaimed Brittany resident Jacline Mouraud in a Facebook post viewed more than six million times.   “If that’s what the money is used for, we might as well change, there’s no point in you staying on.”  Reporting by Sarah White; editing by Richard Lough and Marie-Louise Gumuchian",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-politics-fuel/refile-macron-braces-for-motorist-revolt-on-frances-highways-idUKL8N1XP8XE,15 Nov 2018,"President Emmanuel Macron, hit by

2018-11-15,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - When U.S. President Donald Trump asked Saudi Arabia this summer to raise oil production to compensate for lower crude exports from Iran, Riyadh swiftly told Washington it would do so. But Saudi Arabia did not receive advance warning when Trump made a U-turn by offering generous waivers that are keeping more Iranian crude in the market instead of driving exports from Riyadh’s arch-rival down to zero, OPEC and industry sources say.Angered by the U.S. move that has raised worries about over supply, Saudi Arabia is now considering cutting output with OPEC and its allies by about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) or 1.5 percent of global supply, sources told Reuters this week. “The Saudis are very angry at Trump. They don’t trust him any more and feel very strongly about a cut. They had no heads-up about the waivers,” said one senior source briefed on Saudi energy policies. Washington has said the waivers are a temporary concession to allies that imported Iranian crude and might have struggled to find other supplies quickly when U.S. sanctions were imposed on Nov. 4. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Nov. 5 that cutting Iranian exports “to zero immediately” would have shocked the market. “I don’t want to lift oil prices,” he said. A U.S. source with knowledge of the matter said: “The Saudis were going to be angry either way with the waivers, pre-briefed or even after the announcement.” A U.S. State Department official said: “We don’t discuss diplomatic communications.” The U.S. shift toward offering waivers adds to tension between the United States and Saudi Arabia, as Washington pushes for Riyadh to shed full light on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. “The Saudis feel they were completely snookered by Trump. They did everything to raise supplies assuming Washington would push for very harsh Iranian sanctions. And they didn’t get any heads up from the U.S. that Iran will get softer sanctions,” said a second source briefed on Saudi oil thinking. Saudi energy ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.     Since the summer, Riyadh has led the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers to hike supplies by over 1 million bpd to keep a lid on prices as U.S. sanctions were imposed. Brent oil had surged above $86 a barrel in October on tight supply worries, but prices have since slid to $66 on concerns about oversupply. Trump had wanted lower oil prices before the U.S. midterm elections earlier this month. Washington gave waivers in November to eight buyers to purchase Iranian oil for 180 days. This was more waivers than were initially expected. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a key Trump administration ally, wants prices at $80 or more for his economic reforms, sources familiar with Saudi thinking say. “The waivers were totally unexpected, especially after calls to raise output. A few people are upset,” said a senior Gulf oil source familiar with the discussions among OPEC and its allies on output policy. While the United States set a time limit for the waivers, it did not tell the eight recipients how much oil they could buy and has not eased payment restrictions, complicating purchases. Iran’s oil exports are expected to drop sharply to about 1 million bpd in November from a peak of 2.8 million bpd earlier this year. Although output is expected to recover from December thanks to waivers, it is still not clear by how much. Riyadh’s concern is to avoid the kind of oversupply in the market that led to a price collapse in 2014 to below $30. But the lack of clarity about the level of Iran’s supplies makes it tough for Saudi Arabia to work out appropriate production levels, especially after Russia raised output steeply in recent months and has said it wanted to produce more in 2019. Saudi Arabia would need to convince Russia to join in any move for new supply cuts. “First the Saudis let oil prices rise to $86 per barrel and then flooded the market. Can they now cut back enough going into a seasonally weak time of the year? Without Russia it won’t be credible,” said Gary Ross, CEO of Black Gold investors. Saudi Arabia must also contend with rising U.S. production that has hit record levels above 11 million bpd and is set to climb further next year. U.S. exports could surge from the second part of 2019 when new pipeline infrastructure opens. Rapidan Energy Group said it saw a supply glut now lasting much more than just a few months in 2019. “Now that the market has correctly priced weaker-than-anticipated Iran sanctions and much bigger inventory builds next year, we wish to emphasize that ‘OPEC plus’ officials face more than a single-year supply tsunami in 2019,” Rapidan said.

2018-11-15,"* Sterling tumbles a cent after Brexit deal hopes crumble * Asia rose overnight on U.S.-China trade hopes * Oil nudges higher for second day after 12-day losing streak * Dollar gets going after soft start, Wall Street seen edging high * Bunds rally, Italian bond yields dip as budget remains in focus By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Sterling tumbled and the rest of Europe’s share markets groaned on Thursday after a long-awaited Brexit agreement was thrown into chaos as Britain’s chief negotiator for the deal quit just hours after it had been unveiled. Up until that point markets had looked relatively calm. Asia had cheered news that China and the United States were back in contact about their trade dispute, and oil was inching up again having halted a record losing streak. But then came the hammer blow with Brexit minister Dominic Raab quitting in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal for leaving the European Union. “No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,” he said in his resignation letter. Cue a sterling meltdown. The currency slumped a full 2 cents to $1.2750 and though that made the FTSE stronger — a weaker pound makes life easier for exporters on the index — big UK banks the rest of Europe sank swiftly into the red. “The reaction is sterling shows that the chance of no Brexit deal has spiked,” said Tim Graf, Head of Macro Strategy for EMEA at State Street Global Markets. “It also introduces thoughts of a leadership challenge (for British Prime Minister Theresa May) which seems likely now.” The turmoil also boosted demand for safe-haven German government bonds. Ten-year yields on what is regarded as one of the safest assets in the world, fell over three basis points to 0.36 percent — its lowest in over two weeks. UK government bonds saw a rush of demand too with the reflex dive for cover and the sight of state owned bank RBS stocks down almost 9 percent, drove the biggest fall in 5-year yields since just after the June 2016 Brexit vote. EU leaders had said they would meet on Nov. 25 to endorse the divorce deal, but May now faces the much more perilous struggle of getting parliament to approve what was agreed. “We are basically trading the headlines.” said Ned Rumpeltin European Head of Currency Strategy at TD Securities in London. “I think a leadership challenge is imminent.” Investors were also starting to look ahead to U.S. trading where futures were pointing to a modestly higher start as forecast topping earnings from Walmart provided a welcome appetiser ahead of U.S. retail sales later. In the commodity markets, where Brexit may be a sideshow but turbulence is still acute after a 12-day losing streak was set this week, the mood was much calmer. U.S. oil futures steadied at $56.35 a barrel, after a slight bounce overnight. Brent was up 0.4 percent at $66.42. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had also ended up 0.8 percent having fallen the previous day as the sharp slide in oil prices had heightened anxiety about the global growth outlook. Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.8 percent on the China-U.S. communications, while Australian stocks inched up 0.05 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.2 percent. “While it’s difficult to pin-point a specific event for the risk-off move, recent themes appear to be keeping markets cautious include oil’s recent plummet, Apple’s fall, U.S. political gridlock, China’s slowing growth, tightening liquidity, a hawkish Fed, earnings peak, Italian jitters, and Brexit uncertainty,” wrote economists at ANZ. The S&P 500 had fallen for a fifth straight day overnight too, with financial stocks hit by fears of tighter regulations once the Democratic Party takes control of the House of Representatives. U.S. equities have also been pressured by concerns that earnings growth might be peaking, trade tensions and a slowing global economy - factors that had triggered a rout in riskier assets in October. “If U.S. stocks are to bounce back, economic indicators will be key,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “Focus will be on today’s U.S. retail sales data, which will provide a view of how private consumption -the main component of economic growth- is faring.” U.S. retail sales for October will be released at 1330 GMT.

2018-11-15,"* Partnership hopes to use the design for UK plant * Assessment process expected to take around four years (Adds comment from EDF Energy) By Susanna Twidale LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The first Chinese-designed atomic reactor for use in Britain moved a step closer to fruition on Thursday as the UK nuclear regulator said it had completed the second stage of its assessment of the technology. General Nuclear Services, an industrial partnership between China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN) IPO-CGNP.HK and French utility EDF, hopes to use the design at a nuclear plant planned to be built at Bradwell in Essex, eastern England. CGN intends to make a number of investments in Britain’s nuclear power sector, most notably the new Hinkley Point C project in southwest England. Britain’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said the Chinese HPR1000 reactor had completed stage two of its generic design assessment (GDA) - the formal process for approving a new reactor. The four-stage assessment process is expected to take around four years in total and was started around two years ago. The project will now move to stage three of the process. “The regulators have not identified at this stage of the GDA process any fundamental safety, security or environmental issues that would prevent the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation,” the ONR said in a statement. EDF Energy said the approval is a “key step” for a new nuclear power station at Bradwell, which will use a British version of the HPR1000 reactor following full approval. However, the project is still in an early pre-planning stage, which will involve years of investigative work and public consultations before detailed proposals are produced to allow a planning application to be made, the company added. Britain needs to fill an electricity supply gap in the next decade. Many of its ageing nuclear plants are due to close by 2030 and the government plans to shut its coal plants by 2025 to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices. Last week, Japan’s Toshiba Corp said it would scrap a proposed nuclear plant project at Moorside, in northwest England, after failing to find an investment partner.

2018-11-15,"* Russia pumped 11.41 mln bpd in Oct, a post-Soviet high * Saudi Arabia proposed Oct level as reference for combined cut * Moscow wants to avoid any cuts as its output grows - sources By Vladimir Soldatkin and Olesya Astakhova MOSCOW, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Russia wants to stay out of any oil-production cuts being touted by some of its partners in an OPEC-led supply pact, two high-ranking Russian sources told Reuters. Worried by a drop in oil prices due to slowing demand and record supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is talking about a policy U-turn just months after increasing production. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday avoided giving a direct answer on whether production should be limited, but said he had discussed the situation in global oil markets with U.S. President Donald Trump. “We need to be very accurate here, each word matters,” Putin told reporters in Singapore. “But the fact that the cooperation (with OPEC) is needed is obvious and we will cooperate.” This week, Trump said he hoped Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC would not cut production. Putin said an oil price of around $70 per barrel suited Russia. A steep slide in prices has surprised many oil market participants. Brent crude has fallen from a four-year high of $86 a barrel in early October to $66 as of Thursday. Just weeks ago, some trading firms were talking of $100 oil. “I think (oil) production should not be lowered. Yes, we have done this in the past but this was not the right systematic approach,” a senior Russian government source said. “Oil production in Russia has been on the rise in recent years, by around 100,000 barrels per day each year, and it will continue to do so in future.” Earlier this week, three sources familiar with the issue said OPEC and its partners were discussing a proposal to cut oil output by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), although Russia may not be on board for such a large reduction. Another source familiar with Russian thinking said Moscow may support smaller cuts, most likely by other producers. “We think 1 million bpd (cuts) is more realistic, not 1.4 million bpd ... But who is going to do this is another question,” the source said. Putin said last month that Russia was able to add another 200,000–300,000 bpd to its production. Russia pumped 11.41 million bpd in October, a post-Soviet high. October’s level was proposed by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih as the reference point for any cut. Russia’s October level was around 460,000 bpd more than the 10.947 million bpd it had initially been bound to produce under the supply pact agreed with OPEC and other allies. A small reduction from the October level would be a “win-win” for Moscow, the second source said. Alternatively, Russia may propose not to increase output further, instead of a cut, the source said. Saudi-led OPEC and a group of non-OPEC nations, dominated by Russia, have been cooperating to limit oil supply since the start of 2017. They partially unwound their reduction in June after pressure from Trump, who wanted lower oil prices. The producers, known informally as “OPEC+”, will convene in the first week of December in Vienna to decide further steps. Another indication of the likelihood of any Russian output cut can be gleaned from the head of Kremlin-controlled energy giant Rosneft, Putin ally Igor Sechin. He eschewed a direct response on Wednesday on whether curbs were needed, saying oil prices were adjusting after being hit by initial uncertainty about production in Iran, which later benefited from export waivers from U.S. sanctions. “It (the oil price) is already growing,” he said, as Brent rebounded from a steep sell-off the previous day. “I believe that this uncertainty which affected the oil price was largely due to Iran. Now everything is being adjusted.” Rosneft, which accounts for 40 percent of Russian oil production, plans to raise its liquid hydrocarbon output further next year, to 241 million tonnes, or 4.8-4.9 million bpd, from 4.73 million bpd in the third quarter. Another large Russian oil producer, Gazprom Neft, is ready to lift output by a further 20,000-30,000 bpd this year and by 50,000 bpd next year. The head of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, voiced opposition this week to any cut. Surging U.S. production is a headache for OPEC+. The country’s crude output is expected to average 12.06 million bpd in 2019, passing 12 million bpd sooner than expected on surging shale supply, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said this month. “U.S. oil production will soon plateau. It can’t grow indefinitely,” the Russian government source said. In the previous round of global production cuts, Russian oil companies first opposed the move but then relented under orders from Putin. The Russian Energy Ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for a comment.

2018-11-15,"MELBOURNE, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Australia has readied its stretched power grid to cope with a hotter-than-normal summer, with extra electricity supply lined up for the system in case of disruptions, the energy market operator said in a statement on Friday. This is the second year the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has taken extra steps to prepare for summer by beefing up power reserves to offset intermittent wind and solar generators and outages at ageing coal-fired plants. Blackouts hit the country’s southeastern states in 2016 and 2017, the worst of which hit the entire state of South Australia and shut top global miner BHP’s Olympic Dam copper mine for two weeks, costing it $105 million. “The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting a hotter and drier summer, which - coupled with other risks we have identified - suggests we have a challenging summer awaiting us,” AEMO Chief Executive Audrey Zibelman said. Australian power demand typically soars in the southern hemisphere summer as households and businesses crank up air conditioning. At the same time, generation, transmission and distribution networks can be hit by bushfires and storms. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said in a seasonal forecast on Thursday that the summer will be hotter than normal. “Warmer-than-average days and nights are likely for almost all of Australia for December to February,” it said. AEMO said in August the states of Victoria and South Australia were most at risk for outages this summer, with some threat in the most populous state of New South Wales, where drought has depleted hydropower dams. To help prevent blackouts, the operator has secured 930 megawatts (MW) of reserve power, in part by making agreements with some energy users to curb use when supplies are tight. “AEMO is confident the plans we have made ... have appropriately equipped us to tackle any unforeseen events the upcoming summer might bring,” Zibelman said in the statement. Last summer, lining up and activating reserve supplies cost the market operator A$52 million ($38 million), which it then passed on in fees to customers in South Australia and Victoria. Costs for the reserves are expected to fall this year, AEMO said, partly because it has not had to line up as much back-up supply as last year, as 2,100 MW of new generation capacity has come onto the market over the past year. Australia’s drought is not expected to impact power generation this summer, AEMO said. $1 = $1.3746 Australian dollars

2018-11-15,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 15 (Reuters) - There was something for everyone in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) latest world energy outlook, but supporters of coal, renewables, and oil and gas are all likely to take away the wrong messages. The comprehensive report, released on Nov. 13, outlined an energy future where natural gas overtakes coal by 2030 to become the world’s second-largest energy source. There was positive news for renewables as well, with the agency forecasting that the sector would overtake coal in power generation by 2040 with a share of just over 40 percent. Even if this sounded like bad news for coal, the IEA still believed that use of the high-polluting fuel will remain largely flat over the forecast period as gains in Asia ex-China are offset by declines in Europe and North America. If this forecast is correct, it means coal-exporting countries focused on Asia, such as Australia, Indonesia and South Africa, can look forward to years of solid demand. There were two caveats in the report, however, that show the reality of the next two decades of global energy consumption could potentially be quite different from the forecasts. The first was that carbon emissions continue to grow under the IEA’s main scenario on a “slow upward trend” to 2040, which will be a “trajectory far out of step with what scientific knowledge says will be required to tackle climate change.” Following on from that thought was an acknowledgement that government policies across the world will drive the future of energy production and consumption. “Government policies and preferences will play a crucial role in shaping where we go from here,” the IEA said. It’s here that the tide would appear to be shifting in favour of stronger action to mitigate climate change, especially in countries such as China and India where energy demand is expected to grow strongly. The world’s two most populous nations both battle air pollution - largely blamed on burning coal for both power and industry - as well as rising vehicle emissions as the emerging middle class buys more cars. China already has stringent policies in place to lower air pollution over winter, such as closing down steelmaking and aluminium plants and switching residential heating to natural gas from coal. India is probably not too far behind, given that its capital New Delhi is now more polluted than Beijing. While there are governments and leaders that deny climate change, such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, they are becoming exceptions rather than the rule. The risks to the IEA scenario appear to be stacked in favour of a faster-than-forecast adoption of renewable energy, mainly at the expense of coal and natural gas in power generation, and of crude oil for transportation. The trend of the past decade has been coal losing favour as renewables and natural gas expand their market share. The natural gas industry has been quite happy to target coal, bolstered by the fact it is less polluting and increasingly available, especially after the shale gas boom in the United States and the subsequent massive investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) there, and in places like Australia. The risk to the gas industry is that in its glee to kill off coal, it isn’t seeing renewables in the rearview mirror. The September GasTech event in Barcelona was a case in point. This was the gas industry’s largest annual gathering and featured dozens of speakers from the major players. The standout theme of the conference was the absolute confidence the natural gas and LNG industries have in their future, and that they are not just a transition fuel between coal and renewables, but are a permanent part of the energy landscape. The 53-page report on the event and its various sessions mentioned the word “renewables” only three times. Solar and wind didn’t appear in the document at all. Climate change was mentioned just once, and only in relation to limiting emissions from methane leakage. The report gives the impression that the natural gas industry is largely ignoring the threat posed to its growth by renewables, just as coal once ignored the threat posed by natural gas, renewables and environmental activists. One of the common notions in the natural gas industry is that the fuel is a great fit with the more intermittent renewables such as wind and solar. But there seems to be little effort on the industry’s part to seriously partner with the renewables sector to ensure that together they dominate the future of electricity generation. The main risk from the IEA report is that all energy players see in it what they want to see, rather than viewing it as only one possible future out of many.

2018-11-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is likely to leave the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) after Brexit and set up its own equivalent system, UK government documents published late Wednesday show. That would mean Britain sticking to its international obligations to cut carbon emissions and would avoid UK firms gaining a competitive advantage, but could hit the price of EU carbon permits as Britain is currently such a big buyer.  London and Brussels agreed on Wednesday a draft deal over the terms of Britain leaving the bloc on March 29. That included a transitional period until Dec. 31, 2020, meaning Britain would likely remain in the ETS until then.  The documents showed Britain would, after Brexit, continue to take the necessary measures to meet its commitments under the international Paris Climate Agreement. These include implementing a system of carbon pricing at least as effective as that currently in place under EU law, “establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community,” the documents said.     Britain is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in Europe and its utilities and industry are among the largest buyers of permits in the ETS, which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit. As Britain is such a big buyer of ETS permits, analysts have said Britain’s exit from the scheme would likely hit the price of permits. On Thursday, the benchmark European carbon contract was down more than 5 percent at 18.68 euros/tonne. Britain’s carbon price is currently made up of two levies, a domestic carbon tax set at 18 pounds ($23) per tonne, paid by electricity generators on top of obligations under the ETS, which forces companies to surrender one carbon permit for every tonne of CO2 they emit. In a separate document, on Britain’s future relationship with the EU, London said it would consider “cooperation on carbon pricing by linking a United Kingdom national greenhouse gas emissions trading system with the Union’s Emissions Trading System.” Industry group the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) welcomed Britain’s intention to use a trading scheme for carbon pricing rather than a tax. “A market would bring the benefits of being able to guarantee the delivery of internationally agreed climate targets at lowest cost,” said IETA EU Policy Director Simon Henry. Prime Minister Theresa May faces a battle to get the draft Brexit deal approved by British lawmakers, and it could yet fail after two senior ministers quit over the deal’s terms. Without a Brexit deal, Britain would automatically leave the ETS and replace its costs with a carbon tax set at 16 pounds a tonne.

2018-11-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to set up a side-event promoting fossil fuels at the annual U.N. climate talks next month, repeating a strategy that infuriated global-warming activists during last year’s talks, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. As with the 2017 gathering in Bonn, Germany, the administration plans to highlight the benefits of technologies that more efficiently burn fuels including coal, the sources said. This year’s talks in Katowice, Poland - located in a mining region that is among the most polluted in Europe - are intended to hammer out a rule book to the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil-fuel era this century by spurring a trillion-dollar transition to cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind power.  Even as the Trump administration aims to promote energy strategies that could detract from those international goals, it also plans to let State Department officials continue negotiating the climate accord - a recognition that the next U.S. president may drop the nation’s opposition to the pact.  “The White House seems to have taken the view that it’s important to let technocrats complete the work of the rule book. It’s in the U.S. national interest to be at the table and see an outcome that emphasizes transparency, holds countries accountable,” said one of the sources, who is familiar with State Department plans. The White House and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment. The United States, the world’s top oil and gas producer, is the only country to have announced its intention to formally withdraw from the Paris accord.  The administration’s resistance has come against a backdrop of increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about the threats posed by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. The panel will come less than two months after the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a report that the world’s use of coal for generating power will need to be nearly eliminated by mid-century – to between 1 and 7 percent of the global mix, from around 40 percent now - to help prevent deadly droughts, storms and floods brought on by climate change. “Quite frankly, the U.S. is the only party to the convention that appears to be willing to push a rational discussion on the role of cleaner, more efficient fossil (fuels) and the role of civilian nuclear energy,” said one of the sources, who is involved in the planning of the event for Katowice, likely to be held on Dec. 10. The source, who did not want to be named due to the sensitive nature of the issue, said the event will be dominated by proponents of coal and natural gas and likely advanced nuclear power, too. The panel will also likely feature a U.S. Energy Department representative. At this point plans do not include a renewable power industry representative, the source said.  The event is expected to be led by Wells Griffith, Trump’s international energy and climate adviser, the sources added. Griffith’s main energy policy experience involves a year at a political job at the Department of Energy and helping to set up a deal last year to supply Ukraine with U.S. coal after the country lost control of mines to Russian-backed separatists. TWO-TIERED APPROACH Trump last year announced his intent to leave the Paris agreement, calling it harmful to the U.S. economy and casting doubt on the climate science underpinning the accord.  As per U.N. rules, Trump’s administration will not be able to leave the pact until a day after the 2020 presidential election, and U.S. officials recognize that finishing the rule book and making sure developing countries such as China are held to verifiable emissions cuts are in the national interest.  Last year, the fossil fuels event set up by the White House drew widespread protest and condemnation from climate activists. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote on Twitter that “Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.” At the same time, 40 career officials from the State Department and other agencies continued their work on the Paris pact’s rule book. U.S. envoys to the Bonn talks were viewed by their counterparts as constructive and helpful, feeding hopes that the United States could eventually be drawn back into the accord, a possibility that Trump has held open.  But much has changed since last year. Several Trump administration officials who supported keeping the United States in the Paris pact, although under different terms, have left the administration. They include top economic adviser Gary Cohn, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and climate and energy adviser George David Banks. Now, economic adviser Larry Kudlow and national security adviser John Bolton are opponents of the Paris agreement, and Banks has been replaced by Griffith. Ex-CIA director Mike Pompeo, a vocal critic of efforts to combat global warming by past U.S. administrations, has become Secretary of State, replacing former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who supported U.S. participation in the Paris agreement.  That places Trump’s team more squarely behind his “energy dominance” agenda of boosting U.S. fossil fuel output and exports, in part by promoting low-emission technology for fossil fuels to other nations. The Energy Department has touted technologies including small scale “modular” coal plants that could burn the fuel more efficiently and step in when clouds and calm weather limit solar and wind power. Environmentalists should not get excited that any State Department cooperation in Poland signals the Trump administration is eyeing a return to the Paris agreement, one of the sources said. “It’s making sure U.S. interests are paramount, nothing more, nothing less.”  Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-accord-trump/exclusive-at-u-n-climate-talks-trump-team-plans-sideshow-on-coal-idUKL2N1XO221,15 Nov 2018,"The Trump administration

2018-11-15,"BEIJING, Nov 15 (Reuters) - PetroChina will merge its wholesale natural gas sales unit with retail provider Kunlun Energy to shore up profits though the move worries independent gas sellers that fear the combination will create a monopoly. PetroChina announced the restructuring internally last week to merge PetroChina Natural Gas Sales Company, the country’s largest natural gas wholesaler, with Kunlun Energy Co Ltd , said three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The three sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. A spokesman with China National Petroleum Corp, parent of PetroChina, said he could not immediately confirm the restructuring. Hong Kong-listed Kunlun operates Petrochina’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminals and distributes gas to households and factories. PetroChina Natural Gas Sales Company markets the state-owned company’s domestic gas production, imports of pipeline gas from Turkmenistan and Myanmar, and LNG shipped in from Qatar and Australia. But the firm, which supplies 70 percent of China’s gas, has suffered losses in its import business as the global prices it pays are often above state regulated domestic prices. In the first nine months of 2018, PetroChina booked a net loss of nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.88 billion) on gas imports compared with net losses of 16.99 billion yuan during the same period a year earlier. Kunlun during the first six months of 2018 reported net profit of 5.04 billion yuan, up 1.4 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to its financial report. “This shall boost PetroChina’s lagging gas retail business and cut heavy losses at the wholesale department,” said one of the three executives. On Nov. 6, Kunlun released a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange discussing “Natural Gas Business Development Strategies” that states PetroChina’s wholesale and retail sales businesses will be operated independently. The statement adds that as of the date of the announcement Kunlun has no intention to transfer any PetroChina assets in connection with the strategy. Kunlun did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on the restructuring sent after business hours. Still, the restructuring worries smaller independent firms such as China Resources Gas Group, China Gas Holdings and ENN Energy Holdings that are fearful the move could squeeze supplies in a fast growing market and create a monopoly wholesaler. “(It will) dramatically alter the market structure as PetroChina will no doubt prioritize Kunlun as its top customer at the expense of other buyers,” said another of the executives, who is with an independent gas distributor. The move is Petrochina’s response to a government plan to create a national gas pipeline company by consolidating the country’s trunk pipeline assets of which PetroChina controls nearly 80 percent. “The integration means Kunlun will receive support from the supply side, and vice versa the sales group will have a deeper penetration into the retail including city gas distribution, gas refilling stations,” said the third source. Nearly 30 provincial wholesale operations of the gas sales company will be merged with the similar number of provincial outlets under Kunlun, the sources said.

2018-11-15,"(Adds Equinor comments, share price) OSLO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor has bought a 9.7-percent stake in solar energy producer Scatec Solar , raising its ownership to 10 percent, the state-controlled energy firm said on Thursday. Oil and gas firms are rushing to invest in renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprint in the wake of the 2016 Paris Agreement and as falling costs have made solar and wind power competitive with other energy sources. “The investment in Scatec Solar will increase Equinor’s exposure to a fast growing renewable sector, further complementing Equinor’s portfolio with profitable solar energy,” Equinor said in a statement. “This is in line with our strategy to develop into a broad energy company,” it added. It paid 700 million Norwegian crowns ($82.55 million) for the stake, corresponding to about 63.5 crowns per share, a premium of 4.8 percent over Wednesday’s closing price on the Oslo stock market. Equinor said the investment was made with a “long term perspective,” declining to say whether it planned to increase it further in the future. “This is the level that we are comfortable to have. We never comment on investment plans,” said an Equinor spokesman. Shares in Scatec Solar were trading 11.2 percent higher by 1000 GMT. In partnership with Scatec, Equinor entered its first solar development project in 2017 in Brazil, followed by a second joint project in Argentina in June 2018. Scatec Solar operates plants with an installed capacity of 357 megawatt (MW) and has another 1,057 MW under construction. The Equinor spokesman said the company supported Scatec Solar’s current strategy and will not seek a seat on its board. Equinor has also invested heavily in offshore wind turbine projects. Equinor has declined to comment on its future investment plans in solar. “We will continue to build our position within the renewable energy, we don’t want to give any indications of what business opportunities we are looking at,” the spokesman said. Its peers in Europe have invested more in solar. Anglo-Dutch Shell acquired a 43.9 percent stake in the U.S. solar power developer Silicon Ranch Corporation for $217 million in January, following BP’s acquisition of a 43 percent stake in Lightsource, Europe’s largest solar developer, for $200 million in 2017.

2018-11-15,"* 15-20 LNG tankers floating in Asian waters * Most float off Singapore, some Malaysia, S China Sea * Last time tankers used for storage was in 2014 -trade By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Tankers storing liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asian waters have more than doubled in number since late October as traders have been caught off guard by warmer-than-expected temperatures that have capped demand and pulled down prices. Spot market demand ahead of winter has been slowed by the forecasts for warmer temperatures this year in North Asia, with onshore storage tanks filling up. “People were expecting China to buy as much as last year in the spot market, but the weather so far has been quite mild and I don’t think they were anticipating that,” a Singapore-based LNG trader said. LNG prices LNG-AS last year climbed steadily from mid-July to January as China’s gasification push for winter heating sparked higher imports. But this year, buyers from the world’s top natural gas importer - via pipeline and tanker - have been spreading out their purchases more. Now about 15 to 20 LNG tankers holding at least 2 million cubic metres of LNG worth more than $400 million at spot market prices are floating in Asian waters, industry sources said. That’s up from a half-dozen tankers being used for storage in Asia three weeks ago. Globally, the number of such LNG tankers stands at 20 to 30, one of the sources said. This has helped to drive up LNG tanker rates to record highs, the ship broking and trading sources said. Most of the traders storing cargoes in the tankers are “seeking better winter pricing ... holding out against rising charter rates to achieve an acceptable profit on the molecules,” shipbroking firm Braemar said in a weekly LNG report last week. This is “creating pain for those producers who are still forced to lift cargoes from terminals which are approaching tank tops.” Refinitiv Eikon data shows at least eight tankers storing LNG in Singapore waters while two were in Malaysian waters. More than five vessels that had been storing LNG are now on the move or have discharged the cargoes, the data shows. Storing LNG on tankers out at sea, unlike crude oil, is generally seen as a risky bet, given the high costs of storage and the fact that cargoes degrade over time by evaporating. As with other commodities, the play is typically triggered by a market structure known as contango, in which prices for immediate delivery are cheaper than later months. The contango, which was at about $1 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) last month, has since narrowed to about 50 cents or less, traders said. The last time LNG was put into floating storage on a large scale was in 2014, though the number of tankers was lower, the Singapore LNG trader said. Not all the cargoes are stranded without buyers. Some of the companies likely secured the tankers during the summer when shipping rates were far lower, and stored them in anticipation of a pick-up in prices, traders said.

2018-11-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Premier Oil (PMO.L) said on Thursday it expected full-year production to come in at the low end of a previously announced 80,000 to 85,000 barrels per day range.  The company, which has been focussing on cutting debts, also said its debt pile would shrink to $2.4 billion by the year-end. Premier’s debt reduction this year was broadly in line with its target of $300-400 million and Chief Executive Tony Durrant told Reuters he saw net debt reduction next year in that range as well. When asked when Premier might reinstate dividends, Durrant said net debt below $2 billion would feel “comfortable” but that payouts would have to be weighed against investment in growth in Mexico, the Falkland Islands and Indonesia. The company has not paid dividends since 2014. Premier is starting drilling later this month to appraise its resources in Mexico’s huge Zama field and expects results on the extent and depth of the reservoir as well as flow test data in around a hundred days, Durrant said. “Premier remains our preferred Brent oil price play providing leverage to strong oil prices through debt reduction and accelerated use of UK tax losses,” RBC said in a note. Premier has hedged around 30 percent of its output at a price of $69.1 per barrel for the first half of next year and $72 per barrel for the second half, it said. On the production outlook BMO analysts said: “The headline is a reduction to production guidance ... as Premier is likely to be more impacted by a volatile commodity backdrop although at our long-run Brent forecast of $70/bbl, the shares look good value.” Premier’s shares were down 1 percent by 0923 GMT.

2018-11-15,"(Adds details, quotes, background) By Bate Felix PARIS, Nov 15 (Reuters) - France has enough power supply for the winter but needs to be vigilant if there is a cold spell from mid-January through to the end of February when supply is expected to be tight due to nuclear outages, grid operator RTE said on Thursday. RTE said in its winter and medium-term outlook that up to 2020, electricity demand and supply is expected to be balanced but without any margin, due to the expected shutdown of some thermal power generation units. RTE’s director of operations Jean-Paul Roubin said analysis showed that under normal weather conditions, demand was expected to remain stable with peak demand seen at around 85 gigawatts (GW), the same level as last winter. Roubin, speaking at a news conference, said French nuclear power supply, which accounts for over 75 percent of its electricity needs, was expected to increase this winter compared with last year due to fewer outages, while hydro power supply was also expected to be stable. But between mid-January and the end of February supply could be tight if there is a prolonged cold spell because EDF has planned maintenance outages at five nuclear reactors. Two reactors could be halted for several weeks. This situation could lead to after market measures including calls to industrial users and consumers to curb consumption, increased imports from neighbours and lowering voltage on the network. After winter 2020, France will have enough supply to potentially allow it to gradually shut down five coal power units in Cordemais, Havre, Gardanne and Saint-Avold, and also the Fessenheim nuclear power plant under certain conditions.

Griveaux told France Inter radio that the delay to the bill, which was originally due in the autumn, had occurred because the government wanted to first ready another bill dealing with legislation on financing railway and road projects. The energy bill is due to set a calendar for the opening and closing down of power plants over the next decade. The controversial part of the law is the future of nuclear reactors operated by state-owned utility EDF. The previous administration committed to reducing France’s dependence on nuclear energy for electricity to 50 percent from 75 percent, which would require the closure of some reactors.

2018-11-15,"PARADISE, Calif., Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. National Guard troops scoured the ruins of the town of Paradise on Thursday for any sign of 130 people still missing in  California’s deadliest wildfire on record as authorities said the death toll had risen to 56. The “Camp Fire” blaze obliterated the Sierra foothills town of Paradise, once home to 27,000 people, last Thursday. Most of those still missing in and around town, which lies about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, are above the age of 65. The surface area of the fire had grown to 135,000 acres (55,000 hectares) by of Wednesday evening, even as diminished winds and rising humidity helped firefighters shore up containment lines around more than a third of the perimeter. Still, the ghostly expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with twisted wreckage and debris made a strong impression on Governor Jerry Brown, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and other officials who toured the devastation on Wednesday. “This is one of the worst disasters I’ve seen in my career, hands down,” Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told reporters in Chico. “It looks like a war zone. It is a war zone,” Brown said. After visiting some of California’s earlier wildfire zones in August, Zinke blamed “gross mismanagement of forests” because of timber harvest restrictions that he said were supported by “environmental terrorist groups.” Pressed by reporters on Wednesday, Zinke demurred. “Now is really not the time to point fingers,” he said. “It is a time for America to stand together.” The blaze, fueled by thick, drought-desiccated scrub, has capped two back-to-back catastrophic wildfire seasons in California that scientists largely attribute to prolonged drought they say is symptomatic of climate change. Lawyers for some of the victims claimed in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday that lax equipment maintenance by an electric utility was the proximate cause of the fire, which officially remains under investigation. The Butte County disaster coincided with a flurry of blazes in Southern California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which has killed at least two people, destroyed more than 500 structures and displaced about 200,000 people west of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said the body of a possible third victim was found. Cal Fire officials said that blaze was 52 percent contained as of Wednesday night. In Butte County, the search for more human remains kicked into high gear as a National Guard contingent of 50 military police officers joined dozens of search-and-recovery workers and at least 22 cadaver dogs, Sheriff Kory Honea said. The remains of eight more fire victims were found on Wednesday, raising the official number of fatalities to 56 - far exceeding the previous record from a single wildfire in California history - 29 people killed by the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles in 1933. The Camp Fire also stands as one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. More than 80 people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August of 1910. Butte County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Megan McMann said the list of 130 missing would fluctuate from day to day as more names are added and others are removed, either because they turn up safe or end up identified among the dead. Sheriff Honea invited relatives of the missing to provide DNA samples to compare against samples taken from newly recovered remains in hopes of speeding up identification of the dead. He said it was possible some of the missing might never be found. Authorities attributed the magnitude of casualties to the staggering speed with which the fire struck Paradise. Wind-driven flames roared through town so swiftly that residents were forced to flee for their lives. Some victims were found in or around the burned-out wreckage of their vehicles.

2018-11-15,"OSLO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Finland could in future receive gas from Norway via a network of pipes being planned through the Baltic countries and Poland, as part of an effort to reduce its dependency on gas imports from Russia. Helsinki and Tallinn are constructing a gas pipeline under the Gulf of Finland to Estonia, called Balticconnector and with a capacity to transport 7.2 million cubic metres of gas per day. “The plan is for Finland to get fully connected to the European gas network and access gas from other sources such as ... Norwegian gas,” Herkko Plit, CEO of Baltic Connector Oy, one of the two owners of the planned pipeline, told Reuters. Balticconnector would allow such imports of piped gas via a pipeline between Poland and Lithuania called GIPL, due to be completed by December 2021, which in turn could be connected to the planned Baltic Pipe linking Poland to Norway, via Denmark. The investment decision for the Baltic Pipe, a project with an estimated value of 2.1 billion euros ($2.37 billion), is expected by its partners, Polish and Danish transmission system operators Gaz-System and Energinet, by the end of 2018. Plit was speaking by phone from Warsaw, where he was meeting the partners of the Baltic Pipe to present information about the Balticconnector. Finland and eastern European countries have in recent years tried to reduce their dependence on Russian gas, partly over concerns that Moscow could use its gas monopoly for political influence, after a similar spat with Ukraine about a decade ago. Finland imports all its gas from Russia, with gas accounting for five percent of its total energy needs. Balticconnector’s commercial operations are scheduled to start on January 1, 2020. It is co-owned by the Finnish natural gas transmission system operators, Baltic Connector Oy, and its Estonia counterpart, Elering AS.

2018-11-15,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to text) * Oil production to fall to 1 mln bpd by 2023 without new projects * Angola plans to tender oil blocks in 2019 * Total to drill first exploration well in four years By Stephen Eisenhammer LUANDA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - On Saturday, nearly two decades after securing the initial rights, Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanné was in Luanda to snip the ribbon on a $16 billion oil project. It’s not clear when he, or his peers, will be cracking open the bubbly in Angola again. Without another mega-project like Total’s Kaombo on the horizon and fields getting old, Africa’s second-largest crude producer is facing a steep decline unless it can revive exploration in what was once one of the world’s most exciting offshore prospects. Sonangol, the state oil company, is negotiating contracts for new blocks with oil majors and Angola plans to hold an auction next year, the first tender for exploration rights since 2011. It’s a race against time for a country where oil accounts for 95 percent of exports and around 70 percent of government revenues. Luck will also play a part, as it always does in exploration where finding oil can never be guaranteed. But without new projects, output could fall to 1 million barrels per day by 2023, according to the oil ministry. That is down from 1.5 million today and nearly half of what Angola was producing a decade ago. The country risks having its OPEC quota cut and is struggling to ensure the long-term feed for its $10 billion liquid natural gas plant. President João Lourenço won an August 2017 election promising an “economic miracle” in Angola, which despite its oil wealth struggles to provide basic services to a mostly impoverished population that is growing at 3 percent a year. But falling oil production means a third consecutive contraction is expected in 2018, even while annual inflation runs at 18 percent. To turn things around, Angola has asked international oil companies to the table, offering better fiscal terms and more collaboration. With the time from exploration to first oil on new areas anything from five to 10 years, Angola is also offering tax breaks to encourage companies to link existing marginal discoveries to operating production platforms. There are signs the measures are working, though some oil experts wonder at what cost for the southwest African country. “The level of exploration activity in Angola is beginning to change,” Sonangol’s Chairman, Carlos Saturnino, said at Saturday’s inauguration. He expects between five and 10 new concessions to be signed next year. Exxon, he said, has shown interest in some blocks in southern Angola’s unexplored Namib basin, while advanced discussions are being held with BP, Equinor and ENI for the rights to the ultra-deep offshore blocks 46 and 47. BP and ENI declined to comment. Equinor and Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Total, which operates 40 percent of Angola’s production, plans to drill its first exploration well in four years. Beneath 3,630 metres of water on block 48, it will be one of the world’s deepest. “We hope it will be a play-opener for the ultra-deep in Angola,” said André Goffart, Senior Vice-President for Development. “We are seeing a new wave of exploration in Angola.” These signs of fresh exploration come after a period of near-paralysis due to a lack of drilling success, a slump in oil prices and a deteriorating relationship between Sonangol and the oil majors. Angola’s offshore reserves are expensive to explore and develop, making it a hard sell for shareholders when oil is at $40. The number of rigs operating off Angola’s shores dropped from 18 in early 2014 to just two in 2017, according to oil services company Baker Hughes. The steep drop in prices from 2014 came just as companies were smarting from the failure to discover Brazil-like oil reservoirs beneath a layer of salt on the African side of the Atlantic. The search for the “Angolan pre-salt” resulted in some of the most expensive dry wells ever drilled and sapped exploration appetite. Critics say the situation was exacerbated by Isabel dos Santos, the former president’s daughter and previous chair of Sonangol, under whose leadership new projects ground to a halt. Dos Santos denies allegations of mismanagement, saying she helped turn around an almost bankrupt company. “There are few places in the world right now where the oil majors are in as good a negotiating position as here,” said one international oil executive in Luanda on condition of anonymity. Some local experts fear the deals Angola is striking are too beneficial for the companies, although details remain private. “If Angola gives away too much it could create problems further down the line,” said José Oliveira, an oil specialist at the Catholic University in Luanda. But the country has little choice given its imminent production decline and a lack of money or expertise to lead the drilling campaigns itself. Asked if he will be back in the next few years to launch another giant project like Kaombo, Total’s Pouyanné shrugs. “We’ll see what we find,” he said. “It’s possible.” (Reporting by Stephen Eisenhammer; Editing by Catherine Evans)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/angola-oil-exploration/rpt-angola-battles-to-revive-oil-exploration-as-output-declines-idUKL8N1XQ21M,15 Nov 2018,"* Oil production to fall to 1 mln bpd by 2023 without new

2018-11-15,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - There was something for everyone in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) latest world energy outlook, but supporters of coal, renewables, and oil and gas are all likely to take away the wrong messages. The comprehensive report, released on Nov. 13, outlined an energy future where natural gas overtakes coal by 2030 to become the world’s second-largest energy source. There was positive news for renewables as well, with the agency forecasting that the sector would overtake coal in power generation by 2040 with a share of just over 40 percent. Even if this sounded like bad news for coal, the IEA still believed that use of the high-polluting fuel will remain largely flat over the forecast period as gains in Asia ex-China are offset by declines in Europe and North America. If this forecast is correct, it means coal-exporting countries focused on Asia, such as Australia, Indonesia and South Africa, can look forward to years of solid demand. There were two caveats in the report, however, that show the reality of the next two decades of global energy consumption could potentially be quite different from the forecasts. The first was that carbon emissions continue to grow under the IEA’s main scenario on a “slow upward trend” to 2040, which will be a “trajectory far out of step with what scientific knowledge says will be required to tackle climate change.” Following on from that thought was an acknowledgement that government policies across the world will drive the future of energy production and consumption. “Government policies and preferences will play a crucial role in shaping where we go from here,” the IEA said. It’s here that the tide would appear to be shifting in favour of stronger action to mitigate climate change, especially in countries such as China and India where energy demand is expected to grow strongly. The world’s two most populous nations both battle air pollution - largely blamed on burning coal for both power and industry - as well as rising vehicle emissions as the emerging middle class buys more cars. China already has stringent policies in place to lower air pollution over winter, such as closing down steelmaking and aluminium plants and switching residential heating to natural gas from coal. India is probably not too far behind, given that its capital New Delhi is now more polluted than Beijing. While there are governments and leaders that deny climate change, such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, they are becoming exceptions rather than the rule. The risks to the IEA scenario appear to be stacked in favour of a faster-than-forecast adoption of renewable energy, mainly at the expense of coal and natural gas in power generation, and of crude oil for transportation. The trend of the past decade has been coal losing favour as renewables and natural gas expand their market share. The natural gas industry has been quite happy to target coal, bolstered by the fact it is less polluting and increasingly available, especially after the shale gas boom in the United States and the subsequent massive investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) there, and in places like Australia. The risk to the gas industry is that in its glee to kill off coal, it isn’t seeing renewables in the rearview mirror. The September GasTech event in Barcelona was a case in point. This was the gas industry’s largest annual gathering and featured dozens of speakers from the major players. The standout theme of the conference was the absolute confidence the natural gas and LNG industries have in their future, and that they are not just a transition fuel between coal and renewables, but are a permanent part of the energy landscape. The 53-page report on the event and its various sessions mentioned the word “renewables” only three times. Solar and wind didn’t appear in the document at all. Climate change was mentioned just once, and only in relation to limiting emissions from methane leakage. The report gives the impression that the natural gas industry is largely ignoring the threat posed to its growth by renewables, just as coal once ignored the threat posed by natural gas, renewables and environmental activists. One of the common notions in the natural gas industry is that the fuel is a great fit with the more intermittent renewables such as wind and solar. But there seems to be little effort on the industry’s part to seriously partner with the renewables sector to ensure that together they dominate the future of electricity generation. The main risk from the IEA report is that all energy players see in it what they want to see, rather than viewing it as only one possible future out of many.

A cautious start is expected in Europe, however. Spreadbetters see Britain’s FTSE opening flat, Germany’s DAX slipping 0.25 percent and France’s CAC losing 0.2 percent. U.S. government sources told Reuters on Wednesday that China had sent a response to U.S. demands for trade reform but gave no further details, raising hopes the two sides could resume negotiations to end their trade war. U.S. oil futures fell 0.3 percent to $56.08 a barrel, after a slight bounce overnight that followed 12 straight losing sessions. Brent was down 0.1 percent at $66.04. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.7 percent. The index had fallen the previous day as the sharp slide in oil prices heightened anxiety about the outlook for broad demand and global growth. Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.8 percent. Traders have cautiously welcomed news in recent days that Washington and Beijing have resumed informal discussions ahead of a meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping late this month. Few market watchers expect a trade agreement at that meeting but hopes are growing that they may agree on a de-escalation while the two sides pursue more detailed talks. Elsewhere, Australian stocks inched up 0.05 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.2 percent. “While it’s difficult to pin-point a specific event for the risk-off move, recent themes appear to be keeping markets cautious include oil’s recent plummet, Apple’s fall, U.S. political gridlock, China’s slowing growth, tightening liquidity, a hawkish Fed, earnings peak, Italian jitters, and Brexit uncertainty,” wrote economists at ANZ. The S&P 500 fell for a fifth straight day overnight as financial stocks were hit by fears that banking industry regulations would tighten once the Democratic Party takes control of the House of Representatives. U.S. equities were also pressured by concerns that earnings growth might be peaking, trade tensions and a slowing global economy - factors that had triggered a rout in riskier assets in October. “If U.S. stocks are to bounce back, economic indicators will be key,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “Immediate focus will be on today’s U.S. retail sales data, which will provide a view of how private consumption -the main component of economic growth- is faring.” U.S. retail sales for October will be released at 1330 GMT. In currencies, the pound and euro kept gains made after British Prime Minister May’s cabinet backed her draft Brexit deal. May now has to gain the support of parliament, though it is unclear whether she has enough votes to clinch approval. The pound was 0.2 percent higher at $1.3010. The euro also added 0.2 percent, to $1.1334.

2018-11-15,"* Oil production to fall to 1 mln bpd by 2023 without new projects * Angola plans to tender oil blocks in 2019 * Total to drill first exploration well in four years By Stephen Eisenhammer LUANDA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - On Saturday, nearly two decades after securing the initial rights, Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanné was in Luanda to snip the ribbon on a $16 billion oil project. It’s not clear when he, or his peers, will be cracking open the bubbly in Angola again. Without another mega-project like Total’s Kaombo on the horizon and fields getting old, Africa’s second-largest crude producer is facing a steep decline unless it can revive exploration in what was once one of the world’s most exciting offshore prospects. Sonangol, the state oil company, is negotiating contracts for new blocks with oil majors and Angola plans to hold an auction next year, the first tender for exploration rights since 2011. It’s a race against time for a country where oil accounts for 95 percent of exports and around 70 percent of government revenues. Luck will also play a part, as it always does in exploration where finding oil can never be guaranteed. But without new projects, output could fall to 1 million barrels per day by 2023, according to the oil ministry. That is down from 1.5 million today and nearly half of what Angola was producing a decade ago. The country risks having its OPEC quota cut and is struggling to ensure the long-term feed for its $10 billion liquid natural gas plant. President João Lourenço won an August 2017 election promising an “economic miracle” in Angola, which despite its oil wealth struggles to provide basic services to a mostly impoverished population that is growing at 3 percent a year. But falling oil production means a third consecutive contraction is expected in 2018, even while annual inflation runs at 18 percent. To turn things around, Angola has asked international oil companies to the table, offering better fiscal terms and more collaboration. With the time from exploration to first oil on new areas anything from five to 10 years, Angola is also offering tax breaks to encourage companies to link existing marginal discoveries to operating production platforms. There are signs the measures are working, though some oil experts wonder at what cost for the southwest African country. “The level of exploration activity in Angola is beginning to change,” Sonangol’s Chairman, Carlos Saturnino, said at Saturday’s inauguration. He expects between five and 10 new concessions to be signed next year. Exxon, he said, has shown interest in some blocks in southern Angola’s unexplored Namib basin, while advanced discussions are being held with BP, Equinor and ENI for the rights to the ultra-deep offshore blocks 46 and 47. BP and ENI declined to comment. Equinor and Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Total, which operates 40 percent of Angola’s production, plans to drill its first exploration well in four years. Beneath 3,630 metres of water on block 48, it will be one of the world’s deepest. “We hope it will be a play-opener for the ultra-deep in Angola,” said André Goffart, Senior Vice-President for Development. “We are seeing a new wave of exploration in Angola.” These signs of fresh exploration come after a period of near-paralysis due to a lack of drilling success, a slump in oil prices and a deteriorating relationship between Sonangol and the oil majors. Angola’s offshore reserves are expensive to explore and develop, making it a hard sell for shareholders when oil is at $40. The number of rigs operating off Angola’s shores dropped from 18 in early 2014 to just two in 2017, according to oil services company Baker Hughes. The steep drop in prices from 2014 came just as companies were smarting from the failure to discover Brazil-like oil reservoirs beneath a layer of salt on the African side of the Atlantic. The search for the “Angolan pre-salt” resulted in some of the most expensive dry wells ever drilled and sapped exploration appetite. Critics say the situation was exacerbated by Isabel dos Santos, the former president’s daughter and previous chair of Sonangol, under whose leadership new projects ground to a halt. Dos Santos denies allegations of mismanagement, saying she helped turn around an almost bankrupt company. “There are few places in the world right now where the oil majors are in as good a negotiating position as here,” said one international oil executive in Luanda on condition of anonymity. Some local experts fear the deals Angola is striking are too beneficial for the companies, although details remain private. “If Angola gives away too much it could create problems further down the line,” said José Oliveira, an oil specialist at the Catholic University in Luanda. But the country has little choice given its imminent production decline and a lack of money or expertise to lead the drilling campaigns itself. Asked if he will be back in the next few years to launch another giant project like Kaombo, Total’s Pouyanné shrugs. “We’ll see what we find,” he said. “It’s possible.” (Reporting by Stephen Eisenhammer; Editing by Catherine Evans)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/angola-oil-exploration/angola-battles-to-revive-oil-exploration-as-output-declines-idUKL8N1XP4IQ,15 Nov 2018,"* Oil production to fall to 1 mln bpd by 2023 without new

2018-11-15,"PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - National Guard troops joined the grim search on Wednesday for more victims in the ruins of an incinerated northern California town while the death toll climbed to 56 in the most deadly and destructive wildfire in the state’s history. The latest fatality count was announced as authorities released a revised list of 130 people reported missing by loved ones after flames largely obliterated the Sierra foothills town of Paradise, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, last Thursday. The majority on the list were over the age of 65. Nearly 230 people were initially reported as missing in the killer blaze, dubbed the Camp Fire. Most of those who remain unaccounted for are from Paradise, once home to 27,000 people. More than 8,900 homes and other buildings burned to the ground in and around Paradise, and an estimated 50,000 people remained under evacuation orders in the area.     Adding to the misery of some survivors was an outbreak of norovirus, a highly contagious gastrointestinal illness, at a shelter housing about 200 evacuees in the nearby city of Chico. Public health agency spokeswoman Lisa Almaguer said at least 20 people may have caught the virus. The footprint of the six-day-old fire grew to 135,000 acres (55,000 hectares) as of Wednesday, even as diminished winds and rising humidity helped firefighters shore up containment lines around more than a third of the perimeter. Still, the ghostly expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with twisted wreckage and debris made a strong impression on Governor Jerry Brown, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and other officials who toured the devastation on Wednesday. “This is one of the worst disasters I’ve seen in my career, hands down,” Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told reporters in Chico. “It looks like a war zone. It is a war zone,” Brown said. After visiting some of California’s earlier wildfire zones in August, Zinke blamed “gross mismanagement of forests” because of timber harvest restrictions that he said were supported by “environmental terrorist groups.” But pressed by reporters on Wednesday, Zinke demurred. “Now is really not the time to point fingers,” he said. “It is a time for America to stand together.”     The blaze, fueled by thick, drought-desiccated scrub, has capped two back-to-back catastrophic wildfire seasons in California that scientists largely attribute to prolonged drought they say is symptomatic of climate change. Lawyers for some of the victims claimed in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday that lax equipment maintenance by an electric utility was the proximate cause of the fire, which officially remains under investigation. The Butte County disaster coincided with a flurry of blazes in Southern California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which has killed at least two people, destroyed more than 500 structures and displaced about 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said the body of a possible third victim was found there in a burned-out dwelling. Cal Fire officials said that blaze was 52 percent contained as of Wednesday night. In Butte County, the search for more human remains kicked into high gear as a National Guard contingent of 50 military police officers joined dozens of search-and-recovery workers and at least 22 cadaver dogs, Sheriff Kory Honea said. The remains of eight more fire victims were found on Wednesday, raising the official number of fatalities to 56 - far exceeding the previous record from a single wildfire in California history - 29 people killed by the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles in 1933. The Camp Fire also stands as one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. More than 80 people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August of 1910. Butte County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Megan McMann said the list of 130 missing would fluctuate from day to day as more names are added and others are removed, either because they turn up safe or end up identified among the dead. Sheriff Honea invited relatives of the missing to provide DNA samples to compare against samples taken from newly recovered remains in hopes of speeding up identification of the dead. But he acknowledged it was possible some of the missing might never be found. Authorities attributed the magnitude of casualties to the staggering speed with which the fire struck Paradise. Wind-driven flames roared through town so swiftly that residents were forced to flee for their lives. Some victims were found in or around the burned-out wreckage of their vehicles. Anna Dise, a resident of Butte Creek Canyon west of Paradise, told KRCR TV her father, Gordon Dise, 66, died when he ran back inside to gather belongings and their house collapsed on him.  Dise said she could not flee in her car because the tires had melted. To survive, she hid overnight in a neighbor’s pond with her dogs. “It was so fast,” Dise recounted of the fire. “I didn’t expect it to move so fast.” (For graphic on deadly California fires, click tmsnrt.rs/2Plpuui) Reporting by Terray Sylvester; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich and Sharon Bernstein in Paradise and Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; writing by Bill Trott and Steve Gorman; editing by Steve Orlofsky, James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker",https://uk.reuters.com/article/california-wildfires/update-8-at-least-56-killed-130-missing-in-californias-deadliest-wildfire-idUKL2N1XP0FP,15 Nov 2018,"National Guard troops

U.S. government sources told Reuters on Wednesday that China had sent a response to U.S. demands for trade reform but gave no further details, raising hopes the two sides could resume negotiations to end their trade war. U.S. oil futures fell 0.6 percent to $55.92 a barrel, after a slight bounce overnight that followed 12 straight losing sessions. Brent was down 0.5 percent at $65.89. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent. The index had fallen the previous day as the sharp slide in oil prices heightened anxiety about the outlook for broad demand and global growth. Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. Traders have cautiously welcomed news in recent days that Washington and Beijing have resumed informal discussions ahead of a meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping late this month. Few market watchers expect a trade agreement at that meeting but hopes are growing that they may agree on a de-escalation while the two sides pursue more detailed talks. Elsewhere, Australian stocks fell 0.5 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.25 percent. “While it’s difficult to pin-point a specific event for the risk-off move, recent themes appear to be keeping markets cautious include oil’s recent plummet, Apple’s fall, U.S. political gridlock, China’s slowing growth, tightening liquidity, a hawkish Fed, earnings peak, Italian jitters, and Brexit uncertainty,” wrote economists at ANZ. The S&P 500 fell for a fifth straight day overnight as financial stocks were hit by fears that banking industry regulations would tighten once the Democratic Party takes control of the House of Representatives. U.S. equities were also pressured by concerns that earnings growth might be peaking, trade tensions and a slowing global economy - factors that had triggered a rout in riskier assets in October. “If U.S. stocks are to bounce back, economic indicators will be key,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “Immediate focus will be on today’s U.S. retail sales data, which will provide a view of how private consumption -the main component of economic growth- is faring.” U.S. retail sales for October will be released at 1330 GMT. In currencies, the pound and euro kept gains made after British Prime Minister May’s cabinet backed her draft Brexit deal. May now has to gain the support of parliament, though it is unclear whether she has enough votes to clinch approval. The pound was a shade higher at $1.2998 after peaking at $1.3072 on Wednesday, when it tacked on 0.1 percent. The euro added 0.15 percent to $1.1325 after advancing 0.2 percent overnight.

2018-11-15,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI) is facing no problem selling business-class tickets on its ultra-long non-stop flights to the United States but is having to price premium economy seats very attractively, a senior executive said on Wednesday. The carrier last month resumed after five years the world’s longest commercial flight, an almost 19-hour non-stop journey from Singapore to New York. The airline ordered seven new ultra-long-range twin-engine Airbus SE (AIR.PA) A350-900ULRs fitted with just 67 business class and 94 premium economy seats for those flights and for non-stop services to Los Angeles and San Francisco. These flights have no economy class seats.  It represents a major expansion in the U.S. market for Singapore Airlines and a test of whether the carrier can charge the 20 percent price premium that travel industry data shows is typical for ultra-long non-stop services due to their popularity with time-sensitive business travelers. Singapore Airlines Executive Vice President Commercial Mak Swee Wah said there was existing demand for business class which he expected would continue to pick up.  For premium economy, however, he said some markets were not “entirely familiar” with the product, which offers more leg room and other amenities than economy class.  “I think we need to continue to stimulate and encourage the market to consider this product, initially with very attractive pricing, but eventually I think people will see that even at prices which we offer it is a good product to purchase because it is a very long flight,” he said at an analyst and media briefing. His comments came after Singapore Airlines reported on Tuesday an 81 percent plunge in second-quarter net profit, hurt by higher fuel prices, lower airfares and non-cash losses at its part-owned Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd (VAH.AX). Yields, a proxy for ticket prices, fell 2.2 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, failing to help offset the impact of a 24 percent rise in fuel prices.  Singapore Airlines is offering premium economy fares as low as S$1,698 ($1,230.17) return from Singapore to New York for weekday travel over part of the peak Christmas travel period, according to its website.  That is in line with economy class fares from premium rivals like Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) and Dubai-based Emirates that require a stop and a longer travel time, according to a Reuters search on Expedia. When it previously flew to New York and Los Angeles non-stop on four-engined A340-500 jets that used more fuel, it had initially offered both “executive economy” and business class but later switched to all business class. Those flights were abandoned in 2013 when high fuel prices made them uneconomic. A Singapore Airlines spokesman said on Thursday that the airline constantly reviewed its cabin configurations. “However at this point we are confident we have the right balance with business class and premium economy class seating on our A350-900ULRs, and there are no plans to change it,” he said.

2018-11-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three South Korean companies will plead guilty to criminal charges and pay $236 million for their role in a conspiracy to fix the price of fuel sold to U.S. military bases in South Korea, the Justice Department said on Wednesday. SK Energy Co Ltd [SKENGG.UL]; GS Caltex Corp [GSCAL.UL], 50 percent owned by Chevron; and Hanjin Transportation Co Ltd agreed to pay $154 million in civil damages to the United States and $82 million in criminal fines, the department said. The settlement was part of a larger investigation involving other companies, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, told reporters. The three “and other co-conspirators rigged bids and fixed prices for fuel supply contracts issued by the U.S. military in this strategically critical region for over a decade,” Delrahim said. The conspiracy began around March 2005 and continued until 2016, with South Korean petroleum and refinery companies and their agents working to suppress competition during the bidding process for U.S. military fuel contracts, the department said. “As a result of the anti-competitive agreement, the U.S. Department of Defense paid substantially more for fuel supply services than it would have absent the collusion,” Delrahim said. SK Innovation, owner of SK Energy, said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that SK Energy had been investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for price rigging. It “reached an agreement with the Department of Justice to conclude the case in the fourth quarter and pay around 140 billion won ($124 million) in fines and damages,” the filing said.  GS Caltex said in an emailed statement it also “signed and entered into agreements with the United States Department of Justice”, but could not further comment on specific details as the investigation on the case is ongoing.      Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said the company fully cooperated with authorities in the probe of Caltex. “No Chevron employees were implicated in the case,” he said. Hanjin representative Seung Bae Lee said the company was “committed to complying with the antitrust and competition laws and values its decades-long relationship with the U.S. military.” Between criminal fines and other payments, SK Energy is to pay $124.5 million, GS Caltex will pay $104.2 million and Hanjin will pay $7.6 million, according to Justice Department data. The payments made by the companies “exceeds the amount of the individual overcharge,” the department said. ($1 = 1,130.7000 won) Reporting by Sarah N.

2018-11-15,"ABUJA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - A probe by the Nigerian Senate into whether state oil firm NNPC improperly withdrew money has expanded with the amount under investigation doubling to over $2.2 billion, a committee said on Wednesday. The Senate last week voted to probe withdrawals of $1.05 billion by Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), from NLNG, a venture owned by the state oil firm and foreign energy companies, without approval. The committee led by Senator Bassey Akpan, chairman of Senate committee on gas, said on Wednesday it had found more withdrawals in excess of what it set out to investigate. Akpan asked NNPC and central bank officials to provide documents to back up the withdrawals, carried out at various periods between 2016 to 2018. NNPC officials said documents were being assembled ahead of next hearing due on Nov 22 and declined to comment further. Nigeria’s Premium Times newspaper reported last week that NNPC had used the portion of NLNG earnings that should have been passed to local and federal state authorities to fund the state oil firm’s fuel purchases and subsidies during a shortage in late 2017 and early 2018. The shortages left people queuing for hours at filling stations and saw NNPC spend at least $5.8 billion on fuel imports. NLNG, which produces liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export, is a joint venture company owned by NNPC and foreign energy firms Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and ENI.

2018-11-15,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s October imports of Iran oil remained at zero for a second straight month ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran that came into effect on Nov.5, customs office data showed on Thursday.  In September, South Korea’s imports of Iran oil fell to zero for the first time in six years as South Korean buyers halted purchases from the Middle Eastern due to uncertainty over whether they would receive a waiver from the U.S. government. South Korea was granted a temporary waiver from U.S. sanctions, along with seven other countries, to purchase Iran oil. The sanctions aim to force Tehran to stop not only its nuclear and ballistic missile program but also its involvement in regional conflicts in Syria. The country’s final October crude oil imports data by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) is due for release later this month.  South Korea can buy up to 200,000 barrels per day of Iran oil, mostly condensate, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. In the January-October period of the year, the country’s imports of Iranian oil halved to 7.15 million tonnes, from 15.70 million tonnes in the same period a year earlier, according to the data. The data does not provide a breakdown of imports by types.   Overall, South Korea imported 13.07 million tonnes of crude oil in October, up 5.1 percent from 12.44 million tonnes from a year earlier.  Oil shipments from Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top oil supplier, almost doubled to 4.17 million tonnes in October, from 2.68 million tonnes from a year earlier.

2018-11-15,"TOKYO, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices fell on Thursday, resuming declines after an industry group said U.S. inventories had risen more than expected and shrugging off a report that OPEC and other producers plan to cut output. U.S. crude futures were down 33 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $55.92 a barrel by 0004 GMT. The contract rose 1 percent on Wednesday, after sliding for 12 straight sessions and touching its lowest since November 2017. Brent crude was yet to trade. It settled up 65 cents, or 1 percent, at $66.12 a barrel, after hitting a session-high of $67.63, having also slumped in recent weeks. The oil market reversed course on Wednesday after Reuters reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its partners were discussing a proposal to cut output by up to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), more than officials had mentioned previously. But it did not taken long for concerns about potential oversupply to return to the fore. The American Petroleum Institute said late on Wednesday that crude inventories rose by 8.8 million barrels in the week to Nov. 9 to 440.7 million, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels. Oil markets are being hit by surging supply from OPEC, Russia, the Unites States and other producers and concern that a global economic slowdown will cut into energy demand. That has pushed the price of global benchmark Brent down more than 20 percent since early October, one of the biggest declines since the price collapse of 2014. The Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) also said on Wednesday that the implied stock build for the first half of 2019 is 2 million bpd. The IEA left its forecast for global demand growth for 2018 and 2019 unchanged from last month, but cut its forecast for non-OECD demand growth, the engine of expansion in world consumption. U.S. crude output from its seven major shale basins was expected to hit a record 7.94 million bpd in December, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said earlier this week. The EIA announces official crude stocks and other data later on Thursday. The surge in onshore output has helped overall U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA hit a record 11.6 million bpd, making the United States the world’s biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. Amid the general market decline, late on Wednesday the CME raised December oil futures margins by 14.5 percent to $3,550 per contract, with the new rate effective from Thursday.

2018-11-15," (Editor’s Note: Please be advised that this story contains details that may upset some readers) By Terray Sylvester PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - A shaggy male Australian shepherd named IC darted nervously through the charred remnants of a house in Paradise, California, sniffing for victims of the deadliest blaze in the state’s history. “He’s getting an overload of scent,” said his handler, Trish Moutard, a volunteer with CARDA, the California Animal Rescue Dog Society, while searching properties on Forest Glen Road in Paradise. “It’s a new experience for him.” IC was among several cadaver dogs brought in to look for victims of the Camp Fire, which has so far killed 48 people and burned 135,000 acres (55,000 hectares). Fire fighters have said it was only 35 percent contained. Authorities said they have not accounted for nearly 230 people. On Wednesday, a National Guard contingent was sent to Paradise, a town of about 27,000 in the Sierra foothills that has been largely reduced to ashes, to seek and identify human remains. They will join the cadaver dogs, coroner-led recovery teams and forensic anthropologists searching the ghostly landscape. IC appeared agitated as he was instructed to sniff inside a car and a pile of rubble from the destroyed house - a brick chimney and burned trees the only things standing on the property.  Moutard said that she and IC had previously only worked house fires and the dog was overwhelmed by the size of the search area and multitude of scents from what was left of house after house. She said her method was to look for places where people may be trapped by fire, such as front and back doorways, or where they might take shelter, such as a bathtub. “I generally try to look at what’s going to be the catch point for someone in a home,” she said. She stays alert for obvious body parts that would survive fire, “skulls often,” but also looks for imprints of bodies, a discolored area in the shape of a human, that may be the most obvious remnant. “In a fire like this it may just simply appear as an outline,” she said. “What may be left is just literally the outline of a person.” A husband-wife team, Karen and Larry Atkinson, worked their way through devastated properties near Eden Roc Drive in Paradise with their dog Echo, an English lab. Echo dashed ahead, nose to the ground, and then returned to Karen, who would point the dog toward the next place to be searched. She periodically shook talcum powder from a bottle to test the direction of the wind and make sure the dog searched the downwind side of each location so it would be easier to pick up scents. As they searched, the Atkinsons stayed alert for hazards: downed power lines, holes left by burned roots, and dangling  tree branches, which they called “widow makers.” Larry Atkinson said the search was painstaking because Echo was working through many scents to single out human remains.  “There’s a lot of scent everywhere, and it’s hard to nail down,” he said.
