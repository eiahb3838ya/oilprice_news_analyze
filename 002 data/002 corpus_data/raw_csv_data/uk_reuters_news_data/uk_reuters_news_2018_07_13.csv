2018-07-13,"(Adds Boeing’s statement, details) July 13 (Reuters) - Boeing Co’s KC-46 mid-air refueling tankers have completed the final flight tests ahead of its first aircraft delivery in late October, the company and the U.S. Air Force said on Friday. The KC-46 test program will move to follow-on receiver aircraft testing and certifications required for operational testing, starting in 2019. The KC-46 test team completed Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) flight testing in April and is working through associated paperwork to receive the STC, Boeing said. Boeing is set to deliver 17 tankers by April next year, the U.S. Air Force said last month. ""With this milestone complete, the test program has demonstrated a level of maturity that positions Boeing to deliver, and the Air Force to accept, an aircraft by the end of October 2018,"" said Will Roper, an Air Force service acquisition executive. (bit.ly/2ujFG2N) The KC-46, a multirole tanker, will refuel U.S., allied and coalition military aircraft using its boom and hose and drogue systems. The boom allows the tanker to transfer up to 1,200 gallons of fuel per minute, while the hose and drogue systems enable refueling of smaller aircraft with up to 400 gallons of fuel per minute.

Motiva spokeswoman Angela Goodwin declined comment. Motiva on Thursday began planning the shutdown of the 81,000 barrel per day (bpd) gasoline-producing Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 3 (FCCU 3) at its 603,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery due to excessive catalyst loss, the sources said. If Motiva puts off the Monday, July 23 shutdown, it would be the second time this month the refinery has avoided shutting FCCU 3, the sources said. The problems with catalyst clogging and loss began on Wednesday and Motiva planned to shut the catcracker on Thursday, but was able to keep the unit running at reduced production levels. While keeping FCCU 3 operating, Motiva also began preparing to take the unit out of production on July 23 for a period that could be measured in weeks. Within the refinery’s FCCU 3, the fine powder catalyst breaks down gas oil into gasoline and other products.

2018-07-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 index hit a more than five-month high on Friday on gains in industrial stocks and energy companies, while the safe-haven U.S. dollar flattened after touching a two-week high. Gold slipped to seven-month lows and Treasury prices rose after the Federal Reserve reinforced views of strong U.S. economic growth in a report to Congress, reinforcing expectations of higher interest rates. The U.S. central bank reiterated that it “expects that further gradual increases” in interest rates would be appropriate given “solid” growth. An absence of rhetoric overnight about a U.S.-China trade war helped industrial stocks, as did remarks on Thursday from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said that the United States and China might reopen trade talks. “Despite the ominous headlines about a trade war with China, we’re comfortable with U.S. equities at current prices amid favourable macro trends and surging earnings growth,” said Mike Bailey, director of Research at FBB Capital Partners in Maryland. Gains from Boeing, Caterpillar and 3M helped offset a drop in financials after three big Wall Street banks reported mixed quarterly earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 94.52 points, or 0.38 percent, to 25,019.41, the S&P 500 gained 3.02 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,801.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.06 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,825.98. For the week, the Dow added 2.3 percent, the S&P rose 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1.79 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.26 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.21 percent. The greenback initially got a boost from the Fed report and from data showing China’s trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record high in June, which could further inflame a trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. The dollar fell after touching its highest since June 29. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar index slipped 0.1 percent.  Spot gold dropped 0.4 percent to $1,241.30 an ounce.  While China has vowed to retaliate against the proposed new U.S. tariffs - 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods - the lack of a specific response to date has sparked global relief. The yield curve on U.S. Treasuries once again reached its flattest in 11 years, with the spread between 2-year and 10-year notes falling to 24.46 basis points. Prices moved higher on the Fed report. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.8271 percent, from 2.853 percent late on Thursday. In commodity markets, oil prices had a wild week of price swings, with both main benchmarks at one point suffering heavy losses as traders focused on the return of Libyan oil to the market. Even so, oil rose on Friday. U.S. crude rose 0.47 percent to $70.66 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.90, up 0.6 percent.

2018-07-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 1 percent on Friday as strike actions in Norway and Iraq hit supplies, but futures were set for a second straight week of decline after Libyan ports reopened and on the view that Iran might still export some crude despite U.S. sanctions. Brent crude LCOc1 rose 88 cents to settle at $75.33 a barrel, a 1.18 percent gain. The global benchmark fell about 2.7 percent for the week. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 68 cents to settle at $71.01 a barrel, but lost about 3.9 percent this week. The market pared gains late in the session on a Bloomberg report that the Trump administration is actively considering tapping in to the country’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would add supply to the market. The United States holds a reserve of about 660 million barrels, enough for about three or four months of supply.  “People have been talking about that as a rumor,” said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. “This is nothing different than anything that’s been said in the last weeks here.” Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, closing Shell’s (RDSa.L) Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Iraq, about 100 protesters demanding jobs and better services closed access to Umm Qasr commodities port near the southern city of Basra on Friday, port employees said. “Persistently declining oil supplies from Venezuela and simmering strike actions in Norway and Iraq are prompting bullish sentiment,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London.  Prices weakened earlier in the week after OPEC member Libya reopened major eastern oil ports and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would consider granting waivers to some of Iran’s crude buyers. Fears that a U.S.-China trade dispute could hit global economic growth have also kept buyers on the back foot. Russia and other leading oil producers may boost oil output further if supply shortages hit the market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said. In June, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other key producers including Russia responded to market tightness by easing a supply-cut agreement.  China’s crude oil imports fell for a second month in a row in June to their lowest level since December, as shrinking margins and volatile oil prices led some independent refiners to scale back purchases. The U.S. oil rig count remained steady at 863 this week, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said. The rate of growth has slowed over the past month or so with a decline in crude prices from late May through late June. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their combined futures and options position in New York and London by 847 contracts to 457,718 during the week ended July 10, the highest since April 24, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.

2018-07-13,"* Iraq’s main commodities port shut * Protesters storm Najaf airport, halt flights * Complaints over unemployment and poor services * Iraq’s most influential cleric supports protesters (Adds protests in Amara) By Aref Mohammed BASRA, Iraq July 13 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Iraqis stormed the airport and halted air traffic in the Shi’ite holy city of Najaf on Friday, extending protests about poor government services and corruption following demonstrations in the southern city of Basra. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, expressed solidarity with protesters, saying they faced an “extreme lack of public services” such as electricity in the suffocating summer heat. “We can only stand with our dear citizens in their demands as we feel their great suffering,” Sistani said through an aide during a Friday sermon heard on live television. Sistani, who has millions of followers, rarely intervenes in politics but has wide sway over public opinion. Two airport security officials said hundreds of demonstrators entered Najaf airport’s main hall and walked on to the tarmac. Witnesses said security forces allowed protesters to enter the main airport building. Earlier in the day, residents took to the streets of the oil city Basra for a fifth straight day and blocked access to the nearby commodities port of Umm Qasr. Protests were also held in the cities of Amara and Nasiriya as public anger mounted over unemployment and delivery of basic services. Iraqi politicians face growing unrest as they try to form a coalition government after a May 12 parliamentary election tainted by allegations of fraud. A political bloc led by cleric Moqtada al-Sadr won a majority in the poll on an anti-corruption platform which had appeal across Iraq’s electorate. In Amara, protesters occupied the headquarters of the provincial governorate, threw stones at branches of the Shi’ite Dawa party and the powerful Badr Organisation, which has close ties to Iran, and beat up policemen, said a security official. Security forces pushed them back. A port worker said the road leading into the Umm Qasr terminal near Basra was blocked and trucks had no way of getting in or out. Port officials told employees to go home. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi held talks with officials in the oil-exporting city of Basra to discuss the unrest. Protesters hoping to catch his attention stormed the hotel where he was meeting tribal leaders. But he had already left. The government will quickly address the demands of the protesters, the Council of Ministers said in a statement. Basra oil officials have said the protests, which have also taken place near major oilfields, have not impacted crude production. Oil exports from Basra account for more than 95 percent of OPEC producer Iraq’s state revenues. Any potential disruptions to production could severely impact the country’s limping economy. Umm Qasr receives Iraq’s grain, vegetable oils and sugar shipments. “We will not stop until our demands are met,” said Mohammed Jabbar, 29, an unemployed college graduate. “If they don’t create jobs and improve services such as water and electricity we will close down Basra and oil production.” Iraq’s government will be hard-pressed to improve life in Basra, a crumbling city once dubbed the “Venice of the Middle East” for its network of canals resembling the Italian city. Iraq needs tens of billions of dollars to rebuild after a three-year war with Islamic State. Long neglected, Basra is one of the few cities in the Middle East without an effective water treatment system. Many of its waterways are stagnant cesspools. State officials blame a public funding crisis caused by years of low oil prices. People like 34-year-old Nuri Malik, unemployed for ten years, have lost patience. “Unless our demands are met, we will take steps to escalate. We will stop the activities of oil companies and will not allow them to hire foreigners,” Malik said.

Production and Mining Minister Dante Sica, who assumed the role three weeks ago amid a cabinet shakeup in market-friendly President Mauricio Macri’s government, said in an interview that he planned to meet with oil industry suppliers and service providers operating in the area in the coming weeks. “We will sit down and discuss, see where the needs are, where the logistical bottlenecks are,” Sica said. “That way we can move quickly to unlock those resources and increase productivity and competitiveness.” The Vaca Muerta play in Patagonia is one of the largest reserves of unconventional hydrocarbons on the planet, though much of its oil and gas remains untapped. Sica added that growing exports in 2019 would help reduce Argentina’s trade deficit in part due to the depreciation of the peso currency this year.

2018-07-13,"(Adds rigs in the Permian) July 13 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies left the oil rig count unchanged this week as the rate of growth has slowed over the past month or so with a decline in crude prices from late May through late June. U.S. crude prices were on track to fall almost 4 percent this week as escalating U.S.-China trade tensions threatened to hurt oil demand after last week rising to their highest level since November 2014. The number of active oil rigs held steady at 863 in the week to July 13, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI More than half the total oil rigs are in Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there increased by one this week to 475, the most in a month. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 765 rigs were active as energy companies have ramped up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $65.95 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading over $69 for the balance of 2018 and near $65 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,032 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Last week, Simmons forecast the count would rise to 1,033 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,054 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,006. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this month projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.8 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017.

2018-07-13,"HANOI (Reuters) - An American detained in Vietnam last month is set to go on trial next Friday, days after U.S. Secretary of State raised the case with local officials during a Hanoi visit. Will Nguyen, 34, is accused of “causing public disorder”, the Police Department of Ho Chi Minh City said in a statement on its official news website. Nguyen, of Vietnamese descent, was detained last month following mass protests sparked by concerns that plans to develop economic zones by offering land leases for up to 99 years would be dominated by investors from China, with which Vietnam has a history of fractious ties. The police statement cited the indictment as saying that Nguyen incited people to protest and tried to overturn a police truck in the city, Vietnam’s economic hub. His lawyer is not immediately available for comment. Nguyen’s sister, Victoria Nguyen, said in a letter sent to the Department of State earlier this month that her brother was not violent and was a man of integrity. “I think we all understand that he is being condemned for something that we all know is our universal birth right: freedom of speech and expression,” Victoria Nguyen said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the issue during his meetings with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi this week, encouraging a speedy resolution. Police in Vietnam arrested dozens of people following protests by thousands of people in several cities, including a protest in the central province of Binh Thuan that turned violent. A court in Binh Thuan province on Thursday jailed six people for clashing with police for between two and two and a half years. According to Vietnam’s penal code, anyone found guilty of causing public disorder may face a prison term of between two and seven years.

2018-07-13,"* Fears Chinese trade surplus could inflame dispute * Dollar rises, gold falls on trade war concerns * U.S., European stocks steady * Oil drops 4 percent this week (Adds Wall Street open; changes dateline from LONDON; recasts with U.S. dollar, updates throughout) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - The safe-haven U.S. dollar touched to a two-week high on Friday after data showed a record Chinese trade surplus, while Wall Street stocks were little changed on mixed bank earnings and gains in industrials. Stocks in Europe edged higher. Gold slipped to seven-month lows on the firmer dollar and remarks Thursday from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said that the United States and China might reopen trade talks, briefly easing concerns about an escalating trade dispute between the two countries. “Despite the ominous headlines about a trade war with China, we’re comfortable with U.S. equities at current prices amid favorable macro trends and surging earnings growth,” said Mike Bailey, Director of Research at FBB Capital Partners in Maryland. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 86.11 points, or 0.35 percent, to 25,011, the S&P 500 gained 4.59 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,802.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.66 points, or 0.21 percent, to 7,840.57. Mixed corporate results from the three big Wall Street banks put some of this week’s earnings optimism in check. The greenback got a boost from data showing China’s trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June, which could further inflame a trade dispute with Washington. Upbeat comments on the U.S. economy from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also stoked demand for the dollar, analysts said. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar index rose 0.05 percent. Earlier Friday the dollar touched its highest level since June 29. Spot gold dropped 0.4 percent to $1,241.92 an ounce. While China has vowed to retaliate against the proposed new U.S. tariffs - 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods - the lack of a specific response to date has sparked global relief. Shanghai’s stock index edged lower and China’s yuan headed for its fifth straight week of losses. The yield curve on U.S. Treasuries once again reached its flattest level in 11 years on Friday in low-volume trading. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.8381 percent, from 2.853 percent late on Thursday. In commodity markets, oil prices had a wild week of price swings, with both the main benchmarks at one point suffering heavy losses as traders focused on the return of Libyan oil to the market. Even so, oil rose on Friday. U.S. crude rose 0.58 percent to $70.74 per barrel and Brent was last at $75.21, up 1.02 percent on the day. Copper eased about half a percent on Friday and was poised for a fifth straight weekly fall, its longest decline since 2015, on concerns about weaker demand in face of the U.S.-China trade dispute.

2018-07-13,"LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices continued correcting lower with potentially steeper dips expected ahead amid thin demand from China and India and healthy supply. Recent tender deals seemingly confirmed the bearish tone. Spot prices for August LNG-AS delivery in Asia were assessed at $10 per million British thermal units (Btu), down 10 cents from the previous week. LNG prices may be a shade lower heading into September. Russia’s Sakhalin II plant sold a tender Aug. 22-loading cargo to a North Asian buyer at an estimated delivered price of $9.90 per mmBtu, market sources said. Earlier this week, Australia’s APLNG plant sold a Aug. 4-loading free-on-board cargo potentially to Shell at an estimated $9.30 per mmBtu. Despite above-average temperatures in Japan, utilities show limited demand for LNG, while in China buyers may be waiting for prices to fall further before wading into the spot market. Total LNG imports into China remain brisk however. Cooling prices may also tempt Indian buyers back into the market but for now demand was sparse with only Gail this week wrapping up a tender purchase for a single late July cargo. A run of production outages helped to tighten markets last month but much of that pressure has since been relieved. The market was not fully out of the woods as Malaysia’s giant Bintulu complex may have shut in some production for planned maintenance, traders said. The 30 million tonne per annum, nine-train facility spent last month troubleshooting unexpected electrical faults that impeded output. Angola LNG planned to shut this month ahead of an early August restart. Australia’s Ichthys project, meanwhile, fell further behind schedule, delaying first LNG as developer Inpex patched what it called “minor issues”. The second train from Yamal LNG in Russia’s Arctic should start pumping in September. The fifth train from Cheniere’s Sabine Pass plant in Louisiana starts the following month.

2018-07-13,"YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroon’s President Paul Biya said on Friday he would run for re-election in October, aiming to extend his 36-year rule and keep his place on the roster of Africa’s longest-serving leaders.  The 85-year-old who came to power in 1982 when his predecessor retired is seeking a seventh term that could see him rule well into his 90s.  It would leave him in rare company after former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and Gambia’s Yahya Jammeh were ousted in 2017. Of Africa’s living rulers, only Equatorial Guinea’s President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has ruled uninterrupted for longer. “I am willing to respond positively to your overwhelming calls. I will stand as Your Candidate in the upcoming presidential election,” Biya said in a tweet. Biya, who has ruled virtually by decree since taking office, scrapped term limits from the constitution in 2008, allowing him to run again and prompting riots in which more than 40 people were killed. After a meeting with Biya on Friday, African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki said the organisation would send an observation mission to the Oct. 7 polls, which come at a turbulent time for the Central African country and for Biya.  A separatist insurgency in the western English-speaking regions has killed more than 80 troops since September, while a drop in the price of Cameroon’s key cocoa and oil exports has weighed on the economy. A convoy carrying Cameroon’s defence minister, Joseph Beti Assomo, was attacked on Thursday in the southwest, army spokesman Colonel Didier Badjeck said on Friday. The minister was unharmed and the convoy resumed its journey, Badjeck said. Another military source said at least six separatist fighters were killed during the attack.

2018-07-13,"LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Investors switched to defensive equities and bonds in the week to July 11 as the U.S. slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports and then raised the stakes by threatening another round on an extra $200 billion of goods. Investors worry that a full-blown China-U.S. trade conflict could hurt global exports, investment and growth, and have scrambled to take risk off the table. Bonds attracted inflows of $5.6 billion — their biggest inflows in 12 weeks — data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) showed on Friday, while defensive equity sectors such as healthcare enjoyed their largest inflows in a year, pulling in some $800 million. Overall, equity funds attracted some $1.2 billion, with the United States pulling in $4.3 billion, Europe $4.2 billion and Japan $1.9 billion. Yet BAML noted that 34 MSCI equity indices were down year-to-date, and only 11 were up after a bruising first half for global markets. Turkish equities are the biggest faller, down 36.7 percent, as investors have grown concerned by the outlook for monetary policy under President Tayyip Erdogan, who has moved quickly to cement his power since winning an election. Other big losers include Brazilian equities, down 15.3 percent, and South African stocks, down 13.3 percent. As a whole, emerging equities are down 6.6 percent, towards the bottom of BAML’s cross-asset table of winners and losers in dollar terms. Perhaps not surprisingly then, emerging market equity funds suffered redemptions of $1.3 billion in an eighth straight week of outflows. But emerging market debt funds enjoyed their first inflows in three months, attracting a modest $900 million. The lion’s share of the fixed income flows continued to go to investment grade bond funds, which pulled in $2.3 billion, while high yield bond funds ended their nine-week drought, attracting $500 million.

2018-07-13,"(Adds comments from union, mediator, background) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, July 13 (Reuters) - A four-day oil workers’ strike in Norway that may escalate on Monday would have to last a month to impact Aker BP’s production from the Valhall field in the North Sea, the Norwegian energy company said. Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, closing Shell’s Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Four days in and the conflicting parties were still not talking to each other, a union official and a mediator told Reuters on Friday. Aker BP Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said activity at the Valhall IP water injection and Valhall DP drilling platforms would stop if the strike escalated. “If the strike is prolonged it will have later in the year impact on when wells are back in production ... if that is going to happen it means the strike has to be quite long,” he said during the firm’s second-quarter results presentation. Aker BP later told Reuters a strike of a month to six weeks could impact output at the field by “a few thousands barrels per day”. “Some of the wells that are drilled are planned to be put in production at the end of this year. If the strike lasts, the output will move to next year, which would have an impact on this year’s production outlook,” investor relations contact Kjetil Bakken said. In the short term, Aker BP plans to use any lost drilling time to perform maintenance and activities to raise the flow of oil and gas, Hersvik said. Aker BP holds a 90 percent stake in the Valhall field, which produced 13.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2017. The firm has plans to increase production. Just two days before 901 more oil workers could walk out, Norway’s Safe union and the country’s Shipowners’ Association, representing employers, have yet to talk to each other, the union’s negotiator said. “So far there is no contact. If they want to talk they have to do so,” Roy Aleksandersen told Reuters. A mediator appointed to smooth negotiations said neither side had tried to reach him since the industrial action began.

2018-07-13,"PARIS (Reuters) - The United States has rejected a French request for waivers for its companies operating in Iran that Paris sought after President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Le Figaro. Paris had singled out key areas where it expected either exemptions or extended wind-down periods for French companies, including energy, banking, pharmaceuticals and automotive. Officials had expressed little hope for securing the waivers, which were critical for oil and gas major Total (TOTF.PA) to continue a multibillion-dollar gas project in Iran and for carmaker PSA Group (PEUP.PA) to pursue its joint venture. French reinsurer Scor SE (SCOR.PA) said on Friday it will not seek new contracts or renew existing business in Iran, given the U.S. sanctions. Most international insurers in Iran are working with the shipping and energy industries in the country. “We have just received Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin’s response: it’s negative,” Le Maire told Le Figaro in an interview published on Friday. Le Maire said Europe needed to react quickly and protect its economic sovereignty. “Europe must provide itself with the tools it needs to defend itself against extra-territorial sanctions,” Le Maire added. Washington announced in May it was imposing new economic penalties on Tehran after pulling out of a multilateral 2015 agreement, under which Tehran had agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump’s sanctions are aimed at pressuring Iran to negotiate a new agreement to halt its nuclear programmes that might include Tehran’s regional activities and ballistics development. In particular, Washington wants to curtail the oil exports that are key to Iran’s economic revival.  Earlier this month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani appeared to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from its neighbours if Washington pressed ahead with trying to force countries to stop buying Iranian oil.

2018-07-13,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] must hand over e-mails in connection with lawsuits brought by investors against Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE) in connection with the Volkswagen (VW) (VOWG_p.DE) diesel scandal, a Stuttgart regional court ruled on Friday. Investors in two separate suits claimed that Porsche SE, which controls 52.2 percent of VW’s voting rights, had not disclosed the financial risks of VW’s emissions scandal quickly enough when it emerged in 2015. Their lawyers demanded that Bosch provide e-mails concerning its business with VW. Bosch, which makes an engine control unit used by several top automakers including VW, had protested, saying it had the right to refuse to provide evidence. The Stuttgart court ruled that Bosch had no such right in this case. It said the e-mails showed Bosch acted in accordance with the law, which meant it could not argue that it risked incriminating itself by handing them over. Providing the e-mails would also not risk causing direct financial damage to the company or to anyone to whom it is accountable, it said. Nor could Bosch refuse based on its right to protect trade secrets, since manipulation of engine control software is illegal and therefore not protected by law. Bosch said it would await the court’s full written opinion and then consider how to respond. “The company reserves the right to file a legal challenge to protect the interests of Bosch,” it said in a statement. Preference shares in Porsche SE fell by more than 40 percent in the two weeks after the VW emissions scandal broke.  They remain nearly 10 percent below their value prior to the news that VW had cheated on emissions tests.

2018-07-13,"* Novak says Russia may raise oil output by more than 200,000 bpd * Novak says global deal members may react quickly (Writes through, adds quotes) By Vladimir Soldatkin and Oksana Kobzeva MOSCOW, July 13 (Reuters) - Russia and other leading oil producers may boost oil output further if supply shortages hit the global oil market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday. The expected drop in Iranian crude exports this year due to renewed U.S. sanctions, coupled with a decline in Venezuela’s production and outages in Libya, Canada and the North Sea have driven oil prices to their highest since 2014 in recent weeks. OPEC and other key producers including Russia responded to the tightness by easing a supply-cut agreement in June. The deal effectively increases combined oil output by 1 million barrels per day (bpd), of which Russia’s share stands at 200,000 bpd. “If we need more than 1 million bpd, I don’t rule out that we can quickly discuss it and make a quick decision,” Novak told reporters, adding that the leading oil producers can get together and discuss the market situation at a teleconference. He also said Russia may surpass the 200,000 level of increases if there is a need for it. The International Energy Agency said on Thursday that there were already “very welcome” signs that output from leading producers had been boosted and may reach a record. The global energy watchdog however said the disruptions underscored the pressure on global supplies as the world’s spare production capacity cushion “might be stretched to the limit”. Novak said higher crude prices this year would add 2.5 trillion roubles ($40.14 billion) to state coffers this year. The minister also said that the war of tariffs between the United States and China have a negative impact on the global economy and boosted oil price volatility.

Expectations of a bumper U.S. earnings season and news that China’s overall global export growth beat expectations led European shares up on Friday with industrials and technology sending the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.2 percent. Markets appeared broadly risk-friendly as a weakening safe-haven yen helped lift Japan’s Nikkei stock index 2 percent. That followed the S&P500 hitting four-month highs on Wall Street overnight. Yet fears about the impact of an escalating U.S.-China trade war continue to cloud the outlook, encouraging investors into the safety of the dollar. Data showing China’s trade surplus with the United States swelling to a record in June could further inflame a trade dispute with Washington. “The record surplus with the U.S. will inevitably get top billing ... China’s exporters have been front-loading exports to beat the imposition of tariffs, implying a relatively sharp drop in coming months,” ADM Investor Services market strategist Mark Otswald said. With investors braced for the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs, one of China’s main indexes edged lower and China’s yuan headed for its fifth straight week of losses. While China has vowed to retaliate against the proposed new U.S. tariffs — 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods — the lack of a specific response to date has sparked global relief. On Friday, S&P500 e-mini futures rose to a five-month high on expectations of solid earnings growth among U.S. firms despite the trade war concern. Offering some reassurance to investors, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday the United States and China could reopen trade talks if Beijing was serious about structural reforms of its business practices. “Some have suggested that Chinese officials are easing back their rhetoric with the intention of going back to the negotiation table, perhaps in light of increased concerns about economic impacts,” ANZ analysts wrote in a note on Friday. The options available to Beijing include boycotting American goods, selling off U.S. Treasury holdings or sharply devaluing the yuan. In commodity markets, oil prices have had a wild week with both the main benchmarks suffering heavy losses as traders focused on the return of Libyan oil to the market. Oil prices fell on Friday, with Brent crude dropping 35 cents to $74.10 a barrel and heading for a weekly fall of nearly 4 percent. A warning on spare capacity by the International Energy Agency (IEA) helped Brent recoup some losses on Thursday. Copper eased about half a percent on Friday and was poised for a fifth straight weekly fall, its longest decline since 2015, on concerns about weaker demand in face of the U.S.-China trade dispute. The dollar, which has been a safe haven amid global uncertainty over trade, touched 112.795 against the yen, its highest level in six months, boosted by expectations of higher U.S. inflation. The greenback was the strongest major currency this week and the dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.4 percent at 95.142. The euro fell to a nine-day low of $1.1629. Analysts said the dollar’s rally could soon run out of steam, however. “The big risk (for the dollar) that we see is the potential for U.S. GDP growth expectations to adjust lower as investors come to terms with the idea that the U.S. economy is not immune to a global trade war,” Viraj Patel, a currencies analyst at ING, said in a note. Sterling fell 0.8 percent to a 1-1/2 week low on Friday of $1.3103 as a resurgent dollar and comments by U.S. President Donald Trump that a possible U.S.-British trade deal was probably dead sapped demand for the pound. There was plenty of pain for emerging market stocks and currencies, including the biggest weekly loss for Turkey’s lira since the height of the financial crisis a decade ago. The lira has lost 22 percent of its value against dollar this year, reflecting investor concern about monetary policy and economic management by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who appointed his son-in-law as finance minister this week.

2018-07-13,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as its overall exports grew at a solid pace, a result that could further inflame a bitter trade dispute with Washington. But signs exporters were rushing shipments before tariffs went into effect in the first week of July suggest the spike in the surplus was a one-off, with analysts expecting a less favorable trade balance for China in coming months as duties on exports start to bite.  The data came after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in its trade row with China on Tuesday, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items. China’s trade surplus with the United States, which is at the center of the tariff tussle, widened to a record monthly high of $28.97 billion, up from $24.58 billion in May, according to Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008.  The record surplus “won’t help already sour relations and escalating tensions”, Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office at Everbright Sun Hung Kai, wrote in a note.  Trump, who has demanded Beijing cut the trade surplus, could use the latest result to further ratchet up pressure on China after both sides last week imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other’s goods. Washington has warned it may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - nearly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.  The dispute has jolted global financial markets, raising worries a full-scale trade war could derail the world economy.    Chinese stocks fell into bear market territory and the yuan currency has skidded, though there have been signs in recent days its central bank is moving to slow the currency’s declines. China’s June exports rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, China General Administration of Customs reported, beating forecasts for a 10 percent increase according to the latest Reuters poll of 39 analysts, and down from a 12.6 percent gain in May.  China’s commerce ministry confirmed last month that Chinese exporters were front-loading exports to the U.S. to get ahead of expected tariffs - a situation that could exacerbate any slowdown in shipments toward the year-end.    “Looking ahead, export growth will cool in the coming months as US tariffs start to bite alongside a broader softening in global demand,” Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a note, though he noted a weaker yuan should help offset some of the decline. China’s exports to the United States rose 13.6 percent in the first half of 2018 from a year earlier, while its imports from the U.S. rose 11.8 percent in the same period. Separate data suggested some Chinese retailers moved up orders to the U.S. to insulate themselves from the intensifying trade war that threatens to send up costs on a growing number of consumer products. For January-June China’s trade surplus with the United States rose to $133.76 billion, compared with about $117.51 billion in the same period last year.  After a strong start to the year, growth in China’s exports has moderated recently, and is expected to face more pressure from the initial round of U.S. tariffs. Both official and private business surveys reported softer export orders last month. China’s foreign trade faces risks of slowing in the second half of the year, General Administration of Customs spokesman Huang Songping told a news conference - a view backed by analysts and likely to put more strain on an economy already feeling the pinch from a multi-year debt battle that has driven up corporate borrowing costs. Investors fear a prolonged trade battle with the United States could harm business confidence and investment, disrupting global supply chains and harming growth in China and the rest of the world.  South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, warned on Thursday that components and materials used in home appliances, computers and communications devices could be caught in the crossfire of the trade war. Imports grew 14.1 percent in June, customs said, missing analysts’ forecast of a 20.8 percent growth, and compared with a 26 percent rise in May. The commerce ministry also said this week it will use funds collected from tariffs charged on imports from the U.S. to help ease the impact of U.S. trade actions on Chinese companies and their employees. In a sign Beijing is seeking alternative supplies of the commodities as it hit U.S. imports with extra tariffs, China had dropped import tariffs on a range of animal feed ingredients from several Asian countries. Separate customs data on Friday showed imports of commodities from soybeans to crude oil eased compared with a year ago, but China’s steel mills and aluminum smelters sold much more abroad spurred by higher international prices amid growing concerns about slowing demand growth. The data could renew longstanding criticism from the United States and Europe that the world’s top metal producer is selling its surplus product abroad, hurting foreign rivals.  “We expect slowing export growth to put downward pressure on the current account and RMB (yuan), and believe China is likely to be willing to make concessions in future rounds of trade negotiations with the U.S.,” Nomura analysts said in a note to clients.

2018-07-13,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A major explosion at a chemical plant in southwestern China has killed 19 people and injured 12, authorities said on Friday, the latest deadly industrial incident in the world’s largest producer of chemicals. It comes amid a drive to strengthen industrial safety, with China ramping up checks over the last year, in the wake of some high-profile incidents at coal mines and chemical plants.  The cause of Thursday evening’s blast at Yibin Hengda Technology in an industrial park several hours southeast of Chengdu, the capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, is not yet known, the local government in Jiang’an county said. “I heard seven explosions in ten minutes,” an eyewitness told domestic news agency Beijing News. “It took a couple dozen firefighter trucks to put out the fire.” The injured are in stable condition and an investigation has begun, state news agency Xinhua said. The company, which makes chemicals for the food and pharmaceutical industries, did not immediately answer telephone calls from Reuters to seek information. Photographs on Chinese social media showed a huge fire and plumes of smoke rising from the facility. The fire, which broke out early on Thursday evening, was put out by 11:30 p.m. (1530 GMT), the government said in its statement.  “I heard a big explosion, it was really loud and I felt the ground shaking,” Liu Ping, a manager from the industrial park told China Newsweek, who was in his office at the time of the eruption. “My first response was that something was wrong and I went the window and saw thick smoke rising from the east.” A trio of three-storey buildings were reduced to their steel frames by the explosion, the Sichuan Daily newspaper said, citing eyewitness accounts. Footage on its website on Friday afternoon showed the skeleton of the burnt-out buildings.     Windows of nearby buildings were shattered by the explosion at the factory, which is surrounded by a sand and gravel plant, it added. The plant has three production lines, making 300 tonnes per year (tpy) of benzoic acid, which is used in food preservatives, and 2,000 tpy of 5-nitroisophthalic acid, for medicines and dyes, the regional environmental protection bureau says.  China’s breakneck pace of economic growth during the last decade has resulted in a spate of industrial accidents. In 2015, an explosion in a chemical warehouse in the northern port city of Tianjin killed 165 people. Last year, a blast at a petrochemical plant in eastern Shandong province killed eight people and injured nine.

2018-07-13,"(Reuters) - Investment bank JP Morgan on Friday raised its outlook for oil prices, but lowered its forecast for global crude demand-growth this year amid increasing uncertainty over international trade.     The U.S. bank said prices for Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil markets, would average $70 per barrel in both 2018 and 2019, up from an earlier forecast of $65 and $60 per barrel respectively. Brent stood at around $74 on Friday LCOc1. “Uncertainty around actual OPEC production increases, current budget constraints and sanction effects could mean near-term oil prices remain elevated,” the bank’s European equity research team said in a note. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in June agreed on modest increases in oil production starting in July but it is not yet clear how those will pan out, while the United States is set to reimpose sanctions on major crude supplier Iran in November. However, the bank said oil prices would be capped by “rising OPEC spare capacity and short-cycle U.S. shale well economics against a muted demand growth-backdrop in 2018/19”. It revised its 2018 demand-growth outlook to 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.4 million previously, though its 2019 forecast edged up a touch to 1.1 million bpd from 1 million. “The global macro outlook, weakness in emerging market currencies, impact of the last rally in oil prices, impact of sanctions on Iran and rising trade uncertainties are all potential risks to oil demand-growth,” the bank said.  Washington and Beijing have been descending deeper into a tit-for-tat trade war, with steep tariffs slapped on a raft of goods by both sides. JP Morgan said it expected global oil supply to remain robust despite short-term disruptions, forecasting OPEC supply in 2018 at about 32.9 million bpd. It said non-OPEC supply was expected to increase by 2.2 million bpd year-on-year in 2018 and by 1.7 million bpd in 2019, “driven significantly by the U.S. as well as Canada, Russia, Kazakhstan and Brazil”. The bank added that volatility seen in oil markets this year would likely to continue.  “We expect continued price fluctuations within a wide $50-80/barrel range, with the strip gravitating lower over the medium-term and a wider Brent/WTI crude differential.” Reporting by Apeksha Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Joseph Radford",https://uk.reuters.com/article/research-crude-jp-morgan/jp-morgan-raises-oil-price-outlook-but-trims-demand-growth-forecast-idUKL4N1U92KQ,13 Jul 2018,"Investment bank JP Morgan on Friday

The stock failed to trade higher than the issue price of A$2.50 and closed at A$2.40 after its owners, led by global energy trader Vitol, raised A$2.65 billion ($1.96 billion) selling 55 percent of the company in the initial public offering. The float was priced at the bottom of the bidding range at 13.1 times forecast net profit for the year to June 2019, a slight discount to rival Caltex Australia Ltd. Caltex also fell on Friday, ending down 1.4 percent in a flat broader market. Fund managers were a bit surprised at the drop as the IPO had good support from institutional investors. The volume was not heavy, at less than 3 percent of the shares on issue, suggesting retail investors disappointed with Viva’s weak opening may have sold out. One fund manager said they shouldn’t have expected to turn a quick profit on day one. “It’s not one you’d be expecting to make a big ‘stag’ on since it’s a stable, yielding business,” said Wilson Asset Management portfolio manager Matthew Hauptman. Vitol and its unnamed partners built Viva Energy after buying Royal Dutch Shell’s former refinery in Geelong near Melbourne and its petrol stations in Australia for $2.6 billion in 2014. They have since spent more than A$1 billion improving the business, including buying Shell’s jet fuel operations, expanding its petrol station network, and acquiring a 50 percent stake in independent fuel retailer Liberty Oil. The company expects its net profit to grow by about 14 percent to A$370.8 million in the year to June 2019, according to the float prospectus. “I have great confidence on our ability to deliver on our long-term forecasts and I look forward to leading a team that will continue to produce outstanding long-term shareholder returns,” Viva Energy Chief Executive Scott Wyatt said in an emailed comment.

2018-07-13,"PARIS, July 13 (Reuters) - The United States has rejected a French request for waivers for its companies operating in Iran that Paris sought after President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Le Figaro. Paris had singled out key areas where it expected either exemptions or extended wind-down periods for French companies, including energy, banking, pharmaceuticals and automotive. French officials had expressed little hope for securing the waivers, which were critical for oil and gas major Total to continue a multi-billion-dollar gas project in Iran and for carmaker PSA Group to pursue its joint venture . “We have just received Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin’s response: it’s negative,” Le Maire told Le Figaro in an interview published on Friday. Le Maire said Europe needed to react quickly and protect its economic sovereignty. “Europe must provide itself with the tools it needs to defend itself against extra-territorial sanctions,” Le Maire added. Washington announced in May it was imposing new economic penalties on Tehran after pulling out of a multilateral 2015 agreement, under which Tehran had agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Trump’s sanctions are aimed at pressuring Iran to negotiate a new agreement to halt its nuclear programmes that might include Tehran’s regional activities and ballistics development. In particular, Washington wants to curtail the oil exports that are key to Iran’s economic revival. Earlier this month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani appeared to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from its neighbours if Washington pressed ahead with trying to force countries to stop buying Iranian oil.

2018-07-13,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan +0.6 pct * Nikkei +1.9 pct on weak yen, Fast Retailing earnings * European shares tipped to open higher By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, July 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares extended their recovery on Friday, as investors shifted their focus to bullish expectations for Wall Street earnings and as a weaker yen supported Japanese stocks, though Sino-U.S. trade tensions have tempered exuberance. Keeping trade squarely in view was Chinese trade data, which showed its trade surplus with the United States swelling to a record in June, a result that could further inflame a bitter trade dispute with Washington. Financial spreadbetters expect European stocks to rise, with London’s FTSE set to open up 41 points, Frankfurt’s DAX up 57 points and Paris’ CAC up 25 points. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.6 percent, adding to a 0.6 percent rise on Thursday, after U.S. stocks ended the day higher. Analysts are forecasting that S&P 500 companies’ earnings grew about 21 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at Axi Trader in Sydney, said that a good earnings season could nevertheless bring with it some “troubling outlooks.” “If you recall what happened when the CFO of Caterpillar said last earnings season that Q1 was likely to be the high water mark. All we need is somebody with serious exposure to the global economy to do something similar and we’re talking about the downside again for stocks, not the upside,” he said. However, fears over the impact of an escalating U.S.-China trade war continued to cloud the outlook as investors braced for the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs, with one of China’s main indexes lower. China’s overall global export growth topped expectations, however, possibly as its exporters and big American customers rushed to beat U.S. tariffs. The MSCI index rose on gains in Taiwan shares, which rose 1.2 percent, Seoul’s Kospi, which added 1 percent, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, which was 0.4 percent higher. Australian shares were flat after adding 0.8 percent on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1.9 percent higher. The index hit a two-and-a-half-week high Friday supported by weakness in the yen, and as index-heavy stock Fast Retailing jumped after posting strong third-quarter results. In China, the blue-chip CSI300 index was up 0.3 percent after dipping into the red, and the Shanghai Composite index was 0.3 percent lower. There was little immediate reaction in Chinese markets to the trade data. Shares in Asia have been see-sawing as investors ponder the impact of Washington’s planned 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports. The U.S. slapped import tariffs of 25 percent on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6, prompting a matching response from China. While China has vowed to retaliate to the new tariffs, the lack of a specific response to date has sparked global relief, helped by expectations of strong corporate earnings. On Friday, S&P500 e-mini futures rose to a five-month high on expectations of solid earnings growth among U.S. firms despite the trade war threat. Offering some reassurance to investors spooked by trade war concerns, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the U.S. and China could reopen trade talks, but only if Beijing was willing “to make serious efforts to make structural changes.” “Some have suggested that Chinese officials are easing back their rhetoric with the intention of going back to the negotiation table, perhaps in light of increased concerns about economic impacts,” ANZ analysts wrote in a note on Friday. “But it is not clear whether it is truly a change in tone or if the U.S. news was a surprise to China’s economic team and a reaction is being prepared.” The dollar, which has been a safe haven amid global uncertainty over trade, touched 112.775 against the yen, its highest level in six months, boosted by expectations of higher U.S. inflation. At 0615 GMT, it was trading at 112.56. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.1 percent at 94.928. The euro was 0.1 percent weaker at $1.1656. In commodities, U.S. crude gained 0.1 percent to $70.37 a barrel. Brent crude was lower, falling 0.3 percent to $74.22 per barrel. Brent prices had risen on Thursday after a warning from the International Energy Agency about the world’s stretched oil supply cushion drove concerns about spare capacity. The warning came after supply disruptions in recent weeks from countries including Venezuela, Norway, Canada and Libya. Spot gold was 0.2 percent lower, trading at $1244.75 per ounce.

2018-07-13,"* Asia demand, China reactor ambitions to drive growth * Australia’s Tribeca to launch uranium mining fund * Tribeca looks for recovery in 2-4 years on Asia demand * Australia sees upward price pressure “over the longer term” By Melanie Burton MELBOURNE, July 13 (Reuters) - Seven years on from Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster, the beaten down uranium sector is attracting interest as analysts and investors see signs its time in the wilderness may drawing to an end. Years of low prices have forced cuts by large producers who have also shelved new investments, while reactor restarts in Japan and a drive by China to cut pollution point to a potential revival, although the timing of any pick-up is unclear. Australian fund manager Tribeca is betting on a sector recovery over the next two to four years, with the forthcoming launch of a uranium-focused mining investment fund. It expects uranium prices and mining shares to rally as Asian nations build new reactors to reduce their reliance on polluting fossil fuels. “You’ve seen Japan coming back ... China has made a very clear and aggressive focus on reducing pollution, that’s becoming a theme that the rest of the emerging market is picking up,” fund manager Guy Keller told Reuters. Uranium spot prices slumped from over $70 a pound pre-Fukushima to below $20 in late 2016. Tribeca sees term prices at least doubling from $20 a tonne over the next few years, Keller said. Tribeca plans to launch its open-ended fund on Aug. 1 with an overall target of $100 million. It will have a three-year lock-up and is targeting 15-20 mining investments to hold as well as taking physical price exposure. Japan last month confirmed plans to make nuclear power 20-22 percent of its total power mix by 2030, up from 2 pct in 2016, while China is set to boost nuclear power capacity by more than 60 percent to 58 gigawatt (GW) by the end of this decade. It sees that at around 150 GW by 2030. China’s nuclear reactors are already gaining global market share. China General Nuclear Corp (CGN) and France’s EDF are building a Hualong reactor in England, while China also has a deal to build a third large reactor in Pakistan. “Going forward, Chinese-made reactor technology will be exported and that will accelerate growth in emerging markets,” Keller said. Perth-based broker Argonaut also sees a recovery for the downtrodden sector. “We believe the uranium price is within two years of a sustained recovery,” it said in a recent report. Risks, however, include construction delays in China’s next generation plants, due to both protracted safety testing and difficulty in gaining funding given a current domestic power oversupply. China’s nuclear build-out is well behind schedule, noted Argonaut Hong Kong-based analyst Helen Lau. Australia, the world’s third largest producer, expects uranium prices to start rising slowly after recent production cuts. However, it sees spot prices rising only around $6 a pound from current levels to $28 by 2020, at which level “uranium will remain a loss-making commodity for most producers”, the Department of Industry said in its latest quarterly minerals report. Further out, however, it said new capacity under construction and the shake-out in supply should lead to “much greater upward price pressure over the longer term”.

2018-07-13,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Six of China’s biggest state-owned firms have drawn up plans to reduce debt and leverage in the coming two years, state media said on Friday, part of the country’s efforts to rejuvenate the debt-ridden sector. China began a new round of reforms in 2016 aimed at streamlining its lumbering state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by introducing private capital, curbing overcapacity, shutting down “zombie” subsidiaries and restructuring assets.  It has already cut the total number of companies under central government control to 96, down from 117 in 2012. The official China Securities Journal said on Friday that the six firms - including the country’s biggest refiner, the Sinopec Group (600028.SS) - have already finished drawing up their debt-reduction plans and have submitted them to the regulator, the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Two of China’s big state power groups, Huaneng and Huadian, as well as the China Railway Construction Corporation (601186.SS), the China State Construction Engineering Corp (601668.SS) and the China Merchants Group, are also among the six pilot enterprises, it said, adding that SASAC itself was also preparing to release its “work plan” to control debt ratios at the 96 firms now under its jurisdiction.  The 96 companies are under political pressure to cut debt to asset ratios by an average of 2 percentage points by 2020. SASAC chairman Xiao Yaqing told a meeting of executives earlier this month that firms needed to adjust investment structures, slash excess capacity and improve cash flow management in order to achieve the goal.  Debt to asset ratios among central government enterprises stood at an average of 66 percent by the end of June, down 0.3 percentage points since the beginning of the year, SASAC said at a Thursday briefing. The figure still amounts to about 36 trillion yuan ($5.4 trillion).

2018-07-13,"KURASHIKI, Japan, July 13 (Reuters) - Municipal workers in Japan struggled on Friday to restore water supply in the flood-hit western region a week after inundation caused by a record downpour killed more than 200 people in the worst weather disaster in 36 years. Communities that grappled with rising floodwaters last week now find themselves battling scorching summer temperatures well above 30 degrees Celsius (86°F), as foul-smelling garbage piles up in mud-splattered streets. “We need the water supply back,” said Hiroshi Oka, 40, a resident helping to clean up the Mabi district in one of the hardest-hit areas, the city of Kurashiki, where more than 200,000 households have gone without water for a week. “What we are getting is a thin stream of water, and we can’t flush toilets or wash our hands,” he added, standing over a 20-litre (4.4-gallon) plastic tank that was only partly filled after almost four hours of waiting. Water supply has been restored to some parts of the district, a city official told Reuters, but he did not know when normal operation would resume, as engineers are still trying to locate water pipeline ruptures. The soaring temperatures have fuelled concern that residents, many still in temporary evacuation centres, may suffer heat strokes or illness as hygiene levels deteriorate. Public broadcaster NHK has spread advice on coping with high temperatures and maintain hygiene, such as a video tutorial on how to make a diaper from a towel and plastic shopping bag. More than 70,000 military, police and firefighters have fanned out to tackle the aftermath of the floods. There have been 204 deaths, the government said, with dozens still missing. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the government spokesman, urged people in flood-hit areas to take precautions against the heat, and guard against thunderstorms. “People still need to be aware of the possibility of further landslides,” he told a regular news conference on Friday. Severe weather has increasingly battered Japan in recent years, including similar floods last year that killed dozens of people, raising questions about the impact of global warming. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who cancelled a scheduled overseas trip to deal with the rescue effort, visited Kurashiki on Thursday, and said he aimed to visit other flood-damaged areas on Friday and over the weekend.

2018-07-13,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s crude oil imports fell for a second month in a row in June to the lowest since December, as shrinking margins and volatile oil prices led some independent refiners, known as “teapots”, to scale back purchases. June shipments came in at 34.35 million tonnes, or 8.36 million barrels per day (bpd), according to data from the General Administration of Customs. That was down 9 percent from 9.2 million bpd in May and also down from 8.8 million bpd in June last year. Thomson Reuters Oil Research had pegged China’s crude oil arrivals in June at 35.13 million tonnes. Imports for the first half of this year were still up 5.8 percent from a year earlier at 225 million tonnes, or about 9.07 million bpd, the official data showed. While some state-run and independent plants were shut for regular maintenance, others took advantage of weakening margins and oil prices at near four-year-highs to conduct extended shutdowns.  “The numbers are lower than we expected, mostly because of slowing down at some teapot plants as they face growing domestic competition in refined fuel supplies and weakening margins,” said Seng Yick Tee of consultancy SIA Energy. “The oil price volatility is certainly not helping as not many independent plants are doing sophisticated hedging.”  Shandong Shengxing Chemical Group shut its crude oil unit at the end of April and only expects to resume operations around mid-August. Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical, a Rizhao-based teapot with annual import quotas of 3.2 million tonnes, has kept its crude unit shut since late May without a definite date to reopen. Imports of oil products fell 26.5 percent to 2.22 million tonnes, while oil product exports fell 22.0 percent to 4.78 million tonnes, data showed.  However, total gas imports in June - including pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas - rose to 7.3 million tonnes, up 31 percent from a year ago, customs said.  Year-to-date imports hit 42.08 million tonnes, 35.4 percent higher than the same period in 2017. Gas maintained high growth as demand remained strong for storage fills as well as for industrial uses.  Local governments are rolling out hikes in benchmark city-gate gas prices for residential use, following a policy change by Beijing in May to unify residential prices with industrial users. In a boost for gas producers, the change effectively removes long-running subsidies for the residential sector.

Growth in imports for June showed a moderate slowdown from May, official data showed on Friday. The data came after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in its trade dispute with China on Tuesday, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items. Firing the first shots in a trade war that has rattled financial markets and raised risks to the global economy, Washington last week imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, drawing rapid retaliatory duties by Beijing on the same amount of U.S. exports to China. China’s June exports rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, beating forecasts for a 10 percent increase according to the latest Reuters poll of 39 analysts, and down from a 12.6 percent gain in May. After a strong start to the year, growth in China’s exports has moderated recently, and is expected to face more pressure from the initial round of U.S. tariffs. Both official and private business surveys reported softer export orders last month as the trade row deepens. China’s foreign trade faces risks of slowing in the second half of the year, General Administration of Customs spokesman Huang Songping told a news conference, though he said Beijing was capable of handling challenges. Analysts expect shipments growth to slow in the second half of the year, putting more strain on an economy already feeling the pinch from a multi-year debt battle that has driven up corporate borrowing costs. Investors fear a prolonged trade battle with the United States could harm business confidence and investment, disrupting global supply chains and harming growth in China and the rest of the world. China’s commerce ministry confirmed last month that Chinese exporters were front-loading shipments to the U.S. to get ahead of expected tariffs - a situation that could exacerbate any slowdown in shipments toward the year-end. Imports grew 14.1 percent in June, customs said, missing analysts’ forecast of a 20.8 percent growth, and compared with a 26 percent rise in May. The commerce ministry also said this week it will use funds collected from tariffs charged on imports from the U.S. to help ease the impact of U.S. trade actions on Chinese companies and their employees. The ministry encouraged companies to increase import of soybean, soymeal, vehicles, aquatic products from other markets. In a sign Beijing is seeking alternative supplies of the commodities as it hit U.S. imports with extra tariffs, China had dropped import tariffs on a range of animal feed ingredients from several Asian countries. China’s exports to the United States rose 13.6 percent in the first half of 2018 from a year earlier, while its imports from the U.S. rose 11.8 percent in the same period. The trade balance between the two countries, which is at the centre of the trade dispute, continued to move in favour of China. In June the surplus with the U.S. was at $28.97 billion, up from $24.58 billion in May, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data released on Friday. The surplus was the highest ever with the U.S. for any single month, according to Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008. For January-June, it rose to $133.76 billion, compared with about $117.51 billion in the same period last year. Trump has railed against China’s trade surplus with the U.S., which ran at $375 billion in 2017, and has demanded Beijing cut it. Washington has warned it may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. China logged a trade surplus of $41.61 billion for the month, compared with forecasts for a $27.61 billion surplus in June and a surplus of $24.92 billion in May. The surplus was China’s highest since December. Reporting by Yawen Chen and Elias Glenn; additional reporting

2018-07-13,"BEIJING, July 13 (Reuters) - Independent Chinese refiner, Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical Group, has no definite plan to reopen its crude oil distillation unit (CDU) after shutting it down sometime in late May, two industry sources with knowledge of the plant’s operation said on Friday. The plant, in the city of Rizhao in Shandong province, owns a CDU with a capacity of around 70,000 barrels per day (bpd), which it shut down after a local government order to cut down pollution ahead of a regional summit in June, the sources said. Haiyou, however, will keep open its 1 million tonne-per-year delayed coker, a unit that processes residual fuel oil into lighter refined products such as diesel and gasoline, said one of the sources. Falling profit margins following Beijing’s move to tighten tax rules for independent oil refiners and blenders could be one reason for Haiyou’s extended shutdown, the two sources said. Haiyou’s large debt burden could be another reason as the plant struggles to secure financing for oil purchases, said the second source, who has knowledge of the plant’s financial status. Haiyou has an annual crude oil import quota of 3.2 million tonnes. Both sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to press. Multiple calls to the company went unanswered.

2018-07-13,"SHANGHAI, July 13 (Reuters) - Most Asian share markets rose on Friday, heartened by gains on Wall Street fueled by expectations of strong U.S. earnings, but China’s markets wobbled as investors braced for the impact of broadening, tit-for-tat Chinese-U.S tariffs. Adding to fears that even stronger punitive measures from Washington may be on the way, China reported a trade surplus with the United States of $28.97 billion in June, the highest on record, according to Reuters calculations. China’s overall global export growth topped expectations, however, possibly as its exporters and big American customers rushed to beat U.S. tariffs. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.6 percent, adding to a 0.6 percent rise on Thursday, after U.S. stocks ended the day higher. The MSCI index rose on gains in Taiwan shares, which rose 0.8 percent, Seoul’s Kospi, which added 1 percent, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, which was 0.5 percent higher. Australian shares turned lower, falling 0.2 percent after adding 0.8 percent Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1.3 percent higher. In China, the blue-chip CSI300 index was up 0.1 percent after dipping into the red, and the Shanghai Composite index was 0.4 percent lower. There was little immediate reaction in Chinese markets to the trade data. Shares in Asia have been see-sawing as investors ponder the impact of Washington’s planned 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imports. The U.S. slapped import tariffs of 25 percent on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6, prompting a matching response from China. While China has vowed to retaliate to the new tariffs, the lack of a specific response to date has sparked global relief, helped by expectations of strong corporate earnings. On Friday, S&P500 e-mini futures rose to a five-month high on expectations of solid earnings growth among U.S. firms despite the trade war threat. Analysts are forecasting that S&P 500 companies’ earnings grew about 21 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at Axi Trader in Sydney, said that a good earnings season could nevertheless bring with it some “troubling outlooks.” “If you recall what happened when the CFO of Caterpillar said last earnings season that Q1 was likely to be the high water mark. All we need is somebody with serious exposure to the global economy to do something similar and we’re talking about the downside again for stocks, not the upside,” he said. Offering some reassurance to investors spooked by trade war concerns, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the U.S. and China could reopen trade talks, but only if Beijing was willing “to make serious efforts to make structural changes.” “Some have suggested that Chinese officials are easing back their rhetoric with the intention of going back to the negotiation table, perhaps in light of increased concerns about economic impacts,” ANZ analysts wrote in a note on Friday. “But it is not clear whether it is truly a change in tone or if the U.S. news was a surprise to China’s economic team and a reaction is being prepared.” The dollar, which has been a safe haven amid global uncertainty over trade, touched 112.70 against the yen, its highest level since Jan. 10, boosted by expectations of higher U.S. inflation. At 0305 GMT, it was flat on the day at 112.58. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up less than 0.1 percent at 94.846. The euro was down a hair at $1.1667. In commodities, U.S. crude crept down to $70.30 a barrel. Brent crude gave up more ground, falling 0.5 percent to $74.10 per barrel. Brent prices had risen on Thursday after a warning from the International Energy Agency about the world’s stretched oil supply cushion drove concerns about spare capacity. The warning came after supply disruptions in recent weeks from countries including Venezuela, Norway, Canada and Libya. Spot gold was flat, trading at $1246.58 per ounce.

June’s imports also rebounded from 22.33 million tonnes in May, the data from the General Administration of Customs showed, after traders said China relaxed customs checks to let in foreign supplies. Robust imports led to higher inventories at port and power plants, easing worries that China’s electricity output might not be able to meet surging demand from provinces such as Hebei and Shandong due to hot weather. Major Chinese cities such as Wuhan in Hubei and Hefei in Henan province last month reported heavy loads on their power grid and indicated that they might started rationing electricity.

2018-07-13,"TOKYO, July 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Friday and were set for a second weekly fall, as the market shrugged off a warning that spare capacity may be stretched as OPEC and Russia increase production. Brent crude eased 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $74.25 by 0059 GMT. On Thursday it gained $1.05 a barrel, rebounding from a session low of $72.67. It is heading for a weekly fall of nearly 4 percent. U.S. crude dipped 6 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $70.27, after a five cent decline in the previous session. It is heading for a weekly decline of nearly 5 percent. It has been a wild week for oil prices with both the main benchmarks suffering heavy losses on Wednesday as traders focused on the return of Libyan oil to the market amid concerns about a China-U.S. trade war. However, a warning on spare capacity by the International Energy Agency (IEA) pushed Brent higher on Thursday, helping it recoup some losses. The IEA cautioned that the world’s oil supply cushion “might be stretched to the limit” due to production losses in several different countries. “Rising production from Middle East Gulf countries and Russia, welcome though it is, comes at the expense of the world’s spare capacity cushion, which might be stretched to the limit,” the Paris-based IEA said in its monthly report. “This vulnerability currently underpins oil prices and seems likely to continue doing so,” the agency said.

2018-07-13,"(Repeats July 12 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LbhIwR By John Kemp LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Brent crude prices registered their largest one-day fall in more than two years on Wednesday, in what was probably an indication hedge fund managers and other traders are realising profits after a year-long rally. Front-month futures slumped by $5.46 per barrel, or just under 7 percent, a daily price move more than three standard deviations away from the mean, and the largest one-day decline since February 2016. The market has suffered a larger percentage decline on only 44 days since the start of 1990, and it comes after a long period in which price volatility has been very low by historical standards. Traders and analysts have blamed the sudden drop on a cocktail of factors, including the reopening of oil export terminals in Libya and the worsening trade dispute between the United States and China. There have also been hints the United States will grant at least some waivers for countries to continue importing Iranian crude, easing fears of an extreme supply crunch after sanctions are reimposed in November. Saudi Arabia also sharply increased exports in June and is expected to raise them further in July, helping relieve fears about future shortages. The most likely explanation is a combination of all these factors, coupled with stretched market positioning and a lack of liquidity. Brent has shown signs of topping out for some time, even as prices remain close to their highest since 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2LbhIwR). Buoyant flat prices have concealed signs of weakness elsewhere in the calendar spreads as well as hedge fund positioning. Brent spreads, which cycle between contango and backwardation as the oil market alternates between over- and under-supply, have been softening for more than a month. The six-month futures spread peaked in a backwardation of $3.50 per barrel in late April, and had slipped to just $1.76 on Tuesday, before plunging to 63 cents on Wednesday. Hedge funds and other money managers have cut their bullish position in Brent futures and options from 632 million barrels in early April to just 457 million barrels by July 3. Portfolio managers hold just over eight bullish long positions in Brent for every bearish short position, but the ratio has come down from 20:1 in April. At the same time, fund managers have been gradually working down their bullish positions in refined fuels such as gasoline, heating oil and gasoil, contributing to downward pressure on crude. Overall, the fund community remains bullish on oil, anticipating that strong consumption growth and further disruptions in production will tighten the market even further in 2018 and 2019. But they are less bullish following the 75 percent run-up in Brent prices over the last 12 months and the market’s failure to break through the previous highs set in May. Fears about future supply disruptions have failed to push prices higher and cast doubt on the potential for further short-term gains. The resulting profit-taking has gradually sapped the momentum from the rally and probably contributed to the lack of liquidity behind Wednesday’s price move. The sharpest price drops were concentrated in near-dated futures contracts, which are where many hedge fund positions are held. Even after profit-taking in recent weeks, fund managers still held a historically high and lopsided bullish position in Brent futures, leaving them vulnerable to another bout of profit-taking. U.S. crude futures prices have remained supported by the interruption of pipeline deliveries into the U.S. Midwest as a result of the shutdown at Canada’s Syncrude plant. Hedge funds have actually been buying U.S. crude futures, adding 116 million barrels of net bullish positions in the last two weeks, even as they left Brent positions unchanged. But Brent has had no such local factors to support the market and on Wednesday it finally seemed to succumb to a profit-taking plunge. Markets exhibit strong cyclical behaviour. Once prices stop rising, they tend to fall, rather than hold at the peak. And the sharpest price falls in a market come not straight after the peak, but normally when prices have been under gentle pressure for some time, and the initial trickle of selling finally turns into a torrent. That is likely what happened on Wednesday.
