2018-11-04,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Investors stay focussed on Sino-U.S. trade war talks * Xi Jinping delivers speech later in the day * U.S. mid-term elections on Nov.6 By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The British pound jumped to a two-week high on Monday on hopes Britain was inching closer to a smooth Brexit, while Asian stocks will likely have a nervous start amid worries about shaky Sino-U.S. trade relations. With just five months to go until the UK exits the EU, Britain’s divorce talks are at an impasse, fuelling huge uncertainty among businesses and causing the value of sterling to see-saw on any news about a possible breakthrough in the negotiations. A Sunday Times report that an all-UK customs deal will be written into the agreement governing Britain’s withdrawal from the EU was enough to cheer investors who sent the pound to $1.3062, the highest since Oct. 22. The currency has faltered in seven of the 10 months of this year so far, losing as much as 3.6 percent. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s office called the Sunday Times report speculatory but added that 95 percent of the withdrawal agreement was settled and negotiations were ongoing. Elsewhere, investors will keep their eyes peeled for any headline on the Sino-U.S. trade war ahead of a meeting of the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies later this month. Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech at the China International Import Expo later in the day, which could provide further clues on the subject. Markets had climbed early on Friday on hopes the United States and China were mending their relations, but gains faded on news a tariff deal may not be imminent. The outlook for global shares has also been clouded by the prospect of faster rate rises in the United States amid robust economic data in recent months. On Friday, the world’s biggest economy reported solid jobs growth for October, with wages at 9-1/2-year highs, further boosting expectations for a December rate rise. “The U.S. employment report supports our view that the Federal Reserve will raise rates three more times from now until mid-2019,” Capital Economics said in a note. “After that, we suspect that the cumulative effect of monetary policy tightening will start taking a toll on the US economy, forcing the Fed to end its tightening cycle and pulling Treasury yields, the US stock market and the dollar down.” Broadly, trading is expected to be rangebound ahead of U.S. congressional midterm elections on Tuesday. Opinion polls show strong chances that Democrats may win control of the House of Representatives in the elections after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, with President Donald Trump’s Republican Party likely to keep the Senate. A Reuters analysis of the past half century shows stocks fared better in the two calendar years after congressional elections when Republicans control Congress and the presidency than when Democrats controlled the two branches, as well as during times of gridlock. In commodities, oil traders will keenly await the outcome of negotiations on possible waivers to U.S. sanctions on Iran. “Any deals allowing oil importers to continue buying from Iran could see prices come under further pressure,” ANZ said in a morning note to clients.

2018-11-04,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar named new heads to its giant state-run energy firm and deep-pocketed sovereign wealth fund on Sunday while appointing the CEO of its largest bank as its new trade minister. It was the first government shuffle in Qatar, the world’s top liquefied natural gas producer, since early 2016, but diplomats and analysts said the changes did not represent a significant shift in power. The wealthy country has been subject to a diplomatic and economic boycott by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt since June 2017. They accuse Qatar of backing terrorism and cozying up to Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty. Qatar’s ruler issued decrees outlining changes to the boards of state gas giant Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the world’s ninth largest sovereign wealth fund with about $300 billion in assets. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani was named chairman of QIA, which injected billions of dollars into Qatari banks last year to offset foreign outflows just after the Arab boycott began. Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al-Thani, the 30-year-old deputy and brother of the emir, was named chairman of Qatar Petroleum, which expects to ramp up gas production by some 43 percent over the next five to six years. Though limited, the cabinet shuffle pulled in business heavyweights like Qatar National Bank (QNB) CEO Ali Ahmed al-Kuwari, who was appointed to a new portfolio combining commerce and industry under one ministry. Saad al-Kaabi, the chief executive of QP, was named minister of state for energy affairs. New ministers were appointed to  head the departments of justice, of labor and social affairs, and of municipality and environment. Western diplomats and analysts did not see the shake-up as indicative of a shift in policy nearly 18 months since the start of the regional rift, which Qatar has weathered with new trade routes and higher oil prices that have helped it swing to a budgetary surplus this year.    “The cabinet shuffle was expected to come earlier, but was apparently on hold as the country dealt with the blockade and now as the ramifications have been successfully dealt with, it was time,” said Majed al-Ansari, an analyst and professor of political sociology at Qatar University. “It does not signal a change in policy or power shift in the government,” he said.      It was not clear whether Kuwari would retain his post at QNB, the Middle East’s largest lender by assets. The bank, which is 50 percent owned by the country’s sovereign wealth fund, did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. QP’s Al-Kaabi, a U.S.-educated engineer, rose through the ranks to become chief executive in 2014 and also sits on the board of the Qatar Investment Authority.   He has gained a reputation among executives of the world’s energy majors, such as Exxon (XOM.N), Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA), as a reliable counterpart for energy projects that have made the tiny nation of 2.6 million people the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Abdulla Abdulaziz Al Subaie was appointed minister of municipality and environment, a post seen as key to preparations for the country’s 2022 World Cup. Subaie has served as managing director and CEO of Qatar Rail, which expects to launch Doha’s first metro line this year. A separate decree on Sunday appointed Mohammed Bin Hamad Al-Thani chairman of the Qatar Financial Markets Authority as part of a shuffle of its board of directors.

2018-11-04,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Sunday Israel had asked for consultations on a special land deal agreed in their peace treaty that the Jordanian government wants to end.  Under the peace treaty, two border areas were recognised to be under Jordanian sovereignty but gave Israel special provisions to use the land and allow Israelis free access. Jordan formally notified Israel two weeks ago it would not renew the 25-year deal over Baquora where the Yarmouk River flows into the Jordan River and in the Ghumar area in the southern Wadi Araba desert where Israeli farmers have large plantations. Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told Reuters after the decision the kingdom was waiting for Israel to invoke a provision in the peace treaty to hold consultations after giving notice before the deadline. Petra state news agency quoted government spokeswoman Jumana Ghunaimat as saying Jordan had received the Israeli request but did not say when the discussions would begin. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged  Jordan’s move and said his country sought to enter negotiations on the possibility of extending the arrangement. The 25-year special regime would be automatically renewed unless either of the parties notified the other a year before expiry that it wished to terminate the agreement. Safadi said the deal, which was signed in November 1994, had been conceived as a temporary arrangement from the start. The kingdom had contemplated the move for a while before the Nov. 10 deadline. King Abdullah, who stressed the territories were Jordanian lands and would remain so, said the move was made in the “national interest” at a period of regional turmoil.  Jordan is one of only two Arab states that has a peace treaty with Israel and the two countries have a long history of close security ties. But the treaty is unpopular in Jordan where  pro-Palestinian sentiment is widespread.
