2018-11-02,"(Adds quotes) ISTANBUL, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Turkey has been told it will receive a waiver on U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil sales, Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said on Friday. The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. Washington says it will temporarily allow eight “jurisdictions” to keep importing Iranian oil when the sanctions come back into force on Monday. “Just a while ago ministry officials brought the news that the U.S. Secretary of State made a statement on limiting or lifting of sanctions for eight countries including Turkey,” Donmez told reporters. He said he welcomed the move, as Turkey had previously warned that the U.S. sanctions would “negatively impact the peace and economy of neighbouring countries like Turkey”. NATO member Turkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighbouring Iran has been one of its main sources of oil because of its proximity, the quality of its crude and favourable price differentials. An industry source said last month Turkey had already made efforts to cut its purchases ahead of the U.S. sanctions, but would prefer to keep up some level of Iranian oil imports past November.

2018-11-02,"* Few trades heard amid bloated storage, stranded ships * Mild weather, nuclear restarts in Japan dampen demand * Recent and upcoming LNG plant start-ups will add supply By Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) were flat this week, at two-month lows, as bloated storage levels in the region left cargoes stranded and deterred trade. December spot LNG LNG-AS was heard at $10.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the lowest since Aug. 10. Expectations of a mild winter and higher nuclear generation in Japan, the world’s largest LNG buyer, are weighing on prices after a frenzied September of buying by Asian utilities to replenish storage tanks left low after a hot summer. But inventory levels in Japan and South Korea, the world’s third largest purchaser, have now exceeded volumes seen in the previous three years for this time of the year. In China, state energy group CNPC said it finished injecting gas into its underground storage, with record volumes at more than 9 billion cubic metres by the end of October. Exxon Mobil Corp’s Papua New Guinea plant offered a cargo for delivery in the second half of December on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis, trade sources said. Angola offered to sell a cargo for delivery into Asia in December with bids due by Nov. 6 and remaining valid until Nov. 7, they said. Aside from such tenders, at least one Asian utility is trying to sell winter cargoes it does not need due to high stocks, a trader familiar with the Japanese LNG market said. And more supply is expected in the coming weeks that will offset any potential increase in demand as temperatures start dropping for winter. Inpex delivered this week its first LNG cargo from the giant Ichthys project in Australia, after multiple delays to the project’s start-up. And in the United States, Cheniere Energy is expected to commission its first cargo from the new Corpus Christie plant on Nov. 15. The oversupply and falling spot Asian LNG prices, as well as sky-high shipping costs, have diverted cargoes to Europe, where Belgium and the Netherlands took in record volumes in October. Nevertheless, even here gas storage levels are high with the Netherlands at 96 percent and France at 94 percent, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Belgium’s levels are lower at 54 percent, however the country is short on energy as six of its seven nuclear reactors are down for maintenance. Japan is likely to experience warmer than average weather between November and January, the country’s official forecaster said last week, implying low demand for heating. Nuclear power plant restarts at the world’s top LNG importer are also denting demand for the super-chilled fuel.

2018-11-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L), which has tried to take over Norwegian Air (NWC.OL), said on Friday it regards the short-haul market as its best opportunity for consolidation. Chief executive Willie Walsh told investors he expected to see airline consolidation in Europe and that IAG had the financial headroom needed to pursue acquisitions. “When we talk about consolidation it (Norwegian) is an opportunity, particularly if you look at the short-haul network and further consolidation in that short-haul network, it’s probably the best opportunity for us,” Walsh said. Walsh said he had nothing new to report on Norwegian, in which IAG owns a 4 percent stake, and which has rejected two approaches by the owner of BA, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling. IAG said on Friday most of its financial goals for 2019-2023 were the same as those made in a long-term plan last year. The group said it was sticking to a target to post an operating profit margin of between 12 and 15 percent. despite a sharp rise in oil prices, as it continues to outperform European rivals Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA). Shares in IAG were flat at 619 pence at 1544 GMT, paring early gains of 5 percent. Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said it was “positive that the targets have gone up despite a tougher fuel cost environment, but a risk of greater scepticism on delivery as a result.” Jet fuel has risen by more than 30 percent from 12 months ago, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) says.  IAG said average earnings per share would grow more than 12 percent per year from 2019 to 2023, in line with the forecast it made last year. It also raised its outlook for core annual earnings (EBITAR) to an average forecast of around 7.2 billion euros ($8.2 billion) from 6.5 billion euros.  Those forecasts came after it said last week that for 2018 annual profit would increase by 200 million euros. That compared to Lufthansa’s outlook for adjusted earnings (EBIT) this year to show a slight fall from 2017’s record. Air France-KLM has spent the year struggling with costly strikes before finally agreeing a pay deal with unions in October. It has faced competition from low-cost carriers like Ryanair (RYA.I) and easyJet (EZJ.L) but has been unable to overhaul costs and services as IAG and Lufthansa have. In its outlook, IAG raised its forecast for capital expenditure to 2.6 billion euros a year from 2.1 billion, and said it would grow available seat kilometres, a measure of capacity, by 6 percent a year, up from 5 percent previously.  Walsh said that capacity growth would deliver.  “We’re not putting capacity in there because we think there’s an opportunity to grow, we’re putting capacity in there because we think there’s an opportunity to grow profitably.” Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by James Davey/Edmund Blair/Alexander Smith",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iag-outlook/update-3-british-airways-owner-iag-looks-to-short-haul-for-deals-idUKL8N1XD150,02 Nov 2018,"* Shares flat after early rise

The relaunch of hot-rolled steel production at its Turkish site was expected to add as much as $100 million to MMK’s core earnings but was delayed earlier this year due to rising trade tensions and a surge in protectionist measures. MMK’s third-quarter earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 26 percent to $671 million, the highest since at least 2008, beating forecasts of $638 million in a Reuters poll. Revenue rose 3.9 percent to $2.09 billion. While MMK said it sees stable demand for steel products in its markets, supported by growth in global steel consumption and a programme to reduce production capacity in China, it also warned that global steel prices could put pressure on results. “The company’s financial results for (the fourth quarter) will be affected by the decrease in global steel prices and seasonal correction in the domestic market, against a backdrop of stabilising prices for key raw materials,” MMK said in its statement. MMK had intended to decide the fate of the Metalurji complex in Turkey in November but has put back the decision until mid-2019, Andrey Eremin, MMK director for economics, said on a conference call. “We actually made a decision to postpone the launch of steel-making part of Turkish business, and the main reason for this is that volatility of the potential profitability (in the steel sector)...is unpredictably high,” Eremin said. Analysts also noted that MMK’s 2018 capital expenditure was expected to exceed the previously planned $800 million due to an acceleration of its investment programme. The firm, controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Rashnikov, recommended a third-quarter dividend payment of 2.114 roubles per share.

2018-11-02,"NEW DELHI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - India’s Petronet LNG and ONGC Videsh are jointly in talks about buying a stake in Tellurian Inc’s proposed Driftwood project in Louisiana, Petronet’s managing director said on Friday. “We have moved slightly forward (from the preliminary discussion stage)... we are evaluating it seriously and we are in serious discussion with them,” Prabhat Singh told Reuters in a phone interview. India is expanding its pipeline network and building new liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals to boost use of the cleaner fuel in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to raise the share of natural gas in India’s overall energy mix to 15 percent in the next few years from about 6.5 percent at present. Petronet is India’s top gas importer with no experience of the upstream business, which is why it is tying up with ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of Indian oil producer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. “We want confirmation and confidence of upstream ... we want to mitigate geological risk,” Singh said. ONGC Videsh’s managing director N. K. Verma declined to comment when asked by Reuters. Tellurian here is offering a 60 to 75 percent equity interest in Driftwood Holdings, which comprises Tellurian’s upstream company, its pipeline and the upcoming terminal that will be able to export 27.6 million tonnes a year of LNG, its co-founder Martin Houston told Reuters last year. Singh, however, said that Petronet was also in talks with several other players about buying a stake in assets spanning from drilling to dispensing, saying it was a bold step for the firm. “But this a step which will deliver gas at cheap prices to India on a longer-term basis. It has merit in this, let us see how things shape up,” he said. A $500 million investment in Driftwood would give the stakeholder rights over a one million tonne/year of LNG over the life of the project, according to a presentation by Tellurian posted on the U.S. company’s website. On a free-on-board basis gas will cost $4.5 per million British thermal units. Tellurian hopes to deliver the first LNG to partners in 2024, the presentation said. “We are negotiating on the contours offered by them (Tellurian),” Singh said.

2018-11-02,"(Updates throughout) By David Randall NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Concerns that a trade deal between the U.S. and China may not be imminent reined in a rally in world equity markets and reversed gains on Wall Street on Friday, while strong U.S. wage growth boosted U.S. bond yields. Markets had earlier climbed on hopes that the world’s two biggest economies were mending their shaky trade relations. A steep decline in shares of Apple Inc further weighed down sentiment in the U.S. stock market after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss expectations. A senior official in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday dismissed as untrue a media report that said Trump was preparing a possible trade deal with China, a CNBC reporter said in a post on Twitter. “There is a long way to go” on negotiations, the unnamed official told CNBC’s Eamon Javers, according to his tweet. That erased earlier gains in the U.S. stock market and curtailed a rally in global shares that had lifted emerging market stocks up by their largest daily gain since 2016. In Europe, Germany’s export-heavy DAX had jumped as much as 1.5 percent, its best session since July, before giving up most of its gains. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.30 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.13 percent.

2018-11-02,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan freed two associates of rebel leader Riek Machar from prison on Friday, advancing a peace agreement to end almost five years of civil war. The two - retired South African colonel William Endley, an adviser to Machar, and James Gatdet, Machar’s spokesman, had been sentenced to death. President Salva Kiir on Wednesday ordered their release on Wednesday to reinforce the peace accord signed in September. “We are here to implement the orders of the president. Their release comes as part of the peace process. They are now free,” Interior Minister Michael Chiangjiek said after signing the paperwork confirming their release. Sudan erupted in conflict in 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president. Ethnically charged fighting soon spread, shutting down oil fields and forcing millions to flee. At least 383,000 South Sudanese have died as a result of the  war, through combat, starvation, disease or other factors,  according to a recent study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine researchers. Under pressure from governments in East Africa and from United Nations and Western donors, Machar’s group, other rebel factions and the government signed the peace accord under which he will again become vice president. Endley was sentenced to death in February for trying to bring down the government, while Gatdet was sentenced to death in the same month on charges of treason and incitement against the government. A Reuters witness at the prison where they had been said the two were brought out of their cells and told to put on civilian clothes. Gatdet will go to Khartoum, Sudan’s capital. Endley left South Sudan on Friday afternoon to return to South Africa, a Reuters witness at Juba international airport said. Before their release, the two had expressed excitement at their impending freedom. “I hope to see peace in South Sudan,” Gatdet told Reuters from his jail cell, seated next to Endley. “After two years and two months. It is finally a few minutes to go and also very happy today for the signed peace for the Republic of South Sudan,” Endley said. Machar returned to Juba on Wednesday. He fled to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 after fighting broke out again in the capital, wrecking an earlier peace deal. He later travelled to South Africa, where he was held under house arrest.

2018-11-02,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South African researchers say they have made bricks using human urine in a natural process involving colonies of bacteria, which could one day help reduce global warming emissions by finding a productive use for the ultimate waste product. The grey bricks are produced in a lab over eight days using urine, calcium, sand and bacteria. Fertilizers are also produced during the processes. And no, the bricks do not smell. The bricks are made using urea — a chemical found naturally in urine and also synthesized around the world to make fertilizer. The process of growing bricks from urea has been tested in the United States with synthetic solutions, but the new brick uses real human urine for the first time, the researchers said. “We literally pee this away every day and flush it through the sewer networks,” said Dyllon Randall, a senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town’s civil engineering department who is part of the team that developed the brick. “Why not recover this instead and make multiple products?” The bio-bricks are created through a process called microbial induced carbonate precipitation, which is similar to the process that naturally produces coral reefs. Loose sand is colonized with bacteria that produce the enzyme urease. The enzyme breaks down the urea in urine, while producing the rocky substance calcium carbonate through a complex chemical reaction. A brick or column of any shape can be made. The bricks are formed at room temperature, cutting the harmful carbon dioxide emitted when making regular bricks that are kiln-fired. One obstacle preventing mass production: the bricks use huge amounts of pee. To make a single brick requires about 20 liters of urine - a couple of weeks’ worth of wee for a typical adult. “So, I get it from the boys bathroom opposite the laboratory. I put a little sign up and all the university boys contribute to my research,” said Suzanne Lambert, who proved the concept for the research by making the first brick. “I definitely see commercialization in the next decade or two, but there is still a lot of lab work to be done,” she said.

2018-11-02,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday reported a quarterly profit that topped analysts’ estimate on higher prices received for its oil and natural gas but its production volumes fell on a year-over-year basis. The company’s third-quarter net income rose 57 percent to  $6.24 billion, or $1.46 a share, compared with $3.97 billion, or 93 cents per share a year ago. Analysts had forecast a $1.23 a share profit, according to data from I/B/E/S on Refinitiv. With crude up 44 percent in the quarter over a year-earlier, results at Exxon and other major oil companies are returning to levels not seen in four years. Royal Dutch Shell posted income of $5.6 billion on Thursday and BP Plc this week reported profit of $3.8 billion.  Exxon’s shares rose more than 1 percent to $81.61 in morning trading but are down more than 4 percent year-to-date on lower oil and gas production. Including the latest period, its oil and gas output has dropped in nine of the last 10 quarters.  “It’s a modestly positive report,” said Brian Youngberg, an equity analyst at Edward Jones. “They had such a weak first half of the year, the bar was lower and they jumped over it.”   Results benefited in part from a $360-million tax benefit that added about 7 cents a share to earnings, said Youngberg.  Oil production fell 3 percent to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent and natural gas output dropped 4 percent, the company said.  Its liquids output in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico rose 57 percent over a year ago as the company brought on 66 wells in the nation’s largest oilfield, Senior Vice President Jack Williams said during a conference call.  Earnings from the company’s downstream unit, which refines crude oil into gasoline and other products, rose 72 percent to $1.64 billion, benefiting from fewer maintenance disruptions during the quarter and from growing supplies of discounted shale oil from West Texas and crude from Western Canada. Exxon officials said the company continues to prioritize investing cash into new production projects and to shareholder dividends rather than share buybacks. Investors have been pushing the company to resume repurchases which were halted in 2016 except to offset the dilution the stock issues to employees.

2018-11-02,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected for now a bid by the President Donald Trump’s administration to block a trial in a lawsuit filed by young activists who have accused the U.S. government of ignoring the perils of climate change. The loss for the administration means it now faces a high-profile examination of U.S. climate change policy during the trial that was due to begin on Oct. 29 in Eugene, Oregon but has since been postponed by the judge. Chief Justice John Roberts on Oct. 19 had temporarily put the case on hold while the court as a whole decided how to proceed.  The Supreme Court’s three-page order noted that the administration may still have grounds to take its arguments to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.  Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the administration’s request. There was no indication how Trump’s new Supreme Court appointee, conservative Brett Kavanaugh, voted on the issue. In the lawsuit, 21 activists, ages 11 to 22, said federal officials violated their rights to due process under the U.S. Constitution by failing to adequately address carbon pollution such as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 against former President Barack Obama and government agencies in a federal court in Eugene, Oregon. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have failed in efforts to have the lawsuit thrown out. The administration has said a courtroom is not the appropriate venue for a debate on climate change policy. “This suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process, by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions,” Trump administration Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers.   Francisco noted that the plaintiffs are seeking to hold the U.S. government liable for the cumulative effects of carbon dioxide emissions “from every source in the world over decades.” Lawyers for the young activists, led by Julia Olson of a Eugene-based group called Our Children’s Trust that brought the lawsuit, have said their clients have suffered “irreparable harm” from the effects of a changing climate.  “This is a case about the fundamental rights of children and whether the actions of their government have deprived them of their inalienable rights,” Olson said in court papers. On July 30, the high court rejected an earlier application by the Trump administration, calling it premature. Eugene, Oregon-based federal Judge Ann Aiken has repeatedly allowed the case to move forward to trial over the objections of the government. The trial will proceed if neither the high court nor the 9th Circuit intervene. Aiken said in an Oct. 15 ruling that although the case raised questions about the role of the judiciary delving into a matter of policy those concerns were not enough to warrant a dismissal of the entire case.

2018-11-02,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI on Friday said it had recovered a second suspicious package addressed to California billionaire Tom Steyer, a Democrat known for funding ads calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Twitter it recovered a package on Thursday night that was similar to other recently mailed parcel bombs to prominent Democrats and critics of Trump. A 56-year-old Florida man, Cesar Sayoc, has been arrested and charged with mailing 15 pipe bombs. Law enforcement officials have warned Sayoc may have mailed other parcels before his arrest that could still be working their way through the U.S. postal system. Last Friday Steyer’s office said a package addressed to him had been found at a post office outside of San Francisco. “These threats are not isolated but are a part of a larger assault on the norms that uphold our democracy. We will not relent as we push for the broadest possible democracy and a life of dignity and respect for every American,” Steyer said in a written statement of the latest package.  Sayoc, a former male stripper, pizza delivery driver and disk jockey, on Friday agreed in a Miami court to be transferred to New York state to face five charges and a maximum penalty of 48 years in prison for allegedly sending the bombs to targets including former President Barack Obama.

2018-11-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Friday and notched a weekly loss of over 6 percent, as investors worried about oversupply after the United States said it will temporarily spare eight jurisdictions from Iran-related sanctions.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision in a conference call. The waivers could allow top buyers to keep importing Iranian oil after economic penalties come back into effect on Monday. Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell 6 cents to settle at $72.83 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 declined 55 cents to end the session at $63.14 per barrel, a 0.86 percent loss. Both contracts have fallen more than 15 percent from the near four-year highs touched in early October on worries the looming Iran sanctions could drain supply from global markets.  Pompeo did not name the jurisdictions, but said the European Union as a whole, which has 28 members, would not receive one.  India, Iraq and South Korea were on the list of waivers, said a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under U.S. law, such exceptions can only be granted for up to 180 days.  Turkey has been told it will receive a waiver on U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil sales, Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said. Iran said on Friday that it had no concerns over the reimposition of sanctions. On Twitter, in a message designed to emphasise his “maximum pressure” policy toward Iran, U.S. President Donald Trump included a photograph of himself modelled on a popular television show poster with the headline: “Sanctions are coming November 5.” “It seems as though all the worries about tightening supplies due to the loss of Iranian barrels in the market have dried up,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “On top of that, concerns regarding reduced global demand has also helped ... the market continues to search for a bottom.” Prices have been under pressure as world oil production has been rising significantly in the past two months. Russian Energy Ministry data showed on Friday the country pumped 11.41 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in October, a 30-year high. The U.S. believes that global oil supplies will exceed demand next year making it easier for countries to cut Iranian oil imports to zero, a senior U.S. official said on Friday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries boosted oil production in October to 33.31 million bpd, up 390,000 bpd and the highest by OPEC since 2016. [OPEC/O] The United States is challenging Russia for title of top producer, with U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA now above 11 million bpd.

2018-11-02,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranians fear an even more painful squeeze on living costs     after additional U.S. sanctions take effect on Monday, from businesses struggling to buy raw materials to the sick and elderly unable to afford life-saving medicines. The United States will reapply curbs to the country’s vital petroleum and banking sectors on Monday in an effort to rein in its arch foe’s nuclear, missile and regional activities. Iran’s clerical rulers have played down the U.S. move, but many ordinary Iranians appear apprehensive. “All the prices are going higher every day ... I cannot imagine what will happen after 13 Aban (Nov. 4). I am scared. I am worried. I am desperate,” said elementary school teacher Pejman Sarafnejad, 43, a father of three in Tehran. “I cannot even buy rice to feed my children or pay my rent.” The daily struggle to make ends meet has been getting harder for months: The economy was battered by the reimposition of a first raft of U.S. curbs in August after Washington’s pullout from a nuclear deal between Tehran and global powers in May. Foreign businesses of all types, ranging from oil companies, trading houses to shipping, have stopped doing business with Iran for fear of incurring U.S. penalties. A Tehran Grand bazaar grocery shop owner said: “I am very nervous because already there is shortage of some goods in the market and the rial has lost so much value.  “What will happen after the reimposition of new sanctions?” Iran’s leadership says Tehran will not succumb to pressure to halt its missile programs or to change its regional policy.  Yet while some Iranians back their leaders’ defiance, others are fearful that the economy, weakened by years of sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, may collapse when the U.S. puts more pressure on the world’s Number 3 crude exporter.  “Statements by government officials that ... the sanctions (will) have no impact are political slogans,” said Washington-based lawyer Farhad Alavi, who focuses on U.S. trade regulation and sanctions.     “The fact is that these restrictions significantly increase transaction costs for Iranians.”  Since the reimposition of the first round of curbs in August, prices of bread, cooking oil and other staples have soared and the rial national currency has fallen sharply.  Rice, one of the staples of Iran’s diet, has more than tripled in price since last year because of the rial’s fall. Ordinary Iranians fear cuts in Iran’s oil sales could be the ultimate hammer blow to the economy, since energy exports are still the country’s main source of earnings. Iranian leaders hope sanctions waivers granted to eight buyers of Iranian crude, combined with rising oil prices, will compensate for a reduction oil export volumes. But even without the new measures due on Monday, Iranian businessmen have been finding it harder to cope. Some 70 percent of small factories, businesses and workshops have already started to shut down in the past months due to lack of raw materials and hard currency, according to Iranian media. “I had to close my business. Those European companies that were racing to ink a deal with me last year, now refuse to return my calls,” said a businessman in Tehran, who declined to be named. Mohammad Reza Sadoughi says ordinary people will bear the brunt of the sanctions, in terms of medicines for the sick such as cancer patients and food shortages and currency problems.  “My father has cancer, and with sanctions, the cancer-treatment medicine that his life depends on will only be available in the black market for a higher price,” said the 38-year-old government employee in the northern city of Sari. The U.S. sanctions permits trade in humanitarian goods such as food and pharmaceuticals. Yet measures imposed on banks and trade restrictions will make life hard for Iranian patients. “At the end of the day, it’s the Iranian people with their aspiration to lead a good life who are suffering due to lack of good sense from their own regime who are not ready to compromise with the world power (U.S.),” said Dubai-based businessman Aftab Hasan, a member of the Iranian Business Council in Dubai.  However analysts say that economic grievances are unlikely to revive anti-government unrest such as the demonstrations in December that turned into anti-government rallies.   “I don’t care about politics. I don’t care who is responsible for our problems. I don’t want a regime change. I just want to live peacefully with my family in my country,” said housewife Fariba Shakouri, 51, in the central city of Yazd.

2018-11-02,"(Fixes garble in oil price data in final paragraph.) By David Randall NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Concerns that a trade deal between the United States and China may not be imminent reined in a rally in world equity markets and reversed gains on Wall Street on Friday, while strong U.S. wage growth boosted U.S. bond yields. Markets had earlier climbed on hopes that the world’s two biggest economies were mending their shaky trade relations. A steep decline in shares of Apple Inc further weighed on sentiment in the U.S. stock market after the iPhone maker warned that sales during the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss expectations. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC that while President Donald Trump plans to meet China President Xi Jinping later this month, he has not asked U.S. officials to draw up a proposed trade plan, contradicting a report earlier in the day that had buoyed hopes of a trade dispute resolution. That erased early gains in U.S. stocks and curtailed a rally in global markets that had lifted emerging market stocks by their largest daily gain since 2016. “The stock market is focused on tariffs and they believe that increased tariffs are going to hurt the economy,” said Mike Rask, director of trading at Hodges Capital in Dallas. “There was the belief overnight that we were close to a trade deal with China and now it looks like that is not the case.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 279.37 points, or 1.1 percent, to 25,101.37, the S&P 500 lost 27.22 points, or 0.99 percent, to 2,713.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 94.35 points, or 1.27 percent, to 7,339.71. Apple’s shares tumbled nearly 7 percent, taking its market value below $1 trillion, after the company said sales for the final quarter would likely miss expectations. In Europe, Germany’s export-heavy DAX had jumped as much as 1.5 percent, its best session since July, before giving up most of its gains. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.28 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.06 percent. U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in December. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 14/32 in price to yield 3.1969 percent, from 3.144 percent late on Thursday. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.25 percent, with the euro down 0.2 percent to $1.1384.

2018-11-02,"ANKARA, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Some Iranian airliners were refused fuel in Turkey’s Istanbul airports on Friday and had to cancel at least one flight, while other carriers had to cut the number of passengers on board in order to fly on less fuel, Turkish media reported. Turkey’s Petrol Ofisi, a subsidiary of Vitol Investment Partnership Ltd., refused fuel to Iranian airplanes in Turkey, according to the private Demiroren news agency. Iran’s Mahan Air, ATA Airlines, Qeshm Airlines and Iran Aseman Airlines all operate flights between Tehran and Istanbul. The United States said on Friday it would temporarily allow eight jurisdictions to keep importing Iranian oil when U.S. sanctions come back into force on Monday, sparing them for now from the threat of U.S. economic penalties. Turkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighbouring Iran has been one of its main sources of oil because of its proximity, crude quality and favorable price differentials, traders say. Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said Turkey, had been told it would get a waiver on the restrictions though U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has not named the jurisdictions. The website of Istanbul’s Ataturk airport showed at least one flight to Iran had been cancelled, while several others had taken off after being delayed. At least three flights had taken off on time, the website showed. Turkey’s Haberturk daily quoted Petrol Ofisi as saying it had told the carriers that it would not be supplying fuel to Iranian airline companies. Vitol declined to comment, while Petrol Ofisi could not be reached. ATA Airlines, an Iranian charter carrier, told the Demiroren news agency that they had to cut the number of passengers on a flight between Istanbul and Tabriz, in northwestern Iran, to 100 from 160 to get extra fuel from Iran. “It’s impossible to carry all passengers unless we can get fuel from both destinations of the flight. Companies would make losses, and it would damage Turkish tourism,” said Behzad Atarod, the Istanbul manager of ATA Airlines.

2018-11-02,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Earnings for the two largest U.S. oil companies on Friday jumped on higher crude prices and the nation’s shale boom, joining big oil rivals in posting sharply higher quarterly profit.   Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) posted a 57-percent increase on prices there were up 44 percent over a year ago helped by a lower tax rate while Chevron Corp’s (CVX.N) earnings doubled on surging output from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.  While Exxon’s results topped Wall Street forecasts, but shares were up fractionally as its oil and gas production declined for the ninth of the last 10 quarters.  Chevron’s shares rose 2.7 percent as it forecast continued strong oil production this quarter. Results for most of the world’s top oil companies are returning to levels not seen in four years, driven by strong demand for oil and years of cost-cutting. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) posted income of $5.6 billion on Thursday and BP Plc (BP.L) this week reported profit of $3.8 billion. Irving, Texas-based Exxon is investing heavily to reverse its production declines. It spent $6.59 billion on capital projects during the quarter, up 10 percent from the same period last year.    Executives on Friday said the company plans to continue to prioritize spending on new projects and shareholder dividends over stock repurchases, something that investors have been calling for it to restart. Exxon halted buybacks except to offset dilution in 2016. “The company that a decade ago had the largest buyback program in the S&P 500 is now altogether absent from the buyback table,” said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov in a note on Friday.  Chevron said it benefited from running 20 drilling rigs in the Permian basin during the quarter and new well designs that have boosted output. It produced 338,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter from the field and forecast sustained Permian growth this quarter.  “The economic outcomes are really outstanding,” Pat Yarrington, Chevron finance chief, told analysts on Friday.  She said that the San Ramon California-based company plans to hold to its full-year capital spending budget of between $18 billion and $20 billion, despite spending about $450 million more than it anticipated year-to-date.  Exxon reported earnings of $6.24 billion, or $1.46 per share, while analysts had forecast a per share profit of $1.23. Chevron reported earnings of $4.05 billion, or $2.11 per share, compared with analysts’ estimate for $2.06 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2018-11-02,"(Adds rig count in the Permian basin) Nov 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil drilling rig count declined this week for the first time in four weeks, although the rig count held close to its highest in over three years as production surges to record highs and some companies forecast even higher output this year. Drillers cut one oil rig in the week to Nov. 2, bringing the total count down to 874, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 729 rigs were active because energy companies have ramped up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian Basin, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there decreased by two this week to 487 this week. U.S. crude oil production surged by 416,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 11.346 million bpd in August, the government said in a monthly report on Wednesday, as production in Texas and North Dakota climbed to fresh peaks. Apache Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its production forecast for the year as it benefited from rising oil prices and increased output from the Permian. Top Bakken producer Continental Resources Inc on Monday said its output from the oil-rich North Dakota shale field hit a record during the third quarter and would increase significantly through the end of the year as it completed more wells. Apache and its peers are reaping the benefit of a 32 percent surge in average U.S. crude oil prices from a year earlier. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $67.19 per barrel, up from $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. On Friday, U.S. crude futures were trading around $63 per barrel, putting the contract on track to fall for a fourth week in a row on demand concerns despite upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran due to begin on Nov. 4. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 20 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $86.7 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,067 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,024. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 20 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $86.7 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,067 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,024. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-11-02,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and natural gas producer Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Friday reported that its quarterly profit doubled on record oil and gas production, sending its shares up as much as 5 percent.  The results reflected strong gains in its oil and gas production with crude prices up 44 percent during the quarter and offset a drop in earnings from its downstream operations,  including refining and chemicals. Third-quarter oil and gas production rose 9 percent over a year earlier, and the company forecast total output for the full year would be up about 7 percent over 2017. Its production in the West Texas shale fields rose 80 percent in the quarter, adding 150,000 barrels per day, “the equivalent of adding a midsize Permian pure-play E&P company,” Pat Yarrington, the company’s finance chief, told analysts on a conference call.  Chevron ran 20 drilling rigs in its Permian operations during the quarter, and will continue running the same number this quarter, Yarrington said.  “Our approach right now is to take a bit of a pause and to focus on capturing all the efficiencies that a 20-rig fleet would necessitate,” she added.  Fourth-quarter downstream earnings and cash flow will be hurt by higher planned maintenance activity, the company said. Downstream profit fell 24 percent in the quarter from continuing weakness in its international refining operations.  Pierre Breber, Chevron’s executive vice president of downstream and chemicals, declined to comment on reports it is in discussions to acquire a U.S. Gulf Coast refinery. But he said the company has strong reasons, including growing Permian oil production, to consider doing so.  The company reported third-quarter net income of $4.05 billion, or $2.11 a share, compared with $1.95 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Analysts were looking for $2.06 per share of profit, according to IBES data on Refinitiv.  Shares rose $3.44 to $114.51 and hit a session high of $117.11.

2018-11-02,"(Adds quotes) ISTANBUL, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Turkey has been told it will receive a waiver on U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil sales, Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said on Friday. The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. Washington says it will temporarily allow eight “jurisdictions” to keep importing Iranian oil when the sanctions come back into force on Monday. “Just a while ago ministry officials brought the news that the U.S. Secretary of State made a statement on limiting or lifting of sanctions for eight countries including Turkey,” Donmez told reporters. He said he welcomed the move, as Turkey had previously warned that the U.S. sanctions would “negatively impact the peace and economy of neighbouring countries like Turkey”. NATO member Turkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighbouring Iran has been one of its main sources of oil because of its proximity, the quality of its crude and favourable price differentials. An industry source said last month Turkey had already made efforts to cut its purchases ahead of the U.S. sanctions, but would prefer to keep up some level of Iranian oil imports past November.

2018-11-02,"* Few trades heard amid bloated storage, stranded ships * Mild weather, nuclear restarts in Japan dampen demand * Recent and upcoming LNG plant start-ups will add supply By Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) were flat this week, at two-month lows, as bloated storage levels in the region left cargoes stranded and deterred trade. December spot LNG LNG-AS was heard at $10.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the lowest since Aug. 10. Expectations of a mild winter and higher nuclear generation in Japan, the world’s largest LNG buyer, are weighing on prices after a frenzied September of buying by Asian utilities to replenish storage tanks left low after a hot summer. But inventory levels in Japan and South Korea, the world’s third largest purchaser, have now exceeded volumes seen in the previous three years for this time of the year. In China, state energy group CNPC said it finished injecting gas into its underground storage, with record volumes at more than 9 billion cubic metres by the end of October. Exxon Mobil Corp’s Papua New Guinea plant offered a cargo for delivery in the second half of December on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis, trade sources said. Angola offered to sell a cargo for delivery into Asia in December with bids due by Nov. 6 and remaining valid until Nov. 7, they said. Aside from such tenders, at least one Asian utility is trying to sell winter cargoes it does not need due to high stocks, a trader familiar with the Japanese LNG market said. And more supply is expected in the coming weeks that will offset any potential increase in demand as temperatures start dropping for winter. Inpex delivered this week its first LNG cargo from the giant Ichthys project in Australia, after multiple delays to the project’s start-up. And in the United States, Cheniere Energy is expected to commission its first cargo from the new Corpus Christie plant on Nov. 15. The oversupply and falling spot Asian LNG prices, as well as sky-high shipping costs, have diverted cargoes to Europe, where Belgium and the Netherlands took in record volumes in October. Nevertheless, even here gas storage levels are high with the Netherlands at 96 percent and France at 94 percent, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Belgium’s levels are lower at 54 percent, however the country is short on energy as six of its seven nuclear reactors are down for maintenance. Japan is likely to experience warmer than average weather between November and January, the country’s official forecaster said last week, implying low demand for heating. Nuclear power plant restarts at the world’s top LNG importer are also denting demand for the super-chilled fuel.

2018-11-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L), which has tried to take over Norwegian Air (NWC.OL), said on Friday it regards the short-haul market as its best opportunity for consolidation. Chief executive Willie Walsh told investors he expected to see airline consolidation in Europe and that IAG had the financial headroom needed to pursue acquisitions. “When we talk about consolidation it (Norwegian) is an opportunity, particularly if you look at the short-haul network and further consolidation in that short-haul network, it’s probably the best opportunity for us,” Walsh said. Walsh said he had nothing new to report on Norwegian, in which IAG owns a 4 percent stake, and which has rejected two approaches by the owner of BA, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling. IAG said on Friday most of its financial goals for 2019-2023 were the same as those made in a long-term plan last year. The group said it was sticking to a target to post an operating profit margin of between 12 and 15 percent. despite a sharp rise in oil prices, as it continues to outperform European rivals Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA). Shares in IAG were flat at 619 pence at 1544 GMT, paring early gains of 5 percent. Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said it was “positive that the targets have gone up despite a tougher fuel cost environment, but a risk of greater scepticism on delivery as a result.” Jet fuel has risen by more than 30 percent from 12 months ago, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) says.  IAG said average earnings per share would grow more than 12 percent per year from 2019 to 2023, in line with the forecast it made last year. It also raised its outlook for core annual earnings (EBITAR) to an average forecast of around 7.2 billion euros ($8.2 billion) from 6.5 billion euros.  Those forecasts came after it said last week that for 2018 annual profit would increase by 200 million euros. That compared to Lufthansa’s outlook for adjusted earnings (EBIT) this year to show a slight fall from 2017’s record. Air France-KLM has spent the year struggling with costly strikes before finally agreeing a pay deal with unions in October. It has faced competition from low-cost carriers like Ryanair (RYA.I) and easyJet (EZJ.L) but has been unable to overhaul costs and services as IAG and Lufthansa have. In its outlook, IAG raised its forecast for capital expenditure to 2.6 billion euros a year from 2.1 billion, and said it would grow available seat kilometres, a measure of capacity, by 6 percent a year, up from 5 percent previously.  Walsh said that capacity growth would deliver.  “We’re not putting capacity in there because we think there’s an opportunity to grow, we’re putting capacity in there because we think there’s an opportunity to grow profitably.” Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by James Davey/Edmund Blair/Alexander Smith",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iag-outlook/update-3-british-airways-owner-iag-looks-to-short-haul-for-deals-idUKL8N1XD150,02 Nov 2018,"* Shares flat after early rise

The relaunch of hot-rolled steel production at its Turkish site was expected to add as much as $100 million to MMK’s core earnings but was delayed earlier this year due to rising trade tensions and a surge in protectionist measures. MMK’s third-quarter earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 26 percent to $671 million, the highest since at least 2008, beating forecasts of $638 million in a Reuters poll. Revenue rose 3.9 percent to $2.09 billion. While MMK said it sees stable demand for steel products in its markets, supported by growth in global steel consumption and a programme to reduce production capacity in China, it also warned that global steel prices could put pressure on results. “The company’s financial results for (the fourth quarter) will be affected by the decrease in global steel prices and seasonal correction in the domestic market, against a backdrop of stabilising prices for key raw materials,” MMK said in its statement. MMK had intended to decide the fate of the Metalurji complex in Turkey in November but has put back the decision until mid-2019, Andrey Eremin, MMK director for economics, said on a conference call. “We actually made a decision to postpone the launch of steel-making part of Turkish business, and the main reason for this is that volatility of the potential profitability (in the steel sector)...is unpredictably high,” Eremin said. Analysts also noted that MMK’s 2018 capital expenditure was expected to exceed the previously planned $800 million due to an acceleration of its investment programme. The firm, controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Rashnikov, recommended a third-quarter dividend payment of 2.114 roubles per share.

2018-11-02,"NEW DELHI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - India’s Petronet LNG and ONGC Videsh are jointly in talks about buying a stake in Tellurian Inc’s proposed Driftwood project in Louisiana, Petronet’s managing director said on Friday. “We have moved slightly forward (from the preliminary discussion stage)... we are evaluating it seriously and we are in serious discussion with them,” Prabhat Singh told Reuters in a phone interview. India is expanding its pipeline network and building new liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals to boost use of the cleaner fuel in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to raise the share of natural gas in India’s overall energy mix to 15 percent in the next few years from about 6.5 percent at present. Petronet is India’s top gas importer with no experience of the upstream business, which is why it is tying up with ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of Indian oil producer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. “We want confirmation and confidence of upstream ... we want to mitigate geological risk,” Singh said. ONGC Videsh’s managing director N. K. Verma declined to comment when asked by Reuters. Tellurian here is offering a 60 to 75 percent equity interest in Driftwood Holdings, which comprises Tellurian’s upstream company, its pipeline and the upcoming terminal that will be able to export 27.6 million tonnes a year of LNG, its co-founder Martin Houston told Reuters last year. Singh, however, said that Petronet was also in talks with several other players about buying a stake in assets spanning from drilling to dispensing, saying it was a bold step for the firm. “But this a step which will deliver gas at cheap prices to India on a longer-term basis. It has merit in this, let us see how things shape up,” he said. A $500 million investment in Driftwood would give the stakeholder rights over a one million tonne/year of LNG over the life of the project, according to a presentation by Tellurian posted on the U.S. company’s website. On a free-on-board basis gas will cost $4.5 per million British thermal units. Tellurian hopes to deliver the first LNG to partners in 2024, the presentation said. “We are negotiating on the contours offered by them (Tellurian),” Singh said.

2018-11-02,"(Updates throughout) By David Randall NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Concerns that a trade deal between the U.S. and China may not be imminent reined in a rally in world equity markets and reversed gains on Wall Street on Friday, while strong U.S. wage growth boosted U.S. bond yields. Markets had earlier climbed on hopes that the world’s two biggest economies were mending their shaky trade relations. A steep decline in shares of Apple Inc further weighed down sentiment in the U.S. stock market after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss expectations. A senior official in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday dismissed as untrue a media report that said Trump was preparing a possible trade deal with China, a CNBC reporter said in a post on Twitter. “There is a long way to go” on negotiations, the unnamed official told CNBC’s Eamon Javers, according to his tweet. That erased earlier gains in the U.S. stock market and curtailed a rally in global shares that had lifted emerging market stocks up by their largest daily gain since 2016. In Europe, Germany’s export-heavy DAX had jumped as much as 1.5 percent, its best session since July, before giving up most of its gains. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.30 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.13 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 125.44 points, or 0.49 percent, to 25,255.3, the S&P 500 lost 20.32 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,720.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 89.41 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,344.65. Apple’s shares tumbled 6.8 percent, taking its market value below $1 trillion, after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss expectations. U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in December.

The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.05 percent, with the euro up 0.04 percent to $1.1411.

2018-11-02,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan freed two associates of rebel leader Riek Machar from prison on Friday, advancing a peace agreement to end almost five years of civil war. The two - retired South African colonel William Endley, an adviser to Machar, and James Gatdet, Machar’s spokesman, had been sentenced to death. President Salva Kiir on Wednesday ordered their release on Wednesday to reinforce the peace accord signed in September. “We are here to implement the orders of the president. Their release comes as part of the peace process. They are now free,” Interior Minister Michael Chiangjiek said after signing the paperwork confirming their release. Sudan erupted in conflict in 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president. Ethnically charged fighting soon spread, shutting down oil fields and forcing millions to flee. At least 383,000 South Sudanese have died as a result of the  war, through combat, starvation, disease or other factors,  according to a recent study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine researchers. Under pressure from governments in East Africa and from United Nations and Western donors, Machar’s group, other rebel factions and the government signed the peace accord under which he will again become vice president. Endley was sentenced to death in February for trying to bring down the government, while Gatdet was sentenced to death in the same month on charges of treason and incitement against the government. A Reuters witness at the prison where they had been said the two were brought out of their cells and told to put on civilian clothes. Gatdet will go to Khartoum, Sudan’s capital. Endley left South Sudan on Friday afternoon to return to South Africa, a Reuters witness at Juba international airport said. Before their release, the two had expressed excitement at their impending freedom. “I hope to see peace in South Sudan,” Gatdet told Reuters from his jail cell, seated next to Endley. “After two years and two months. It is finally a few minutes to go and also very happy today for the signed peace for the Republic of South Sudan,” Endley said. Machar returned to Juba on Wednesday. He fled to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 after fighting broke out again in the capital, wrecking an earlier peace deal. He later travelled to South Africa, where he was held under house arrest.

2018-11-02,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South African researchers say they have made bricks using human urine in a natural process involving colonies of bacteria, which could one day help reduce global warming emissions by finding a productive use for the ultimate waste product. The grey bricks are produced in a lab over eight days using urine, calcium, sand and bacteria. Fertilizers are also produced during the processes. And no, the bricks do not smell. The bricks are made using urea — a chemical found naturally in urine and also synthesized around the world to make fertilizer. The process of growing bricks from urea has been tested in the United States with synthetic solutions, but the new brick uses real human urine for the first time, the researchers said. “We literally pee this away every day and flush it through the sewer networks,” said Dyllon Randall, a senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town’s civil engineering department who is part of the team that developed the brick. “Why not recover this instead and make multiple products?” The bio-bricks are created through a process called microbial induced carbonate precipitation, which is similar to the process that naturally produces coral reefs. Loose sand is colonized with bacteria that produce the enzyme urease. The enzyme breaks down the urea in urine, while producing the rocky substance calcium carbonate through a complex chemical reaction. A brick or column of any shape can be made. The bricks are formed at room temperature, cutting the harmful carbon dioxide emitted when making regular bricks that are kiln-fired. One obstacle preventing mass production: the bricks use huge amounts of pee. To make a single brick requires about 20 liters of urine - a couple of weeks’ worth of wee for a typical adult. “So, I get it from the boys bathroom opposite the laboratory. I put a little sign up and all the university boys contribute to my research,” said Suzanne Lambert, who proved the concept for the research by making the first brick. “I definitely see commercialization in the next decade or two, but there is still a lot of lab work to be done,” she said.

2018-11-02,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday reported a quarterly profit that topped analysts’ estimate on higher prices received for its oil and natural gas but its production volumes fell on a year-over-year basis. The company’s third-quarter net income rose 57 percent to  $6.24 billion, or $1.46 a share, compared with $3.97 billion, or 93 cents per share a year ago. Analysts had forecast a $1.23 a share profit, according to data from I/B/E/S on Refinitiv. With crude up 44 percent in the quarter over a year-earlier, results at Exxon and other major oil companies are returning to levels not seen in four years. Royal Dutch Shell posted income of $5.6 billion on Thursday and BP Plc this week reported profit of $3.8 billion.  Exxon’s shares rose more than 1 percent to $81.61 in morning trading but are down more than 4 percent year-to-date on lower oil and gas production. Including the latest period, its oil and gas output has dropped in nine of the last 10 quarters.  “It’s a modestly positive report,” said Brian Youngberg, an equity analyst at Edward Jones. “They had such a weak first half of the year, the bar was lower and they jumped over it.”   Results benefited in part from a $360-million tax benefit that added about 7 cents a share to earnings, said Youngberg.  Oil production fell 3 percent to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent and natural gas output dropped 4 percent, the company said.  Its liquids output in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico rose 57 percent over a year ago as the company brought on 66 wells in the nation’s largest oilfield, Senior Vice President Jack Williams said during a conference call.  Earnings from the company’s downstream unit, which refines crude oil into gasoline and other products, rose 72 percent to $1.64 billion, benefiting from fewer maintenance disruptions during the quarter and from growing supplies of discounted shale oil from West Texas and crude from Western Canada. Exxon officials said the company continues to prioritize investing cash into new production projects and to shareholder dividends rather than share buybacks. Investors have been pushing the company to resume repurchases which were halted in 2016 except to offset the dilution the stock issues to employees.

2018-11-02,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Friday it had no concerns over the reimposition of new U.S. sanctions on the country’s vital oil and financial sectors, expected to be announced by Washington on Nov. 4.  “America will not be able to carry out any measure against our great and brave nation ... We have the knowledge and the capability to manage the country’s economic affairs,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told state TV. The U.S. government has agreed to let eight countries, including close allies South Korea and Japan, as well as India, keep buying Iranian oil after it reimposes sanctions on Tehran. “The possibility of America being able to achieve its economic goals through these sanctions is very remote and there is certainly no possibility that it will attain its political goals through such sanctions,” Qasemi said.  “The new US sanctions will mostly have psychological effects.” Washington imposed sanctions on Iran in August following President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with major powers. Under the deal, most international sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear programme were lifted in 2016 in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear work.

2018-11-02,"(Updates to open of U.S. trading, changes dateline to NEW YORK; previous LONDON) By David Randall NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - World equity markets rallied on Friday with emerging market stocks seeing their best day since 2016 on hopes the United States and China were mending trade relations, while strong U.S. wage growth boosted bond yields. The signals on trade triggered a global surge in risk appetite that lifted metals and swathes of trade-sensitive currencies and bond markets. A buoyant Asian session, where most of the major markets gained between 2.5 and 4 percent, put emerging market stocks up 3 percent. “When (U.S. President Donald) Trump wants to bump the market ahead of the mid-terms, the market likes it,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy, John Hardy, referring to next week’s mid-term U.S. elections. In Europe, Germany’s export-heavy DAX jumped 1.5 percent in its best session since July. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.78 percent, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.76 percent. U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in December. The Dow Industrials and the benchmark S&P 500 stock index rose for a fourth day on strong earnings and optimism over the trade dispute, but Apple’s share slide after a disappointing forecast pulled the Nasdaq lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 91.98 points, or 0.36 percent, to 25,472.72, the S&P 500 gained 3.62 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,743.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 38.99 points, or 0.52 percent, to 7,395.07. Apple’s shares dropped 6.8 percent, taking its market value below $1 trillion, after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss expectations. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 3.176 percent, from 3.144 percent late on Thursday. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, fell 0.03 percent, with the euro up 0.09 percent to $1.1417. In commodity markets, industrial metals led the charge on the hopes a Trump-Xi trade deal would prevent China’s resource-hungry economy faltering. Oil prices were weighed down by a report that the U.S. government has agreed to let eight countries, including close allies South Korea and Japan, as well as India, keep buying Iranian oil after Washington re-imposes sanctions. U.S. crude fell 0.58 percent to $63.32 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.78, down 0.15 percent on the day.

2018-11-02,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CXAFBR By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The recovery in oil prices since the downturn of 2014/15 looks a lot like the upward adjustments that followed the slumps of 2008/09 and 1997/98, which could provide clues about what happens next. The oil market is strongly cyclical, and although no two cycles are the same, they often show similar characteristics (“Cyclical behaviour of oil prices”, Reuters, June 4, 2018). Spot prices and calendar spreads exhibit cyclical movements that correlate closely with the market, alternating between periods of under- and over-supply (tmsnrt.rs/2CXAFBR). Brent’s six-month calendar spread seems to have reached a major cyclical peak in April 2018, up from a post-slump trough in January 2015, before trending downwards. Spot prices may have reached a similar peak in early October 2018. Although it is too early to be certain, most hedge funds and other money managers have liquidated a large share of their bullish positions in recent weeks. In the recent recovery, Brent calendar spreads rose for 39 months from trough to the first major peak, which is roughly comparable with recoveries in 1998-2000 (21 months) and 2009-2011 (33 months). Spot prices have risen for 33 months from trough to their peak in October, which is also broadly comparable with recoveries in 1998-2000 (22 months) and 2008-2011 (28 months). Oil prices, spreads and the reactions of producers and consumers suggest the market has passed the first major cyclical peak after the slump of 2014/15. In the recovery phase of the cycle, the oil market is characterised by a rapid advance in consumption and a slower increase in production, absorbing excess inventories built up during the preceding slump. But as spot prices increase and calendar spreads tighten, consumption growth slows and production growth accelerates, eventually arresting and reversing the rise in spot prices and spreads. This cyclical sequence describes the oil market’s development in 2018 almost perfectly, confirming this is a fairly typical cyclical recovery (notwithstanding the novelty of OPEC+ and U.S. sanctions on Iran). Consumption growth has started to slow in the advanced economies and emerging markets in response to higher prices while output is rising strongly in the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Spot prices and spreads are now softening to avert or at least mitigate a period of potential oversupply in 2019/2020. Lower prices should eventually restrain the excessive growth in output from OPEC+ members and especially U.S. shale producers as well as buying back some lost consumption growth. Shocks could still move oil prices sharply higher or lower in the coming months, with Iran sanctions, further disruption in Venezuela, Libya or Nigeria, and an economic recession the most likely candidates. After the major cyclical peak in 2011, prices remained relatively high, albeit gradually declining, for three more years, as a result of supply disruptions in Libya, Venezuela, Nigeria, Iraq and Iran. Something similar could keep oil prices elevated throughout 2019/2020, especially if production from Iran, Venezuela or Libya collapses. But unless there is another shock, the cyclical recovery that began in 2015/2016 now appears complete and oil prices are adjusting to prevent oversupply and an unwanted build-up of stocks in 2019/2020.

2018-11-02,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state-owned oil producer Zarubezhneft has pulled out of projects in Iran because of looming U.S. sanctions, two sources at the company told Reuters on Friday. The National Iranian Oil Company has signed a deal with Zarubezhneft to develop two oilfields, Aban and Paydar-e Gharb, in Iran. The 10-year agreement was intended to boost the production of the fields to 48,000 barrels per day from current 36,000 bpd. The fields are expected to produce a total of 67 million barrels of oil over the 10 years. Zarubezhneft has an 80 percent share in the deal and its Iranian partner, Dana Energy, the remaining 20 percent.  The cost of developing the fields was estimated at $674 million, with an additional $68 million in indirect costs, according to SHANA, the news site of the Iranian oil ministry. However, a source at the Moscow-headquartered company said imminent U.S. sanctions against Iran meant it had pulled the plug on the projects. “Zarubezhneft left all the projects in Iran due to sanctions,” a source said. The company declined to comment. The United States is imposing new sanctions from Monday on Iran’s oil industry after Washington withdrew from a nuclear deal between Tehran and other global powers earlier this year. “We would lose foreign currency revenue had we’d been hit by the sanctions,” the source said, adding that this would also have a negative impact on its partners in other projects. Zarubezhneft’s main area of activity has been offshore oil in Vietnam since the 1980s. Another source said the company had no plans to work in Iran. The Iran deal was first struck in March and Zarubezhneft’s subsidiary, ZN-Vostok, opened an office in Tehran in April, according to the ownership records in Russian database SPARK. The database also showed that ZN-Vostok is now controlled by Promsirieimport, a trading unit of Russia’s Energy Ministry, which has been involved in Iranian oil trading. The energy ministry declined to comment on Zarubezhneft’s decision.  In May, Russian oil producer, Lukoil (LKOH.MM) said it had decided not to go ahead with plans to develop projects in Iran at the moment due to the threat of U.S. sanctions. The company was in talks with Iran over development of Abe Timur and Mansuri oilfields.

2018-11-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cuadrilla extracted its first shale gas from its site in northwest England, it said on Friday, after it began fracking operations there just over two weeks ago. Cuadrilla said the gas flows were small but coming at such an early stage of the project were evidence of the potential of the site. “This is a good early indication of the gas potential that we have long talked about,” Cuadrilla Chief Executive Francis Egan said in an emailed statement. Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure.    The practice, which started at the New Road site on Oct. 15 has been halted and restarted twice since then after small earth tremors were detected.    Britain’s regulatory system calls for any fracking to be paused if any tremor of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected. Cuadrilla said it plans to fully test flow rates from the current two exploration wells towards the end of 2018 and into the New Year to determine whether full-scale gas extraction would be viable. Fracking is opposed by environmentalists and green groups who say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.    But Britain’s government is supportive of the industry and is keen to reduce the country’s reliance on imports of natural gas, which is used to heat around 80 percent of Britain’s homes.     The British Geological Survey estimates shale gas resources in northern England alone could contain 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, 10 percent of which could meet the country’s demand for almost 40 years.     Cuadrilla which is 47.4 percent owned by Australia’s AJ Lucas (AJL.AX) and 45.2 percent owned by a fund managed by Riverstone, first extracted shale gas in England near the coastal town of Blackpool in the northwest in 2011, but it was stopped after causing a 2.3 magnitude earth tremor.    It said then that the quake was caused by an unusual combination of geological features, but it led to an 18-month nationwide ban on fracking while further research was carried out and a new regulatory system was implemented.

2018-11-02,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan up 1.4 pct * China shares rally on easing trade tensions, gov’t support * Weaker oil prices weigh on Australian index * Dollar index posts small bounce after Thursday’s drop By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares jumped on Friday after a phone call between the U.S. and Chinese presidents raised hopes of a thaw in trade tensions, but gains were checked by signs of slowing global  growth and a warning from tech giant Apple Inc on holiday sales. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched a two-and-a-half-week high and was last up 1.4 percent, adding to the previous session’s strong gains. But that came after a sharp 10.3 percent dive in October, its worst month since August 2015. Chinese blue-chips gained 1.7 percent, and China’s start-up board added 3 percent after President Xi Jinping promised more support for private firms. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1.2 percent higher. The cheerier mood in Asian trade followed a rise in U.S. shares overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each gaining 1.06 percent while  the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.75 percent. A combination of bargain-hunting following steep losses in equities last month and some strong corporate earnings have helped power Wall Street’s bounce. After the bell, though, shares of Apple tumbled about 7.0 percent after it said sales for the crucial holiday quarter could miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs. Apple suppliers in Asia largely shrugged off the news as investors hoped some progress was being made on trade. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co gained 1.5 percent, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co added 0.2 percent. Tech rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd also rallied, rising 2 percent. Global investors lapped up news that the leaders of the world’s two largest economies may be ready to take concrete steps to resolve their bitter trade dispute - one of the major factors behind the recent equity market rout. U.S. President Donald Trump said trade discussions with China were “moving along nicely” and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping expressed hopes of expanding trade cooperation. Trump said he planned to meet with Xi at an upcoming G-20 summit Earlier this week, Trump had been quoted as saying China was not ready to make a deal yet and he would impose more tariffs on Chinese goods unless he and Xi had productive talks. “While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now. Hence the next four weeks between the U.S. mid-term elections and the G20 meeting in Argentina on Nov 30 will be important to see how things progress,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist, Asia Pacific, at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “Combined with the prospects of more economic stimulus from China and reasonable valuations in Asian equities, investors could use this opportunity to reload on emerging market and Asia assets,” he said. All the same, a U.S. Justice Department indictment said companies based in mainland China and Taiwan had conspired to steal trade secrets for a U.S. semiconductor firm, underscoring Sino-U.S. trade tensions. Investors will be looking ahead to a U.S. jobs report, due at 1230 GMT, for more indications on the health of the U.S. economy and the clues on the pace of further interest rate rises. U.S. nonfarm payroll figures are expected to rise 190,000 in October from 134,000 a month earlier, with average hourly earnings seen increasing 0.2 percent in October after a 0.3 percent gain the previous month. Those numbers follow data this week revealing slower factory growth around the world, adding to worries about the outlook for corporate earnings, business investment and trade. Data from the U.S. showed cooling manufacturing activity in October as a measure of new orders hit a 1-1/2 year low. That came after manufacturing surveys showed factory activity and export orders weakening across Asia as the impact of the trade war deepened. In currency markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.1 percent at 96.367 after a sharp drop on Thursday. The dollar had fallen across the board as the pound rallied on reports that London is close to sealing a financial services deal with Brussels, and after the Bank of England hinted at slightly rate rises in future. “A corrective setup is in place for the USD, with overbought valuations and a series of reversals across various currency pairs arguing for a short-term pullback,” RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note. The pound fell 0.16 percent to $1.2988. The weaker dollar also boosted the offshore yuan after it touched 6.9800 per dollar on Thursday, its weakest level since January 2017. By 0306 GMT Friday the currency was changing hands at 6.9300. The onshore yuan was 0.14 percent weaker at 6.9295. The dollar inched up against the yen to 112.72, and the euro was down 0.11 percent on the day at $1.1394. U.S. crude dipped 0.6 percent to $63.31 a barrel.

2018-11-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global energy trading businesses are set for a new wave of consolidation as rising interest rates and high oil prices compress already thin profit margins, said Mercuria, one of the world’s biggest oil traders. “The overall industry is oversized,” chief executive Marco Dunand told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. “In the trading world, if you look typically over the last few years what the return on equity in trading is, it’s not so bad. But if you look at profit compared to turnover it is very small,” he said. The industry usually operates with a net margin of below 1 percent and during poor years closer to 0.5 percent, which Dunand said leaves very little room for error. “The net margin compared to turnover is probably one of the lowest you can find in markets... We believe there should be consolidation within the industry.” Mercuria grew rapidly in recent years by buying trading books and businesses of rivals such as JP Morgan as banks exited commodities trading and some parts of struggling rival Noble Group. “One way to grow, or at least reduce your cost base, is...consolidation,” said Dunand citing opportunity to reduce expenses such as back and legal offices: “Once you have those in place you don’t have to double in size”. Also spurring consolidation might be higher oil prices, requiring larger working capital to fund trading operations, as well as increasing interest rates around the world, he said. Mercuria is still looking to enter the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, Dunand said, where its rivals such as Gunvor and Trafigura have already carved out a chunk of the increasingly liquid market. The firm tried to gain exposure to LNG earlier this year when it was part of a failed bid by Harbour Energy to buy Australian gas producer Santos Ltd. The Swiss-based firm reported a gross profit of $674 million in 2017, down from $716 million in 2016 while traded volumes of crude and refined products rose to 121 million tonnes from 105 million tonnes. Volumes will go slightly up in 2018 and the trader will have more than 50 percent of its business in gas, power, coal and metals trading and less than 50 percent in oil and products, said Dunand.

Middle distillates such as diesel are expected to support overall demand for the fourth quarter, the company said in an earnings statement. A week ago, S-Oil, South Korea’s third-biggest refiner, said seasonal demand for heating and tight regional supply were expected to help boost refining margins in the fourth quarter. Oil refining margins have been volatile, with fuel oil and gasoil cracks soaring on tightening supply and higher demand for low-sulphur gasoil ahead of the implementation of stricter marine fuel regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). By contrast, a supply glut has weakened gasoline cracks. “Current weakness in gasoline cracks is due to increased export volumes from China and impact of non-peak season ... but further falls are expected to be limited,” Kang Dong-soo, head of corporate planning office at SK Energy, said in a call with analysts. Demand from India and China, as well as lower inventories, is expected to keep gasoil cracks firm, he said. SK Innovation’s July-September operating profit fell 12.7 percent to 836 billion won ($741 million) due to a weaker Korean won and lower inventory-related gains, down from 958 billion won a year earlier, the statement said. The company announced last year it would build a 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) Vacuum Residue Desulfurisation (VRDS) by 2020 in a bid to produce clear fuels ahead of tougher IMO sulphur regulations from 2020. Kang said construction of the unit was 27 percent complete, and it was expected to generate an annual operating profit of up to 300 billion won once it comes online. SK Innovation, which has a total refining capacity of 1.115 million barrels per day (bpd) in Ulsan and Incheon, ran at 92 percent capacity on average in the second quarter, slightly down from 94 percent during the same period a year earlier, the statement said.

The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2P1FGR7 By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production is rising at the fastest rate on record as the increase in prices over the last year boosts drilling and completion activity and energy firms employ more horsepower to fracture larger wells. Crude and condensates output hit a record 11.35 million barrels per day in August, up from 10.93 million bpd in July, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, Oct. 31). Crude output has increased by more than 2 million barrels per day over the past 12 months, an absolute increase that is unparalleled in the history of the U.S. oil industry (tmsnrt.rs/2P1FGR7). In percentage terms, output is up by nearly 25 percent over the last year, the fastest increase since the 1950s (excluding the recovery from hurricanes). U.S. oil production is now rising faster than at the height of the last drilling and fracking boom before prices slumped in the second half of 2014. Most of the increase is coming from onshore shale fields, where output has risen by more than 1.9 million bpd over the last year, with a smaller contribution from the Gulf of Mexico, where output is up 200,000 bpd. In the first nine months of the year, the number of wells drilled in the United States was up by 26 percent while well completions were up by 24 percent (“Drilling productivity report”, EIA, Oct. 15). Increasing U.S. output has helped alleviate earlier concerns about a possible crude shortage following the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran with effect from Nov. 5. Surging domestic output coupled with increased production from Russia, Saudi Arabia and a number of other OPEC countries has pushed oil prices lower and driven the futures markets back towards contango. Spot prices and calendar spreads for WTI have weakened rapidly since July, much further and faster than for Brent, in response to the improved availability of crude in the midcontinent of the United States. Six-month WTI calendar spreads are trading around 70 cents contango compared with a backwardation of more than $3 per barrel in July as traders become more confident about availability. But the accompanying increase in domestic inventories and crude exports has ensured weakness in inland WTI has begun to bleed into the seaborne crude market and started to pull down Brent prices too. Experience suggests there is an average delay of around 3-4 months between a change in futures prices and the number of rigs drilling for oil. Completions take an extra six months or so, giving a total lag from futures price changes to production of roughly 9-12 months. The surge in production reported in the first eight months of the year is therefore the lagged effect of the sharp rise in oil prices during the second half of 2017 and early 2018. But benchmark futures prices have levelled off since April and wellhead prices have softened significantly as a result of insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity in west Texas. The number of rigs drilling for oil was basically flat between the end of May and the end of September, which is likely to lead to a slowdown in production growth by the second and third quarters of 2019. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts average crude and condensates production will rise by just over 1 million b/d in 2019 after increasing by almost 1.4 million b/d in 2018. Production in the lower 48 states excluding federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, most of it from shale plays, is predicted to rise by 900,000 b/d next year down from 1.4 million b/d in 2018. Provided they are sustained, lower prices should help bring an unsustainable production boom back under control and keep domestic and international markets closer to balance.

2018-11-02,"* Output from Russia, USA and Saudi Arabia has surged * Top-3 crude oil production: tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8 * But U.S. sanctions against Iran to start next week By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Friday as record crude output by the world’s top-three producers offset supply concerns from the start of U.S. sanctions next week against Iran’s petroleum exports. Front-month Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $72.86 per barrel at 0041 GMT on Friday, down 3 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 16 cents at $63.53 a barrel. Traders said prices were weighed down by rising output. The 15-member producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) boosted oil production in October to the highest since 2016 at 33.31 million barrels per day (bpd), a Reuters survey found this week. That’s up 390,000 bpd from September and the highest by OPEC since December 2016, just before the group started to voluntarily withhold supply in January 2017 in order to prop up prices. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production surged by 416,000 bpd to a record 11.346 million bpd in August, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a monthly report this week. On a weekly basis, U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA stood at 11.2 million bpd last week. “Year-on-year growth in U.S. crude oil production has averaged almost 1.5 million barrels per day in the first eight months of the year... with output from many key producing regions reaching new all-time highs,” said Barclays bank. The United States is now in a race with Russia as top producer. Russian oil production has risen to a post-Soviet record high of 11.41 million bpd so far in October, up from 11.36 million bpd in September. With Saudi Arabia pumping out 10.65 million bpd so far in October, combined output from the top three oil producers is now higher than ever, at 33.41 million bpd, meaning that Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia alone meet more than a third of the world’s almost 100 million bpd of crude oil consumption. Despite the surge in output, concerns lingered as Washington is set to impose its sanctions against Iran’s petroleum exports from next week. Clayton Allen of Height Securities said Iran’s biggest oil customers, all in Asia, were seeking waivers to U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum exports. “Thus far, potential waivers appear targeted at India and South Korea, and they require some reductions over current import volumes while still allowing oil to flow,” he said. “We think Trump will agree to China importing some volumes, similar to the treatment that India and South Korea receive,” he said. Japan is seeking a similar deal. Despite these efforts, Allen said any potential Iran oil sanction waivers would likely only be temporary. “The U.S. may use waivers to slow walk implementation, but these will not apply indefinitely,” he added.

2018-11-02,"(Adds details, estimates) Nov 2 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc, Canada’s largest pipeline operator, topped analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Friday, as the company transported more oil on its Mainline system that runs from western Canada to the United States. The company said it moved 2.58 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil on its Mainline system during the quarter, up from 2.49 million bpd a year earlier. Canada’s oil producers are desperate for new export pipelines, as rising production and tight capacity on existing pipelines has led to Canadian crude trading at a wide discount to the West Texas Intermediate benchmark. Enbridge has aggressively sold assets this year, exceeding an announced target to reduce its high debt load following its $28-billion acquisition of Spectra Energy Corp. However, the company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of C$90 million, or 5 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of C$765 million, or 47 Canadian cents per share, a year ago. The loss was due to some charges, including a non-cash charge of C$1.02 billion, Enbridge said in a statement. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 55 Canadian Cents per share.

2018-11-02,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - In January, President Donald Trump fired the opening shot of his trade war, slapping tariffs on solar panel imports to boost U.S. manufacturing of a product long dominated by cheap foreign competition. But other duties his administration has imposed since then are making the solar panel components more expensive - dampening the domestic panel manufacturing sector’s initial hopes for expansion. The conflicting impacts of his tariffs illustrate the pitfalls the administration faces in using broad protections for economic development - because tariffs meant to help one industry often undermine those shielding another. Other examples include a levy on imported washing machines to help domestic manufacturers such as Whirlpool, the effect of which has since been undercut by separate tariffs on the imported steel and aluminium used to make them. For the solar industry, the impact of Trump’s tariffs for companies and jobs gets even more complex.  The United States currently accounts for just a fraction of the fast-growing global panel manufacturing industry, a key reason why Trump moved to protect the U.S. sector.  While the January tariff on panels initially boosted the U.S. manufacturing outlook, it dented the prospects for the panel installation business by making panels more expensive for consumers. Now solar manufacturers - including four that said they would expand U.S. production after Trump’s January announcement - are also taking a hit, this time from newer tariffs covering a range of Chinese-made components used in panel production.  Two companies with U.S. operations - China’s Jinko Solar and Silicon Valley startup Solaria - told Reuters they have scaled back initial growth plans as a result.  “The impacts are generally very, very negative,” Suvi Sharma, the chief executive of Solaria, told Reuters. Jinko slashed a planned $410 million investment at a manufacturing facility in Florida to just $50 million, costing the city of Jacksonville some 600 prospective jobs, according to public disclosures filed by the city council. Solaria abandoned its hopes of boosting production this year at its plant in Fremont, California and adding 20 jobs. Finished solar panels require scores of components, ranging from aluminium framing to transformers, solar glass and power inverters. Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium early this year, and many of the other materials used in panels now also face duties as part of Trump’s 10 percent levy on about $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect in September. The tax on those imports will rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the solar tariffs were designed with other duties in mind and that domestic solar panel manufacturers should consider buying their components from places other than China. That could be difficult because China is the top source of cheap components. But some panel manufacturers say they are already sourcing panel components from countries other than China, including Korea’s LG, which is starting panel production in Alabama next year, and Canada’s Heliene, which started production in Minnesota in October. Some component-makers are also shifting production out of China to serve U.S. manufacturers. Enphase Energy, for example, said it will start making microinverters for the U.S. market in Mexico. Its rival, SolarEdge, has said it would move some production to Romania and Hungary. The $17 billion U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, most of them in installation and development and only about a fifth in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Commerce Department’s senior renewable energy specialist, Cora Dickson, acknowledged at a September solar industry trade show that the tariffs impacting components pose a challenge for domestic panel manufacturers, but added they will be lifted once the U.S. and China come to better terms on trade.  “It’s not designed to cut off trade from China forever,” she said at the Solar Power International conference in Anaheim, California.  Solaria’s Sharma estimated that U.S. tariffs this year have increased the company’s U.S. production costs by about 30 percent – an amount equal to the original U.S. solar panel import duty. That means that, instead of ramping up its Fremont, California factory to its full 40 MW of capacity as Solaria had planned this year, it has kept production constant at an unspecified level. Jinko has seen its growth plans constrained by Trump administration tariffs on steel for factory construction, Chinese-made manufacturing equipment, said U.S. General Manager Nigel Cockroft. Certain parts for panel assembly are also “limiting factors,” he said. The public documents filed by Jacksonville’s city council in January and March show Jinko’s original $410 million investment plan for the Jacksonville facility would have produced some 800 jobs. The $50 million plan that replaced it will create 200. Jinko declined to elaborate on the documents. Sunpower - a major U.S.-based solar company that bought a manufacturing plant in Oregon after Trump’s initial panel import tariff - is another company feeling the pinch. “We are certainly concerned,” Suzanne Leta, the head of global market strategy at SunPower, said at the Solar Power International conference.  The new tariffs are discouraging the kind of manufacturing expansion the original tariffs on imported panels were meant to encourage, she said. Leta did not say specifically how the component tariffs might affect SunPower’s domestic output, and the company declined further comment. Other solar panel producers with U.S. operations contacted by Reuters - including Korea’s LG, and Canada’s Heliene - said they expected the impact of the new rounds of tariffs to be limited because of their particular supply chain dynamics. Another Canadian firm, Silfab Solar, expects “slightly elevated costs” at the U.S. factory in Bellingham, Washington it took over from Itek Energy LLC in October, according to spokesman Geoff Atkins. For First Solar Inc, which mostly manufactures panels in Asia but is expanding a factory in Ohio, tariffs pose a “headwind” for U.S. operations, Chief Executive Mark Widmar said on a conference call with analysts, citing higher costs for steel parts and aluminium frames. Solar and electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc complained about the tariffs in a September letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, saying they “will hinder American innovation, expansion of companies, and the creation of more American jobs.” The company declined to comment on the specific impact of the tariffs on its U.S. operations, including its solar manufacturing plant in Buffalo, New York, where it is already facing technical challenges to increasing output.  The Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA), the solar industry’s primary trade group, said it had opposed the initial solar panel tariff in January to begin with because it expected the benefit for domestic manufacturing would fail to compensate for damage to the solar installation industry.  Now, the impact of additional tariffs on components used in manufacturing are “slowing down something we had pretty low expectations for to begin with.”  Reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles; Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-solar/insight-trumps-latest-tariffs-undercut-his-first-trade-salvo-in-solar-idUKL8N1X4801,02 Nov 2018,"In January, President Donald

2018-11-02,"MOSCOW, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Leonid Fedun, a co-owner of Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil, has transferred a 2 percent stake in the company to his children, the company said. Based on Lukoil’s current market capitalisation, the 2 percent share is worth around $1.3 billion. Fedun’s stake in Lukoil has also been a subject of scrutiny because of his active share trading. He said last year that his stake stood at 9.5 percent and that he may transfer it to his children in the future. A Lukoil spokesman declined to give a reason for Fedun’s deal. Lukoil, the last large non-state oil company in Russia, Lukoil has suffered from sluggish production because its fields, located mostly in Western Siberia, are mature and depleted. But it has been focusing on growth in new producing regions, such as the Caspian Sea and Iraq. It is facing difficulties with efforts to team up with foreign companies to develop shale oil because of Western sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis. The company also announced that it had completed the purchase and cancellation of more than 100 million of its shares. After the deal, Chief Executive Officer Vagit Alekperov owns 26.06 percent of Lukoil common shares, the company said, up from 23 percent as of 2017-end.

2018-11-02,"HOUSTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - As U.S. oil production rises - setting records in average daily output nearly every month this year - the companies that convert crude to diesel and gasoline are increasing their ability to consume more crude and generate higher profits. Using more efficient equipment and running bigger plants at peak speeds, the combined capacity of nation’s 135 refineries was 18.6 million barrels per day (bpd) at the start of the year, up 16 percent over the 15.7 million bpd in 1985, when there were 223 refineries, according to Energy Information Administration data. Demand for new products coming from these expansions “will lead to higher refinery utilization, higher distillate prices and higher refinery margins generally,” Arvinder Saluja, a senior analyst at debt ratings firm Moody’s Investors Service, wrote in a report on Thursday. U.S. refinery utilization, or how much of the capacity is being used, hit a record 98 percent in early August, the EIA said. Utilization differs from capacity due to weather or maintenance disruptions, market demand and other factors. This year, high production and ample supplies of shale and heavy Canadian oil have made U.S. refiners very profitable. Refining income this year through September at Phillips 66 was $1.94 billion, up 87 percent from the year earlier. Valero Energy’s refining business posted an operating profit of $3.64 billion, up 21 percent. Just as shale producers are exporting more, U.S. refiners which convert crude into low-sulfur fuels should be able to drive exports of marine fuel and profits higher next year. Earning from such sales can remain strong through “at least 2022,” Moody’s Saluja said. Between 2012 and 2017, exports of finished U.S. refined products climbed by 772,000 bpd to 2.79 million bpd, accounting for a national increase of refined products exports of 735,000 bpd to 3.34 million bpd. Consolidation is also lifting refiners’ outlooks. Last month, second-largest refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp acquired fifth-largest Andeavor in part to gain Andeavor’s ability to process shale and because of its retail gasoline network in Mexico. Six of the 10 largest U.S. refineries are owned by oil producers, including Motiva, owned by Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE, Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp . “There is an enormous opportunity,” said Ken Medlock, senior director of energy studies at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. “The more functionally effective you are the more likely you are of turning a profit.” (Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/refineries-usa-growth/u-s-refiners-boost-processing-capacity-to-accommodate-shale-moodys-idUKL2N1X925X,02 Nov 2018,"As U.S. oil production rises -

2018-11-02,"* Russian govt, oil firms agree to cut wholesale fuel prices * Rise in gasoline, diesel prices unnerved drivers, authorities * New tax system to be introduced for oil industry on Jan. 1 By Vladimir Soldatkin MOSCOW, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Russian government and oil companies have agreed to cut wholesale domestic fuel prices as a temporary measure aimed at stemming an unwanted increase in the cost of petrol and diesel, a politically sensitive issue for voters. Petrol has become more expensive as a global deal to curb oil production led to a rise in the price of crude. Imminent U.S. sanctions against Iran, a large oil producer and exporter, have also lent upward pressure. Russian authorities are keen to prevent fuel from becoming too costly because previous price spikes angered voters. The government is already taking a series of unpopular measures to raise more revenue for the budget and needs to tread carefully. Earlier this year, it raised the rate of value-added tax and sharply increased the pension age - a move that knocked public support for President Vladimir Putin. According to ThomsonReuters Kortes data, gasoline and diesel retail prices have increased by almost 7 percent since May, way above annual inflation of around 4 percent - the level at which the government has promised to cap fuel prices next year. On Wednesday, the government and the largest oil producers hammered out a temporary deal to keep prices down, avoiding tougher measures such as prohibitive oil export duties. “A solution has been found, the situation has started to calm down,” Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak told reporters after meeting with the oil companies. According to the Russian central bank, the cost of gasoline has remained the main factor affecting inflation expectations, followed by the weaker rouble and food prices. Under the deal, which will be in force from Nov. 1 until March 31, oil firms will ramp up petrol and diesel supplies to the domestic market by 3 percent per month versus the year-earlier period. Next year, oil companies will be allowed to raise prices, frozen until the end of 2018, in line with inflation. “This is not a market mechanism, and does not add to the system’s transparency,” said Denis Borisov, director of the EY consultancy’s oil and gas centre in Moscow. “What will the government do if oil prices rise and the rouble weakens? This is only a temporary stop-gap measure in comparison to the new taxation starting on Jan. 1.” The retail cost of a litre of Ai-92 fuel, the most commonly used grade in Russia, jumped 7 percent to almost 42 roubles per litre in April-June, after which the government effectively brought in a price freeze. The Russian oil industry is due to get a new taxation system from Jan. 1 that will cut export duties while at the same time increasing the mineral extraction levy. VTB Capital called the agreement between the state and the companies “a move away from the market-pricing basis”. Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; additional reporting by

The signals triggered a global surge in risk appetite that lifted metals and swathes of trade-sensitive currencies and bond markets, but it was equities that saw the most explosive action. A jubilant Asian session, that included 2.5-4 percent leaps for most of region’s big bourses, put the world’s main emerging market index up three percent and on course for its best day and week since early 2016. Europe was overjoyed too. Germany’s export-heavy DAX jumped 1.5 percent in its best start since July, while Wall Street futures were also up almost one percent ahead of the monthly installment of non-farm payrolls jobs data. “When Trump wants to bump the market ahead of the mid-terms the market likes it,” Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy referring to next week’s mid-term U.S. elections. Hardy said while it might just be “political theatre” from Trump for now, the real test would come when he and China’s President Xi Jinping meet at a summit of world leaders later this month in Argentina. The other key focus meanwhile is if U.S. earnings numbers are strong later and whether that then sends 10 and 30-year U.S. bond yields punching up towards 3.5 percent. Europe’s bond yields rose were already on the rise and a Reuters poll shows economists expect a 190,000 rise in U.S. jobs and see hourly earnings increasing 0.2 percent having climbed 0.3 percent in September. Those numbers will follow data this week that has revealed slowing factory growth around the world, but for the day at least those worries were being soothed by the brighter U.S.-China mood. In currency markets, the hopes saw the dollar dip to a week-low though it held its ground against the safe-haven yen at 113.00 yen. China’s yuan strengthened to a high of 6.9092 per dollar in onshore markets and also firmed in offshore trade , pulling away from the sensitive seven level. The euro also edged up 0.15 percent to $1.1426 while the Australian dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7240 and sterling made ground again to $1.30 on hopes London is closing in on transitional deal for when it leaves the EU next year. If it doesn’t slip it will be the second best week of the year for the pound. Thursday was its best day of the year. “Were it not for Brexit uncertainty, the Bank of England would probably have laid the groundwork (at its meeting on Thursday) for its next rate hike,” BNP Paribas analysts said in a note. Metals led the charge in the commodity markets on the hopes a trade deal will prevent China’s resource-hungry economy faltering. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange climbed as much as 2.5 percent to $6,240.50 a tonne, its highest in a week. Other base metals were up across the board too, with zinc rising 1.8 percent, nickel climbing 1.7 percent, lead up 1.3 percent and aluminum gaining 0.9 percent. Oil prices were less energetic but had managed to reverse early Asian losses, with U.S. crude last at $63.63 a barrel and Brent crude a touch higher at $72.99.

2018-11-02,"KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s new government will cut public spending sharply despite foreseeing the economy growing more slowly than had been expected earlier, as it has to reduce a large debt pile left behind by the previous administration. Voted into power in May, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s government quickly revised up Malaysia’s debt to around 1 trillion ringgit ($239.23 billion), saying it had been understated by Najib Razak, the former premier now facing multiple charges of graft and abuse of power. The government released its economic outlook report on Friday, to accompany its first budget. The report forecast economic growth of 4.8 percent in 2018 - a sharp drop from the 5.9 percent pace a year earlier - with a slight pick up to 4.9 percent next year. Last month, Mahathir had flagged expectations that growth would be between 4.5-4.9 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 5.0 percent. “Private sector expenditure will remain as the key driver of growth, cushioning the effects of lower public sector spending in 2018 and 2019,” the government said in the report. Public sector investment is forecast to contract by 1.5 percent in 2018 and fall further by 5.4 percent next year. The slowing growth and spending forecasts come two weeks after the government abandoned previous fiscal goals, estimating wider budget deficits over the next few years. Mahathir’s government is set to deliver an austerity flavoured first budget on Friday, as it looks to fill a revenue gap left by the scrapping of a consumption tax. It has already announced the cancellation or suspension of at least $20 billion in public infrastructure projects, and the government is unlikely to invest in new projects in the short-term, according to the economic report. In 2019 monetary policy will remain accommodative and any “adjustments will depend on risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation,” the government said in the report. Inflation is projected to increase 2.5-3.5 percent next year from this year’s 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The government expects the private sector to play a bigger role in development, with private investments seen growing 4.5 percent this year and increasing 5 percent in 2019. Private consumption will remain the main growth driver. It is projected to grow 7.2 percent in 2018 and moderate slightly to 6.8 percent in 2019. Most sectors will likely face tepid growth over this year and 2019, though the mining sector is seen rebounding from a 0.6 percent decline in 2018 to grow 0.7 percent the following year. Agriculture is seen expanding 3.1 percent in 2019, improving on 0.2 percent projected growth this year due to expected improvements in palm oil yield. The government said export growth will likely ease slightly to 3.9 percent in 2019 from 4.4 percent growth projected for this year. The current account surplus is projected to narrow to 38.6 billion ringgit in 2018, down from 40.3 billion ringgit the previous year. The government expects it to drop further in 2019 to 34 billion ringgit. ($1 = 4.1800 ringgit) (Editing by A.

2018-11-02,"KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Malaysia announced an expanded budget for 2019 and forecast a wider fiscal deficit as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s new administration tussles with shrinking revenue and a large debt left by the previous administration. The new government is resetting “its fiscal consolidation path starting from 2019 to account for narrow revenue base, additional provision for off-budget items and tax refunds,” it said in a fiscal outlook report released on Friday alongside the presentation of next year’s budget. Malaysia has budgeted 314.6 billion ringgit ($75.53 billion) for government expenditure in 2019, up 8.3 percent from this year’s revised budget of 290.4 billion ringgit, according to the report. Total revenue is projected to rise to 261.8 billion ringgit next year, up from 236.5 billion ringgit from 2018. The government said it has decided to settle outstanding tax refunds of around 37 billion ringgit, much of which will be funded by a one-off special dividend of 30 billion ringgit from state energy firm Petronas. The oil and gas company will also pay a regular annual dividend of 24 billion ringgit, according to the report. The fiscal deficit, which is closely tracked by ratings firms, is expected to hit 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019. The deficit will come in at 3.7 percent for this year, higher than an earlier forecast of 2.8 percent, the government said. It is undertaking a more rigorous expenditure optimisation exercise, the report said, adding that a tax reform committee has been set up to review tax incentives and explore new sources of revenue. Friday’s budget announcement is the first by Mahathir’s government since Malaysians ended former leader Najib Razak’s near decade long rule at a general election in May. Analysts had widely predicted cuts to public spending, especially after Mahathir in October announced plans to reduce development spending and blamed Najib’s administration for saddling the country with debt of more than 1 trillion ringgit. Revenue collection had also taken a hit after the new government scrapped a six percent consumption tax and reintroduced fuel subsidies earlier this year. In an economic report released on Friday, Malaysia said it will cut public spending sharply despite foreseeing the economy growing more slowly.

2018-11-02,"HARARE, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Australian-listed Invictus Energy said on Friday it had not found oil and gas deposits in northern Zimbabwe but there were indications of a “working petroleum system” which could only be confirmed by a planned exploration well. President Emmerson Mnangagwa told reporters on Thursday that Invictus had found oil and gas deposits in the Muzarabani area and had agreed to enter a production sharing arrangement with Zimbabwe once the project reached commercial production. But in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Invictus tampered Zimbabwe’s expectations of an oil bonanza saying “an oil or gas discovery has not been made.” “The prospective resource estimate for the Muzarabani prospect relates to undiscovered accumulations which have both a risk of discovery and a risk of development,” said Invictus. “Although the Cabora Bassa Basin possess all the elements for a working petroleum system, a discovery can only be confirmed through drilling of an exploration well.” Zimbabwean-born Invictus Managing Director Scott MacMillan attended Mnangagwa’s news conference on Thursday. Mines Minister Winston Chitando said the well would be sunk in 2020 at a cost of $20 million and said the Muzarabani project was the largest undrilled onshore resource in Africa. Invictus, which is an independent oil and gas exploration firm whose only asset is in Zimbabwe, is using data first generated by Mobil Oil during its studies in the 1990s. Chitando said Invictus had made more progress than Mobil because it had a better knowledge of the Muzarabani basin which had a similar geological structure to Uganda and Kenya, where oil has been discovered.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 2.7 percent to hit its highest level since Oct. 10. It is up 6.4 percent on the week, on course to mark its best weekly performance in three years. South Korea’s Kospi gained 3.5 percent, the biggest gains in almost seven years, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 3.6 percent. “Asia is the most sensitive to trade wars so Asian shares naturally have the most to gain from the prospects of a trade deal,” said Makoto Sakuma, researcher at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo. Japan’s Nikkei stock index rose 2.6 percent higher while U.S. S&P500 e-mini futures rose 0.7 percent. European stocks are expected to follow suit, with financial spread-betters seeing Britain’s FTSE rising 0.9 percent and France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX 1.0 percent each. Chinese shares surged and the yuan firmed. Chinese blue-chips gained 3.3 percent, and its start-up board added 4.5 percent, also buoyed by President Xi’s pledge on Thursday of more support for private firms. MSCI China gained 7.9 percent so far this, about the double the 3.5 percent gains in MSCI’s broadest gauge of global stocks, ACWI. Bloomberg reported that Trump is interested in reaching a trade agreement with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 nations summit in Argentina later this month and has asked key U.S. officials to begin drafting potential terms, citing people familiar with the matter. One person said a sticking point in any potential deal is intellectual property theft, where the Trump administration has sought to take a hard line, and it was unclear if Trump was easing up on U.S. demands that China has resisted. Earlier this week, Trump was quoted as saying Beijing wasn’t ready to do a deal and he was prepared to slap more tariffs on China if his meeting with Xi was not productive. The Bloomberg report came after the two leaders expressed optimism on Thursday about resolving their bitter trade disputes, one of the major factors behind a recent global equity market rout. “While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist, Asia Pacific, at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “The next four weeks between the U.S. mid-term elections and the G20 meeting in Argentina on Nov 30 will be important to see how things progress.” On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each gained 1.06 percent while  the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.75 percent. A combination of bargain-hunting following steep losses in equities last month and some strong corporate earnings have helped power Wall Street’s bounce. After the bell, though, shares of Apple tumbled about 7.0 percent after it said sales for the crucial holiday quarter could miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs. Apple suppliers in Asia largely shrugged off the news as investors hoped some progress was being made on trade. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co gained 1.4 percent, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co added 0.4 percent. Tech rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd also rallied, rising 4.7 percent. Investors will be looking ahead to a U.S. jobs report, due at 1230 GMT, for more indications on the health of the U.S. economy and the clues on the pace of further interest rate rises. U.S. nonfarm payroll figures are expected to rise 190,000 in October from 134,000 a month earlier, with average hourly earnings seen increasing 0.2 percent in October after a 0.3 percent gain the previous month. Those numbers follow data this week revealing slower factory growth around the world, adding to worries about the outlook for corporate earnings, business investment and trade. Data from the U.S. showed cooling manufacturing activity in October as a measure of new orders hit a 1-1/2 year low. That came after manufacturing surveys showed factory activity and export orders weakening across Asia as the impact of the trade war deepened.

2018-11-02,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - French energy group Engie remains committed to using natural gas for power generation despite selling its oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) unit and LNG assets during the past two years. The company, which generates half of its electricity globally from natural gas and the rest from renewables, sees a strong global movement to tap biogas for power generation, Engie’s Executive Vice President Didier Holleaux told the Reuters Commodities Summit. “Having a strong position in upstream and midstream LNG is no longer necessary for us,” Holleaux said. “We also see a strong move into more and more renewable gas world-wide: Gas produced through the methanization of agricultural waste and from waste treatment.” Engie sold its oil and gas E&P unit to UK upstream independent Neptune Energy Group last year and also completed a sale of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business to Total in July. The company continues to be involved in gas distribution in the Asia Pacific and is working on various LNG infrastructure projects as it believes that replacing coal with gas is the easiest and quickest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region, Holleaux said. These include a project in Indonesia with Perusahaan Gas Negara and Perusahaan Listrik Negara, the state-owned gas and power companies, to supply LNG to 10 different power plants, said Holleaux, who was attending the Singapore International Energy Week. Engie is also rebuilding its LNG trading business globally with a team headed by Gordon Waters in Singapore. “The fact that we have sold our mid-stream business doesn’t mean that we have no need for short-term LNG trading because from time to time we need cargoes,” Holleaux said. “LNG globally will be growing, short-term trading will be growing because there are needs for adjustment (to supplies) for this market. We’ll just be a small part of this business.” For renewables, Engie is seeking to expand its market share in selling electricity directly to corporations instead of grids and it is working with partners such as French retailer Casino and Unisun in China. Engie will exit the coal-fired power business in Asia once it completes the sale of its Thai subsidiary Glow Energy, part of the company’s two-year plan to sell off coal, upstream oil and gas businesses and to invest in areas such as renewable energy, power grids and energy services. The $4 billion deal to sell Glow to Global Power Synergy Company Pcl (GPSC), a unit of PTT Pcl’s, was blocked by Thailand’s energy regulator earlier in October. “It’s for the buyer GPSC to decide if they will appeal to the Thai government. We will act accordingly,” Holleaux said, adding that Engie would have to look for other buyers if GPSC decides not to appeal. “We still have a few coal assets outside of Asia Pacific which we want to divest,” he said.

2018-11-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s biggest oil traders are gearing up to cash in on big disruptions that could hit the shipping fuel market in just over a year due to new U.N.-mandated environmental rules.  International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations will cut the limit for sulfur in marine fuels globally from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent from the start of 2020. “We’re going to hopefully facilitate the new rules in 2020 by helping out the industry and the participants in general to have a reasonably smooth transition,” Marco Dunand, the chief executive of trading house Mercuria, told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. He said Mercuria was in talks to finance shipowners who want to install expensive sulfur cleaning kits called scrubbers, allowing them to burn cheaper high sulfur fuel. He declined to name those clients.  The company is offering a package that would include providing compliant fuels via its subsidiary Minerva as well as fuel-price hedging. Traders are widely expected to benefit as they thrive off efficiently moving products between regions with price dislocations. But the market currently lacks a benchmark for the new compliant fuel grade.  “There are legitimate concerns about this product being available in multiple locations,” Vitol Group Chief Executive Russell Hardy told the summit. He added that planning for the changes in the absence of a futures market was complicating matters. “It’s doable but we would like a bit of transparency,” he said. While S&P Global Platts, the agency that publishes benchmark physical fuel oil price assessments, plans to launch a set of new 0.5 percent sulfur prices starting in January, a paper market does not yet exist. “I think it will be a bit chaotic in the beginning of 2020 ... (but) we don’t think it’s going to be extremely disruptive,”  Gunvor CEO Torbjorn Tornqvist told the summit. Other winners from the changes will be complex refineries that have invested in the right kit to turn high-sulfur products into low-sulfur, or sweet, ones.  This leaves simple refiners that can’t easily clean sulfur from petroleum products at a risk of losing out. Shipowners, on the other hand, could be facing an extra $30 billion in fuel costs in 2020, according to a base case scenario from consultancy Wood Mackenzie. This compares with a total global shipping fuel bill of roughly $100 billion today.  Vitol sees 3,000-4,000 scrubbers installed around the 2020 implementation date, a number that means high sulfur, or heavy, fuel oil is expected to remain in demand. Vitol has opted to install scrubbers on its bigger ships.  “It’s not the amount of scrubbers you do, but on which ships because the majority of bunker fuel that is consumed today goes on 20-30 percent of the global fleet,” Tornqvist said.  As such, Gunvor, which has also invested in some scrubbers, believes there will still be demand for heavy fuel oil, as scrubber uptake increases through 2020 and 2022. Vitol expects around 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) of middle distillates to go into the 3 million bpd bunker pool to make the new product. That equates to about 2.5 percent of the entire 30 million bpd distillates market, Hardy said. He added this transition could be achieved with the right price incentives.  Tornqvist said the future price difference of around $40 a barrel between gasoil and heavy fuel oil gave “an extreme incentive to install a scrubber”.

2018-11-02,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping both expressed optimism on Thursday about resolving their bitter trade disputes ahead of a high-stakes meeting planned for the two leaders at the end of November in Argentina. But within hours of the upbeat assessments, the U.S. Justice Department took aim at another Chinese firm it accused of unfair practices, part of an across-the-board pressure campaign by the Trump administration targeting Beijing. Trump said on Twitter that trade discussions with China were “moving along nicely,” and that he planned to meet with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 leaders summit, after the two had a “very good” phone discussion. In comments to state media, Xi said he hoped China and the United States would be able to promote a steady and healthy relationship, and that he was willing to meet with Trump in Argentina.  “The two countries’ trade teams should strengthen contact and conduct consultations on issues of concern to both sides, and promote a plan that both can accept to reach a consensus on the China-U.S. trade issue,” Xi said on CCTV state television. Xi was quoted by CCTV as saying after the call with Trump that the two leaders had hoped to expand bilateral trade cooperation. Neither leader specified any details of potential progress in their first known direct discussion in several months. Trump administration officials have said that trade talks with China cannot resume until Beijing comes up with specific actions it is willing take to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to policies on technology transfers, industrial subsidies and market access. The two countries already have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods and Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on the remainder of China’s $500 billion-plus (£384.5 billion-plus) exports to the United States if the disputes cannot be resolved. Just after the upbeat readouts of the Trump-Xi call, the Justice Department announced the latest in a long list of actions against what Trump administration calls China’s cheating through intellectual property theft, unfair corporate subsidies and rules hampering U.S. corporations in China. A Justice Department indictment targeted two companies based in China and Taiwan and three individuals, saying they conspired to steal trade secrets from U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology Inc (MU.O). Earlier this week, prosecutors announced an indictment against 10 defendants, including two Chinese intelligence officers and other computer hackers and co-conspirators, who are all accused of breaking into American company computers to steal data on a turbo fan engine used in commercial jetliners. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China was probably Washington’s biggest long term security challenge and the United States was engaged in a “multi-pronged effort ... to convince China to behave like a normal nation on commerce” and respect international law. But Trump struck a more affable tone on Twitter after the phone call with Xi. “Just had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade,” Trump tweeted. “Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina. Also had good discussion on North Korea!” Earlier on Thursday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told a group of visiting U.S. politicians that China and the United States could overcome their differences and get relations back on track if they worked together in a spirit of mutual respect.  China and the United States are locked in an increasingly bitter trade war, and both countries have already placed tariffs on some of each others’ imports. Meeting a group of Republican lawmakers in Beijing, China’s Li noted the China-U.S. relationship’s “ups and downs” over the past four decades of diplomatic ties. “We do hope that China and the United States will meet each other halfway and work together in the spirit of mutual respect and equality,” Li told Trump’s fellow Republicans.  U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee told Li that the delegation was there “to show our respect to a great country and a great people,” and that the two countries “are competitors but not adversaries.” Alexander said he would be discussing trade with Li, though neither of them mentioned the ongoing tariff war in remarks in front of reporters. Earlier this week, Trump said he thought there would be “a great deal” with China on trade, but warned that he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to go if a deal did not materialise. The United States has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, with duties on $200 billion of the total set to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on Jan. 1, 2019. China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods.

The company, which generates half of its electricity globally from natural gas and the rest from renewables, sees a strong global movement to tap biogas for power generation, Engie’s Senior Vice President Didier Holleaux told the Reuters Commodities Summit. “Having a strong position in upstream and midstream LNG is no longer necessary for us,” Holleaux said. “We also see a strong move into more and more renewable gas world-wide: Gas produced through the methanization of agricultural waste and from waste treatment.” Engie sold its oil and gas E&P unit to UK upstream independent Neptune Energy Group last year and also completed a sale of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business to Total in July. The company continues to be involved in gas distribution in the Asia Pacific and is working on various LNG infrastructure projects as it believes that replacing coal with gas is the easiest and quickest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region, Holleaux said. These include a project in Indonesia with Perusahaan Gas Negara and Perusahaan Listrik Negara, the state-owned gas and power companies, to supply LNG to 10 different power plants, said Holleaux, who was attending the Singapore International Energy Week. Engie is also rebuilding its LNG trading business globally with a team headed by Gordon Waters in Singapore. “The fact that we have sold our mid-stream business doesn’t mean that we have no need for short-term LNG trading because from time to time we need cargoes,” Holleaux said. “LNG globally will be growing, short-term trading will be growing because there are needs for adjustment (to supplies) for this market. We’ll just be a small part of this business.” For renewables, Engie is seeking to expand its market share in selling electricity directly to corporations instead of grids and it is working with partners such as French retailer Casino and Unisun in China. Engie will exit the coal-fired power business in Asia once it completes the sale of its Thai subsidiary Glow Energy , part of the company’s two-year plan to sell off coal, upstream oil and gas businesses and to invest in areas such as renewable energy, power grids and energy services. The $4 billion deal to sell Glow to Global Power Synergy Company Pcl (GPSC), a unit of PTT Pcl’s, was blocked by Thailand’s energy regulator earlier in October. “It’s for the buyer GPSC to decide if they will appeal to the Thai government. We will act accordingly,” Holleaux said, adding that Engie would have to look for other buyers if GPSC decides not to appeal. “We still have a few coal assets outside of Asia Pacific which we want to divest,” he said.

2018-11-02,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan up 1.4 pct * China shares rally on easing trade tensions, gov’t support * Weaker oil prices weigh on Australian index * Dollar index posts small bounce after Thursday’s drop By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares jumped on Friday after a phone call between the U.S. and Chinese presidents raised hopes of a thaw in trade tensions, but gains were checked by signs of slowing global  growth and a warning from tech giant Apple Inc on holiday sales. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched a two-and-a-half-week high and was last up 1.4 percent, adding to the previous session’s strong gains. But that came after a sharp 10.3 percent dive in October, its worst month since August 2015. Chinese blue-chips gained 1.7 percent, and China’s start-up board added 3 percent after President Xi Jinping promised more support for private firms. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1.2 percent higher. The cheerier mood in Asian trade followed a rise in U.S. shares overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each gaining 1.06 percent while  the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.75 percent. A combination of bargain-hunting following steep losses in equities last month and some strong corporate earnings have helped power Wall Street’s bounce. After the bell, though, shares of Apple tumbled about 7.0 percent after it said sales for the crucial holiday quarter could miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs. Apple suppliers in Asia largely shrugged off the news as investors hoped some progress was being made on trade. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co gained 1.5 percent, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co added 0.2 percent. Tech rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd also rallied, rising 2 percent. Global investors lapped up news that the leaders of the world’s two largest economies may be ready to take concrete steps to resolve their bitter trade dispute - one of the major factors behind the recent equity market rout. U.S. President Donald Trump said trade discussions with China were “moving along nicely” and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping expressed hopes of expanding trade cooperation. Trump said he planned to meet with Xi at an upcoming G-20 summit Earlier this week, Trump had been quoted as saying China was not ready to make a deal yet and he would impose more tariffs on Chinese goods unless he and Xi had productive talks. “While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now. Hence the next four weeks between the U.S. mid-term elections and the G20 meeting in Argentina on Nov 30 will be important to see how things progress,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist, Asia Pacific, at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “Combined with the prospects of more economic stimulus from China and reasonable valuations in Asian equities, investors could use this opportunity to reload on emerging market and Asia assets,” he said. All the same, a U.S. Justice Department indictment said companies based in mainland China and Taiwan had conspired to steal trade secrets for a U.S. semiconductor firm, underscoring Sino-U.S. trade tensions. Investors will be looking ahead to a U.S. jobs report, due at 1230 GMT, for more indications on the health of the U.S. economy and the clues on the pace of further interest rate rises. U.S. nonfarm payroll figures are expected to rise 190,000 in October from 134,000 a month earlier, with average hourly earnings seen increasing 0.2 percent in October after a 0.3 percent gain the previous month. Those numbers follow data this week revealing slower factory growth around the world, adding to worries about the outlook for corporate earnings, business investment and trade. Data from the U.S. showed cooling manufacturing activity in October as a measure of new orders hit a 1-1/2 year low. That came after manufacturing surveys showed factory activity and export orders weakening across Asia as the impact of the trade war deepened. In currency markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.1 percent at 96.367 after a sharp drop on Thursday. The dollar had fallen across the board as the pound rallied on reports that London is close to sealing a financial services deal with Brussels, and after the Bank of England hinted at slightly rate rises in future. “A corrective setup is in place for the USD, with overbought valuations and a series of reversals across various currency pairs arguing for a short-term pullback,” RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note. The pound fell 0.16 percent to $1.2988. The weaker dollar also boosted the offshore yuan after it touched 6.9800 per dollar on Thursday, its weakest level since January 2017. By 0306 GMT Friday the currency was changing hands at 6.9300. The onshore yuan was 0.14 percent weaker at 6.9295. The dollar inched up against the yen to 112.72, and the euro was down 0.11 percent on the day at $1.1394. U.S. crude dipped 0.6 percent to $63.31 a barrel. Brent crude was 0.5 percent lower at $72.51. Spot gold eased 0.08 percent to $1,232.81 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith

2018-11-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global energy trading businesses are set for a new wave of consolidation as rising interest rates and high oil prices compress already thin profit margins, said Mercuria, one of the world’s biggest oil traders. “The overall industry is oversized,” chief executive Marco Dunand told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. “In the trading world, if you look typically over the last few years what the return on equity in trading is, it’s not so bad. But if you look at profit compared to turnover it is very small,” he said. The industry usually operates with a net margin of below 1 percent and during poor years closer to 0.5 percent, which Dunand said leaves very little room for error. “The net margin compared to turnover is probably one of the lowest you can find in markets... We believe there should be consolidation within the industry.” Mercuria grew rapidly in recent years by buying trading books and businesses of rivals such as JP Morgan as banks exited commodities trading and some parts of struggling rival Noble Group. “One way to grow, or at least reduce your cost base, is...consolidation,” said Dunand citing opportunity to reduce expenses such as back and legal offices: “Once you have those in place you don’t have to double in size”. Also spurring consolidation might be higher oil prices, requiring larger working capital to fund trading operations, as well as increasing interest rates around the world, he said. Mercuria is still looking to enter the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, Dunand said, where its rivals such as Gunvor and Trafigura have already carved out a chunk of the increasingly liquid market. The firm tried to gain exposure to LNG earlier this year when it was part of a failed bid by Harbour Energy to buy Australian gas producer Santos Ltd. The Swiss-based firm reported a gross profit of $674 million in 2017, down from $716 million in 2016 while traded volumes of crude and refined products rose to 121 million tonnes from 105 million tonnes. Volumes will go slightly up in 2018 and the trader will have more than 50 percent of its business in gas, power, coal and metals trading and less than 50 percent in oil and products, said Dunand.

2018-11-02,"* Sees middle distillates demand supporting Q4 demand * Expects further falls in gasoline cracks to be limited * Demand from India, China to keep gasoil cracks firm * New VRDS unit construction currently 27 pct complete * Q3 operating profit down abt 13 pct to 836 bln won y/y (Adds comments, details) By Jane Chung SEOUL, Nov 2 (Reuters) - SK Innovation, owner of South Korea’s top refiner SK Energy, said on Friday that market conditions are expected to be “favourable” in the fourth quarter on the back of firm demand. Middle distillates such as diesel are expected to support overall demand for the fourth quarter, the company said in an earnings statement. A week ago, S-Oil, South Korea’s third-biggest refiner, said seasonal demand for heating and tight regional supply were expected to help boost refining margins in the fourth quarter. Oil refining margins have been volatile, with fuel oil and gasoil cracks soaring on tightening supply and higher demand for low-sulphur gasoil ahead of the implementation of stricter marine fuel regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). By contrast, a supply glut has weakened gasoline cracks. “Current weakness in gasoline cracks is due to increased export volumes from China and impact of non-peak season ... but further falls are expected to be limited,” Kang Dong-soo, head of corporate planning office at SK Energy, said in a call with analysts. Demand from India and China, as well as lower inventories, is expected to keep gasoil cracks firm, he said. SK Innovation’s July-September operating profit fell 12.7 percent to 836 billion won ($741 million) due to a weaker Korean won and lower inventory-related gains, down from 958 billion won a year earlier, the statement said. The company announced last year it would build a 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) Vacuum Residue Desulfurisation (VRDS) by 2020 in a bid to produce clear fuels ahead of tougher IMO sulphur regulations from 2020. Kang said construction of the unit was 27 percent complete, and it was expected to generate an annual operating profit of up to 300 billion won once it comes online. SK Innovation, which has a total refining capacity of 1.115 million barrels per day (bpd) in Ulsan and Incheon, ran at 92 percent capacity on average in the second quarter, slightly down from 94 percent during the same period a year earlier, the statement said.

2018-11-02,"(Repeats Nov. 1 story with no change to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2P1FGR7 By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production is rising at the fastest rate on record as the increase in prices over the last year boosts drilling and completion activity and energy firms employ more horsepower to fracture larger wells. Crude and condensates output hit a record 11.35 million barrels per day in August, up from 10.93 million bpd in July, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, Oct. 31). Crude output has increased by more than 2 million barrels per day over the past 12 months, an absolute increase that is unparalleled in the history of the U.S. oil industry (tmsnrt.rs/2P1FGR7). In percentage terms, output is up by nearly 25 percent over the last year, the fastest increase since the 1950s (excluding the recovery from hurricanes). U.S. oil production is now rising faster than at the height of the last drilling and fracking boom before prices slumped in the second half of 2014. Most of the increase is coming from onshore shale fields, where output has risen by more than 1.9 million bpd over the last year, with a smaller contribution from the Gulf of Mexico, where output is up 200,000 bpd. In the first nine months of the year, the number of wells drilled in the United States was up by 26 percent while well completions were up by 24 percent (“Drilling productivity report”, EIA, Oct. 15). Increasing U.S. output has helped alleviate earlier concerns about a possible crude shortage following the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran with effect from Nov. 5. Surging domestic output coupled with increased production from Russia, Saudi Arabia and a number of other OPEC countries has pushed oil prices lower and driven the futures markets back towards contango. Spot prices and calendar spreads for WTI have weakened rapidly since July, much further and faster than for Brent, in response to the improved availability of crude in the midcontinent of the United States. Six-month WTI calendar spreads are trading around 70 cents contango compared with a backwardation of more than $3 per barrel in July as traders become more confident about availability. But the accompanying increase in domestic inventories and crude exports has ensured weakness in inland WTI has begun to bleed into the seaborne crude market and started to pull down Brent prices too. Experience suggests there is an average delay of around 3-4 months between a change in futures prices and the number of rigs drilling for oil. Completions take an extra six months or so, giving a total lag from futures price changes to production of roughly 9-12 months. The surge in production reported in the first eight months of the year is therefore the lagged effect of the sharp rise in oil prices during the second half of 2017 and early 2018. But benchmark futures prices have levelled off since April and wellhead prices have softened significantly as a result of insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity in west Texas. The number of rigs drilling for oil was basically flat between the end of May and the end of September, which is likely to lead to a slowdown in production growth by the second and third quarters of 2019. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts average crude and condensates production will rise by just over 1 million b/d in 2019 after increasing by almost 1.4 million b/d in 2018. Production in the lower 48 states excluding federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, most of it from shale plays, is predicted to rise by 900,000 b/d next year down from 1.4 million b/d in 2018. Provided they are sustained, lower prices should help bring an unsustainable production boom back under control and keep domestic and international markets closer to balance.

2018-11-02,"* Output from Russia, USA and Saudi Arabia has surged * Top-3 crude oil production: tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8 * But U.S. sanctions against Iran to start next week By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Friday as record crude output by the world’s top-three producers offset supply concerns from the start of U.S. sanctions next week against Iran’s petroleum exports. Front-month Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $72.86 per barrel at 0041 GMT on Friday, down 3 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 16 cents at $63.53 a barrel. Traders said prices were weighed down by rising output. The 15-member producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) boosted oil production in October to the highest since 2016 at 33.31 million barrels per day (bpd), a Reuters survey found this week. That’s up 390,000 bpd from September and the highest by OPEC since December 2016, just before the group started to voluntarily withhold supply in January 2017 in order to prop up prices. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production surged by 416,000 bpd to a record 11.346 million bpd in August, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a monthly report this week. On a weekly basis, U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA stood at 11.2 million bpd last week. “Year-on-year growth in U.S. crude oil production has averaged almost 1.5 million barrels per day in the first eight months of the year... with output from many key producing regions reaching new all-time highs,” said Barclays bank. The United States is now in a race with Russia as top producer. Russian oil production has risen to a post-Soviet record high of 11.41 million bpd so far in October, up from 11.36 million bpd in September. With Saudi Arabia pumping out 10.65 million bpd so far in October, combined output from the top three oil producers is now higher than ever, at 33.41 million bpd, meaning that Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia alone meet more than a third of the world’s almost 100 million bpd of crude oil consumption. Despite the surge in output, concerns lingered as Washington is set to impose its sanctions against Iran’s petroleum exports from next week. Clayton Allen of Height Securities said Iran’s biggest oil customers, all in Asia, were seeking waivers to U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum exports. “Thus far, potential waivers appear targeted at India and South Korea, and they require some reductions over current import volumes while still allowing oil to flow,” he said. “We think Trump will agree to China importing some volumes, similar to the treatment that India and South Korea receive,” he said. Japan is seeking a similar deal. Despite these efforts, Allen said any potential Iran oil sanction waivers would likely only be temporary. “The U.S. may use waivers to slow walk implementation, but these will not apply indefinitely,” he added.
