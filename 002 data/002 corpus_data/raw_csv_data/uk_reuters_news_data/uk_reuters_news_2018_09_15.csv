2018-09-15,"KOLWEZI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - The prime minister of Democratic Republic of Congo will sign a decree in the coming days to designate cobalt and other minerals as “strategic” and therefore subject to higher royalties, Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu said on Saturday. The change is part of a new mining code, which mining companies including Glencore (GLEN.L) and Randgold RRS.L oppose as it axes tax exemptions and hikes royalties and profit taxes. They have been holding out the hope it might be watered down in further negotiations. The government has not yet formally announced which metals will be classed as strategic in the new code and subject to royalties of 10 percent. Before the code was introduced, companies paid a rate of 2 percent for cobalt.   Addressing a mining conference in the copper and cobalt-mining city of Kolwezi, Kabwelulu said: “in the coming days, you will see the prime minister sign a decree to declare cobalt and certain other substances as strategic.” Miners of cobalt would have paid a royalty of 3.5 percent under the new code if its designation had stayed the same. The government considers minerals with the “strategic” designation important for the economic, social and industrial future of the country. The new code came into effect in June. Companies say its tax hikes and cancelling of 10-year exemptions for existing projects against changes to the previous fiscal and customs regimes breach previous agreements with the government and will deter further investment. Kabwelulu said all companies were paying the royalties and taxes as stipulated by the new code, despite Randgold saying in August it was still negotiating with the government. [nL5N1V06J0 “I know that Randgold made a statement, but it’s not true,” he said. Congo is Africa’s top copper producer and the world’s leading miner of cobalt, a mineral which has seen a surge in demand to the manufacture of electric car batteries and mobile phones. Other major mining companies with investments in Congo include AngloGold Ashanti (ANGJ.J), Ivanhoe Mines (IVN.TO), China Molybdenum (603993.SS), Zijin Mining (601899.SS) and MMG (1208.HK).

2018-09-15,"LAMU, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenyan islanders have built a boat made entirely of recycled plastic collected during clean-ups of the ocean to highlight the growing menace of plastic waste that ends up in the sea.  Last year, the Kenyan government imposed the world’s toughest law against plastic bags, with offenders - including producers, retailers, and ordinary Kenyans - risking imprisonment for up to four years or fines of $40,000 (£30,604), in a bid to reduce plastic pollution. Many bags drift into the ocean, strangling turtles, suffocating seabirds and filling the stomachs of dolphins and whales.   The construction of the boat has been dubbed the FlipFlopi project because of the hundreds of recycled plastic sandals that cover the vessel.  The nine-metre sailing dhow, which the team built from over 10 tonnes of plastic waste, sailed for the first time in the waters off Kenya’s Lamu island on Saturday. Its launch coincided with international World Cleanup Day, during which environmental groups carry out activities to tackle pollution.    The boat is a riot of colour, including red, green, blue and yellow, due to the re-purposed flip flops used to cover the hull and other parts. “We hope people around the globe are inspired by our beautiful multicoloured boat and find their own ways to re-purpose already-used plastics,” said Ben Morrison, the founder of the FlipFlopi project. Morrison, who spent a decade building a travel business focussed on Africa, turned to constructing colourful boats in 2016, when he noticed alarming pollution along the Kenyan coast. The team used Kenyan facilities and technologies to recycle the plastic waste, and was led by local boat builder Ali Abdalla Skanda. “We are proud to be a guide to the world and its inhabitants during this vital time of challenge for our ocean environment,” Skanda said, adding they had received support from around the world as they built the boat.  Najib Balala, the Kenyan tourism minister, praised the team when he attended the launch at Lamu island, a protected world heritage site popular with local and foreign holidaymakers, on Kenya’s far north coastline. Tourism is one of the top hard currency earners for Kenya and officials in Nairobi are keen to protect beach resorts along the coastline.

2018-09-15,"RALEIGH, N.C./NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence could taint North Carolina waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste as heavy rains test environmental rules written with milder weather in mind, carrying the risk of contaminating water with bacteria like salmonella, officials said on Friday. Many of the state’s environmental codes were written to withstand a 25- or 100-year storm. But Florence promises heavy rains that some regions might not see in a thousand years, straining systems meant to keep state residents safe. The deluge could push industrial waste sites to the limit, Governor Roy Cooper said on Friday. “All of the infrastructure here is going to be tested,” Cooper told a news conference. “We are deeply concerned about the inland flooding.” Florence would not be the first test of North Carolina manure pits, or “lagoons.” Sixteen lagoons flooded under the foot of rain that came with Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The southeast part of the state is expected to get more than twice that amount in the days ahead, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist at DTN Marine Weather, a forecasting service. There are 62 industrial hog farms within North Carolina’s 100-year floodplain, environmentalists estimate, and Duke Energy Corp has four coal ash sites in the coastal area touched by Florence. If excrement escapes from the lagoons where it is stored, it could potentially contaminate drinking water with bacteria like salmonella, which can cause digestive problems, and, in certain vulnerable patients cause E. coli. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working with storm-struck states and is ready to respond to any breaches, a spokeswoman, Maggie Sauerhage, said. Animal feeding operations above a certain size need to be “designed and operated to handle the rainfall and runoff from 25-year 24-hour storms,” Sauerhage said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters. Even in the midst of a storm, these feeding sites must report leaks, she said. In North Carolina, hog and poultry waste pits make up 6,848 acres of land according to a report from the Environmental Working Group. Still, North Carolina has fewer flood-prone hog farms than it did when Hurricane Floyd inundated about 50 sites in 1999 and sparked statewide reforms. Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy has agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing. Erin Culbert, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, said the utility was ready to respond as needed to the storm. There is, however, disagreement over the risk posed by Florence. Andy Curliss, head of the North Carolina Pork Council, said spill dangers are overblown, noting that hog farmers have faced severe weather before. “This is not the first hurricane to hit North Carolina,” said Curliss, who noted that many lagoons are at a low point across the state at this time of year. But a state lawmaker said that hurricanes have led to dangerous spills in recent years and North Carolina’s laws are too lax to confront severe storms such as Florence. “As a state, we have put our head in the sand,” Representative Pricey Harrison said. “Past storms should have been a wakeup call.” (Reporting by Patrick Rucker in Raleigh and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York additional reporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago editing by Leslie Adler)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/storm-florence-pollution/rpt-florence-seen-testing-n-carolina-environmental-codes-on-toxic-hog-waste-idUKL2N1W100L,15 Sep 2018,"Tropical Storm

2018-09-15,"(Corrects incorrect figures provided by Cape Town’s mayor in paragraph seven) By Sebastien Malo SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The outgoing mayor of Cape Town, known for averting a near catastrophic water shortage, said she hopes to leave office on the heels of another victory in the fight against climate change - slashing greenhouse emissions from transportation. Patricia de Lille said South Africa’s second-largest city could reduce its greenhouse gas footprint by building homes for low-income residents on land left undeveloped as a legacy from apartheid. It is a unique solution tied to the country’s cruel history. The parcels of land were used to buffet the white-minority from members of the majority black population who were oppressed and segregated under the system of apartheid, which was imposed by white-governments from 1948 until the early 1990s. “It’s valuable land, close to transport,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of a climate change summit in San Francisco on Wednesday. Under her plan, de Lille said, erecting low-cost housing on five city-owned plots will allow people to live closer to their jobs in the city center, thereby cutting car transportation and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. “We’re using those pieces of land that belong to the city to bring about transport-oriented development,” she said, adding that transportation accounts for about 30 percent of carbon emissions in Cape Town. “To reduce carbon emissions, you have to deal with the spatial planning of your city,” said de Lille. Her plan was adopted by Cape Town’s government in 2016, but has not yet been put into action. De Lille, a former anti-apartheid militant who quit as mayor of Cape Town last month after a bitter dispute within her political party, said it “must be implemented.” “If it does not happen, I will be the first person to protest and I will mobilize the masses,” she said. “This is an opportunity for me to drive integration of the city, by bringing people of color closer to the city.” De Lille, whose resignation is effective Oct. 31, has been a mayor of Cape Town since 2011, and has a large support base among her fellow mixed-race residents of the city. Under her tenure, the port city, a tourist hub with a population of about 4 million, avoided a feared “Day Zero” when its taps would have run dry due to severe drought after three years of low rainfall. De Lille was speaking at the Global Climate Action Summit, a three day event that has drawn about 4,500 delegates from city and regional governments from around the world.
