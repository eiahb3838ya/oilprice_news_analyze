2019-01-10,"GEORGETOWN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Seismic research vessels hired by Exxon Mobil to explore for oil off Guyana’s coast have not yet returned to the site of a December incident with Venezuela’s navy, but they may in the future, Guyana’s foreign minister said on Thursday. Guyana, with no history of oil production, has become the focus of intense interest since Exxon announced the discovery of over 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off its shores. That has reignited a territorial dispute with neighboring Venezuela going back centuries. OPEC-member Venezuela’s crude output is near its lowest levels in 70 years amid an economic crisis. In a speech at a trade union forum in the capital Georgetown, Foreign Minister Carl Greenidge said the Dec. 22 incident when the ships complied with Venezuela’s order to turn around - which both countries say took place within their territorial waters - would not necessarily hold back future exploration. “They haven’t returned to the area. It doesn’t mean they can’t return in the future,” Greenidge said. “We’re not speaking in absolutes here.” According to a notice posted on Guyana’s Maritime Administration Department’s website before the incident, the ships’ activities were expected to begin on Dec. 6, 2018 and conclude on Dec. 31. No new notice has been posted. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Greenidge’s statements. In a press conference on Wednesday, socialist President Nicolas Maduro praised the armed forces for intercepting the ships, noting that if it were not for their patrol, “one day we would get there and they would be taking oil.” “Is a world like that viable, without respect for international law?” Maduro said. An Exxon spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2019-01-10,"(Adds details on budget stabilization fund) By Stefanie  Eschenbacher MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Mexico completed its 2019 oil hedge, the world’s largest sovereign derivatives trade, guaranteeing an average price of $55 per barrel for Mexican crude for the year after buying $1.23 billion in put options, the finance ministry said on Thursday. Mexico hedges its crude every year and deals are closely watched by the market since the trades are big enough to affect prices. The program is a longstanding part of Mexico’s strategy for safeguarding oil revenues from market volatility. The government said it spent 23.49 billion pesos on put options, a financial instrument that sets an agreed price to sell assets around a specified date. It did not say how many barrels of crude were covered by the trade. “With these actions we protect that budget ... against drops in prices of oil below this level,” the finance ministry said in a statement. The ministry said that between the put options and resources in a budget stabilization fund, they could assure an average price of $55 per barrel for Mexican crude exports during 2019. The fund had 246.7 billion pesos ($12.90 billion) at the end of the third quarter last year, according to the 2019 budget proposal. For more than a decade, Mexico’s government has paid for a hedge in a bid to guarantee its revenues from oil exports by state company Pemex. The program is seen as the world’s top sovereign derivatives trade.

2019-01-10,"(Adds reaction from U.S. embassy in Berlin) BERLIN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions against the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline would be the wrong way to solve a dispute over energy supply, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Germany of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance and urged it to halt work on the $11 billion, Russian-led gas pipeline that is to be built in the Baltic Sea. “Questions of European energy policy must be decided in Europe, not in the U.S.,” Maas said. “To impose unilateral sanctions against Nord Stream 2 is certainly not the way to go.” Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago. But they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which is expected to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route. Washington is concerned the pipeline, which will bypass Ukraine by running under the Baltic Sea, will strip Ukraine of important transit revenues. Joseph Giordono-Scholz, spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Berlin, said other European states also opposed the planned pipeline. “We would point out that... the European Parliament condemned Nord Stream 2 and called for its cancellation as recently as December,” he said in response to the comments by Maas. Washington has touted liquefied natural gas, delivered by U.S. companies, as an alternative to Russian gas. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told Reuters in an interview last month that Germany would build the infrastructure to import LNG and that authorities were currently in the process of clarifying location issues with private investors.

2019-01-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An index of world stock markets rose on Thursday as worries over the lack of clear signs of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade spat were offset by an assurance by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank has the ability to be patient on monetary policy. The dollar rebounded after hitting a three-month low, while     U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and as Powell said the U.S. central bank will “substantially” reduce the size of its balance sheet. MSCI’s all-country index .MIWD00000PUS, which came under some pressure after U.S. stocks briefly retreated following Powell’s comments on the Fed balance sheet, recovered to trade up 0.35 percent on the day. Thursday marked the index’s fifth straight session of gains. Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, Powell reiterated the U.S. central bank has the ability to be patient on monetary policy given stable price measures. He downplayed predictions from policymakers suggesting interest rates would be raised twice more this year. “The stock market is wanting to hear dovish speak from the Fed, whether it’s Powell or the governors or the presidents,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. Stocks around the globe started Thursday weaker after China said three days of talks with the United States that wrapped up on Wednesday had established a “foundation” to resolve differences. But it gave few details on key issues at stake, including a scheduled U.S. tariff increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The trade war between the two economic giants has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. On Wall Street, stocks rose in a choppy session, having shrugged off a hit to retail stocks after Macy’s Inc (M.N) cut its full-year profit and comparable sales forecast.

U.S. Treasury prices erased early gains and benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR shed 1/32 in price to yield 2.7296 percent, up from 2.728 percent late Wednesday. The dollar rallied from three-month lows, extending gains against the euro and yen, following Fed Chairman Powell’s remarks the U.S. central bank intends to further shrink the balance sheet, suggesting it is not done tightening monetary policy just yet. The dollar index .DXY, tracking against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.36 percent to 95.564, after earlier dropping to a three-month trough. In commodity markets, oil prices clung to their recent gains. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 24 cents to settle at $61.68 a barrel, a 0.39 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 23 cents to settle at $52.59 a barrel, a 0.44 percent gain. Both benchmarks rose by around 5 percent the previous day.

U.S. Treasury yields retreated, the U.S. dollar firmed, and oil prices edged lower, as various markets reversed recent moves. MSCI’s all-country index was 0.03 percent lower, retreating from a near four-week high hit on Wednesday. China said three days of talks with the United States that wrapped up on Wednesday had established a “foundation” to resolve differences, but gave few details on key issues at stake, including a scheduled U.S. tariff increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The trade war between the two economic giants has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. “Capital markets were probably too optimistic that some concessions would be announced at the end of three-day trade talks this week between the world’s two largest economies,” Dean Popplewell, vice president of market analysis at OANDA in Toronto, said in a note. A slew of weak data - which showed Chinese factory-gate inflation was the slowest in more than two years and worse-than-expected industrial figures in France - further hurt risk appetite. On Wall Street, stocks were modestly lower, as Macy’s Inc cut its full-year comparable sales forecast, hurting retail stocks. The S&P 500 retail index was 0.9 percent lower, and Macy’s shares sank 18 percent.

The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark was up 0.18 percent. Investors will be looking for new clues on U.S. interest rate policy when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before the Economic Club of Washington at about 12:45 p.m. ET. U.S. Treasury yields fell as stocks weakened on disappointment over the lack of specifics on resolving the U.S.-China trade dispute, while shorter-dated debt outperformed following Wednesday’s dovish Federal Reserve meeting minutes. Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting released on Wednesday showed that a range of policymakers said they could be patient about future interest rate increases and a few did not support the central bank’s rate increase that month. Benchmark 10-year notes gained 3/32 in price to yield 2.7206 percent, down from 2.728 percent late Wednesday. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes steepened to 16 basis points, from 13 basis points early on Wednesday.

2019-01-10,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans faced with a fuel shortage are turning to bikes and scooters, generating business for startups that rent those alternative rides, but straining operations for ride-hailing service Uber in some cities.  The shortages came after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador closed some vulnerable pipelines in a crackdown on fuel theft. There have been long lines at pumping stations this week in several states. Uber said the fuel shortage posed challenges in some cities in the central state of Guanajuato and the Western state of Michoacan. Users are requesting fewer trips in those cities, but with fewer Uber drivers on the road, demand has increased for those who are working, said company spokesman Saul Crespo. “Although the temporary closure of some gas stations can affect the demand for available vehicles, we are working to make sure our driving partners do not see their profits affected,” Crespo said in a statement, adding Uber will take steps to hold prices steady.  Spanish ride-hailing company Cabify said its operations had also been affected, while Chinese firm Didi Chuxing said it had not been impacted. For startups peddling bikes and scooters, the crisis touched off a flurry of new business.  Mobility as a Service for Latin America, a trade group representing firms such as Chinese bike-sharing company Mobike and California scooter outfit Bird, reported a spike in demand as people who normally drive scramble for alternatives.  “It’s a big opportunity for those companies to show that new alternatives can be substitutes for traditional cars, for short distances,” said Miguel Abad, who leads public affairs for the group. Mobike, which entered Mexico with its fleet of bright orange bikes last year, said its trips jumped an additional 10 percent above normal growth over the past few days.  Jetty, a Mexico City-based van-sharing service, has seen a 10 percent rise in demand and expects the trend to intensify in the coming days, said Chief Executive Cristina Palacios. Starting on Monday, the company will temporarily boost service on its main routes, she added. “There’s still this risk that we might not have enough gas to meet our demand,” she said. “But up until now we haven’t had any problems.”  For Grin, a Mexico City-based scooter company, demand had more than doubled and was climbing further on Thursday, co-founder Sergio Romo wrote in an e-mail. “Don’t worry, Grin is electric,” the company advised users on Twitter. But drivers for ride-hailing services have faced the same headaches finding fuel as any others.  In Mexico City, pumping stations were swamped with drivers making panic purchases, despite assurances from Lopez Obrador. Cabify said in a statement that its drivers had been hit by the fuel shortage, asking customers to be patient. Luis Garcia, who drives for Uber in Mexico City and owns cars driven by others on the platform, said he had struggled to fill up. “There’s been an impact on profits,” said Garcia, 27. “You’re spending money to find a gas station.”  Armando Silva, a 34-year-old who works in Mexico City’s posh Polanco neighbourhood, said he normally takes public transportation to the office. But with routes packed, he experimented with a new commute on Thursday. “Today I tried a scooter, and it went well,” he said. “But I hope they resolve the shortage because it’s more expensive and a little far to make the trip like this.” Reporting by Julia Love and Sharay Angulo; Additional reporting by Diego Ore; Editing by David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-theft-rides/mexicans-embrace-bikes-scooters-as-fuel-shortage-drags-on-idUKL1N1ZA04L,10 Jan 2019,"Mexicans faced with a fuel

2019-01-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices edged higher on Thursday, supported by comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman that lifted equity markets, but a more than week-long oil rally slowed as optimism surrounding U.S.-China trade talks faded.  Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 24 cents, or 0.4 percent,  to settle at $61.68 a barrel. The global benchmark posted its first consecutive nine-day winning streak since September 2007. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 ended 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, higher at $52.59 a barrel, also its ninth straight day of gains, that beats a 2010 record. Earlier in the session, both benchmarks hit their highest in nearly a month. WTI hit a session high of $52.78 per barrel and Brent rose to $61.91 a barrel.  Global financial markets have climbed recently on hopes that Washington and Beijing would avert an all-out trade war. The two superpowers concluded three days of talks on Wednesday. But the rise in global markets began to dwindle after the world’s two largest economies issued vaguely positive statements that lacked concrete details.[.N][USD/] Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday helped boost riskier asset classes, including oil, late in the session.  Powell said the U.S. central bank had the ability to be patient on policy, but that the Fed would shed significantly more assets than it already has. “It was a mixed message from him, but I think it was sufficiently accommodative,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management. “It’s a continuation of that shift towards easier policies and more assistance to the underlying economy which helped boost crude oil prices.” U.S. equity markets broadly rose after the comments. [.N] Recently crude futures have tracked closely with Wall Street. However, investors remained worried about a potential slowdown in the global economy, with disappointing data from China overnight adding to concerns.  China’s producer prices in December rose at their slowest pace in more than two years, a worrying sign of deflationary risks. Market participants also were paying close attention to global crude supply, particularly a shale boom in the United States. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has held around a record high of 11.7 million barrels per day since early November, according to government data.  To counter rising U.S. output, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, reached a deal to rein in supply that officially began in January.     Barclays forecast that Brent will remain range bound at $55 to $65 per barrel as inventories build in the coming months, while it expects “the market will return to a balanced state” by the second half of 2019. (GRAPHIC: U.S. oil production, drilling & storage levels - tmsnrt.rs/2GVNTmb)  Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday U.S. sanctions against his country were “fully illegal” and Tehran would not comply with them.

2019-01-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) has agreed to a settlement worth about $800 million (£627 million) to resolve claims from the U.S. Justice Department and state of California that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests, but still faces an ongoing criminal probe. The hefty penalty is the latest fallout from the U.S. government’s stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules. The Fiat Chrysler settlement includes $311 million in total civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, up to $280 million to resolve claims from diesel owners, and extended warranties worth $105 million. It covers 104,000 Fiat Chrysler 2014-16 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels, the Justice Department said. Regulators said Fiat Chrysler used “defeat devices” to cheat emissions tests in real-world driving.  Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that “the settlements do not change the Company’s position that it did not engage in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat emissions tests.” The company did not admit liability. “You wouldn’t pay $311 million total dollars to the federal government in civil penalties if there were not a serious problem,” U.S. assistant attorney general Jeff Clark told a news conference. The settlement also includes $72.5 million for state civil penalties, and $33.5 million in payments to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims. German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], which provided the emissions control software for the vehicles, also agreed to pay $27.5 million to resolve claims from diesel owners. Owners will receive an average of $2,800 to obtain software updates as part of the emissions recall, Fiat Chrysler said. Elizabeth Cabraser, a lawyer for the owners, said the “substantial cash compensation” will ensure that consumers get the recall fix.  Bosch, which also provided diesel emissions software to Volkswagen, also agreed to pay $103.5 million to settle claims with 47 U.S. states that said the supplier “enabled” the cheating and should have known its customers would use the software improperly, the New York Attorney General’s Office said. Bosch said in a statement it did not accept liability or admit to the factual allegations, but that the settlement reflects “Bosch’s desire to move forward and to spare the company the very substantial costs and the burden on the company’s resources that would be required to litigate these issues.” The Justice Department said the settlement does not resolve an ongoing criminal investigation into Fiat Chrysler’s conduct, but officials declined to discuss the status. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating. U.S. regulators are also investigating Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) for alleged excess emissions in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, but the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the status of the probe - and would not say if any other automakers are under scrutiny. Daimler declined to comment Thursday but has acknowledged it faces investigations in Germany and the United States. In October, Daimler said operating profit would fall by more than 10 percent, blaming “government proceedings and measures in various regions” in referencing diesel emissions issues. U.S. regulators said the industry was getting a tough message. “Fiat Chrysler deceived consumers and the federal government by installing defeat devices on these vehicles that undermined important clean air protections,” said Andrew Wheeler, acting administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “Today’s settlement sends a clear and strong signal to manufacturers and consumers alike - the Trump administration will vigorously enforce the nation’s laws designed to protect the environment and public health.” Wheeler said the settlement message is simple to automakers: “Don’t cheat.” The case dragged on after the Justice Department filed suit in May 2017 and the sides remained far part. At one point, the Justice Department sought $1.4 billion in civil penalties from Fiat Chrysler - or about a $1 billion more than the company ultimately paid, two people briefed on the matter said. The Justice Department said Fiat Chrysler must work with one or more vendors of aftermarket catalytic converters to improve the efficiency of 200,000 converters that will be sold in the 47 U.S. states that do not already require the use of the California-mandated high-efficiency gasoline vehicle catalysts. That is estimated at $50 million to $70 million, officials said. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement, “Fiat Chrysler tried to evade these standards by installing software to cheat emissions testing. The company not only violated the law and our trust, but did so at the expense of our environment.” U.S. Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio said at a news conference that automakers were on notice: “If you cheat our emissions tests you are going to get caught.” Fiat Chrysler has agreed to an enhanced whistleblower programme and the company must implement corporate governance, organization and technical process reforms to minimize the likelihood of future Clean Air Act violations and must hire a compliance auditor to oversee and assess the reforms. With the Fiat Chrysler settlement, the U.S. Justice Department’s total civil fines for both Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen are now valued at around $2,500 per vehicle. In total, Volkswagen agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, including spending as much as $15 billion to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The company pleaded guilty to three felony counts to resolve the criminal probe. Fiat Chrysler shares were up 1.6 percent at $16.03 late on Thursday in New York. The settlement will be open for public comment for 30 days before a federal judge decides whether to approve the agreements.

2019-01-10,"ZAGREB (Reuters) - Israel will not be able to deliver to Croatia a dozen used F-16 fighter jets which Croatia decided to buy last year to modernise its air force, Croatia’s Defence Minister Damir Krsticevic said on Thursday. “Israel has officially informed us that it cannot get an approval from the United States for delivery of the planes to Croatia,” Krsticevic told reporters after a meeting with an Israeli delegation in Zagreb. Officials from both sides said Croatia held no responsibility for the deal falling through. They gave no comment on why the United States opposed the sale. Croatian media reported the problem arose as the planes have been refitted with Israeli technology, depriving U.S. defence companies the chance to update and service the planes. The U.S. State Department did not comment because it was on furlough.  Croatia’s Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said earlier this week that Zagreb would not accept any other deal but the original Israeli offer which it accepted last March. “The agreement on buying the planes has not been signed, so there is no financial damage to our budget,” Plenkovic told a cabinet session on Thursday. He added that Croatia was determined to continue with its plans of modernising its air force. It is unclear at the moment whether Zagreb would now call another tender or turn to other bidders that competed in a previous tender. The deal with Israel was supposed to be worth $500 million. Israel had been in competition with several countries bidding for Zagreb’s business..     Sweden’s SAAB was reported as being the most serious competitor, offering new Gripen planes, but at a much higher price. Croatia joined the NATO alliance in 2009 and the EuropeanUnion in 2013. Its air force currently owns a squadron of outdated MIG-21 fighter jets, but just three planes are operational at the moment.

2019-01-10,"OSLO (Reuters) - The oceans are warming faster than previously estimated, setting a new temperature record in 2018 in a trend that is damaging marine life, scientists said on Thursday. New measurements, aided by an international network of 3,900 floats deployed in the oceans since 2000, showed more warming since 1971 than calculated by the latest U.N. assessment of climate change in 2013, they said. And “observational records of ocean heat content show that ocean warming is accelerating,” the authors in China and the United States wrote in the journal Science of ocean waters down to 2,000 meters (6,600 ft). Man-made greenhouse gas emissions are warming the atmosphere, according to the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, and a large part of the heat gets absorbed by the oceans. That in turn is forcing fish to flee to cooler waters. “Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!” the authors wrote in a statement. Almost 200 nations plan to phase out fossil fuels this century under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit warming. U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants to promote U.S. fossil fuels, plans to pull out of the pact in 2020. Data due for publication next week will show “2018 was the warmest year on record for the global ocean, surpassing 2017,” said lead author Lijing Cheng, of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He told Reuters that records for ocean warming had been broken almost yearly since 2000. Overall, temperatures in the ocean down to 2,000 meters rose about 0.1 degree Celsius (0.18F) from 1971-2010, he said. The 2013 U.N. assessment estimated slower rates of heat uptake but did not give a single comparable number. A separate study on Monday, by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, said 2018 was the fourth warmest year for global surface temperatures in records dating back to the 19th century. Ocean temperatures are less influenced by year-to-year variations in the weather. It can take more than 1,000 years for deep ocean temperatures to adjust to changes at the surface. “The deep ocean reflects the climate of the deep and uncertain past,” Kevin Trenberth, of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research and a co-author of Thursday’s study, told Reuters. Among effects, extra warmth can reduce oxygen in the oceans and damages coral reefs that are nurseries for fish, the scientists said. Warmer seas release more moisture that can stoke more powerful storms. Warmer ocean water also raises sea levels by melting ice, including around the edges of Antarctica and Greenland.

2019-01-10,"NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - EPIC Crude Pipeline LP said the projected third-quarter start-up of its crude pipeline from the Permian basin to Corpus Christi, Texas is in “some jeopardy” after U.S. regulators delayed action on its petition to set initial tariff rates. The San Antonio, Texas, based company said in a letter to U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dated Jan. 8 that the requested Jan. 4 action date for FERC to pass a declaratory order that would allow EPIC to set rates has “now come and gone,” causing concern to shippers. The planned 900,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) pipeline, stretching from Southeast New Mexico and West Texas to refineries and other destinations in and around Corpus Christi is one of the largest lines currently under construction, and is seen as vital for bringing crude out of the largest oilpatch in the United States. Crude prices in the Permian basin have come under pressure in recent months as a production surge has overwhelmed existing pipeline and infrastructure, sparking a race to add new lines. Prices in Texas collapsed in 2018 due to full lines. Currently, the Permian produces about 3.8 million bpd, accounting for about a third of overall U.S. production of 11.7 million bpd, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. The pipeline was projected to be up and running to Corpus Christi by the third quarter. EPIC filed a petition in October, asking for FERC’s approval within about 90 days that would allow the company to start setting shipping rates on the line. Pipeline companies typically hold bidding rounds known as an open season to solicit shippers that commit to long-term contracts and fill the line with crude before commercial deliveries begin. “We have had no indication from Commission Staff that any aspect of our project is problematic from a regulatory standpoint, but we are committed to addressing and resolving any issues that should arise in that regard,” EPIC said in its letter, urging FERC to vote on the petition by Jan. 15. EPIC currently has committed transportation agreements with five shippers, covering about 60 percent of the system’s capacity, it said in the letter. “The case is still under review,” a FERC spokeswoman said. EPIC was formed in 2017 and the crude line is one of its first projects. In October, EPIC said it would convert a portion of its planned natural gas liquids pipeline to transport crude instead.

2019-01-10,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is seeking damages from former managers, who were dismissed for their roles in the diesel emissions scandal that has cost the German automaker as much as $30 billion (£24 billion), the Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday. Volkswagen filed the claims for damages as part of labour court disputes at the end of last year, the newspaper said, without giving details of which former employees it had targeted or how high the total damages claims might be. Volkswagen declined to comment on the report. Handelsblatt said Volkswagen has fired six managers since it admitted in 2015 to illegally installing software in U.S. vehicles for years to evade emissions standards. It said all six were fighting their dismissals. Volkswagen pleaded guilty in 2017 as part of a $4.3 billion U.S. settlement. In total, nine people have been charged in the diesel emissions scandal and two former VW executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison terms. Handelsblatt said Volkswagen was seeking to recover a large part of the 4 million euros (£3.6 million) the company paid for the defence of one of the jailed former executives, Oliver Schmidt, who was handed a seven year prison sentence in 2017.

2019-01-10,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro started a second term on Thursday, defying critics in the United States and Latin America who called him an illegitimate usurper of a nation where economic chaos has wrought a humanitarian crisis. The country’s pro-government Supreme Court, which has largely supplanted the opposition-run Congress, swore him in following a welcome with a symphony orchestra and cheering supporters waving miniature yellow, blue and red Venezuelan flags. The ceremony contrasted with the harsh realities that face the former bus driver turned socialist leader, including  hyperinflation, severe food and medicine shortages and an exodus of millions of citizens. Before he had even completed his inaugural speech, the United States decried a “usurpation of power,” and Paraguay announced it was cutting diplomatic ties - highlighting the growing isolation that Maduro will face. “A new world has risen up that refuses to be controlled by the imperial and hegemonic orders of a single nation or its satellite countries,” Maduro said following his swearing-in. “That’s the rallying cry of our revolution to the peoples and governments of the world.” Supreme Court Chief Maikel Moreno dedicated nearly 20 minutes to explaining why Maduro was not being sworn in by Congress, which the ruling Socialist Party has systematically ignored since the opposition took control of the body in 2016. Opposition leaders have portrayed the inauguration as the moment at which Maduro will be internationally branded a dictator, following a widely boycotted 2018 election that many  foreign governments described as a farce. “We call on the armed forces, the majority of men and women in uniform who refuse to be corrupted, to step forward,” said Congress chief Juan Guaido at a news conference. “We must disavow that which was not the result of a popular vote.”  But Maduro continues to enjoy consistent support from the armed forces, leaving him with few serious challenges at home despite the international outcry.  That support was on display on Thursday afternoon during a ceremony at Venezuela’s military academy in Caracas. Flanked by the military’s top commanders, Maduro strolled through a courtyard filled with thousands of uniformed troops. “Loyalty always, betrayal never,” said Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino, shortly before handing Maduro a replica of the sword of Venezuelan liberation hero Rafael Urdaneta. The Washington Post on Wednesday reported that Padrino had told Maduro to step down last month and said he would offer his own resignation if he did not. Supporters, many of whom were public servants identified by t-shirts of state agencies, rallied in the centre of Caracas to celebrate the new term. Some said Maduro should do more to crack down on business leaders for raising prices. “Sometimes it’s hard to find food because businesses hide it and then say it’s the president’s fault, even though we all know that’s a lie,” said Graciela Laya, 43, a homemaker, at a rally near the Supreme Court.  Maduro replaced Hugo Chavez after his death in 2013 and won a new six-year term in 2018 despite hyperinflation, chronic food shortages and a severe economic contraction. He blames an “economic war” led by the United States and local opposition adversaries for the country’s woes. The vast majority of the opposition boycotted last year’s vote on the grounds that it was rigged in favour of Maduro, noting a host of irregularities, including Socialist Party activists offering monetary payments to voters. The United States, the European Union, and many Latin American countries condemned the vote last year, and issued withering criticism of Maduro on Thursday. “It is time for Venezuela to begin a transitional process that can restore the constitutional, democratic order by holding free and fair elections that respect the will of the Venezuelan people,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. Paraguayan President Mario Abdo said his country was shutting its embassy and pulling out all diplomatic personnel due to what it called a “rupture of constitutional order.” Most other countries plan to maintain their embassies and diplomatic relations with Venezuela, according to sources consulted by Reuters. Peru, which has barred Maduro and other officials from entry into the country, recalled the charge d’affaires from its Caracas embassy. “Venezuela has unfortunately become a threat to Colombia’s national security,” tweeted Marta Lucia Ramirez, the vice president of neighbouring Colombia, which has taken in more Venezuelan refugees than any other country. “It is time for this criminal dictatorship to end.”     Reporting by Brian Ellsworth and Shaylim Castro, additional reporting by Deisy Buitrago and Corina Pons in Caracas, Mariel Cristaldo in Asuncion, Marco Aquino in Lima and Nelson Bocanegra in Bogota; editing by Susan Thomas and Rosalba O'Brien",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics/update-4-venezuelas-president-maduro-starts-new-term-shrugs-off-criticism-idUKL1N1ZA0BD,10 Jan 2019,"Venezuelan President Nicolas

2019-01-10,"(Recasts with comments on refineries, background on output and shortages) By Sheky Espejo MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Key Mexican oil refineries are shut down, Mexico’s president said on Thursday, as the government’s drive to stamp out gasoline theft from pipelines is pressuring the distribution of supplies from terminals across the country. Declining output at refineries owned and operated by state-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, is forcing the firm to meet demand by relying more heavily on imported motor fuels, which President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to cut once more gasoline and diesel can be produced at home. “There are (Pemex) refineries that have been shut down for a while,” said Lopez Obrador at his morning news conference. The company’s 177,000 barrel per day (bpd) Madero refinery has not produced fuel in a “long time,” while the 285,000-bpd Minatitlan refinery is “shut down or producing little,” he said. Pemex owns and operates six oil refineries in Mexico with a joint capacity of 1.63 million bpd of crude processing, which last year worked below half capacity. Leftist Lopez Obrador, who won a landslide election on promises to boost domestic refining capacity while avoiding gasoline price spikes, emphasized that the country has enough fuel supplies and that only distribution problems persist. Pemex’s largest refinery, the 330,000-bpd Salina Cruz, just recently resumed production, the president said, without offering further details. The refinery, located on the coast of southern Oaxaca state, was producing about 52,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline in November, according to the most recent published Pemex data. The facility produced about 91,000 bpd of gasoline in 2014. Overall, Pemex’s refineries are producing about 200,000 bpd of gasoline according to official numbers, while another 600,000 bpd are being imported, almost all of which comes from U.S. refiners. “We have enough (gasoline) reserves, ships are arriving, we have enough fuel, that’s why we’re meeting this challenge,” said Lopez Obrador. Still, long lines of drivers are forming at gas stations in the Mexican capital, as well as in several states, since earlier this week as the government crackdown on fuel theft has led to slower fuel distribution, primarily by rail and trucks. Meanwhile, at key Mexican import hubs, bottlenecks for discharging imported fuel have formed where more than 7 million barrels of fuel languish, according to traders and Refinitiv Eikon data.

2019-01-10,"VIENNA, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Austrian utility Verbund and heavy energy-consuming industrials have launched anti-competition proceedings in Vienna against German grid operator TenneT TSO, in a bid to restore the German-Austrian power price zone. The Austrians said the zone’s split in October, which has capped power flows between the two countries, has led to additional charges of 180 million euros ($206 million) a year for Austrian customers. The European Union’s regulatory authority ACER decided to split Europe’s largest area of uniform electricity prices to curb excessive and volatile exports of Germany’s renewable production. German oversupply arises from wind parks in the north, whose power flows do not go straight to the southern industrial zones, because planned transport grids are not ready. Instead, wind power is rerouted via Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria and back into Germany in so-called loop flows, increasing the grid’s volatility and security risks. Austria had benefited from these flows, as it was able to buy surplus German power at low prices, store excess power in its pumped-storage plants and resell it at higher prices when supply was tight. But after Polish and Czech complaints about the network congestion, ACER decided in 2016 to split the power zone. Verbund, steelmaker Voestalpine, Austria’s paper industry association and power exchange EXAA filed a request against TenneT TSO at Vienna’s higher regional court “to stop abuse of significant market power”, they said on Thursday. The German grid operator exploits its dominant market position by curbing the amount of power that is traded between Germany and Austria, the companies said in a joint statement. TenneT TSO has been capping power flows at 4.9 gigawatts (GW) since October, putting into practice an agreement that was reached between the German and the Austrian network regulators to implement the ACER decision. “This move leads to an anti-competitive market distortion, as the structural grid bottlenecks are not at the Austrian-German border but within Germany,” the Austrian statement said. “We want to go back to the conditions before October 1,” said Verbund Chief Executive Wolfgang Anzengruber. TenneT said it did not see any reason to deviate from the EU decision. ($1 = 0.8732 euros) Reporting by Kirsti Knolle, additional reporting by Vera

Investment in Western Europe’s largest oil producer and Europe’s second-largest gas producer, behind Russia, is surging after a decline due to the slump in oil prices in 2014 to 2016. Despite that, oil output in 2018 of 86.2 million cubic metres (mcm), or 542 million barrels, missed a 90.2 mcm forecast made a year ago, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) said. NPD head Bente Nyland told Reuters that production last year and this year’s prediction were lower than previously expected due to start-up delays and production difficulties at several fields. The regulator said output in 2019 was expected to be 82.2 mcm, against a previous forecast of 87.2 mcm, but will rise to over 100 million cubic metres next year after Equinor starts its giant North Sea Johan Sverdrup field. Germany’s Wintershall said in October its Maria field in Norway was not meeting output expectations due to water injection issues. “The problems have not been solved yet,” Nyland said. Norway’s gas production last year stood at 119.3 billion cubic metres (bcm), also missing a 121.2 bcm forecast. In 2019 it is expected to rise slightly to 119.5 bcm but still below a previous forecast of 121.4 bcm and below the record 122 bcm produced in 2017. Norway’s combined oil and gas production is expected to come close to its 2004 record level by 2023, when production peaks at Sverdrup, which is expected to account for about 40 percent of Norwegian oil output after 2022. Still, while output in the early years of this century was dominated by oil, the majority of production is now made up of gas, NPD data shows. The agency does not see major developments that will lift investment after 2019 following the commissioning of projects such as Sverdrup and the Arctic Johan Castberg field. “More profitable resources must be proven, and the clock is ticking,” Nyland said in a statement. NPD expects oil firms to drill about the same number of exploration wells in 2019 as in 2018 as cost-cutting and higher oil prices raise profitability of new developments. Costs of development wells fell by more than 40 percent from 2014 to 2018, but operating costs are flattening and exploration costs, which included both drilling and seismic surveys, were expected to rise by about 10 percent in 2019 from 2018, NPD said. “If not for the recent drop in the oil price, the cost increases going forward might have been steeper,” NPD’s exploration head Torgeir Stordal told Reuters.

2019-01-10,"STAVANGER, Norway, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Norway will step up preparations to claim its share of oil and gas resources if Russia finds petroleum on its side of a border in the Barents Sea, the head of Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) said on Thursday. Norway and Russia in 2010 agreed a maritime border in the Barents Sea, ending a 40-year long dispute, and also agreed to share oil and gas resources spanning that border. Russia has allowed oil and gas exploration all along the border, including in the Arctic where it has already awarded exploration rights to Rosneft and Italy’s Eni . Norway currently only allows oil firms to explore in the southern part of the Barents Sea. But if Russia makes any discoveries in the northern part of the sea, Norway wants a share. As a result, the NPD, which manages Norway’s oil and gas resources, will this year conduct 3D seismic surveys of geological structures that straddle the border in the Arctic. “Let’s say they started to drill close to (the border) and there is a cross-border structure, then, of course, Norway would like to get the resources that belong to Norway,” NPD head Bente Nyland told Reuters. “That’s the same with the border towards UK and Denmark, she added. The NPD will conduct the surveys in the areas which Norway has not opened exploration. Any discoveries on the Russian side could trigger a political debate in Oslo about the need to open those areas as well, Nyland said. “If this (discoveries) happens, then I’m sure that there will be a situation when the area would be looked at more closely,” she said. “That’s a political question ... My job is just to tell where we expect the resources to be,” Nyland added, when asked whether she saw a need for such a debate. Opening up more exploration areas could be politically difficult given Norway’s climate commitments and opposition from various environmental organisations and some political parties. The NPD has already said that the northern part of the Barents Sea was expected to hold more resources than the southern part. The southern Barents Sea, which Norway has opened up for exploration, has not yielded big results so far. There are only two fields - one gas and one oil - in operation. “We are still positive about the Barents Sea, but a hope for a big, big elephant is probably is not present in the Barents Sea south,” Nyland said. “But we made Johan Sverdrup discovery in the North Sea after 40 years of exploration, so you should never say never,” she added.

2019-01-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Trading and mining giant Glencore (GLEN.L) has lost its exclusive marketing rights for two of Libya’s main crude oil export grades after holding them since late 2015, trading sources with direct knowledge said.  The Switzerland-based firm had secured the rights to the Sarir and Messla grades when it was one of the few foreign companies willing to deal with the North African country during unrest that has wracked the country since 2011. Glencore, which had exclusive rights on the two grades until the end of 2018, and Libya’s National Oil Corp (NOC) declined to comment. In a sign of renewed international confidence in Libya’s oil industry, BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) returned to lifting directly from the country last year, initially taking other grades. “Glencore lost exclusivity on Messla and Sarir,” one of the trading sources told Reuters, asking not to be named. “Companies like BP and Shell had their first Messla and Sarir allocation.” A second trader said that now “anyone can get these grades.” The two grades account for nearly a fifth of Libyan output that now stands at 953,000 barrels per day (bpd), still well below the pre-conflict level of 1.6 million bpd. For a period when oil production fell even more sharply, those grades that are exported from the eastern Libyan port of Marsa el Hariga generated the bulk of state revenues. Libya’s 220,000 barrel-per-day Ras Lanuf refinery, which is now idled, ran on the two grades. The remainder of Libya’s crude streams have not been allocated exclusively to one company for such an extended period. So far, Unipec was also allocated three cargoes from Marsa el Hariga in January, one source said, although the proportion taken of each grade by the trading arm of China’s Sinopec was not immediately clear. BP is due to take 1 million barrels on the Crescent Moon tanker in mid-January from the same port, according to a shipping source and Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Shell is also due to take at least one cargo from Marsa el Hariga, three sources said. Shell also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Security challenges still threaten Libya’s oil infrastructure. Its largest oilfield, El Sharara, has been shut since December over a dispute with tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salaries and development.

China said the three days of talks in Beijing had established a “foundation” to resolve differences, but gave virtually no details on key issues at stake. A slew of weak data also dampened the mood. Again in China, factory-gate inflation was the slowest in more than two years, while worse-than-expected industrial figures in France provided more evidence that Europe is spluttering again. The pan-European STOXX 600 index saw Paris drop as much as 0.8 percent and Germany’s trade-sensitive DAX fall 0.3 percent, though both recovered some ground after the ECB said it was looking at another mass dump of ultra-cheap lending. Wall Street was set to open firmly in the red though, which if it holds will be the first drop in the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial and Nasdaq in five days. “I am beginning to get a little concerned about the path of the European industrial data,” said State Street Global Markets’ head of strategy Michael Metcalfe. “It is raising the possibility of a technical recession in Europe. One of the big challenges is that, if this is replicated in Italy’s data tomorrow, that potentially brings the budget questions back into the market’s thoughts.” Despite a few isolated bright spots there were plenty of grim reports on Christmas trading from European and U.S. retailers, and Ford and Jaguar Land Rover both warned they were laying off thousands of their workers. The soured sentiment saw the standard move into safe-haven government bonds that give a guaranteed return. Yields on German and French and government bonds - which move inversely to price - dropped towards recent two-year lows. The European Central Bank then published the minutes from its December meeting which showed its officials had talked about pumping another round of ultra-cheap long-term financing into the euro zone banking system. U.S. Treasury yields last stood at 2.697 percent, down from 2.710 percent on Wednesday, when Fed minutes showed its policymakers were becoming more cautious about future rate hikes. The dollar remained near its lowest since mid-October. It was barely changed at $1.1542 to the euro , which had gained 0.9 percent against the dollar during the previous session, its biggest one-day gain since late June. China’s yuan had also muscled higher to breach the 6.8 per dollar level for the first time since August in both onshore and offshore trade in Asia. “This drop in the dollar is an overdue correction following a surprisingly robust few weeks, despite the massive collapse in U.S. rate expectations,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank. Asian shares performed fractionally better overnight on the weaker dollar and hopes of more economic stimulus in China. But many stocks seesawed, and Tokyo and Shanghai both closed lower as markets parsed the trade talks and hoped that they will ultimately avert another ramping-up of U.S. tariffs in March. Emerging market bond investors then got a major jolt as Lebanon’s finance minister Ali Hassan Khalil told a local newspaper that it was weighing up a debt restructuring. Goldman Sachs had warned this week that such a move, if extreme enough, could potentially wipe out Lebanon’s banks. “The exposure of Lebanese banks to the sovereign (local debt and Eurobonds) amounts to some 55 trillion Lebanese pounds, almost double the 30 trillion LBP capital base of the banking system,” the bank’s analysts wrote. Lebanon has the third largest public debt-to-GDP ratio in the world at around 150 percent. Oil also caught investors’ attention as Brent and U.S. crude fell as much as $1, having jumped overnight on signs of OPEC-led crude output cuts. Brent crude was last trading at $61.23 a barrel and U.S. WTI was down at $52.11 cents. Industrial metals such as copper dipped a touch too. Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at the foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said he viewed more gains in oil prices as a key driver for any further rise in risk appetite. If U.S. crude futures can break through the $55 level, “you’re going to see real yields probably lower. That’s really good for the cost of money and taking some further headwinds out of the U.S. dollar,” he said. Additional reporting by Tom Finn in London;

2019-01-10,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The emerging dynamic for crude oil markets this year is the struggle between OPEC and its allies for higher prices against the vocal push for low prices from U.S. President Donald Trump. Much has already been written on which side is likely to prevail, but in the meantime the losers are refiners in Asia, who face crude prices likely to be higher relative to those in Europe and the Americas. This is likely because Asian refiners will bear the brunt of lower supplies from OPEC’s Middle East producers, as well as Russia, while at the same time being unable to take full advantage of cheaper U.S. shale crude oil. While more U.S. crude is expected to flow to Asia in coming months because of the discount of West Texas Intermediate to the global light crude benchmark Brent, it remains questionable as to whether this will offset lower supplies from the Middle East. Differences in crude quality also aren’t working in favour of Asian refiners, given the preference of many for heavier, sour crudes such as those typically supplied by top Middle East exporters such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. While there may be more U.S. crude available at competitive prices in Asia, there may not be the appetite for it among many refiners given their plants are optimised to run on heavier grades. And those heavier grades are looking more expensive as demand for them rises and OPEC and its allies cut output. OPEC oil production slumped by the most in almost two years in December, with the reduction coming ahead of a formal agreement between the 15-member producer organisation and its allies, including Russia. OPEC pumped 32.68 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, according to a Reuters survey published on Jan. 3, down 460,000 bpd from November and the largest month-on-month drop since January 2017. OPEC, Russia and other non-members, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019 from November 2018 levels starting this month. OPEC’s share of that cut is 800,000 bpd. The OPEC+ cuts are making Middle East heavier crudes lose their price advantage to lighter grades. Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) futures for Oman crude for March settlement ended at $60.57 a barrel on Wednesday, while the similar Brent contract was at $61.83, a discount of just $1.26. Six months ago Brent was at $79.44 a barrel while DME Oman was at $75.32, a significantly deeper $4.12 discount. The erosion of Oman’s price advantage to Brent leaves many Asian refiners with little choice but to pay relatively more for their crude supplies. Even if they can switch to using lighter crude grades, they end up producing more gasoline than desired and not enough middle distillates, such as diesel and jet kerosene. While the profit margin, or crack, for a Singapore refinery producing diesel from Dubai crude is off its November peak of $17.97 a barrel, at the close of $13.43 on Wednesday it is still comfortably above the profit on gasoline. Producing a barrel of gasoline from Brent crude in Singapore GL92-SIN-CRK actually yielded a loss of 37 cents a barrel on Wednesday, down from the peak last year of a profit of $11.55, reached on Aug. 15. The contrasting fortunes of gasoline and middle distillates in Asia is a reflection of the struggles Asian refiners are having in adapting to the conflicting aims of the governments of the major oil producers, namely the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Throw in uncertainty over what happens in April when U.S. waivers over Iran’s crude exports end, and the picture clouds further for Asian refiners, who buy about two-thirds of the oil exported from the Middle East. It’s not a situation of their making, but Asia’s refiners are caught between the OPEC+ moves to boost oil prices, and Trump’s Twitter onslaught aimed at keeping them low. And the geopolitics of Trump’s renewed sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, the war in Syria and the ongoing fallout from the killing by Saudi agents of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey add to the brew of uncertainty.

2019-01-10,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Collin Eaton CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Booming U.S. oil exports have set off a scramble to build Gulf Coast ports to handle more than 3 million barrels per day in new supplies expected over the next five years. Of seven proposed oil-export projects, nowhere is the opportunity greater or the competition more fierce than in Corpus Christi, Texas, where three firms are vying to open the state’s first deepwater port. Commodities trader Trafigura has taken an early lead with a planned offshore facility that has an easier path to regulatory approval and faces fewer objections from environmentalists. Its chief competitor - a partnership of investor Carlyle Group and the Port of Corpus Christi to build an onshore port - has responded by petitioning regulators to kill Trafigura’s project. Port lobbyists have cited past criminal allegations involving the firm in other countries and potentially “catastrophic” environmental impacts. Rising demand for new ports follows a 2015 decision by the U.S. Congress to lift a 40-year ban on crude exports after advances in drilling techniques sparked a rapid rise in domestic shale production - especially in Texas. The United States had been the world’s top oil buyer for decades, and its port infrastructure was built to import rather than export. Now, surging exports threaten to overwhelm existing ports as U.S. production is projected to hit 12 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from 9.35 million in 2017. “We’ve got a wave of oil headed toward the coast,” said Jeremiah Ashcroft III, chief executive of Lone Star Ports LLC, the Carlyle-backed company formed to develop its Corpus Christi project. Only one U.S. facility, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, can fully load supertankers capable of carrying 2 million barrels. The Corpus Christi port - the closest to the most prolific shale fields in Texas - exports less than 1 million bpd, and its harbor is too shallow to fully load supertankers. The market ultimately may support more than one new deepwater port, but the first firm to build near Corpus Christi will have the best shot at cutting long-term deals with producers expected to ship an estimated 2.1 million bpd to the region through new pipelines set to open this year. “Right now, there’s only enough room for one project,” Ashcroft said. Carlyle plans a $1 billion port to handle 1.4 million bpd. Trafigura, which has not disclosed its planned investment in the port, would handle much less, at 500,000 bpd. But Trafigura’s operation would siphon off revenue from the Port of Corpus Christi and Carlyle’s project because Trafigura would serve shippers offshore, before they reach the harbor. Carlyle declined to make an executive available for an interview and referred questions to Lone Star. Trafigura said in a statement that its port would leave room for other projects because it would handle only a portion of the expected new oil flows. A third competitor, pipeline operator Magellan Midstream Partners LP, plans an export terminal on the Corpus Christi harbor, near Carlyle’s proposed site. But Magellan faces a roadblock because port officials last year agreed to work exclusively with Carlyle. Magellan said in a statement that it has not decided whether to build the project. Companies including Kinder Morgan Inc, JupiterMLP and Tallgrass Energy have also proposed offshore ports along the Gulf Coast. Carlyle said last October that it could open its facility by late 2020. But that assumes its plan for dredging to accommodate supertankers will not require a full environmental review, which is sought by opponents and could take two years. As Carlyle and the Port have tried to navigate those obstacles, port lobbyists have petitioned regulators to halt Trafigura’s project. In an August letter, the port’s law firm called on the U.S. Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration to reject Trafigura’s application, citing a “criminal history.” The letter from Baker Wotring LLP pointed to the trader’s 2006 guilty plea for selling a U.S. company oil from Iraq that Trafigura falsely claimed had been authorized under a United Nations humanitarian aid program. U.S. companies at the time were barred by government sanctions from buying Iraqi oil except through the program. After the regulators declined the port’s request, its law firm in December raised bribery allegations brought earlier that month by Brazilian prosecutors against two former Trafigura executives. The firm asked regulators to halt Trafigura’s work until the allegations were “fully investigated.” Trafigura said in a statement that its management had no knowledge of any improper payments made to employees of Brazil’s state-run oil firm Petrobras. Trafigura did not comment on the port law firm citing its guilty plea involving Iraq oil sales. Last month, five Corpus Christi area lawmakers asked Texas Governor Greg Abbott to veto Trafigura’s application on environmental grounds, citing a risk of “catastrophic crude oil spills” and “excessive air emissions.” Federal rules require state governors to sign off on offshore ports. Abbott has made no decision, a spokesman said. Lone Star’s Ashcroft said onshore terminals are safer than offshore projects because oil spills are more easily cleaned up in harbors than in open water. Trafigura said it chose to go offshore to ensure supertankers can safely and efficiently load cargoes and that its application will be reviewed by more than 30 government agencies. Carlyle is essential to building the Port of Corpus Christi’s crude export business. Port officials started pursuing federal approval to dredge its harbor 28 years ago, but Congress only recently approved $59 million, a fraction of what’s needed. “We don’t have 28 years; we have two,” said Sean Strawbridge, chief executive of the Port of Corpus Christi Authority, referring to its timeline for readying the port for new oil flows. Port officials last year sought to kickstart the dredging by issuing $217 million in bonds. That money will allow it to start dredging to a 54-foot draft - not deep enough for supertankers. If Trafigura’s port wins approval, it could take business from the Port of Corpus Christi. Port revenues could fall by about 12 percent, estimated investment researcher Morningstar Inc., a loss that could hurt its efforts to finance dredging not covered by the government or Carlyle. In October, Carlyle agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to cover the dredging needed to get achieve a 75-foot draft in the outer harbor to accommodate supertankers. Environmentalists favor offshore ports over what they consider the harmful impact of dredging harbors. The newly formed Port Aransas Conservancy in south Texas has argued Carlyle’s plan would endanger sea turtle nesting areas, dump silt onto nearby islands, and threaten shellfish that reach estuaries through the ship channel. Trafigura has countered environmental concerns about its offshore operation by proposing to tunnel under sand dunes and wetlands to install a pipeline instead of digging a trench through environmentally sensitive areas. “Sea turtles are always an issue with dredging” because it brings in salt water, said Jayson Hudson, a regulatory supervisor at the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, which oversees permitting for Carlyle’s project. He called Trafigura’s horizontal drilling plan a “good option for avoiding permanent impacts.” Dredging the harbor, by contrast, would have wide-ranging impacts, said John Donovan, president of the Port Aransas Conservancy. “We’re very much against what we consider to be an environmental disaster that the Port’s plans for Harbor Island would entail,” he said.

2019-01-10,"(Repeats to widen readership) By Paul Lienert, Norihiko Shirouzu and Edward Taylor Jan 10 (Reuters) - Global automakers are planning a $300 billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to 10 years, with nearly half of the money targeted at China, accelerating the industry’s transition from fossil fuels and shifting power to Asian battery and electric vehicle technology suppliers. The unprecedented level of spending - much of it by Germany’s Volkswagen AG - is driven in large measure by government policies adopted to cut carbon dioxide emissions, and will extend technological advances that have improved battery cost, range and charging time to make electric vehicles more appealing to consumers, according to an exclusive Reuters analysis of public data released by those companies. For a graphic showing planned EV spending by country, click on tmsnrt.rs/2Azl09N. China for decades played catch-up to German, Japanese and American automakers, which dominated internal combustion vehicle technology. Now, China is positioned to lead electric vehicle development, industry executives say. “The future of Volkswagen will be decided in the Chinese market,” said Herbert Diess, chief executive of VW, which has decades-old joint ventures with two of China’s largest automakers, SAIC Motor and FAW Car. Speaking earlier this week to a small group of reporters in Beijing, Diess said China “will become one of the automotive powerhouses in the world.” “What we find (in China) is really the right environment to develop the next generation of cars and we find the right skills, which we only partially have in Europe or other places,” he said. Diess added, “We have very clear policies established here in China. Policymakers and regulators are requiring” a shift to electric vehicles. As China and other countries place more restrictions on conventional gasoline and diesel engines, auto companies have accelerated the shift to electrification. A year ago global automakers said they planned to spend $90 billion on electric vehicle development. The $300 billion that automakers have earmarked to put electric vehicles into mass production in China, Europe and North America is greater than the economies of Egypt or Chile. Almost one-third of the industry’s EV spending total, about $91 billion, is being committed by the Volkswagen Group, which is aggressively trying to distance itself from the Dieselgate scandal, which has cost it billions in penalties and legal settlements. VW’s sweeping electrification plan envisions capacity on three continents to build up to 15 million electric vehicles by 2025, including 50 pure electric and 30 hybrid electric models. Eventually, VW plans to offer electrified versions of all 300 models in its 12-brand global portfolio, which includes Audi and Porsche. VW’s staggering EV budget dwarfs that of its closest competitor, Germany’s Daimler AG, which has committed $42 billion. In comparison, General Motors Co, the No 1 U.S. automaker, has said it plans to spend a combined $8 billion on electric and self-driving vehicles. Roughly 45 percent of the global industry’s planned EV investment and procurement spending, more than $135 billion, will occur in China, which is heavily promoting the production and sale of electric vehicles through a system of government-mandated quotas, credits and incentives. As a result, EV spending by major Chinese automakers from SAIC to Great Wall Motor could be matched or even exceeded by multinational joint-venture partners such VW, Daimler and GM, as they dramatically expand their electric vehicle portfolios in China and ramp up battery purchases from Chinese suppliers. Reuters analyzed investment and procurement budgets made public over the past two years by 29 of the world’s top automakers, based primarily in the United States, China, Japan, Korea, India, Germany and France. The figures do not reflect planned investments and purchases that have not yet been made public. Actual spending by vehicle manufacturers on research and development, engineering, production tooling and procurement likely will be much higher. The analysis also does not include related spending by automotive suppliers, technology companies and large corporations in other industries, from energy and aerospace to electronics and telecommunications. “There has been a rush” to invest in electric vehicles and batteries, said Alexandre Marian, AlixPartners managing director and co-author of a 2018 study that forecast total EV spending of $255 billion through 2023 by global automakers and suppliers. Marian said the industry has increased spending budgets on electric vehicles and batteries, while seeking more alliances and partnerships to help spread the higher investment costs. Alliances, such as those between VW and its Chinese partners, will be among the greatest spurs to innovation, especially in the global rollout of electric vehicles. CEO Diess said VW is “evolving from the model where we have been developing and bringing European technology into this market to a new phase where we will co-develop part of the automotive technology in China for the rest of the world. I think this is a significant step change.” Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit, Edward Taylor in

2019-01-10,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) sold a record 6.24 million of its VW-branded vehicles last year despite delivery problems caused by new anti-pollution rules, but warned the company would continue to face considerable challenges in 2019. Still battling to recover from a 2015 emissions test cheating scandal and facing tighter European environmental rules, the German automaker has been trying to boost sales and cut costs to fund an ambitious shift to electric cars and automated driving. At the same time, trade disputes with China driven by U.S. President Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policies have caused uncertainty in the global auto industry.    “2019 will once again be a year of enormous challenges for the brand, aside from volume growth we will focus even more on our profitability,” Chief Operating Officer Ralf Brandstaetter said. VW brand sales rose 0.2 percent last year thanks to growth in South America, the United States and Europe, compensating for a decline in China and difficulties registering cars following the introduction of Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WTLP) emissions standards. The numbers do not include sales under the Audi, Porsche, Skoda, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Seat brands, which are also owned by Volkswagen.  The VW brand increased market share in China in 2018 but its vehicle sales fell 2.1 percent with the world’s largest passenger car market on track for an annual sales contraction not seen since at least 1990. For the wider Asia-Pacific region, sales dropped 1.7 percent. “This decline is mainly due to developments in China, where consumer restraint continues in an uncertain macroeconomic environment,” the company said.  Despite rising 3.6 percent for the year, European sales took a hit after stricter anti-pollution rules were introduced in September.     “2018 was marked by significant uncertainty in some regions, especially in the second half,” VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann said in a statement, but he added that new products had helped offset that. The company sold around 50,000 electric and hybrid cars, a 13 percent increase compared with 2017.

2019-01-10,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text) By Marianna Parraga MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Bottlenecks for offloading imported fuel are forming at some Mexican oil ports following government orders to shut pipelines to limit losses from widespread fuel theft, according to traders and Refinitiv Eikon data. With storage limited in Mexico, the move by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to shut pipelines and move fuel mostly by rail and truck has slowed transport, causing long lines for consumers and slowed deliveries at ports, where more than 7 million barrels of fuel - enough for several days of use in Mexico - languish. The crackdown on fuel theft, a crime that has drained billions of dollars from state coffers and is blamed for rising violence in some regions, is the leftist president’s first major move against criminals and corruption since taking office in December, but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy. Lines of drivers snaked from gas stations in Mexico City on Wednesday as the government crackdown on fuel theft led to panic purchases, despite assurances from Lopez Obrador that his efforts were succeeding. State-run Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) started building an inventory on Dec. 20 in preparation for pipeline closures, Energy minister Rocio Nahle said on Wednesday. She denied there was fuel scarcity in Mexico, which is among the world’s top four importers of gasoline. But fuel distribution to stations has slowed in recent days because of a switch to much less efficient truck transportation. Backlogs of tankers bringing imported fuel have started forming around Pemex’s maritime terminals, which are not draining inventories at their typical rhythm, also creating delays for tanker unloading, the traders said. As of Jan. 9, Mexico’s main port of entry for fuel imports, Pajaritos in the Gulf, had 15 tankers waiting to discharge, some of them since December. The neighboring Tuxpan terminal had 9 tankers waiting to discharge gasoline and other fuel, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), according to the Eikon data. The 24 vessels are jointly carrying about 7.2 million barrels of fuel, enough for nearly five days of consumption. As limitations to import fuel by vessel have grown, Pemex’s trading arm PMI has tapped suppliers to secure fuel by rail from the United States, one of the traders added. “PMI is securing as much by rail as possible, both for gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD). This is limited by the rail loading and unloading capabilities still in both the U.S. and Mexico,” the trader said. The company has had no problems finding suppliers in the United States, another trader said, adding that fuel shortages in some areas of Mexico are not the result of fewer imports, but caused by domestic distribution hiccups. Pemex is producing some 200,000 bpd of gasoline, Lopez Obrador said, slightly above November’s average of 171,700 bpd. “There’s enough fuel in the country,” Lopez Obrador said on Monday. He said that retail domestic prices have not increased mostly because of lower international prices. But Pemex’s fuel production dropped by 33 percent from January to November of last year compared with all of 2017, and it has recently struggled to maintain refineries in service. To compensate for declining domestic fuel output, Pemex has ramped up imports. For last year through November, it purchased 975,200 bpd, about two thirds of Mexico’s consumption, compared with the 799,500 bpd it imported in 2016, which represented 49 percent of consumption. Some independent retailers that started operating in Mexico because of the energy reform are separately importing themselves. All the purchases are making Mexico increasingly dependent on imported fuel, mostly from the United States. But the country still only has enough storage capacity for three days of consumption, causing bottlenecks to show up quickly. “More vessels booked from U.S. West Coast refineries in December, are on the way, causing more of a logjam. If the plan was to use trucks instead of pipelines to move product, it has failed,” one broker said.

China said the three days of talks in Beijing had established a “foundation” to resolve the two country’s differences, but gave virtually nothing in the way of details on key issues at stake. A slew of weak data also dampened the mood. Again in China, factory-gate inflation was the slowest in more than two years, while worse-than-expected industrial figures in France provided more proof that Europe is spluttering again. The pan-European STOXX 600 quickly lost 0.7 percent as Germany’s trade-sensitive DAX dropped 0.8 percent and Britain’s heavyweight FTSE 100 fell 0.5 percent on persistent Brexit concerns. “I am beginning to get a little concerned about the path of the European industrial data,” State Street Global Markets’ head of strategy, Michael Metcalfe, said. “It is raising the possibility of a technical recession in Europe. One of the big challenges is that if this is replicated in Italy’s data tomorrow, that potentially brings the budget questions back into the market’s thoughts.” The soured sentiment saw the normal move into safe-haven government bonds that give a guaranteed return. Yields on German and French and government bonds - which move inverse to price - dropped towards recent two-year lows. The European Central Bank will publish the minutes from its December meeting later where it formal shuttered the mass bond buying programme it has been using in recent years. U.S. Treasury yields last stood at 2.699 percent, down from 2.710 percent on Wednesday when Fed minutes showed policymakers were becoming more cautious about future rate hikes. The dollar remained on the defensive too after hitting its lowest level since mid-October. The greenback was down a tenth of a percent against the euro at $1.1556. The single currency gained 0.9 percent against the dollar during the previous session, its biggest one-day gain since late June. China’s yuan also muscled higher, breaching the 6.8 per dollar level for the first time since August in both onshore and offshore trade in Asia. “This drop in the dollar is an overdue correction following a surprisingly robust few weeks despite the massive collapse in U.S. rate expectations,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank. Asian shares had edged up overnight on the weaker dollar and hopes of more economic stimulus in China following its latest data disappointment. But many stocks seesawed, and Tokyo and Shanghai both closed lower as markets parsed the trade talks and hoped that they will ultimately avert another ramping up of U.S. tariffs in March. Oil also caught investors’ attention as Brent and U.S. crude fell back $1 having jumped overnight on signs of OPEC-led crude output cuts. Brent crude was last trading 1.4 percent lower at $60.58 a barrel and U.S. WTI was down 1.5 percent at $51.57 cents. Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said he viewed more gains in oil prices as a key driver for any further rise in risk appetite. If U.S. crude futures can break through the $55 level, “you’re going to see real yields probably lower. That’s really good for the cost of money and taking some further headwinds out of the U.S. dollar,” he said.

2019-01-10,"(Updates with additional comments from chief executive in paragraphs 8, 11) By Jane Lanhee Lee LAS VEGAS, Jan 9 (Reuters) - South Korean oil buyers are expected to restart Iranian oil imports in late January or early February, the head of South Korea’s SK Innovation, which owns South Korea’s biggest oil refiner SK Energy, said on Wednesday. In November, South Korea won a six-month waiver from sanctions imposed by the United States allowing the purchase a limited amount of Iranian oil, but the country has not imported any crude from the country since September. “As South Korea received a waiver and has been in talks with Iran about the first import volume, it seems (Iran oil) could be brought in late in January or early February at the earliest,” SK Innovation Chief Executive Officer and President Kim Jun told Reuters on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. South Korean and Japanese buyers were expected to restart Iranian oil imports early this year, industry sources said in November. South Korea can buy up to 200,000 barrels per day of Iran oil, mostly condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil under the waiver, the sources said. South Korea was the third-biggest buyer of Iranian oil and the largest importer of Iranian condensate before the U.S. sanctions were reimposed in November. Kim also said that SK Innovation, a supplier of electric vehicle (EV) batteries to Daimler and Volkswagen , may increase the investment into its U.S.-based EV battery manufacturing business to $5 billion to secure more of the market. “SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won expects the U.S. battery manufacturing capacity to be 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by as early as 2025,” Kim said, adding that the investment will be focused in the U.S. state of Georgia. The annual capacity of its global electric car battery production is expected to reach 100 GWh by 2025, and the company is aiming to cut annual production costs by 4 percent to meet demands from car makers, Kim said. Late to the EV battery market compared with rivals LG Chem and Samsung SDI, SK Innovation has announced investment plans worth $3 billion since late 2017, to build new factories in China, Hungary and the U.S. Under this investment agenda, the company expects its battery orders to double by 2020 from a total of 320 GWh of orders as of the end of 2018, Kim said. “Our petrochemical business is affected a lot by things like oil prices. We will continue to keep that business competitive but we also need to have a new growth driver. That is our electric car batteries,” Kim said.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 percent, hovering at a near four-week high, helped by a fall for the dollar. Japan’s Nikkei closed 1.3 percent lower. European stocks are expected to open lower. Spread-betters looked for Britain’s FTSE to be 0.2 percent lower, France’s CAC off 0.5 percent and Germany’s DAX down 0.4 percent. Wall Street’s S&P 500 rose 0.41 percent on Wednesday, extending its gains from 20-month lows touched around Christmas to more than 10 percent. But E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were down half a percent. Weak Chinese inflation data raised the prospect of further government stimulus but China’s blue-chip CSI 300 went back into the red, losing 0.2 percent, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng struggled to maintain a small gain. Delegations from China and the United States ended three days of trade talks in Beijing on Wednesday in the first face-to-face negotiations since both sides agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade war. China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday the talks were extensive, and helped establish a foundation for the resolution of each others’ concerns. However, there were few concrete details on the meetings, which were not at a ministerial level, so were not expected to produce a deal to end the trade war. Risk assets extended a days-long rally overnight after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting showed that many policymakers believed they could be patient about future U.S. monetary tightening, while a few did not support the central bank’s rate increase last month. Figures out of China on Thursday showed the country’s consumer prices and factory-gate inflation both increased less than expected in December, with the latter rising at the slowest pace in over two years. The pace of month-on-month increases in factory-gate inflation declined for a second straight time. “If this trend persists, it may turn negative on year-on-year terms this year and more radical stimulus measures, such as benchmark interest rate cuts, may become possible,” said Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ Research. Oil also caught investors’ attention after U.S. crude and Brent jumped overnight, helped by optimism that Sino-U.S. trade tensions are easing, while OPEC-led crude output cuts also provided support. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures on Wednesday gained almost 5.2 percent, while Brent crude futures rose more than 4.6 percent, extending a rally that has pushed futures up about 14 percent this year. Both benchmarks gave up some of their recent gains on Thursday. U.S. crude was last trading 59 cents lower at $51.76 a barrel, down 1.15 percent. Brent lost 57 cents to $60.87, off 0.93 percent. Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said he viewed more gains in oil prices as a key driver for any further rise in risk appetite. If U.S. crude futures can break through the $55 level, “you’re going to see real yields probably lower. That’s really good for the cost of money and taking some further headwinds out of the U.S. dollar,” he said. U.S. Treasury yields last stood at 2.699 percent, down from 2.710 percent at the U.S. close on Wednesday. The dollar remained on the defensive after hitting its lowest level since mid-October amid the signs Fed policymakers are becoming more cautious about future rate hikes and as investors unwound safe-haven bets due to optimism over the trade talks. The yuan strengthened, breaching the key 6.8 per dollar level for the first time since August in both onshore and offshore trade. The greenback was down a tenth of a percent against the euro at $1.1556. The single currency gained 0.9 percent against the dollar during the previous session, its biggest one-day gain since late June. Against a basket of six major rivals, the dollar briefly dipped to 95.029, its lowest since Oct. 16, and was last down 0.1 percent. The dollar lost 0.2 percent against the yen, a safe-haven currency that’s often preferred by traders during times of market and economic stress. The Canadian dollar retreated in line with oil prices, and last traded down 0.2 percent at C$1.3232. It had risen to a five-week high during the previous session. The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady as expected on Wednesday but said more increases would be necessary even though low oil prices and a weak housing market will harm the economy in the short term. In commodity markets, spot gold was 0.2 percent higher at $1,296.40, edging towards a near seven-month peak of $1.298,60 scaled on Friday.

2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan expects to sign investment agreements with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the coming weeks, the prime minister’s office said, as Islamabad builds on its ties with states that have recently lent it billions of dollars. A memorandum of understanding was expected with Saudi Arabia this month, with an investment framework accord set to be signed with the UAE in February, Prime Minister Imran Khan’s office said in a statement following a meeting on Wednesday. The MoUs follow a similar agreement signed last month with China, it said. The statement gave no details but the daily Dawn newspaper quoted Board of Investment Chairman Haroon Sharif, as saying the investments were likely to be in the oil refining, petrochemicals, renewable energy and mining sectors. “We are expecting $10-billion-plus Saudi investments and the MoUs to be signed in this regard will not be common or vague but concrete agreements,” Dawn quoted him as saying, adding that Saudi Aramco would invest in an oil refinery and also set up its own refinery in Pakistan. Sharif said the UAE was interested in agriculture and housing investments and four Malaysian firms were interested in investments in the areas of halal meat, gemstones, information technology and hi-tech education. The investments would be in addition to a $6-billion package provided to Pakistan by Saudi Arabia and a similar-sized package, made up of loans and an oil payment credit facility, offered by the UAE. The agreements come as Pakistan has sought to strengthen its public finances and reduce its current account deficit, which a report from the International Monetary Fund in November estimated to stand at 5.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2018.

2019-01-10,"* Reaffirms expectations for full-year group operating profit * Forecasts full-year loss for sugar operations (Adds detail, comment) HAMBURG, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Germany’s Suedzucker, Europe’s largest sugar refiner, on Thursday reported a third-quarter operating loss, hit by the global collapse in sugar prices. The group posted an operating loss of 23 million euros ($26.6 million) in the three months to Nov. 30, compared with an operating profit of 103 million euros a year earlier, with quarterly revenue dropping 5.1 percent to 1.71 billion euros. Suedzucker reiterated its expectations for group operating profit of 25 million to 125 million euros in the 2018/19 financial year, down from the previous year’s 445 million euros. It also repeated its forecast for full-year group revenue of 6.6 billion to 6.9 billion euros, against the previous year’s 7 billion euros. The group also has extensive non-sugar interests, from bioethanol to fruit and processed foods. Suedzucker shares fell 3.8 percent in pre-market trade. “The main reason for the quarterly result are low sugar prices,” a Suedzucker spokesman said. “The EU’s market liberalisation means that falling world prices also depress prices in Europe. “Demand in Europe is almost stable, but prices are falling. World sugar demand is still rising but prices are low.” Raw sugar futures ended 2018 at their lowest in 10 years, pressured by heavy global oversupply. The European Union liberalised its sugar market in September 2017, ending its system of guaranteed minimum prices and protected production quotas. This gave producers more freedom to expand and export, but a worst-case scenario emerged, with European producers exposed to collapsing world prices. Suedzucker posted a third-quarter operating loss in its sugar business of 85 million euros, from an operating profit of 38 million euros a year earlier. The company forecasts that its sugar business will suffer a 2018/19 full-year operating loss of between 150 million and 250 million euros, against an operating profit of 139 million euros the previous year. “We have seen a recovery in world sugar prices since October 2018, but we cannot see a full turnaround in the sugar market so cannot give an-all clear signal,” the spokesman said. Suedzucker said in July thatr it was reassessing its sugar sector strategy and considering new options to reduce costs. The strategy examination and reassessment of its sugar operations “will be intensified”, the company said on Thursday.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent, hovering at a near four-week high. China’s blue-chip CSI 300 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. Chinese shares recouped earlier losses as weak inflation data raised the prospect of further government stimulus. The yuan strengthened, breaching the key 6.8 per dollar level for the first time since August in both onshore and offshore trade, further boosting appetite for riskier assets. Australian shares added 0.3 percent, but Japan’s Nikkei closed 1.3 percent lower. Wall Street’s S&P 500 rose 0.41 percent on Wednesday, extending its gains from 20-month lows touched around Christmas to more than 10 percent. Delegations from China and the United States ended three days of trade talks in Beijing on Wednesday in the first face-to-face negotiations since both sides agreed a 90-day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday the talks were extensive, and helped establish a foundation for the resolution of each others’ concerns. However, there were few concrete details on the meetings in Beijing, which were not at a ministerial level, so were not expected to produce a deal to end the trade war.

Besides the dovish slant from the Fed minutes, a clutch of officials said on Wednesday they will wait to deliver more interest rate hikes so the central bank can further assess growing risks to an otherwise solid U.S. economic outlook. “The financial markets had been pushing the Federal Reserve to change their tune,” said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone. “We’ve got that situation played out. The markets have had their day, they have pushed the Federal Reserve to work towards a sort of concerted patience stance...Now we’ve got back to an equilibrium point.” The rally has gained traction since last Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was aware of risks to the economy and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were last down half a percent.

2019-01-10,"(Reuters) - Global automakers are planning a $300 billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to 10 years, with nearly half of the money targeted at China, accelerating the industry’s transition from fossil fuels and shifting power to Asian battery and electric vehicle technology suppliers. The unprecedented level of spending - much of it by Germany’s Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) - is driven in large measure by government policies adopted to cut carbon dioxide emissions, and will extend technological advances that have improved battery cost, range and charging time to make electric vehicles more appealing to consumers, according to an exclusive Reuters analysis of public data released by those companies.  China for decades played catch-up to German, Japanese and American automakers, which dominated internal combustion vehicle technology. Now, China is positioned to lead electric vehicle development, industry executives say. “The future of Volkswagen will be decided in the Chinese market,” said Herbert Diess, chief executive of VW, which has decades-old joint ventures with two of China’s largest automakers, SAIC Motor (600104.SS) and FAW Car (000800.SZ). Speaking earlier this week to a small group of reporters in Beijing, Diess said China “will become one of the automotive powerhouses in the world.” “What we find (in China) is really the right environment to develop the next generation of cars and we find the right skills, which we only partially have in Europe or other places,” he said. Diess added, “We have very clear policies established here in China. Policymakers and regulators are requiring” a shift to electric vehicles. As China and other countries place more restrictions on conventional gasoline and diesel engines, auto companies have accelerated the shift to electrification. A year ago global automakers said they planned to spend $90 billion on electric vehicle development. The $300 billion that automakers have earmarked to put electric vehicles into mass production in China, Europe and North America is greater than the economies of Egypt or Chile. Almost one-third of the industry’s EV spending total, about $91 billion, is being committed by the Volkswagen Group, which is aggressively trying to distance itself from the Dieselgate scandal, which has cost it billions in penalties and legal settlements. VW’s sweeping electrification plan envisions capacity on three continents to build up to 15 million electric vehicles by 2025, including 50 pure electric and 30 hybrid electric models. Eventually, VW plans to offer electrified versions of all 300 models in its 12-brand global portfolio, which includes Audi and Porsche. VW’s staggering EV budget dwarfs that of its closest competitor, Germany’s Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), which has committed $42 billion. In comparison, General Motors Co (GM.N), the No 1 U.S. automaker, has said it plans to spend a combined $8 billion on electric and self-driving vehicles. Roughly 45 percent of the global industry’s planned EV investment and procurement spending, more than $135 billion, will occur in China, which is heavily promoting the production and sale of electric vehicles through a system of government-mandated quotas, credits and incentives. As a result, EV spending by major Chinese automakers from SAIC to Great Wall Motor (601633.SS) could be matched or even exceeded by multinational joint-venture partners such VW, Daimler and GM, as they dramatically expand their electric vehicle portfolios in China and ramp up battery purchases from Chinese suppliers. Reuters analysed investment and procurement budgets made public over the past two years by 29 of the world’s top automakers, based primarily in the United States, China, Japan, Korea, India, Germany and France. The figures do not reflect planned investments and purchases that have not yet been made public. Actual spending by vehicle manufacturers on research and development, engineering, production tooling and procurement likely will be much higher. The analysis also does not include related spending by automotive suppliers, technology companies and large corporations in other industries, from energy and aerospace to electronics and telecommunications. “There has been a rush” to invest in electric vehicles and batteries, said Alexandre Marian, AlixPartners managing director and co-author of a 2018 study that forecast total EV spending of $255 billion through 2023 by global automakers and suppliers. Marian said the industry has increased spending budgets on electric vehicles and batteries, while seeking more alliances and partnerships to help spread the higher investment costs. Alliances, such as those between VW and its Chinese partners, will be among the greatest spurs to innovation, especially in the global rollout of electric vehicles. CEO Diess said VW is “evolving from the model where we have been developing and bringing European technology into this market to a new phase where we will co-develop part of the automotive technology in China for the rest of the world. I think this is a significant step change.” Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit, Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing; Editing by Steve Orlofsky",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autoshow-detroit-electric/exclusive-vw-china-spearhead-300-bln-global-drive-to-electrify-cars-idUKL1N1Z90MI,10 Jan 2019,"Global automakers are planning a $300

2019-01-10,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Bottlenecks for offloading imported fuel are forming at some Mexican oil ports following government orders to shut pipelines to limit losses from widespread fuel theft, according to traders and Refinitiv Eikon data. With storage limited in Mexico, the move by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to shut pipelines and move fuel mostly by rail and truck has slowed transport, causing long lines for consumers and slowed deliveries at ports, where more than 7 million barrels of fuel - enough for several days of use in Mexico - languish. The crackdown on fuel theft, a crime that has drained billions of dollars from state coffers and is blamed for rising violence in some regions, is the leftist president’s first major move against criminals and corruption since taking office in December, but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy. Lines of drivers snaked from gas stations in Mexico City on Wednesday as the government crackdown on fuel theft led to panic purchases, despite assurances from Lopez Obrador that his efforts were succeeding. State-run Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) started building an inventory on Dec. 20 in preparation for pipeline closures, Energy minister Rocio Nahle said on Wednesday. She denied there was fuel scarcity in Mexico, which is among the world’s top four importers of gasoline. But fuel distribution to stations has slowed in recent days because of a switch to much less efficient truck transportation. Backlogs of tankers bringing imported fuel have started forming around Pemex’s maritime terminals, which are not draining inventories at their typical rhythm, also creating delays for tanker unloading, the traders said. As of Jan. 9, Mexico’s main port of entry for fuel imports, Pajaritos in the Gulf, had 15 tankers waiting to discharge, some of them since December. The neighboring Tuxpan terminal had 9 tankers waiting to discharge gasoline and other fuel, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), according to the Eikon data. The 24 vessels are jointly carrying about 7.2 million barrels of fuel, enough for nearly five days of consumption. As limitations to import fuel by vessel have grown, Pemex’s trading arm PMI has tapped suppliers to secure fuel by rail from the United States, one of the traders added. “PMI is securing as much by rail as possible, both for gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD). This is limited by the rail loading and unloading capabilities still in both the U.S. and Mexico,” the trader said. The company has had no problems finding suppliers in the United States, another trader said, adding that fuel shortages in some areas of Mexico are not the result of fewer imports, but caused by domestic distribution hiccups. Pemex is producing some 200,000 bpd of gasoline, Lopez Obrador said, slightly above November’s average of 171,700 bpd. “There’s enough fuel in the country,” Lopez Obrador said on Monday. He said that retail domestic prices have not increased mostly because of lower international prices. But Pemex’s fuel production dropped by 33 percent from January to November of last year compared with all of 2017, and it has recently struggled to maintain refineries in service. To compensate for declining domestic fuel output, Pemex has ramped up imports. For last year through November, it purchased 975,200 bpd, about two thirds of Mexico’s consumption, compared with the 799,500 bpd it imported in 2016, which represented 49 percent of consumption. Some independent retailers that started operating in Mexico because of the energy reform are separately importing themselves. All the purchases are making Mexico increasingly dependent on imported fuel, mostly from the United States. But the country still only has enough storage capacity for three days of consumption, causing bottlenecks to show up quickly. “More vessels booked from U.S. West Coast refineries in December, are on the way, causing more of a logjam. If the plan was to use trucks instead of pipelines to move product, it has failed,” one broker said.

2019-01-10,"CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS (Reuters) - Booming U.S. oil exports have set off a scramble to build Gulf Coast ports to handle more than 3 million barrels per day in new supplies expected over the next five years. Of seven proposed oil-export projects, nowhere is the opportunity greater or the competition more fierce than in Corpus Christi, Texas, where three firms are vying to open the state’s first deepwater port. Commodities trader Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] has taken an early lead with a planned offshore facility that has an easier path to regulatory approval and faces fewer objections from environmentalists.  Its chief competitor - a partnership of investor Carlyle Group and the Port of Corpus Christi to build an onshore port - has responded by petitioning regulators to kill Trafigura’s project. Port lobbyists have cited past criminal allegations involving the firm in other countries and potentially “catastrophic” environmental impacts. Rising demand for new ports follows a 2015 decision by the U.S. Congress to lift a 40-year ban on crude exports after advances in drilling techniques sparked a rapid rise in domestic shale production - especially in Texas. The United States had been the world’s top oil buyer for decades, and its port infrastructure was built to import rather than export. Now, surging exports threaten to overwhelm existing ports as U.S. production is projected to hit 12 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from 9.35 million in 2017.(U.S. crude producers send more shale oil to the world : tmsnrt.rs/2H48vJp  ) “We’ve got a wave of oil headed toward the coast,” said Jeremiah Ashcroft III, chief executive of Lone Star Ports LLC, the Carlyle-backed company formed to develop its Corpus Christi project. Only one U.S. facility, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, can fully load supertankers capable of carrying 2 million barrels. The Corpus Christi port - the closest to the most prolific shale fields in Texas - exports less than 1 million bpd, and its harbor is too shallow to fully load supertankers. The market ultimately may support more than one new deepwater port, but the first firm to build near Corpus Christi will have the best shot at cutting long-term deals with producers expected to ship an estimated 2.1 million bpd to the region through new pipelines set to open this year. “Right now, there’s only enough room for one project,” Ashcroft said. Carlyle plans a $1 billion port to handle 1.4 million bpd. Trafigura, which has not disclosed its planned investment in the port, would handle much less, at 500,000 bpd. But Trafigura’s operation would siphon off revenue from the Port of Corpus Christi and Carlyle’s project because Trafigura would serve shippers offshore, before they reach the harbor. Carlyle declined to make an executive available for an interview and referred questions to Lone Star. Trafigura said in a statement that its port would leave room for other projects because it would handle only a portion of the expected new oil flows. A third competitor, pipeline operator Magellan Midstream Partners LP, plans an export terminal on the Corpus Christi harbor, near Carlyle’s proposed site.   But Magellan faces a roadblock because port officials last year agreed to work exclusively with Carlyle. Magellan said in a statement that it has not decided whether to build the project. Companies including Kinder Morgan Inc, JupiterMLP and Tallgrass Energy have also proposed offshore ports along the Gulf Coast.   Carlyle said last October that it could open its facility by late 2020. But that assumes its plan for dredging to accommodate supertankers will not require a full environmental review, which is sought by opponents and could take two years.  As Carlyle and the Port have tried to navigate those obstacles, port lobbyists have petitioned regulators to halt Trafigura’s project. In an August letter, the port’s law firm called on the U.S. Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration to reject Trafigura’s application, citing a “criminal history.” The letter from Baker Wotring LLP pointed to the trader’s 2006 guilty plea for selling a U.S. company oil from Iraq that Trafigura falsely claimed had been authorized under a United Nations humanitarian aid program. U.S. companies at the time were barred by government sanctions from buying Iraqi oil except through the program. After the regulators declined the port’s request, its law firm in December raised bribery allegations brought earlier that month by Brazilian prosecutors against two former Trafigura executives. The firm asked regulators to halt Trafigura’s work until the allegations were “fully investigated.”   Trafigura said in a statement that its management had no knowledge of any improper payments made to employees of Brazil’s state-run oil firm Petrobras. Trafigura did not comment on the port law firm citing its guilty plea involving Iraq oil sales. Last month, five Corpus Christi area lawmakers asked Texas Governor Greg Abbott to veto Trafigura’s application on environmental grounds, citing a risk of “catastrophic crude oil spills” and “excessive air emissions.”  Federal rules require state governors to sign off on offshore ports. Abbott has made no decision, a spokesman said. Lone Star’s Ashcroft said onshore terminals are safer than offshore projects because oil spills are more easily cleaned up in harbors than in open water. Trafigura said it chose to go offshore to ensure supertankers can safely and efficiently load cargoes and that its application will be reviewed by more than 30 government agencies. Carlyle is essential to building the Port of Corpus Christi’s crude export business. Port officials started pursuing federal approval to dredge its harbor 28 years ago, but Congress only recently approved $59 million, a fraction of what’s needed. “We don’t have 28 years; we have two,” said Sean Strawbridge, chief executive of the Port of Corpus Christi Authority, referring to its timeline for readying the port for new oil flows. Port officials last year sought to kickstart the dredging by issuing $217 million in bonds. That money will allow it to start dredging to a 54-foot draft - not deep enough for supertankers. If Trafigura’s port wins approval, it could take business from the Port of Corpus Christi. Port revenues could fall by about 12 percent, estimated investment researcher Morningstar Inc., a loss that could hurt its efforts to finance dredging not covered by the government or Carlyle. In October, Carlyle agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to cover the dredging needed to get achieve a 75-foot draft in the outer harbor to accommodate supertankers. Environmentalists favor offshore ports over what they consider the harmful impact of dredging harbors. The newly formed Port Aransas Conservancy in south Texas has argued Carlyle’s plan would endanger sea turtle nesting areas, dump silt onto nearby islands, and threaten shellfish that reach estuaries through the ship channel.  Trafigura has countered environmental concerns about its offshore operation by proposing to tunnel under sand dunes and wetlands to install a pipeline instead of digging a trench through environmentally sensitive areas. “Sea turtles are always an issue with dredging” because it brings in salt water, said Jayson Hudson, a regulatory supervisor at the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, which oversees permitting for Carlyle’s project. He called Trafigura’s horizontal drilling plan a “good option for avoiding permanent impacts.” Dredging the harbor, by contrast, would have wide-ranging impacts, said John Donovan, president of the Port Aransas Conservancy. “We’re very much against what we consider to be an environmental disaster that the Port’s plans for Harbor Island would entail,” he said.

2019-01-10,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The emerging dynamic for crude oil markets this year is the struggle between OPEC and its allies for higher prices against the vocal push for low prices from U.S. President Donald Trump. Much has already been written on which side is likely to prevail, but in the meantime the losers are refiners in Asia, who face crude prices likely to be higher relative to those in Europe and the Americas. This is likely because Asian refiners will bear the brunt of lower supplies from OPEC’s Middle East producers, as well as Russia, while at the same time being unable to take full advantage of cheaper U.S. shale crude oil. While more U.S. crude is expected to flow to Asia in coming months because of the discount of West Texas Intermediate to the global light crude benchmark Brent, it remains questionable as to whether this will offset lower supplies from the Middle East. Differences in crude quality also aren’t working in favour of Asian refiners, given the preference of many for heavier, sour crudes such as those typically supplied by top Middle East exporters such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. While there may be more U.S. crude available at competitive prices in Asia, there may not be the appetite for it among many refiners given their plants are optimised to run on heavier grades. And those heavier grades are looking more expensive as demand for them rises and OPEC and its allies cut output. OPEC oil production slumped by the most in almost two years in December, with the reduction coming ahead of a formal agreement between the 15-member producer organisation and its allies, including Russia. OPEC pumped 32.68 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, according to a Reuters survey published on Jan. 3, down 460,000 bpd from November and the largest month-on-month drop since January 2017. OPEC, Russia and other non-members, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019 from November 2018 levels starting this month. OPEC’s share of that cut is 800,000 bpd. The OPEC+ cuts are making Middle East heavier crudes lose their price advantage to lighter grades. Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) futures for Oman crude for March settlement ended at $60.57 a barrel on Wednesday, while the similar Brent contract was at $61.83, a discount of just $1.26. Six months ago Brent was at $79.44 a barrel while DME Oman was at $75.32, a significantly deeper $4.12 discount. The erosion of Oman’s price advantage to Brent leaves many Asian refiners with little choice but to pay relatively more for their crude supplies. Even if they can switch to using lighter crude grades, they end up producing more gasoline than desired and not enough middle distillates, such as diesel and jet kerosene. While the profit margin, or crack, for a Singapore refinery producing diesel from Dubai crude is off its November peak of $17.97 a barrel, at the close of $13.43 on Wednesday it is still comfortably above the profit on gasoline. Producing a barrel of gasoline from Brent crude in Singapore actually yielded a loss of 37 cents a barrel on Wednesday, down from the peak last year of a profit of $11.55, reached on Aug. 15. The contrasting fortunes of gasoline and middle distillates in Asia is a reflection of the struggles Asian refiners are having in adapting to the conflicting aims of the governments of the major oil producers, namely the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Throw in uncertainty over what happens in April when U.S. waivers over Iran’s crude exports end, and the picture clouds further for Asian refiners, who buy about two-thirds of the oil exported from the Middle East. It’s not a situation of their making, but Asia’s refiners are caught between the OPEC+ moves to boost oil prices, and Trump’s Twitter onslaught aimed at keeping them low. And the geopolitics of Trump’s renewed sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, the war in Syria and the ongoing fallout from the killing by Saudi agents of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey add to the brew of uncertainty. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-crude-asia/column-asian-refiners-lose-in-crude-tug-of-war-between-opec-and-trump-russell-idUKL3N1ZA24S,10 Jan 2019,"The emerging

2019-01-10,"CARACAS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro begins a second term in office on Thursday in defiance of international criticism that his reelection last year was illegitimate, further isolating the South American country where an economic crisis is fueling a humanitarian emergency. Leaders from the ruling Socialist Party have disavowed criticism of Maduro’s inauguration, which will keep him at the helm of the OPEC oil exporter until 2025, calling for rallies of support and promoting him on social media with Twitter hashtags such as #Iampresident. Opposition leaders, however, have portrayed Thursday’s inauguration as the moment at which Maduro will be internationally branded a dictator following a widely boycotted 2018 election that governments around the world described as a farce. But continued support from the military, a chronically fractured opposition and a relentless crackdown on opposition critics means that Maduro appears to face few serious challenges at home, despite the international outcry. “They’ve tried to turn a constitutional swearing-in ceremony into a world war,” Maduro said during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. “But whether there’s rain, thunder or lightning, we’re going to triumph.” The ceremony is scheduled for 10 a.m. local time (1400 GMT) on Thursday. Maduro’s triumphalism echoes that of his predecessor, late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who used abundant oil revenues to flood Venezuela with consumer goods while providing heavily subsidized food and medicine. That contrasts sharply with the Venezuela of today. Inflation is fast approaching 2 million percent, leaving a monthly minimum wage worth less than a carton of eggs. Some three million people have emigrated since 2015 - many on foot - to escape rising malnutrition and disease, according to the United Nations. Bank notes that once paid for months’ worth of groceries are now tossed in trash cans, piled into useless stacks or even woven into multi-colored women’s handbags sold by street merchants. Maduro last year won reelection despite the economic chaos in large part because the opposition boycotted the vote, in which Socialist Party activists openly made payments to voters within a stone’s throw of polling stations. Countries around the world condemned the vote, including the United States and Venezuela’s neighbors in Latin America, leaving Maduro backed by just a handful of stalwart allies from leftist governments. While few countries plan to shutter embassies or sever ties with the Maduro government, according to diplomatic sources, the vast majority will not send diplomats to the inauguration as is customary. The government feted the arrival of foreign dignitaries who traveled for the inauguration, including the president of South Ossetia - a disputed territory in the Caucasus region that is rarely described as nation. That sparked guffaws from opposition critics who called it a signal of isolation. Opposition activists have called for protests on Thursday. Authorities have responded by filling streets with police checkpoints and rifle-toting troops. Fury in 2017 over Maduro’s aggressive sidelining of the opposition-run Congress led to a four-month wave of protests that killed over 100 but failed to shake him from power and left his adversaries frustrated. “They’re trying to scare us so that we don’t protest,” said Henry Ramirez, 39, a computer engineer in the western city of San Cristobal, attempting to cut into a line for gasoline, the type of a queue that has become increasingly frequent amid the crisis. “Tomorrow the dictatorship continues.” While politically motivated demonstrations have faded, protests take place nearly every day to demand salary improvements, access to food and medicine, or improvements to spotty power and water services. Less than 24 hours before Maduro’s swearing in, troops in the second largest city of Maracaibo fired tear gas at informal vendors who were defying an order not to set up stalls at a market in the city center. The vendors later looted nearby shops. “Maduro is going to be sworn in and I don’t think it changes anything,” said Angela Perez, 26, who works the cash register at a fast-food restaurant in the city of Valencia, adding she does not sympathize with Maduro or his critics. “I’m just trying to get a few more documents together so I can leave the country. There’s no future here. It’s sad but true.” (Additional reporting by Tibisay Romero in Valencia, Anggy Polanco in San Cristobal and Mariela Navas in Maracaibo; editing by Daniel Flynn and G Crosse)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics/maduro-faces-next-term-in-a-hobbled-isolated-venezuela-idUKL1N1Z91RC,10 Jan 2019,"Venezuelan President Nicolas

2019-01-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) will pay more than $700 million (547.56 million pounds) to resolve lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department and diesel owners over claims it used illegal software to allow 104,000 diesel vehicles to emit excess emissions, three people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. Fiat Chrysler will pay $311 million in civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, about $75 million to states investigating the excess emissions and additional funds to offset excess emissions from the older cars. It will also pay $280 million to settle a lawsuit by owners, the sources said. Fiat Chrysler has denied any wrongdoing and previously said there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules. In October, the company set aside 713 million euros ($815 million) to cover potential costs related to the case. Separately, Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], a German auto supplier that made some components for the Fiat Chrysler diesel engines, is expected to announce it will settle suits from U.S. owners for $30 million, one person said. The settlements are set to be announced on Thursday at the Justice Department. Fiat Chrysler, Bosch and the Justice Department declined to comment. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a media advisory Wednesday that said it would make an “announcement of a significant civil action to address cheating on federal auto-emissions tests.” The Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler in May 2017, accusing it of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles from the 2014-2016 model years. Fiat Chrysler won approval from U.S. regulators in July 2017 to sell diesel vehicles with updated software. The company has repeatedly said it hoped to use that software to address agencies’ concerns over the 2014-2016 vehicles.  The company is not expected to make any hardware changes to the vehicles and the fix will not impact the vehicle’s fuel economy, two people said. Owners of those vehicles are expected to get an average of $2,800 each for completing the software updates, the sources said. Fiat Chrysler will formally issue an emissions recall for the vehicles, but will not offer to buy back the vehicles, the sources said. The Justice Department in 2017 said Fiat Chrysler used auxiliary emissions controls in diesel vehicles that led to “substantially” higher than allowable levels of nitrogen oxide, or NOx pollution, which is linked to smog formation and respiratory problems. U.S. and California regulators stepped up scrutiny of diesel vehicles after Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to illegally installing software in U.S. vehicles for years to evade emissions standards. VW has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. Regulators have also been probing diesel emissions in Daimler AG’s (DAIGn.DE) U.S. Mercedes Benz vehicles.  VW also paid $4.3 billion in 2017 in U.S. civil and criminal fines and pleaded guilty to three criminal felony counts to resolve the Justice Department’s investigation. Fiat Chrysler still faces an ongoing criminal investigation by the Justice Department. Fiat Chrysler sells two U.S. diesel models and plans to add two new Jeep SUV diesel models by 2020.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.2 percent, reversing course after briefly touching a near four-week high early in the session. Australian shares eased 0.3 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei was down 1.4 percent by the midday break. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off nearly half a percent, while China’s blue-chip CSI 300 lost 0.1 percent. Wall Street’s S&P 500 rose 0.41 percent on Wednesday, extending its gains from 20-month lows touched around Christmas to more than 10 percent. Delegations from China and the United States ended three days of trade talks in Beijing on Wednesday in the first face-to-face negotiations since both sides agreed a 90-day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that the talks with the United States this week were extensive, and helped establish a foundation for the resolution of each others’ concerns. However, there were few concrete details on the meetings in Beijing, which were not at a ministerial level, so were not expected to produce a deal to end the trade war. Risk assets extended a days-long rally overnight after minutes from the Fed’s December meeting showed that many policymakers were of the opinion they could be patient about future monetary tightening, and a few did not support the central bank’s rate increase last month. Not helping sentiment were figures out of China showing the country’s consumer prices and factory-gate inflation both rose less than expected in December, with the latter rising at the slowest pace in over two years. “Dovish Fed minutes and positive developments out from the U.S.-China trade talks will likely keep the risk rally going although some market players may opt to book gains and to wait for fresh leads,” ING economists said in a note to clients. Besides the dovish slant from the minutes, a clutch of Fed officials also said on Wednesday they will wait to deliver more interest rate hikes so the central bank can further assess growing risks to an otherwise solid U.S. economic outlook. “The financial markets had been pushing the Federal Reserve to change their tune,” said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone. “We’ve got that situation played out. The markets have had their day, they have pushed the Federal Reserve to work towards a sort of concerted patience stance. That has all happened. Now we’ve got back to an equilibrium point.” The rally has gained traction since last Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was aware of risks to the economy and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were last down about half a percent. Oil also caught investors’ attention after U.S. crude and Brent jumped overnight, helped by optimism over easing Sino-U.S. trade tensions, while OPEC-led crude output cuts also provided support. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures on Wednesday gained almost 5.2 percent, while Brent crude futures were up more than 4.6 percent. The sharp gains extended a rally that has pushed futures up about 14 percent this year. Both crude futures gave up some of their recent gains on Thursday. U.S. crude was last trading 55 cents lower at $51.81 a barrel, down 1.05 percent. Brent lost 50 cents to $60.94, off 0.81 percent. Pepperstone’s Weston said he viewed more gains in oil prices as a key driver for any further rise in risk appetite. If U.S. crude futures can break through the $55 level, “you’re going to see real yields probably lower. That’s really good for the cost of money and taking some further headwinds out of the U.S. dollar,” he said. U.S. Treasury yields last stood at 2.696 percent, down from 2.710 percent at the U.S. close on Wednesday. The dollar remained on the defensive after hitting its lowest level since mid-October amid the signs Fed policymakers are becoming more cautious about future rate hikes and as investors unwound safe-haven bets due to optimism over the trade talks. The greenback was down a tenth of a percent against the euro at $1.1553. The single currency gained 0.9 percent against the dollar during the previous session, its biggest one-day gain since late June. Against a basket of six major rivals, the dollar briefly dipped to 95.082, its lowest since Oct. 17, and was last down 0.1 percent. The dollar lost nearly 0.2 percent against the yen, a safe-haven currency that’s often preferred by traders during times of market and economic stress. The Canadian dollar retreated in line with oil prices, and last traded down 0.2 percent at C$1.3237. It had risen to a five-week high during the previous session. The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady as expected on Wednesday but said more increases would be necessary even though low oil prices and a weak housing market will harm the economy in the short term. In commodity markets, spot gold was 0.2 percent higher at $1,295.40, trading not far off a near seven-month peak of $1.298,60 scaled on Friday.

2019-01-10,"SINGAPORE, Jan 10 (Reuters) - German chemicals giant BASF on Thursday said it had selected the port city of Zhanjiang in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong as the site for its $10 billion petrochemicals complex. The company had previously said that the facility, China’s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex, would be in the province without giving the exact location. China is allowing greater access to its massive chemicals markets for global majors and local independents as it looks to feed fast-growing demand for plastics, coatings and adhesives from industries such as consumer electronics. “By 2030, China’s share of global chemical production will increase to nearly 50 percent,” BASF Chairman Martin Brudermüller said in a statement issued on Thursday. “Guangdong is a growing market for innovations from chemistry, and our new site will support customers in multiple industries.” The company on Wednesday signed a so-called ‘framework deal’ taking the project beyond the ‘memorandum of understanding’ that was previously agreed. The $10 billion will be invested in phases including building a 1 million tonne-per-year steam cracker and several plants for consumer-oriented products, BASF said. A 9 square-km plot of land will be allocated for the project. The move comes after BASF in October signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s Sinopec Corp to build a steam cracker in the eastern city of Nanjing, where the firm started its first major investment in the nation nearly two decades ago in a tie-up with the Chinese state energy firm.

2019-01-10,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Even as a partial shutdown halts the functions of many U.S. government departments, forcing the Department of the Interior to close national parks, the Trump administration is continuing to push for the expansion of oil drilling on sensitive, federally owned lands in Arctic Alaska.     The Alaska Bureau of Land Management (BLM), part of the Interior Department, was scheduled to hold a meeting on Wednesday night in Wainwright, an Inupiat village on the Arctic coast, over a plan to expand oil development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The bureau is legally required to hold public meetings on its plans. Wednesday marked the 19th day of a partial U.S. government shutdown caused by the failure of President Donald Trump and Congressional Democrats to agree on a spending bill that provides funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, one of Trump’s key election pledges. Nine federal departments, including the Department of the Interior - whose BLM handles permits for oil and gas drilling on public land - have been affected, to varying degrees. The BLM has already held some public meetings about the proposed oil lease in the National Petroleum Reserve, including one last week in the Inupiat village of Nuiqsut, where some residents questioned BLM officials about the meeting’s legality.       “There were a lot of people concerned about how they’re conducting business during the shutdown,” said Martha Itta, administrator for the local tribal government in the village of about 450 people near the North Slope oil fields. “There was even a question to them if the meeting was illegal,” she told Reuters.     A BLM spokesman in Washington said the public hearings over permits to drill in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska were exempt from the shutdown. “The Bureau continues to process permit applications as they are an exempted activity during a lapse in appropriations.” It was not clear if that applied to permits nationwide or just in Alaska.  On Wednesday, the BLM in Alaska issued a statement saying it was postponing public meetings on another oil leasing plan, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Those hearings were to be held in eight cities and villages including Anchorage, Fairbanks and Washington D.C. It did not give a reason for the delay but said the deadline for submitting public comments is Feb 11.     The Trump administration has pushed to move quickly on lease sales in the ANWR, which it won approval to drill in through the passage of tax legislation in 2017 after decades of prohibition.     Environmental and Native groups have criticized the Interior Department for moving too swiftly on readying a lease sale later this year, saying more time is needed to consult with tribes and other locals. Alaska’s crude oil production has been sagging for years. The state produced more than 2 million barrels of oil a day (bpd) in 1988, but as of October, the most recent data available, it produced 487,000 bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Department.

2019-01-10,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday proposed restricting utility PG&E Corp (PCG.N) from using power lines deemed to be unsafe during high winds in the 2019 California fire season, adding another complication for the California utility as it faces billions of dollars in wildfire liabilities.  In an order, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco also proposed that PG&E be required to reinspect its grid and “remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines.” The judge is overseeing conditions of PG&E’s probation following a 2010 gas pipeline explosion, and directed the company to respond to his proposed order by Jan. 23. Alsup scheduled a hearing for Jan. 30. PG&E is exploring filing some or all of its business for bankruptcy protection as a contingency, in part because it could soon take a significant financial charge for the fourth quarter of 2018 related to liabilities from fatal wildfires in 2017 and 2018, Reuters reported last week. A bankruptcy filing is not certain. “We are aware of Judge Alsup’s orders and are currently reviewing,” a PG&E spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement.  Alsup said the goal of modifying PG&E’s probation to include the new power restrictions was to eliminate the number of wildfires caused by PG&E in 2019. “This will likely mean having to interrupt service during high-wind events (and possibly at other times),” Alsup wrote, “but that inconvenience, irritating as it will be, will pale by comparison to the death and destruction that otherwise might result from PG&E-inflicted wildfires.” PG&E said in November it could face “significant liability” in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused last year’s Camp fire in Northern California.  The Camp blaze killed at least 86 people, incinerating most of the Sierra foothills town of Paradise, 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco.  PG&E also faces dozens of lawsuits from owners of homes and businesses that burned during 2017 fires.

2019-01-10,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Gasoline shortages in Mexico sparked by a crackdown on fuel theft prompted warnings from business leaders that industries like carmaking will suffer if the shortfalls persist as lines at gas stations in the capital grew on Wednesday. The drive to eradicate a crime that has deprived state coffers of billions of dollars is President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s first major move against chronic corruption since taking office on Dec. 1, but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy. Criminal groups have been tapping pipelines and stealing tanker trucks laden with diesel and gasoline in the oil-producing country for years, reselling it illicitly, often with apparent impunity. However, by closing off pipelines and refineries while it tracked the thefts, the government has triggered shortfalls and long lines at gas stations in several states. Despite assurances from government officials that the situation is in hand, industry concern is growing. Juan Pablo Castanon, head of the powerful Mexican business lobby CCE, told Milenio television bottlenecks in fuel supply were starting to affect manufacturing. “Not just workers in their movements to the workplace, but also production plants, particularly in the auto industry, which isn’t able to get enough fuel for new vehicles,” he said. Alfredo Arzola, director of the automotive industry hub in the state of Guanajuato, a major car-making area hard hit by the fuel problems, told Reuters assembly plants could begin idling within a week if no fix was found. “Investments are being put at risk,” he said. Lopez Obrador said fuel theft has dropped to the equivalent of 27 truckloads a day from “over a thousand” since he sent the army to police installations of state-oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, better known as Pemex, last month. On Wednesday he vowed to hold firm. “It would be easy to open the pipes and say: ‘The situation is normal again,’ but we will not knowingly allow the theft to persist... We’ll resist all pressures, whatever they are,” Lopez Obrador told a news conference. Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said on Wednesday that Pemex’s 74 fuel storage terminals were full as of Dec. 20. The government’s plan to cut fuel transport via several vulnerable pipelines began a week later on Dec. 27. She said the government is monitoring Pemex’s pipeline network for any drop in pressure caused by illegal taps, and shutting the flow of fuel if such taps are detected. Nahle said that some 5,000 fuel tanker trucks are working across the country to improve distribution to gas stations, but declined to say when supplies to gas stations will return to normal. Earlier in the week, Lopez Obrador said Pemex is producing about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, versus the roughly 800,000 bpd that Mexican motorists consume each day.  The difference is made up with imports, almost all of which come from the United States. The president has pledged to cut imports once domestic production grows. At the major import hubs of Pajaritos and Tuxpan on Mexico’s Gulf coast, 24 tanker ships were waiting on Wednesday to unload their cargos, including both motor and heating fuels, according to vessel tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon. In Mexico City, lines of drivers snaked from gas stations making panic purchases out of fear supplies would run low, despite assurances from Lopez Obrador there was plenty of fuel available in the country. Ernesto Villanueva, 34, said he had driven into town from the suburb of Iztapalapa to search for fuel on Tuesday night. “It’s a bit easier to get at night, but last night already the gas was finished in that area. I’m telling my teammates to come here, buy a jug and we can stock up.” Additional reporting by Anthony Esposito and Marianna Parraga; Editing by Tom Brown and Sonya Hepinstall",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-theft/update-1-mexico-fuel-shortage-worries-industry-as-lines-in-capital-grow-idUKL1N1ZA004,10 Jan 2019,"Gasoline shortages in Mexico

U.S. Treasury yields last stood at 2.696 percent, down from 2.710 percent at the U.S. close on Wednesday. The dollar remained on the defensive after hitting its lowest level since mid-October amid signs Fed policymakers are becoming more cautious about future rate hikes and as investors unwound safe-haven bets due to optimism over the trade talks. The greenback was down nearly 0.2 percent against the euro at $1.1560. The single currency gained 0.9 percent against the dollar during the previous session, its biggest one-day gain since late June. Against a basket of six major rivals, the dollar was 0.1 percent lower after falling as low as 95.116, its lowest since Oct. 17, during the previous session. In commodity markets, spot gold edged down to $1,292.70, but still not far off a near seven-month peak of $1.298,60 scaled on Friday.

2019-01-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump stormed out of talks with Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday over funding for a border wall with Mexico and reopening the government, complaining the meeting at the White House was “a total waste of time.” On the 19th day of a partial government shutdown caused by the dispute over the wall, a short meeting that included Trump, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer ended in acrimony with no sign of a resolution. “Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier?” Trump wrote. “Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!” Exasperated Democrats called Trump’s behaviour a “temper tantrum” and said the meeting broke down when they refused to commit to funding his proposed southern border wall. Trump’s desire for a wall between the United States and Mexico was a central theme of his 2016 presidential campaign. “It was a petulant president of the United States,” Pelosi told reporters when she returned to the Capitol. “A person who would say: ‘I’ll keep government shut down for weeks, months or years unless I get my way.’ That’s just not the way democracy works, and so it’s very sad.” Schumer said Trump had “a temper tantrum.” The lawmaker told reporters: “That is sad and unfortunate. We want to come to an agreement. We believe in border security. We have different views.” The breakdown in talks could strengthen the possibility that Trump will declare a national emergency to build a wall on the southern border if no deal with Congress can be reached on his request for $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) for the project. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said he had the authority to declare a national emergency that would let him pay for the wall with military funds. Vice President Mike Pence told reporters  Trump was still considering that option. Asked what Trump had gained by walking out, Pence said: “I think the president made his position very clear today: that there will be no deal without a wall.” Shortly after the White House meeting broke up, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation to end a partial shutdown of the Treasury Department and some other agencies that have been closed since Dec. 22, without money for the wall. But there was no indication that the Senate, controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans, would allow a vote on the bill. Democrats are eager to force Republicans to choose between funding the Treasury’s Internal Revenue Service - at a time when it should be gearing up to issue tax refunds to millions of Americans - and voting to keep it partially shuttered. In a countermove, the Trump administration said that even without a new shot of funding, the IRS would somehow make sure those refund checks get sent. The National Treasury Employees Union filed suit on Wednesday challenging the administration’s authority to force federal employees to work without pay. Trump attended a lunch meeting of Senate Republicans on Wednesday and emerged to declare unwavering support for the tough stance he has taken on funds for the wall. Asked if he got the impression in the meeting that the shutdown would end soon, Republican Senator Tim Scott said: “I did not. I think we’re going to be here a while.”    Pelosi plans more votes this week that one by one would provide money to operate departments ranging from Homeland Security and Justice to State, Agriculture, Commerce and Labour. Able to get the bills through the House because of the Democratic majority, Pelosi is hoping some Senate Republicans back her up and abandon Trump’s wall gambit.  The political manoeuvring comes amid a rising public backlash over the suspension of government activities that has resulted in the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers. Other “essential” employees are being required to report to work, but without pay for the time being. On Thursday, Trump travels to the border to highlight what he calls an immigration “crisis.” He delivered his first prime-time television address from the Oval Office on Tuesday to make his case for the border wall. The funding fight stems from Congress’ inability to complete work by a deadline last September on funding all government agencies. It did, however, appropriate money for about 75 percent of the government on time - mainly military and health-related programs. U.S. airport security workers and air traffic controllers working without pay have warned that security and safety could be compromised if the shutdown continues, but the Trump administration said staffing was adequate and travellers had not faced unusual delays. Union officials said some TSA officers had already quit because of the shutdown and many were considering quitting.    Ratings agency Fitch warned that it could cut the U.S. triple-A sovereign debt credit rating later this year if the shutdown proves prolonged and Congress fails to raise the legal limit on the national debt in a timely manner.

2019-01-10,"(Repeats Jan. 9 column with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2RIgtvy By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas prices have fallen sharply as the unusual cold weather of late November and early December has given way to warmer-than-normal temperatures in the last four weeks. Futures prices for gas delivered at Henry Hub in February 2019 have fallen below $3 per million British thermal units from a peak of almost $4.80 in the middle of November. The exceptional rally in gas prices during the late summer and early autumn has unwound, leaving gas prices back at the low level that has prevailed for the last three years (tmsnrt.rs/2RIgtvy). Cumulative heating demand for the 2018/19 heating season was around 6 percent higher than the long-run average through Dec. 12, according to the U.S. government Climate Prediction Center. But the sustained period of cold in late autumn and early winter has been replaced by an extended period of mild weather and cumulative heating demand has now dropped 4 percent below normal (“Degree days statistics”, CPC, Jan. 8). Government forecasts show average or above-average temperatures expected across most of the major population centres of the United States for much of the next three months. So far this winter, gas stocks have fallen much less for any given level of heating demand than in the previous heating seasons, which has also helped rebalance the market. Surging gas prices have encouraged electricity generators to run gas-fired units for fewer hours in the fourth quarter and turn to coal-fired units instead, cutting gas consumption and making scarce stocks go further. Working gas stocks in underground storage were 726 billion cubic feet (20 percent) below the previous five-year average in mid-December, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By the end of the year, however, the deficit had eased to just 561 billion cubic feet (14 percent) due to warmer weather and a reduction in hours by gas-fired generators (“Weekly natural gas storage report”, EIA, Jan. 4). The rise and fall in gas prices has been accentuated by the accumulation and subsequent liquidation of hedge fund positions since the end of July and especially since the end of September. Hedge fund managers correctly anticipated a shortage of gas this winter and the likelihood price spikes would be needed to eke out the low stocks left at the end of the refill season. Fund managers were net buyers of futures and options equivalent to 2,229 billion cubic feet of gas between late July and mid-November, according to position data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. By the middle of November, fund managers held almost 7 bullish long positions for every one bearish short positions, the most biggest bullish imbalance since at least 2010. Between Nov. 13 and Dec. 18, however, as electric generators curbed their gas consumption and temperature forecasts became milder, portfolio managers turned net sellers of 715 billion cubic feet of gas. Funds probably continued to liquidate bullish positions in the last two weeks of the year – though there is no way to tell yet because publication of updated numbers has been delayed by the U.S. government shutdown. Hedge fund accumulation of bullish positions likely accelerated and exaggerated the rise in gas prices early in the fourth quarter, but it also enforced the necessary conservation of gas stocks and avoided worse shortages. As the seasonal gas deficit has been reduced and those bullish positions have unwound, selling pressure has intensified the subsequent price plunge.

2019-01-10,"* U.S. fuel stocks swell, crude output at record 11.7 mln bpd -EIA * But financial markets upbeat on U.S.-China trade talk hopes * OPEC supply cuts also support oil prices By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Thursday on swelling U.S. supply, although the mood in global markets was increasingly confident amid hopes the United States and China may soon end trade disputes that have undermined global economic growth. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $51.93 per barrel at 0033, down 43 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. Both oil price benchmarks had jumped by around 5 percent the previous day as financial markets around the world surged on that hopes that Washington and Beijing may be able to soon end their trade disputes, soothing fears of an all-out trade war between the two biggest economies and its possible impact on global growth. “Amid easing trade tension and a weaker U.S. dollar, crude oil prices rallied after Saudi Arabia reassured the market that its production cuts would remain in place,” ANZ bank said on Thursday. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said on Wednesday he was confident that supply cuts started in late 2018 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some allies, including Russia, aimed at reining in oversupply would bring the oil market into balance. Khalid al-Falih said he would not rule out calling for further action in future, if needed. Despite this, U.S. bank Morgan Stanley cut its 2019 oil price forecasts by more than 10 percent on Wednesday, pointing to “weakening economic growth expectations” and rising oil supply from outside OPEC as reasons for their lower price forecast. Morgan Stanley now expects Brent to average $61 a barrel this year, down from a previous estimate of $69 a barrel, and U.S. crude to average $54 per barrel, against a prior forecast of $60. “Balancing the market would require OPEC discipline to continue well into 2020,” it said. The main source of new supply is the United States, where crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA remained at a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week ending Jan. 4, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. That has resulted in swelling fuel inventories. Although crude stocks C-STK-T-EIA dipped by 1.7 million barrels, to 439.74 million barrels, they remained above their five-year seasonal average of 435 million barrels. Gasoline stocks rose 8.1 million barrels, to 248.1 million barrels, marking the largest weekly rise since December, 2016. Distillate stocks swelled by 10.6 million barrels, to 140.04 million barrels.

2019-01-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Rolls-Royce called on the British government to avoid a disorderly Brexit and said it was building up some stock, expanding warehouse capacity and training suppliers for customs changes in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal.  Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the globe’s biggest trading bloc in under 80 days but a Brexit agreement looks set to be voted down by lawmakers next week, making a no-deal and potential trade barriers more likely. The BMW-owned (BMWG.DE) brand, which reported record 2018 sales, said that despite the steps it was taking to prepare for Brexit, it was impossible to predict what would happen if there is not a managed transition after March 29. “We are highly dependent on a proper, working frictionless chain of goods and this whole company hinges on just-in-time deliveries,” Chief Executive Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes told reporters.  “We urge the government to avoid any hard Brexit,” he said.  Asked whether Rolls-Royce, which builds all of its roughly 4,000 cars per year at its Goodwood factory in southern England, would ever make some models overseas, Mueller-Oetvoes said: “This is a no-go,” he said. “Rolls-Royce belongs to Britain, we are committed to Britain.” Sales at the 115-year-old company, which employs just over 2,000 people, rose 22 percent to 4,107 cars last year, boosted by an over 40 percent rise in demand from China, which accounted for one in five purchases. The numbers reflect similarly buoyant sentiment from Aston Martin, suggesting that luxury automakers might buck an apparent slowdown that has hit the likes of Apple and prompted China’s most successful car firm Geely to forecast flat sales this year. “You see more and more self-drivers in the Chinese market, people being behind the wheel particularly over the weekends in the luxury sector ... and that made (models) Wraith and Dawn quite successful in China last year,” he said. “I can’t comment yet on how 2019 will pan out for us in China but so far we haven’t seen dents in our success over there.” Mueller-Oetvoes also said that tax cuts made by U.S. President Donald Trump also helped the business. “This was really fuel for our business last year in the United States,” he added.
