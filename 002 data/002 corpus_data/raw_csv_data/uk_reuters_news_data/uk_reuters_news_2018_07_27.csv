2018-07-27,"* Global stocks index down 0.35 pct despite earlier gains * U.S. growth fastest in nearly 4 years; figure was expected * U.S. Treasury yields lower ahead of Fed, BoJ meetings (Updates to early afternoon U.S. stock trading) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - World shares were little changed on Friday as mixed corporate profits and economic data that only met expectations struggled to displace concerns over trade and central bank policy, though a key global equity index was still set for a fourth week of gains. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.35 percent, though still set for its fourth weekly advance. Investors surveyed a host of second-quarter corporate results, punishing those that came up short, including Intel Corp, down 8.6 percent after its fast-growing data center business missed estimates. Exxon Mobil Corp fell 3 percent and Twitter Inc sank 19 percent after their results. Data showed the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter, as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs before they took effect in early July. But the economic growth figures were widely expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 131.68 points, or 0.52 percent, to 25,395.39, the S&P 500 lost 25.01 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,812.43 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 133.20 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,718.98. Bonds did not sell off, as some investors had expected, on strongly positive news. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields slipped from their highest level in 1-1/2 months and last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.9579 percent, from 2.975 percent late on Thursday. Rates markets await an important week of meetings at the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan (BoJ). Earlier speculation that the BoJ might tweak its policies rattled global markets. The bank’s aggressive efforts to keep yields in its own markets low has pushed investors to markets elsewhere, keeping a lid on yields worldwide. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield hit one-year highs even as the BOJ conducted special, unlimited buying for the second time this week that kept the bonds from shooting higher in yield. Helped by the yield spike, the Japanese yen strengthened 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 110.90 per dollar. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback fell 0.1 percent. U.S. disagreements with its trading partners slipped from the headlines after an agreement on Wednesday to negotiate with the European Union, but Chinese markets still showed scars of the unresolved rifts. The main Shanghai index closed down 0.4 percent with the U.S.-China standoff on trade still unresolved. Copper, which is sensitive to growth prospects especially in emerging markets, lost 0.68 percent to $6,248.00 a tonne. Oil, also sensitive to worldwide economic demand, also sank. U.S. crude fell 1.32 percent to $68.69 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.25, down 0.39 percent on the day. “While the prospect of tariffs on European cars has diminished, it hasn’t gone away completely, which means inevitably the market shifts its attention elsewhere,” said CMC Markets chief markets analyst Michael Hewson. “That elsewhere concerns what could happen next with respect to China, and the prospect of an escalation there,” he said. The Chinese offshore yuan fell to 6.855 per dollar, its weakest since June 2017, before rebounding to end stronger on the day. Earlier losses were cushioned by Chinese state banks’ trading to support the currency. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by Ritvik

2018-07-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has not instituted a policy of regime change or collapse in Iran, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday, saying the goal was still to curb what Washington sees as Iran’s threatening behaviour in the Middle East. Mattis made his comments after days of back-and-forth bellicose rhetoric between Iranian and U.S. officials, with President Donald Trump promising dire consequences for Iran if it continues to make threats toward the United States. Asked at the Pentagon whether the Trump administration had instituted a policy of regime change or collapse toward Iran, Mattis said, “There’s none that’s been instituted.” “We need them to change their behaviour on a number of threats that they can pose with their military, with their secret services, with their surrogates and with their proxies,” Mattis told reporters during an off-camera briefing. Mattis’ remarks were the most detailed by a senior administration official about U.S. policy toward Iran following high-level discussions at the White House on Thursday that included the topic of Iran. Since Trump’s decision in May to withdraw the United States from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, Tehran’s clerical establishment has been under increasing U.S. pressure and the prospect of possible sanctions. As the tensions simmered, an Australian media report  appeared to suggest military action was imminent, saying Australian officials believed Washington was prepared to bomb Iran’s nuclear capability as early as next month. Mattis on Friday dismissed the report as “fiction.” “I’m confident that it’s not something that’s being considered right now,” Mattis told reporters, speaking at an on-camera event earlier in the day. Washington aims to force Tehran to end its nuclear programme and its support of militant groups in the Middle East, where Iran is involved in proxy wars from Yemen to Syria.     While the United States is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil beginning in November, Iran has warned of counter-measures and has threatened to block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are halted. The week of heated rhetoric between Washington and Tehran that was kicked off by a warning from Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday that hostile U.S. policies could lead to “the mother of all wars.” On Sunday night, Trump said in a Twitter posting written in all capital letters directed at Rouhani: “Never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence & death. Be cautious!” The harsh words evoked memories of Trump’s warnings to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year over his nuclear weapons programme, which raised fears of a major conflict. Those concerns have eased following a June summit between Trump and Kim.  Still, analysts warn that Iran is a far different challenge, and that stiff U.S. rhetoric could harden Iranian resolve. Iran’s Guards commanders have threatened to destroy U.S. military bases across the Middle East and target Israel, which Iran refuses to recognise, within minutes of being attacked. On Thursday, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, who heads the Quds Force of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, warned Trump, “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine.” Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Will Dunham",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-iran/update-2-u-s-not-pursuing-regime-change-collapse-in-iran-mattis-idUKL1N1UN139,27 Jul 2018,"The United States has not

2018-07-27,"(Adds rig count in Permian basin) July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added oil rigs for the first time in the past three weeks as drillers follow though on plans to spend more on exploration and production in anticipation of higher crude prices in 2018 than recent years. That move higher came despite recent declines in U.S. crude prices, which are on track to fall for a fourth week in a row this week on worries trade tensions between the U.S., China and Europe could hurt oil demand. Drillers added three oil rigs in the week to July 27, bringing the total count to 861, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the oil rig count rose three in July after losing one rig in June. More than half the total oil rigs are in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there increased by four this week, bringing the total to 479, the same as in early June and the highest since January 2015. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 766 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.11 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $68 for the balance of 2018 and about $65 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.7 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,033 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. That is the same as last week’s expectations. Since 1,048 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,009. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this month projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.8 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-07-27,"(Reuters) - U.S. independent oil refiner Phillips 66’s quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates on Friday as cheaper crude prices boosted refining margins by more than 45 percent. The company’s shares rose 2.4 percent to $118.76 in afternoon trading on Friday. Like its rivals Valero Energy Corp and Marathon Petroleum Corp, Phillips 66 processes heavy crude from countries including Venezuela and Canada into diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and other products. But booming U.S. shale production has forced refiners to retrofit the distillation process to handle more of the very light crude from the oilfields of Texas and North Dakota.  “With roughly one-third of their crude slate being light crude, I would suspect Phillips 66 benefited significantly during the quarter as did the other refiners,” said Jennifer Rowland, an energy analyst at Edward Jones. Phillips 66 said earnings from refining, its biggest business, increased to $910 million in the second quarter from $224 million a year earlier. On Thursday, Valero and Marathon Petroleum also topped Wall Street profit estimates as greater processing of cheap, light crude from West Texas boosted margins. The spread between U.S light crude and Brent crude has widened this year with a rise U.S. oil production, which lowered WTI prices, while Brent crude has climbed on Middle East tensions and OPEC supply cuts. U.S. crude production has been rising to record high levels since late last year, hitting a record 11 million barrels per day this month.  The widening of the Brent–WTI spread, larger discounts on U.S. inland crudes and improved heavy crude differentials all contributed to increased realized margins, Phillips 66 said. “We expect Western Canadian Select discounts to be attractive for at least the next 18 months and potentially longer,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland said on a post- earnings report call, adding that the refiner has no major turnaround overhauls planned at its nine refineries in the third quarter of 2018.  Prices for Canadian crude have also dropped against benchmark oil as a surge in production has led to transportation bottlenecks. Realized refining margin was $12.28 per barrel compared with $8.44 per barrel a year earlier, the company said in a statement. The refiner’s utilization rate, which is defined as the percentage of the total equipment or refinery involved in processing crude, reached 100 percent. Chief Financial Officer Kevin Mitchell said in a call with Wall Street analysts that capital expenditure for the rest of the year will be between $2 billion and $3 billion.  Earnings from the company’s midstream business also doubled to $202 million while profit at its chemicals business, which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics, rose nearly 34 percent.  The Houston, Texas-based company said its adjusted earnings rose to $1.32 billion, or $2.80 per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $569 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-07-27,"(Reuters) - An unplanned shutdown this summer of Canada’s Syncrude oil sands site has caused Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) to look to lessen its biggest refinery’s reliance on it, Imperial’s chief executive said on Friday.  Imperial holds a 25 percent stake in Syncrude, which is majority owned by Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO). It was forced to shut down last month after a power transformer failed.  Syncrude’s 360,000 barrel per day mine and oil upgrading site in northern Alberta accounts for 10 percent of Canada’s oil production. Nearly all of Imperial’s share of its output feeds the Strathcona refinery to produce gasoline and other products, accounting for one-third of the refinery’s oil supply, Chief Executive Rich Kruger said. “When Syncrude has an unplanned event, the supply folk at Strathcona do need to scramble, and unfortunately they have had to scramble the last few years more than they would like,” Kruger said on a conference call with analysts. Imperial is testing the suitability of other types of light and synthetic crude to determine if it should secure other supply agreements for the refinery, Kruger said. “The Syncrude events are more troubling for their impact on Strathcona. It does affect the ability to run that refinery at the highest level of reliability without disruptions.” Suncor said this week that some Syncrude production has been restored and full production may come online in September. Imperial’s second-quarter profit missed analyst estimates by a wide margin on Friday, hurt by higher-than-expected costs from planned maintenance at various projects.  Shares of the company, which is majority owned by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), dipped 1.3 percent in Toronto. The company had scheduled maintenance at several projects including a 72-day turnaround at Strathcona. But cost overruns hurt its bottom line, with analysts at Eight Capital saying the hit from maintenance of about C$250 million, or 31 Canadian cents a share, was bigger than expected. The company reported net profit of C$196 million ($149.9 million) or 24 Canadian cents per share in the quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, it earned 24 Canadian cents a share, while analysts expected a profit of 57 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gross production rose to 336,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 331,000 boepd a year earlier, but missed some analysts’ estimates.

2018-07-27,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), two of the world’s largest oil producers, reported quarterly profit on Friday that fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations. The disappointing results come as much of the U.S. oil industry has been recovering from a three-year downturn in the energy sector, bolstered by higher production and crude prices. Exxon’s troubles highlight ongoing issues the company has been having to boost operations, whereas Chevron’s miss was fueled by a slight rise in expenses that likely will not be repeated, analysts said.  Exxon shares fell 2.5 percent to $82.09 shortly after midday, while Chevron's recovered from an early drop and were up about 2 percent at $126.34. Both stocks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI. The results were particularly weak at Exxon, which has been trying to boost operations in a bid to revive a stock price trading at about the same level it was a decade ago. “Exxon’s definitely sticking out like a sore thumb right now,” said Edward Jones energy analyst Brian Youngberg. “It’s just hard to find anything good in the quarter.” Despite rising oil prices CLc1LCOc1, Exxon’s production dropped 7 percent and it spent more than $600 million to upgrade refineries in France, Canada, Texas and Saudi Arabia. Exxon called the quarter a “challenging” one for its operations and “well below market expectations.”     Neil Chapman, an Exxon executive and member of the company’s management committee, said he is “not happy” about the ongoing refinery maintenance, adding there is “nothing systemic” about the repairs that would reveal weakness in the refining division.  “We are absolutely all over these reliability incidents,” Chapman said on a conference call with investors. Exxon earned 92 cents per share, while analysts expected earnings of $1.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.      At Chevron, oil production rose 2 percent and profit spiked, but higher corporate expenses surprised Wall Street. Still, the company announced a $3 billion stock buyback program, long awaited by Wall Street. “We believe annual share repurchases of $3 billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios,” Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told investors on a conference call. Chevron earned $1.78 per share, while analysts expected $2.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), a key rival, posted second-quarter profit on Thursday far below forecasts due in part to weakness in refining.     British oil major BP Plc (BP.L) is set to report quarterly results next week.

2018-07-27,"July 27 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices rose this week as a heatwave gripped Japan and high temperatures swept across South Korea and parts of China boosting cooling demand though relief is set to come from new Russian supplies. Spot prices for September LNG-AS delivery in Asia were assessed at $9.75 per million British thermal units (Btu), up 25 cents from the previous week. Contrary to previous forecasts, temperatures in Japan stayed above average in a prolonged heatwave that killed dozens of people. It also prompted electric utilities to fire up mothballed oil and gas-fired power plants left on standby. The heat hit South Korea too but any increase in gas demand may be muted by the start-up of the 950-megawatt Hanul No.2 nuclear reactor, which is expected to by fully operational by Sunday. LNG imports into South Korea hit record levels in the first half of the year but such volumes will not be sustainable as anticipated nuclear start-ups will leave an average of only six reactors offline over the rest of the year. The second train at Novatek’s Arctic Russian operations in Yamal has started operations, one trader said. Novatek said last year that the second train would start operations in the third quarter of this year. “The start of Yamal’s Train 2 is easing the pain for buyers but demand due to the heatwave seems to be picking up,” said one trader. Papua New Guinea launched a tender offering a cargo for Aug. 22-29 and the bids were seen to be bullish although the result is not yet known, the trader said. However, Russia’s Sakhalin II cargo offered in the first half of September was sold to a shareholder of the plant for an estimated $9.70 per mmBtu. Another trader cited a potential transaction range of $9.65-$9.70 per mmBtu. He sees September prices around the $9.75 per mmBtu mark. Aside from Yamal, traders were also waiting on new supplies from Japan’s Inpex, which expects its Ichthys plant in Australia to start up in September. European spot prices so far remain uncompetitive with Asia in drawing away Qatari cargoes, as storage inventories recover across the continent.

2018-07-27,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday that a private meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week ended with an agreement that the two countries would discuss a nuclear power deal in the future. Ramaphosa has put nuclear expansion on the back burner since taking office in February, saying it is too expensive, and has focused instead on pledges to revive the economy and crack down on corruption. His scandal-plagued predecessor, Jacob Zuma, had championed a deal to dramatically increase South Africa’s nuclear capacity despite concern from ratings agencies that it would deal a further blow to the country’s already strained public finances. “We have huge financial constraints, we are not able to proceed with a nuclear build programme,” Ramaphosa told a news conference at the end of the BRICS summit.  “President Putin was quite relaxed about this. He said you deal with your issues and when the situation changes we can keep talking about this. And that’s where we left it. There’s no other hidden agenda,” Ramaphosa added. Kremlin-controlled Rosatom, a clear leader in the global nuclear industry, was one of the front runners for the massive nuclear project championed by Zuma.

2018-07-27,"(Adds comment from Mountain Valley Pipeline spokeswoman) July 27 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday vacated decisions by two federal agencies that allowed EQT Corp to build its $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia across federal land. The case is the latest victory in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit by the Sierra Club and other opponents of the pipeline. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington said the decision could delay the project’s in-service date until the fourth quarter of 2019. The Sierra Club and others challenged decisions by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service granting the pipeline rights of way across federal land. The court concluded certain aspects of the federal agencies’ decisions failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Forest Management Act. “Mountain Valley Pipeline is working with the agencies to evaluate the effect of the order on construction activities in the National Forest, which amounts to about 1 percent of the overall project route,” said Natalie Cox, a spokeswoman for MVP. The court remanded the case back to the BLM and Forest Service for further proceedings. Mountain Valley is one of several pipelines expected to enter service over the next year or two to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. On Thursday, EQT delayed the targeted completion date for Mountain Valley to the first quarter of 2019 from late 2018. In explaining the delay, the company cited legal challenges in the Fourth Circuit by the Sierra Club and others to a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that allowed the pipeline to cross streams and rivers in West Virginia, among other issues. The 303-mile (488-kilometer) pipeline is designed to deliver up to 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas to meet growing demand for the fuel for power generation and other uses in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day.

2018-07-27,"LISBON, July 27 (Reuters) - France, Spain and Portugal agreed on Friday to increase the links between their energy networks, aiming to reduce the Iberian peninsula’s isolation from European electricity and gas markets and to boost energy security. At a summit in Lisbon, the leaders of the three countries pledged to boost alternative energy sources and routes, including liquified natural gas (LNG), at a time that Europe is facing pressure to reduce its reliance on gas from Russia. Identifying risks to Europe’s energy supplies, the three underlined “the importance of LNG to diversify the sources and routes of EU energy supply, with a view to reducing dependence and thereby strengthening energy security,” according to a joint statement. One possibility is the development of gas pipelines between Spain and France, over the Pyrenees, to pump gas from North Africa or elsewhere, officials said. French President Emmanuel Macron told journalists that regulators were considering “the relevance of new gas interconnections, and in particular a gas interconnection between France and Spain”. He added that such a pipeline could make economic sense as France turns away from coal plants. Friday’s main concrete achievement was an agreement to build an electricity line under the Bay of Biscay from northern Spain to south-west France. It will receive 578 million euros ($675 million) from the European Commission, the biggest such investment by Europe in an energy project. By 2025, the electricity link should raise Spain’s energy interconnection capacity close to the European target of 15 percent from six percent now. The European Union has set a target that member states should have at least 15 percent of their electricity output connected to other countries’ networks. “I think this meeting clearly shows our firm comitment to the (European) energy union,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told journalists. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in a statement that boosting energy interconnections between the three countries was a step towards “strengthening the security of energy supply across Europe”. The United States is trying to sell LNG to Europe, possibly through Portugal’s southern Sines deep water port. For that gas to reach Europe’s biggest northern economies, network connections would be necessary between Iberia and France. Portugal is actively pushing to develop the potential of Sines. Portugal and Spain already have a joint Iberian electricity market called MIBEL, whereby producers can sell extra capacity across the border through an auction system that started in 2014.

2018-07-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World shares fell on Friday as corporate results and economic data failed to wow investors, leaving them to stew over trade tariffs and central bank policies. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.20 percent, though it still marked its fourth weekly advance. Investors surveyed a host of second-quarter corporate results, punishing those that came up short, including Intel Corp, down 8.6 percent after its fast-growing data-center business missed estimates. Exxon Mobil Corp fell 2.8 percent and Twitter Inc sank 20.5 after their results. Data showed the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years during the second quarter, as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed soybean shipments to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs before they took effect in early July. But the economic growth figures were widely expected. “The terrible tariff talks has been a real damper on what has been a banner earnings season,” said Matt Schreiber, president at WBI Investments. “The markets should be higher right now.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 76.01 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,451.06, the S&P 500 lost 18.62 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,818.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 114.77 points, or 1.46 percent, to 7,737.42. Bonds did not sell off on positive news, either. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields slipped from their highest level in 1-1/2 months and last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.9598 percent, from 2.975 percent late on Thursday. Rates markets await an important week of meetings at the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan (BoJ). Earlier speculation that the BoJ might tweak its policies rattled global markets. The bank’s aggressive efforts to keep yields in its own markets low has pushed investors to markets elsewhere, keeping a lid on yields worldwide. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield hit one-year highs even as the BOJ conducted special, unlimited buying for the second time this week that kept the debt’s yields from shooting higher. Helped by the yield spike, the Japanese yen strengthened 0.22 percent versus the greenback at 110.99 per dollar. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback fell 0.1 percent. [FRX/] U.S. disagreements with its trading partners slipped from the headlines after an agreement on Wednesday to negotiate with the European Union, but Chinese markets still showed scars of the unresolved rifts. The main Shanghai index closed down 0.4 percent with the U.S.-China standoff on trade still unresolved. Copper, which is sensitive to growth prospects especially in emerging markets, lost 0.75 percent to $6,244.00 a tonne. Oil, also sensitive to worldwide economic demand, sank. U.S. crude settled 1.32 percent down at $68.69 per barrel, and Brent was off 0.34 percent to $74.29. “While the prospect of tariffs on European cars has diminished, it hasn’t gone away completely, which means inevitably the market shifts its attention elsewhere,” said CMC Markets chief markets analyst Michael Hewson. “That elsewhere concerns what could happen next with respect to China, and the prospect of an escalation there,” he said.

2018-07-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday, weighed down by a drop in the U.S. equities market, but Brent still marked a weekly increase, supported by easing trade tensions and a temporary shutdown by Saudi Arabia of a key crude oil shipping lane. Brent crude futures fell 25 cents to settle at $74.29 a barrel, but notched a 1.8 percent weekly increase, its first increase in four weeks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 92 cents to settle at $68.69 a barrel, and marked a fourth week of declines, falling about 2.4 percent.  Depressing oil prices, U.S. stock markets broadly fell on Friday. Crude futures at times track with equities. “That could show some sign of a slowdown in the economy, which could in turn affect oil consumption,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. The oil market largely brushed off government data on Friday that said the U.S. economy grew in the second quarter at its fastest pace in nearly four years. “It was a strong number that suggests strong energy demand into the end of the year,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The reason why we’re not rallying off that is because it came in line with expectations, but when you’re running that kind of a GDP, that’s a lot of oil.” U.S. energy companies added three oil rigs in the week to July 27, the first time in the past three weeks that drillers have added rigs, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. Hedge funds trimmed their bullish wagers on U.S. crude, cutting their combined futures and options position in New York and London by 11,362 contracts to 412,289 in the week to July 24, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. That was the lowest level since late June, the data showed. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said on Friday the market remained volatile and responded to verbal interventions, adding that the market had priced in risks related to U.S. sanctions against Iran. He said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies were not discussing an option to boost production by more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC and other producers led by Russia agreed last month to ease production curbs. The deal effectively increases combined output by 1 million bpd, with Russia’s share at 200,000 bpd. Saudi Arabia earlier in the week said it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait, one of the world’s most important tanker routes, after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two ships in the waterway. Any move to block the strait would virtually halt oil shipments through Egypt’s Suez Canal and the SUMED crude pipeline linking the Red Sea and Mediterranean. An estimated 4.8 million bpd of crude oil and refined products flowed through the Bab al-Mandeb strait in 2016 toward Europe, the United States and Asia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A breakthrough in U.S.-EU trade talks also lent support to oil prices this week. U.S. President Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, reached a surprise agreement on Wednesday that alleviated the risk of an immediate trade war.

2018-07-27,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday his administration will look to boost the country’s crude oil production to 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.9 million bpd now. Lopez Obrador, elected in a landslide July 1 victory and who will take office on Dec. 1, has said he is committed to expanding Mexico’s oil and gas output, which has declined steadily over the past 14 years due to a lack of investment and natural depletion of oil fields. The leftist leader said he will look to revamp the nation’s six refineries so they are operating at full capacity within two years, and plans to build a new refinery in Dos Bocas in Mexico’s southern Tabasco state with an investment of 160 billion pesos ($8.6 billion) over three years. “With this new refinery and the rehabilitation of the six that already exist we’re going to make good on our campaign promise of stopping purchases of gasoline abroad and of lowering fuel prices by the middle of (my) six-year term,” he said. Mexico has imported an average of about 590,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline and another 232,000 bpd of diesel so far this year, almost all of it from the United States, as gasoline output at the country’s six refineries owned and operated by state-run Pemex [PEMX.UL] has halved since 2013, the first year of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto’s term. He tapped Rocio Nahle, who also won a Senate seat in the election, to be energy minister and named Octavio Romero Oropeza to be Pemex’s next chief executive. Lopez Obrador said his government would look to increase electricity production by revamping Mexico’s hydroelectric power stations.  “We’re going to start by modernizing hydroelectric plants because we have underutilized infrastructure. We’re going to generate electricity with the dams that currently exist,” he said. Lopez Obrador said he expects his administration to invest 175 billion pesos ($9.4 billion) next year to strengthen the energy sector.

2018-07-27,"July 27 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday vacated decisions by two federal agencies that allowed EQT Corp to build its $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia across federal land. The case is the latest victory in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit by the Sierra Club and other opponents of the pipeline. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington said the decision could delay the project’s in-service date until the fourth quarter of 2019. The Sierra Club and others challenged decisions by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service granting the pipeline rights of way across federal land. The court concluded certain aspects of the federal agencies’ decisions failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Forest Management Act. Officials at EQT were not immediately available for comment. The court remanded the case back to the BLM and Forest Service for further proceedings. Mountain Valley is one of several pipelines expected to enter service over the next year or two to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. On Thursday, EQT delayed the targeted completion date for Mountain Valley to the first quarter of 2019 from late 2018. In explaining the delay, the company cited legal challenges in the Fourth Circuit by the Sierra Club and others to a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that allowed the pipeline to cross streams and rivers in West Virginia, among other issues. The 303-mile (488-kilometer) pipeline is designed to deliver up to 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas to meet growing demand for the fuel for power generation and other uses in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.

2018-07-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has not instituted a policy of regime change or collapse in Iran, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday, saying the goal was still to curb what Washington sees as Iran’s threatening behaviour in the Middle East. Mattis made his comments after days of back-and-forth bellicose rhetoric between Iranian and U.S. officials, with President Donald Trump promising dire consequences for Iran if it continues to make threats toward the United States. Asked at the Pentagon whether the Trump administration had instituted a policy of regime change or collapse toward Iran, Mattis said, “There’s none that’s been instituted.” “We need them to change their behaviour on a number of threats that they can pose with their military, with their secret services, with their surrogates and with their proxies,” Mattis told reporters during an off-camera briefing. Mattis’ remarks were the most detailed by a senior administration official about U.S. policy toward Iran following high-level discussions at the White House on Thursday that included the topic of Iran. Since Trump’s decision in May to withdraw the United States from a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, Tehran’s clerical establishment has been under increasing U.S. pressure and the prospect of possible sanctions. As the tensions simmered, an Australian media report  appeared to suggest military action was imminent, saying Australian officials believed Washington was prepared to bomb Iran’s nuclear capability as early as next month. Mattis on Friday dismissed the report as “fiction.” “I’m confident that it’s not something that’s being considered right now,” Mattis told reporters, speaking at an on-camera event earlier in the day. Washington aims to force Tehran to end its nuclear programme and its support of militant groups in the Middle East, where Iran is involved in proxy wars from Yemen to Syria.     While the United States is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil beginning in November, Iran has warned of counter-measures and has threatened to block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are halted. The week of heated rhetoric between Washington and Tehran that was kicked off by a warning from Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday that hostile U.S. policies could lead to “the mother of all wars.” On Sunday night, Trump said in a Twitter posting written in all capital letters directed at Rouhani: “Never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence & death. Be cautious!” The harsh words evoked memories of Trump’s warnings to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year over his nuclear weapons programme, which raised fears of a major conflict. Those concerns have eased following a June summit between Trump and Kim.  Still, analysts warn that Iran is a far different challenge, and that stiff U.S. rhetoric could harden Iranian resolve. Iran’s Guards commanders have threatened to destroy U.S. military bases across the Middle East and target Israel, which Iran refuses to recognise, within minutes of being attacked. On Thursday, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, who heads the Quds Force of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, warned Trump, “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine.” Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Will Dunham",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-iran/update-2-u-s-not-pursuing-regime-change-collapse-in-iran-mattis-idUKL1N1UN139,27 Jul 2018,"The United States has not

2018-07-27,"(Adds rig count in Permian basin) July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added oil rigs for the first time in the past three weeks as drillers follow though on plans to spend more on exploration and production in anticipation of higher crude prices in 2018 than recent years. That move higher came despite recent declines in U.S. crude prices, which are on track to fall for a fourth week in a row this week on worries trade tensions between the U.S., China and Europe could hurt oil demand. Drillers added three oil rigs in the week to July 27, bringing the total count to 861, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the oil rig count rose three in July after losing one rig in June. More than half the total oil rigs are in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there increased by four this week, bringing the total to 479, the same as in early June and the highest since January 2015. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 766 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.11 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $68 for the balance of 2018 and about $65 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.7 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,033 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. That is the same as last week’s expectations. Since 1,048 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,009. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this month projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.8 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-07-27,"(Reuters) - U.S. independent oil refiner Phillips 66’s quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates on Friday as cheaper crude prices boosted refining margins by more than 45 percent. The company’s shares rose 2.4 percent to $118.76 in afternoon trading on Friday. Like its rivals Valero Energy Corp and Marathon Petroleum Corp, Phillips 66 processes heavy crude from countries including Venezuela and Canada into diesel, gasoline, jet fuel and other products. But booming U.S. shale production has forced refiners to retrofit the distillation process to handle more of the very light crude from the oilfields of Texas and North Dakota.  “With roughly one-third of their crude slate being light crude, I would suspect Phillips 66 benefited significantly during the quarter as did the other refiners,” said Jennifer Rowland, an energy analyst at Edward Jones. Phillips 66 said earnings from refining, its biggest business, increased to $910 million in the second quarter from $224 million a year earlier. On Thursday, Valero and Marathon Petroleum also topped Wall Street profit estimates as greater processing of cheap, light crude from West Texas boosted margins. The spread between U.S light crude and Brent crude has widened this year with a rise U.S. oil production, which lowered WTI prices, while Brent crude has climbed on Middle East tensions and OPEC supply cuts. U.S. crude production has been rising to record high levels since late last year, hitting a record 11 million barrels per day this month.  The widening of the Brent–WTI spread, larger discounts on U.S. inland crudes and improved heavy crude differentials all contributed to increased realized margins, Phillips 66 said. “We expect Western Canadian Select discounts to be attractive for at least the next 18 months and potentially longer,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland said on a post- earnings report call, adding that the refiner has no major turnaround overhauls planned at its nine refineries in the third quarter of 2018.  Prices for Canadian crude have also dropped against benchmark oil as a surge in production has led to transportation bottlenecks. Realized refining margin was $12.28 per barrel compared with $8.44 per barrel a year earlier, the company said in a statement. The refiner’s utilization rate, which is defined as the percentage of the total equipment or refinery involved in processing crude, reached 100 percent. Chief Financial Officer Kevin Mitchell said in a call with Wall Street analysts that capital expenditure for the rest of the year will be between $2 billion and $3 billion.  Earnings from the company’s midstream business also doubled to $202 million while profit at its chemicals business, which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics, rose nearly 34 percent.  The Houston, Texas-based company said its adjusted earnings rose to $1.32 billion, or $2.80 per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $569 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier.

2018-07-27,"July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added oil rigs for the first time in the past three weeks as drillers follow though on plans to spend more on exploration and production in anticipation of higher crude prices in 2018 than recent years. That move higher came despite recent declines in U.S. crude prices, which are on track to fall for a fourth week in a row this week on worries trade tensions between the U.S., China and Europe could hurt oil demand. Drillers added three oil rigs in the week to July 27, bringing the total count to 861, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the oil rig count rose three in July after losing one rig in June. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 766 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.11 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $68 for the balance of 2018 and about $65 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.7 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,033 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. That is the same as last week’s expectations. Since 1,048 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,009. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this month projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.8 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-07-27,"(Reuters) - An unplanned shutdown this summer of Canada’s Syncrude oil sands site has caused Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) to look to lessen its biggest refinery’s reliance on it, Imperial’s chief executive said on Friday.  Imperial holds a 25 percent stake in Syncrude, which is majority owned by Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO). It was forced to shut down last month after a power transformer failed.  Syncrude’s 360,000 barrel per day mine and oil upgrading site in northern Alberta accounts for 10 percent of Canada’s oil production. Nearly all of Imperial’s share of its output feeds the Strathcona refinery to produce gasoline and other products, accounting for one-third of the refinery’s oil supply, Chief Executive Rich Kruger said. “When Syncrude has an unplanned event, the supply folk at Strathcona do need to scramble, and unfortunately they have had to scramble the last few years more than they would like,” Kruger said on a conference call with analysts. Imperial is testing the suitability of other types of light and synthetic crude to determine if it should secure other supply agreements for the refinery, Kruger said. “The Syncrude events are more troubling for their impact on Strathcona. It does affect the ability to run that refinery at the highest level of reliability without disruptions.” Suncor said this week that some Syncrude production has been restored and full production may come online in September. Imperial’s second-quarter profit missed analyst estimates by a wide margin on Friday, hurt by higher-than-expected costs from planned maintenance at various projects.  Shares of the company, which is majority owned by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), dipped 1.3 percent in Toronto. The company had scheduled maintenance at several projects including a 72-day turnaround at Strathcona. But cost overruns hurt its bottom line, with analysts at Eight Capital saying the hit from maintenance of about C$250 million, or 31 Canadian cents a share, was bigger than expected. The company reported net profit of C$196 million ($149.9 million) or 24 Canadian cents per share in the quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, it earned 24 Canadian cents a share, while analysts expected a profit of 57 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gross production rose to 336,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 331,000 boepd a year earlier, but missed some analysts’ estimates.

2018-07-27,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), two of the world’s largest oil producers, reported quarterly profit on Friday that fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations. The disappointing results come as much of the U.S. oil industry has been recovering from a three-year downturn in the energy sector, bolstered by higher production and crude prices. Exxon’s troubles highlight ongoing issues the company has been having to boost operations, whereas Chevron’s miss was fueled by a slight rise in expenses that likely will not be repeated, analysts said.  Exxon shares fell 2.5 percent to $82.09 shortly after midday, while Chevron's recovered from an early drop and were up about 2 percent at $126.34. Both stocks are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI. The results were particularly weak at Exxon, which has been trying to boost operations in a bid to revive a stock price trading at about the same level it was a decade ago. “Exxon’s definitely sticking out like a sore thumb right now,” said Edward Jones energy analyst Brian Youngberg. “It’s just hard to find anything good in the quarter.” Despite rising oil prices CLc1LCOc1, Exxon’s production dropped 7 percent and it spent more than $600 million to upgrade refineries in France, Canada, Texas and Saudi Arabia. Exxon called the quarter a “challenging” one for its operations and “well below market expectations.”     Neil Chapman, an Exxon executive and member of the company’s management committee, said he is “not happy” about the ongoing refinery maintenance, adding there is “nothing systemic” about the repairs that would reveal weakness in the refining division.  “We are absolutely all over these reliability incidents,” Chapman said on a conference call with investors. Exxon earned 92 cents per share, while analysts expected earnings of $1.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.      At Chevron, oil production rose 2 percent and profit spiked, but higher corporate expenses surprised Wall Street. Still, the company announced a $3 billion stock buyback program, long awaited by Wall Street. “We believe annual share repurchases of $3 billion can be sustained over most reasonable price scenarios,” Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told investors on a conference call. Chevron earned $1.78 per share, while analysts expected $2.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), a key rival, posted second-quarter profit on Thursday far below forecasts due in part to weakness in refining.     British oil major BP Plc (BP.L) is set to report quarterly results next week. On Thursday it agreed to buy U.S. shale oil and gas assets from global miner BHP Billiton BLT.L(BHP.AX) for $10.5 billion.

2018-07-27,"July 27 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices rose this week as a heatwave gripped Japan and high temperatures swept across South Korea and parts of China boosting cooling demand though relief is set to come from new Russian supplies. Spot prices for September LNG-AS delivery in Asia were assessed at $9.75 per million British thermal units (Btu), up 25 cents from the previous week. Contrary to previous forecasts, temperatures in Japan stayed above average in a prolonged heatwave that killed dozens of people. It also prompted electric utilities to fire up mothballed oil and gas-fired power plants left on standby. The heat hit South Korea too but any increase in gas demand may be muted by the start-up of the 950-megawatt Hanul No.2 nuclear reactor, which is expected to by fully operational by Sunday. LNG imports into South Korea hit record levels in the first half of the year but such volumes will not be sustainable as anticipated nuclear start-ups will leave an average of only six reactors offline over the rest of the year. The second train at Novatek’s Arctic Russian operations in Yamal has started operations, one trader said. Novatek said last year that the second train would start operations in the third quarter of this year. “The start of Yamal’s Train 2 is easing the pain for buyers but demand due to the heatwave seems to be picking up,” said one trader. Papua New Guinea launched a tender offering a cargo for Aug. 22-29 and the bids were seen to be bullish although the result is not yet known, the trader said. However, Russia’s Sakhalin II cargo offered in the first half of September was sold to a shareholder of the plant for an estimated $9.70 per mmBtu. Another trader cited a potential transaction range of $9.65-$9.70 per mmBtu. He sees September prices around the $9.75 per mmBtu mark. Aside from Yamal, traders were also waiting on new supplies from Japan’s Inpex, which expects its Ichthys plant in Australia to start up in September. European spot prices so far remain uncompetitive with Asia in drawing away Qatari cargoes, as storage inventories recover across the continent.

2018-07-27,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday that a private meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week ended with an agreement that the two countries would discuss a nuclear power deal in the future. Ramaphosa has put nuclear expansion on the back burner since taking office in February, saying it is too expensive, and has focused instead on pledges to revive the economy and crack down on corruption. His scandal-plagued predecessor, Jacob Zuma, had championed a deal to dramatically increase South Africa’s nuclear capacity despite concern from ratings agencies that it would deal a further blow to the country’s already strained public finances. “We have huge financial constraints, we are not able to proceed with a nuclear build programme,” Ramaphosa told a news conference at the end of the BRICS summit.  “President Putin was quite relaxed about this. He said you deal with your issues and when the situation changes we can keep talking about this. And that’s where we left it. There’s no other hidden agenda,” Ramaphosa added. Kremlin-controlled Rosatom, a clear leader in the global nuclear industry, was one of the front runners for the massive nuclear project championed by Zuma.  A Rosatom executive told Reuters on Thursday that the company was “still interested” in helping South Africa expand its nuclear capacity.

2018-07-27,"* Global stocks set for best run of daily gains since Feb * U.S. growth fastest in nearly 4 years but figure was expected * U.S. Treasury yields lower ahead of central bank meetings (Updates to U.S. stock market open; Changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - World shares were little changed on Friday as mixed corporate profits and economic data that met expectations struggled to offset concerns over trade and central bank policy, though a key global equity index was still set for a fourth week of gains. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up just 0.07 percent and set for a sixth session of gains, a run not seen since February, as well as its fourth weekly advance. From Europe to the United States, investors surveyed a host of corporate results and rewarded the strong performances, from the Spanish bank BBVA - which gained 1.4 percent, to Amazon.com Inc, which touched a record high after its profit doubled Wall Street estimates. Amazon shares were up nearly 2 percent in late morning trading. Other companies were punished for disappointing results, including Intel Corp, which was down 8 percent in late morning trading after its fast-growing data center business missed estimates. Data showed the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter, as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs before they took effect in early July. “We’re getting good growth and still very low inflation,” said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at French bank Natixis. But the economic growth figures were widely expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.92 points, or 0.04 percent, to 25,536.99, the S&P 500 lost 5.61 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,831.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 44.29 points, or 0.56 percent, to 7,807.89. Bonds did not sell off, either, as some investors had expected on strongly positive news. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields slipped from their highest level in 1-1/2 months and last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.9653 percent, from 2.975 percent late on Thursday. Rates markets await an important week of meetings at the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan (BoJ). Earlier speculation that the BoJ might tweak its policies rattled global markets. That bank’s aggressive efforts to keep yields in its own markets low has pushed investors to rates markets elsewhere, keeping a lid on yields in the United States and beyond. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield hit one-year highs even as the BOJ conducted special, unlimited buying for the second time this week that kept a lid on the bonds from shooting higher in yield. Helped by the yield spike, the Japanese yen strengthened 0.23 percent versus the greenback at 110.97 per dollar. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback fell 0.07 percent. U.S. disagreements with its trading partners slipped from the headlines a bit after an agreement on Wednesday to negotiate with the European Union, but Chinese markets still showed scars of the unresolved rifts. The main Shanghai index closed down 0.4 percent amid the still-unresolved standoff between the U.S. and China on trade. “While the prospect of tariffs on European cars has diminished, it hasn’t gone away completely, which means inevitably the market shifts its attention elsewhere,” said CMC Markets chief markets analyst Michael Hewson. “That elsewhere concerns what could happen next with respect to China, and the prospect of an escalation there,” he said.

2018-07-27,"ADEN (Reuters) - A Saudi-led coalition launched heavy air strikes on Yemen’s main port city of Hodeidah on Friday, in an apparent resumption of military operations on the city after the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement attacked two Saudi oil tankers, residents said. The coalition on July 1 halted an attack on the Houthi-held city to aid U.N. efforts at a political solution that would avert an all-out assault on the Red Sea port, which the United Nations fears could trigger a famine throughout the country. Residents said coalition warplanes had begun their bombardment after midnight, attacking a Houthi military police camp in the city centre, a plastics factory north of the city, and the districts of Zubaid and al-Tahita to the south. The Houthi’s al-Masirah TV said on Twitter that the coalition hit a radio station in the city and a fishing pier. “Coalition warplanes conducted two strikes on a fishing dock and market in Hodeidah, and the yard of the Hodeidah radio building which was damaged by the shrapnel,” one resident said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Saudi Arabia said on Thursday that it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait until maritime transit through the waterway is safe, following an attack on two Saudi oil tankers on Wednesday. The Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Coalition forces quickly retook the southern city of Aden and smaller coastal towns, but since then neither side has made much progress in the war, widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The alliance says capturing Hodeidah would cut off the main supply line of the Houthis and force the group to the negotiating table, but it has made no major gains since it launched the offensive on June 12. U.N. special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, on Friday left Sanaa after another round of talks with the Houthis as part of weeks of shuttle diplomacy between the warring parties. The United Nations fears that cutting off Hodeidah port, a lifeline for millions, may trigger a famine in Yemen where around 8.4 million people are believed to be facing starvation.  The Houthis have offered to hand over management of the port to the world body, according to the United Nations, but the coalition says that the group must quit the western coast.

The Grand Renaissance Dam on the River Nile is the centrepiece of the country’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter. The government has touted the project as a symbol of its ability to move the country forward.

2018-07-27,"MELBOURNE/LONDON (Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) has agreed to buy U.S. shale oil and gas assets from global miner BHP Billiton BLT.L (BHP.AX) for $10.5 billion (8 billion pounds), expanding the British oil major’s footprint in some of the nation’s most productive oil basins in its biggest deal in nearly 20 years. The acquisition of about 500,000 producing acres marks a turning point for BP since the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs. “This is a transformational acquisition for our (onshore U.S.) business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP’s distinctive portfolio,” BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement.  In a further sign of the upturn in its fortunes, BP said it would increase its quarterly dividend for the first time in nearly four years and announced a $6 billion share buyback, to be partly funded by selling some upstream assets. BP’s London-listed shares were trading 0.4 percent higher at 1400 GMT, compared with a 0.8 percent gain in the broader European energy index .SXEP. The sale ends a disastrous seven-year foray by BHP into  shale on which the company effectively blew up $19 billion of shareholders’ funds. Investors led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have been pressing the mining company to jettison the onshore assets for the past 18 months. BHP put the business up for sale last August. The sale price was better than the $8 billion to $10 billion that analysts had expected, and investors were pleased that BHP planned to return the proceeds to shareholders. “It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,” said Craig Evans, co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund. BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20 billion with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp at the peak of the oil boom. It spent a further $20 billion developing the assets, but suffered as gas and oil prices collapsed, triggering massive writedowns. The world’s biggest miner said it would record a further one-off shale charge of about $2.8 billion post-tax in its 2018 financial year results. The deal, BP’s biggest since it bought oil company Atlantic Richfield Co in 1999, will increase its U.S. onshore oil and gas resources by 57 percent. BP will acquire BHP’s unit holding Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian Basin shale assets for $10.5 billion, giving it “some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S.,” the company said. (For a graphic on U.S. oil production, click: tmsnrt.rs/2K1EjdY)  Its bid beat rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) for the assets, which have combined production of 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d)and 4.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources. The acquisition could push BP’s total U.S. production to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in two years and close to 1.4 million boe/d by 2025, said Maxim Petrov, a Wood Mackenzie analyst.  “The Permian acreage offers the biggest longer-term upside, with some of the best breakevens in the play, well below $50 per barrel,” said Petrov.  The deal would turn the onshore United States into “a heartland business in the company,” Bernard Looney, BP’s head of upstream, said in a call with analysts. It will bring BP into the oil-rich Permian basin in West Texas, where production has surged in recent years. With it, BP’s onshore oil production will jump from 10,000 barrels per day to 200,000 bpd by the mid-2020s, Looney said.      BP said the transaction would boost its earnings and cash flow per share and it would still be able to maintain its gearing within a 20-30 percent range. The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2.5 percent to 10.25 cents a share, the first rise in 15 quarters. Meanwhile, a unit of Merit Energy Company will buy BHP Billiton Petroleum (Arkansas) Inc and the Fayetteville assets, for $0.3 billion. Tribeca’s Evans welcomed the clean exit for cash, rather than asset swaps which BHP had flagged as a possibility. “It leaves the company good scope to focus on their far better offshore oil business,” he said. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the company had delivered on its promise to get value for its shale assets, while the sale was consistent with a long-term plan to simplify and strengthen its portfolio. BHP (BHP.AX) shares rose 2.3 percent after the announcement, outperforming the broader market  and rival Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L). BP said it would pay the $10.5 billion in instalments over six months from the date of completion, with $5.25 billion of the consideration to be raised through the sale of new shares.

The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent in London and was set for a sixth straight session of gains, a run not seen since February, and its fourth straight weekly gain. European shares rose, with consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, construction groups Saint Gobain and Vinci and bank BBVA gaining after results, lifting the STOXX 600 0.4 percent. European auto stocks extended to Thursday’s gains. Futures indicated a positive open on Wall Street. Trade tensions had not disappeared altogether from investors’ radars however. Chinese shares lagged an uptick in Asian shares, with the main Shanghai index down 0.4 percent on the day. Traders attributed this to a still-unresolved standoff between the U.S. and China on trade. “To see the way markets reacted early yesterday...it was almost as if the EU and the U.S. were best buddies again,” CMC Markets chief markets analyst Michael Hewson said. “Nothing could be further from the truth, and while the prospect of tariffs on European cars has diminished, it hasn’t gone away completely, which means inevitably the market shifts its attention elsewhere. That elsewhere concerns what could happen next with respect to China, and the prospect of an escalation there,” he said. So far this month, MSCI China A shares have fallen 2.6 percent, taking the biggest hit from U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats on tariffs among other issues in major markets, compared with 3.3-percent gains in the MSCI ACWI. The Chinese yuan eased, on course to mark its seventh week of losses, although those losses were cushioned by Chinese state banks’ swapping of dollars for yuan in the forward market. Traders said they may also have been selling spot dollars. Borrowing costs in the euro zone’s biggest economy, Germany, held below six-week highs, a day after the European Central Bank’s president backed market expectations for a rise in interest rates late next year. Most 10-year bond yields in the bloc were steady ahead of second quarter U.S. economic growth data due out at 1230 GMT that many economists expect to show a strong reading. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield edged up to 2.9880 percent, its highest level in 1-1/2 months, on receding worries about trade tensions. “In fixed income markets, the main question today is whether the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield...will break the 3 percent mark in the wake of the U.S. GDP release,” a UniCredit note said. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield slipped off a one-year high after the BOJ conducted special, unlimited buying for the second time this week. Most market players expect central bankers meeting on Monday to stop short of making immediate policy changes and to say instead that they will study ways to reduce the side-effects of the prolonged easing, such as hits to banks’ profits. In currencies, the dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 111.17 yen as the yen got a lift from a rise in Japanese bond yields. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was up 0.1 percent at 94.863, hitting a five-day high. The euro traded down 0.1 percent at $1.1630, having fallen 0.73 percent on Thursday after the ECB signalled no change in its timetable to move away from ultra low rates or end its bond purchase program. In commodities, oil prices edged lower in quiet trading after three days of gains, but took support from Saudi Arabia halting crude transport through a major shipping lane, and falling U.S. inventories. Brent crude futures traded down 0.1 percent at $74.49 per barrel, but were set for their first weekly increase in four. Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,219.03 an ounce. Copper edged up, again boosted by receding trade tensions. It is on course to gain 2.4 percent on the London Metal Exchange and 3.7 percent on the Shanghai Futures Exchange this week, which would mark its first weekly rise in seven on both bourses after fears of a global trade war dragged prices down.

2018-07-27,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s biggest utility Enel (ENEI.MI) is ready to discuss the sale of its stake in solar joint venture EF Solare to partner F2i, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Enel and F2i currently own 50 percent each of EF Solare, Italy’s biggest solar power operator which could be worth more than 1.5 billion euros (1.33 billion pounds). In a statement on Thursday F2i said it had expressed its intention to acquire Enel’s stake. “Enel is ready to talk about a sale under the right conditions,” the source said on condition of anonymity. Enel declined to comment.    In a report on Friday broker Mediobanca said it estimated EF Solare could be worth around 1.58 billion euros ($1.8 billion) including debt, and suggested Enel could receive 290 million euros cash. Infrastructure fund F2i, partly owned by state lender CDP, agreed on Thursday to buy Terra Firma’s solar farms in Italy for 1.3 billion euros in a move that will make it Europe’s third largest solar player.  F2i and Enel had originally placed a joint bid for the Terra Firma portfolio but Enel pulled out. A source familiar with the matter said Enel, one of the world’s largest renewable energy players, was interested in investing in green projects that could offer higher returns than the Terra Firma portfolio.

2018-07-27,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Chinese investors signed agreements to build a $10 billion metallurgical complex in South Africa during President Xi Jinping’s state visit this week and hope to start construction next year, an executive involved in the project and a provincial official told Reuters. South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa said at a joint news conference with Xi on Tuesday that China had committed to invest $14.7 billion in the South African economy, but neither leader mentioned the $10 billion complex.     Ramaphosa is on a mission to kick-start economic growth after a decade of stagnation and is targeting $100 billion in new investment over five years. The complex, which is still in the planning stage and envisages building a stainless steel plant, a ferrochrome plant and a silicomanganese plant, is a much-needed vote of confidence in the sputtering South African economy. Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said on Tuesday that China was considering a metallurgical project in a special economic zone (SEZ), but he did not reveal the scale of the project or timeframe. The executive involved in the project, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said memoranda on the complex were signed before Xi and Ramaphosa gave news conference on Tuesday. “The investors for the SEZ project were in the room when Ramaphosa and Xi spoke to the press,” the executive said. Richard Zitha, a project executive at the Musina-Makhado SEZ where the complex will be based, said the project was being led by Chinese state-owned companies, but he declined to name them. He said the Chinese investors would look for Black Economic Empowerment partners to comply with South African rules designed to address racial disparities more than two decades after the end of apartheid.  The investors were open to investors from other countries joining at a later stage, he said. “The investors have been in South Africa for around a week and have visited mines to look for inputs for the project,” Zitha said. The Musina-Makhado SEZ is in Limpopo province close to South Africa’s borders with Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana. The SEZ plans to house plants with a capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum of stainless steel, 3 million tonnes per annum of ferrochrome and 500,000 tonnes per annum of silicomanganese. Those capacity targets are subject to change and will be finalised by the end of the year, the executive said. A coal-fired power plant, coking plant and coal washery will be built alongside the metallurgical plants, a presentation prepared for investors showed. Some of the steel output for the complex has been earmarked for export to China, while other products would be sold to countries in southern Africa, the executive said. South Africa is already a major exporter of metal alloys to China. Investors are hoping to receive the necessary environmental approvals by the end of March and would then start construction, Zitha said.

2018-07-27,"(Adds second-quarter details, estimates, share move) July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. independent oil refiner Phillips 66’s quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates on Friday, helped by cheap crude prices that boosted refining margins. The company’s shares rose 1.8 percent to $118.20 in premarket trading. Phillips 66 said earnings from refining, its biggest business, increased to $910 million in the second quarter from $224 million a year earlier. The widening of the Brent–WTI spread, larger discounts on U.S. inland crudes and improved heavy crude differentials all contributed to increased realized margins, the company said.

2018-07-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - A 12-hour strike at Total’s (TOTF.PA) offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea will go ahead as planned on July 30, a spokesman for Britain’s Unite the Union said on Friday, adding that no further talks with Total were currently planned. Around 40 union members started strike action last Monday, stopping work for 24 hours at the Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar platforms in the North Sea, but stored crude cushioned against  any immediate oil supply disruption. Unite the Union, Britain’s largest labour union, has scheduled further 24-hour stoppages on Aug. 6 and 20 and a 12-hour strike on Aug. 13 if it is unable to reach agreement about new rotas with Total. The fields account for about 10 percent of Britain’s gas output, while their oil production contributes about 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the Forties and Brent Blend crude streams. Forties and Brent Blend are key oil grades used to set the dated Brent benchmark that prices more than half of the world’s oil trades. A strike at Total’s Shetland gas plant planned for Monday has been suspended to allow discussions to continue, the spokesman said.

In the poll taken in the past week, analysts and economists’ forecasts showed a median of 2.1 percent growth for Nigeria, accelerating to 3.0 percent next year. That was a significant downgrade from the previous poll taken three months ago, which showed Africa’s largest economy expanding 2.6 percent this year after a lacklustre 0.8 percent in 2017. “Upcoming elections and the associated high-wire politics already underway would instigate caution on the part of economic stakeholders,” said Rafiq Raji, chief economist at Macroafricaintel in Lagos, who expects the economy to slow in the next few quarters. “Business and investment decisions are thus likely to be postponed till after the 2019 elections,” he added. Nigerians vote in February. On Tuesday, 16 senators quit President Muhammadu Buhari’s ruling party and the country’s third most senior politician said he might follow suit, in a blow to the leader who is seeking re-election next year. This comes at a tough time for the economy. Growth slowed in the first quarter of 2018 for the first time since the country pulled out of recession last year as the non-oil sector struggled. Fellow heavyweight South Africa also suffered its worst quarterly contraction in nine years, in a reminder to investors of the huge challenge President Cyril Ramaphosa faces to deliver long term economic growth. A separate survey earlier this month showed South African GDP is expected to grow 1.5 percent this year. However, Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago shocked markets last week when he revealed the Bank projects growth at only 1.2 percent, slower than last year. It is a different story for Kenya, east Africa’s biggest economy, where analysts’ forecasts showed a median of 5.5 percent growth this year despite its debt problems. That was unchanged from a poll taken three months ago. Growth is expected to accelerate next year to 5.9 percent, slightly faster than in the last survey. Raji attributed this to the fact that Kenya is now an oil producer, even though robust production levels are a long way off. He cautioned that the recent suspension of production by Tullow on security grounds could cause problems. Tullow aims to produce the first oil from its $2.9 billion Kenya project by 2021, allowing the country to export crude. However, protests and security problems have halted a pilot scheme which trucks around 600 barrels of oil per day to a storage facility in Mombasa. Major African economies are also at risk to what may be more difficult times for the world economy. Reuters polls of several hundred economists taken this month show global economic activity remains solid but has already passed its peak, with protectionist trade policies likely to slow activity significantly. “(The) knock-on impact of higher trade tariffs will weigh on inflation and consumption expenditure in advanced economies,” said Gaimin Nonyane, head of economic research at Ecobank Group. “Extended risk-off sentiment is also a downside risk to price levels and growth in developing countries.” But many sub-Saharan African economies have been relatively insulated from the challenges facing larger global economies. In Ethiopia, for example, growth has averaged nearly 10 percent for the past decade, albeit from a very low base. For other stories from the Reuters global long-term

2018-07-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States signaled on Thursday it is set to push ahead on trade talks with Canada and Mexico after agreeing to suspend hostilities over tariffs with Europe in a fragile deal that may clear the way for renewed pressure on China. A surprise deal struck on Wednesday will see Washington suspend the imposition of any new tariffs on the European Union, including a proposed 25 percent levy on auto imports, and hold talks over tariffs on imports of European steel and aluminum. The deal boosted share markets initially, and U.S. industrial shares were stronger on Thursday as fears of a trade war with Europe ebbed.   Both sides claimed victory in the deal, reached by Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Washington. In return for the talks and a suspension of auto tariffs, the EU will import more soybeans and energy from the United States. A White House official told Reuters that Juncker had shown greater flexibility than expected in the talks and that while there was no deadline for an overall deal, Trump retained the power to impose tariffs if progress was not made.  One key aspect of the agreement, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity, was that the two sides had agreed to work together to tackle China’s market abuses.  “They want to work together with us on China and they want to help us reform the WTO (World Trade Organization),” said the official, adding that the Europeans came into the talks “with a real positive spirit”. Trump has announced a series of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports in a bid to halt a Chinese surge in high-technology industries that threatens to displace U.S. dominance. Both the U.S. and the EU charge that Chinese companies steal company secrets. On the North American Free Trade Agreement talks with Canada and Mexico, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he was “hopeful that we’ll have an agreement in principal in the near future.” “Whether it’s one deal or two deals, so long as we get the right agreement, we’re indifferent,” Mnuchin told CNBC. Trump and officials from his administration said the EU had given ground by agreeing to import more American goods and to hold talks on tariff reductions including on cars, an industry in which Trump has accused Europe of imposing heavy duties.  EU officials said little had been given away by Juncker and that Europe had emerged as the winner by getting Trump to defer the threatened car tariffs which would have hit European carmakers hard. The deal was hailed by commentators in the United States and Europe for drawing back from an escalation in a trade war that had threatened to take the world back to the kind of protectionism not seen since the 1930s, although some cautioned the relief may be only temporary. French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to challenge the deal, saying on Thursday he would not discuss agriculture in talks with the United States. If it holds, the US-EU pact could allow both to focus on China, whose economic rise threatens both. Lawmakers in Washington on Thursday passed legislation to slow Chinese investment in U.S. companies. In Europe, alarm bells have been sounded over China’s growing economic influence there. “U.S. and EU will be allied in the fight against China, which has broken the world trading system, in effect,” Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said. “President Juncker made it very clear yesterday that he intended to help us, President Trump, on the China problem.” In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said trade disputes should be resolved through talks on the basis of mutual respect and equality. “Engaging is unilateralism or protectionism is not the way out,” Geng said, when asked about Kudlow’s comments. Since taking office last year, Trump has implemented policies to restrict what he sees as unfair competition from other countries. He tore up an agreement to join a Pacific trade pact, has threatened to pull out of NAFTA, and imposed steel and aluminum tariffs aimed at China. In an effort to rein in China’s high technology industries that he charges have stolen intellectual property from American companies, Trump has ramped up threats of tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports from China to $450 billion after China retaliated with its own duties on imports from the United States. The impact has fallen mainly on U.S. farmers and Republican party lawmakers. A move by Trump to offset farmers’ losses with a $12 billion aid package drew criticism with farmers saying  they wanted access to markets rather than subsidies.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a veteran of trade negotiations from former President Ronald Reagan’s administration in the 1980s who is Trump’s top trade official, told lawmakers in Washington that the United States could not afford to capitulate to China economically. “I don’t think it’s a stupid fight,” Lighthizer said of the trade battle with China in heated exchanges in the Senate. “I don’t know a single person that has read this report that thinks it’s a stupid fight to say China should not be able to come in and steal the future of American industry.” A more conciliatory tone emerged from Mnuchin, who told CNBC the United States was willing to reopen trade talks with China if Beijing was willing to make “serious changes,” as he said the EU had indicated it was willing to do. In May, the United States and China initially appeared willing to strike a deal that would see China reduce its $350 billion surplus in the trading of goods by buying more U.S. agriculture and energy products.  That deal fell apart quickly and has been replaced with a rising tally of tariff retaliation that has led to Trump threatening tariffs on almost everything the United States imports from China. China has threatened to retaliate dollar for dollar, and its refusal to sign off on regulatory approval caused a $44 billion deal from Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) to fall apart, a move that showed U.S. companies were being targeted unfairly, Mnuchin said.

2018-07-27,"COPENHAGEN/MADRID (Reuters) - Wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa (SGREN.MC) warned on Friday that trade tensions would drive up costs, after reporting a fall in quarterly sales and profits due to lower turbine sales and pricing. The U.S.-Chinese trade row adds to challenges facing wind turbine makers such as Siemens Gamesa, Vestas (VWS.CO) and General Electric (GE.N), which already face pressure from tighter markets and the phasing out of government subsidies. The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports worth $34 billion, moves that have driven up the cost of steel, the main raw material for wind turbine parts, and other components, Siemens Gamesa said. The company said it was monitoring the impact on product costs and supply chain decisions on next year’s earnings. U.S. costs would rise by 2 to 4 percent depending on the product and whether further tariffs would be implemented, Chief Financial Officer Miguel Angel Lopez told an call with analysts. He said the company was working to reduce the impact on margins by “optimizing our supply chains.” Chief Executive Markus Tacke said it was not likely that the firm could pass on all the cost increases to customers. “We are operating in very competitive markets,” he said. “The likelihood that we can pass through these effects into prices, I would consider this one rather low.” Shares in Siemens Gamesa traded down 5.2 percent at 1000 GMT, while rival Vestas traded down 5.0 percent. The company said there would be no impact on 2018 earnings as the extra costs were covered by hedging and supplier contracts. The firm kept its target for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of 7-8 percent and revenues of 9.0 billion to 9.6 billion euros for the 12 months ending Sept. 30. Average selling prices continued to fall at double-digit rates compared to last year, but Siemens Gamesa said it saw prices stabilizing in the order intake, marking the third consecutive quarter of steady prices. Revenue fell 21 percent to 2.14 billion euros ($2.49 billion) in the April-June quarter, while adjusted EBIT fell 26 percent to 156 million euros due to lower prices.  Siemens Gamesa, majority owned by Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) after the merger of its wind power business with Spain’s Gamesa, said order intake for its onshore business was 1,660 megawatts (MW) in the quarter, up from 693 MW a year earlier but below the 2,464 MW in the preceding quarter. The firm’s total order backlog hit a record 23.23 billion euros.  Siemens Gamesa, which counts Spain’s Iberdrola among its shareholders, overtook Danish rival Vestas last year to become the world’s biggest wind turbine maker in terms of sold turbine capacity last year, consultancy firms GlobalData and MAKE said.

2018-07-27,"* Engie energy trading gains offset nuclear losses * Core EBITDA earnings in line with expectations * Engie says monitoring EDP (Adds detail on strategy day, EDP, TAG, share price) PARIS, July 27 (Reuters) - Shares in Engie rose more than 2 percent on Friday after the French utility confirmed its 2018 earnings outlook despite a series of outages at its Belgian nuclear plants, while posting virtually flat first-half revenue. Engie had warned in mid-June that unscheduled outages at the nuclear reactors would have an impact of 250 million euros on its 2018 earnings, though it said it was confident that other areas of the business could compensate. Engie shares were 2.5 percent higher in morning trade, making it one of the top gainers on the CAC 40 index, which was up 0.15 percent. Engie’s core earnings rose 1.3 percent to 5.1 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in the first half, in line with forecasts but slower than the 3 percent increase seen in the first quarter, partly due to strong hydro power in France. The Benelux contribution to core earnings nearly halved to 133 million euros from 242 million, but that was more than offset by Engie’s global energy trading division, which swung from a 120 million euro loss in the first half of 2017 into a 124 million euro profit. Asked whether Engie was interested in Portuguese EDPR’s U.S. wind portfolio, Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher told analysts that it was actively monitoring the situation. Sources told Reuters last month that Chinese utility China Three Gorges (CTG), which is bidding to take control of Portuguese utility EDP, has held talks with European utilities to gauge interest in buying the U.S assets of EDP’s renewables unit EDPR, as it fears the U.S. will object to Chinese ownership. Kocher also said Engie hopes to restart talks about possibly buying Brazilian gas pipeline company Transportadora Associada de Gas (TAG) by end September or early October. Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) said earlier this month it was suspending major asset sales after a Supreme Court justice ruled that Congress must approve any privatizations. TAG would fit within Kocher’s strategy of focusing Engie more on regulated infrastructure businesses. Engie has just completed a 2016-18 transformation plan that included the sale of 16.2 billion euros worth of mainly fossil fuel-related assets and nearly 15 billion euros of investments in renewable energy, grids and energy services. Kocher said that Engie had moved back a planned strategy day to end February 2019 from December 2018 as the company wants to base its new strategy on 2018 closing figures. Engie’s first-half revenue edged up 0.1 percent to 30.2 billion euros ($35.2 billion). Current operating income rose 1.4 percent to 3.1 billion euros but net income fell 25 percent to 0.9 billion euros, partly because of a 200 million euro loss on the upstream and midstream LNG business that Engie has agreed to sell to Total. Engie confirmed its 2018 earnings guidance for core earnings of 9.3-9.7 billion euros and a 0.75 euro per share dividend. The French state owns 24.1 percent of Engie, but has said it might sell part of its stake in coming months. $1 = 0.8587 euros

2018-07-27,"* Exports of medium-sweet Buzios may start in Oct -sources * Petrobras hires trader in Singapore to market oil to China * Chart of Brazil oil flows to China: tmsnrt.rs/2JPyQXp By Florence Tan and Alexandra Alper SINGAPORE/RIO DE JANEIRO, July 27 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled energy company Petrobras plans to push more crude oil to top importer China by marketing a new medium-sweet grade that could be shipped from October, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Petrobras expects to start pumping pre-salt oil from new platforms in the fourth quarter that would add to output from Latin America’s biggest producer and lift its exports. The new supply could enlarge Brazil’s market share in China as buyers there cut oil imports from the United States following Beijing’s announcement it would impose tariffs on U.S. crude in retaliation against similar moves by Washington. “Petrobras’ oil export curve is increasing and China is currently the company’s main market,” a Petrobras spokesman said in an e-mail. “With (Chinese) refineries’ growing interest in buying oil directly from producers ... Petrobras will grow its presence with these refiners.” Petrobras started production in April at its wholly-owned Buzios pre-salt field in the Santos basin from platform P-74, located about 200 km off the Rio de Janeiro coast in water depths of 2,000 metres, according to the company’s website. Two more platforms, P-75 and P-76, are to come online in the fourth quarter. Total Buzios output is expected to grow to 750,000 bpd by 2021, once an additional four platforms come online, the company said. Buzios crude has API gravity of 28.4 degrees and contains about 0.31 percent sulphur, similar in quality to Brazil’s Lula crude, one of the most popular oils in China, the company said. The new supply could help lift Petrobras’ crude oil exports, which dropped 53.8 percent in June from a year ago to 696,000 barrels per day (2.86 million tonnes) as the company hiked its refinery output. Petrobras’ overall production in June stood at 2.03 million bpd, down 1.5 percent from May. Brazil’s oil liquids output, including biofuels, is expected to rise by 200,000 bpd to 3.5 million bpd in 2019, after holding steady in 2018, according to consultancy Energy Aspects. China’s demand for low-sulphur crude, such as oil from Angola and Brazil, jumped over the past two years after its independent refiners, also known as teapots, were allowed to import crude. That has moved Brazil up two notches since 2017 to fifth on China’s supplier list, with 657,000 bpd in the first quarter this year, according to data from China customs. The teapots’ oil imports from Brazil more than doubled in the first half of 2018 to 350,000 bpd compared with the same period a year ago, according to Beijing consultancy SIA Energy. More than half of Brazil’s shipments to China went through ports in Shandong province, home to most of China’s independent refiners, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. Petrobras also supplied the first crude cargo to Chinese chemical producer Hengli Group for the start-up of its new refinery in northeast China in the fourth quarter of this year. New Brazilian crude Mero was also delivered to Shandong in June. Petrobras has expanded its trading team in Singapore to step up marketing efforts in China, the two sources familiar with the matter said. The company has appointed a business development person from within the company and hired a crude trader from a Chinese refiner who will join in September, the sources said. “In order to improve market share in China, and considering the entry of the teapots in the international market, Petrobras considers that it is necessary to have a professional fluent in Mandarin for the specific development of this market,” the company said, without confirming the new hire. Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec bought a third of China’s Brazilian oil imports in the first half of 2018, up 13 percent from a year ago, SIA Energy analyst Seng Yick Tee said. “Sinopec and independents have the appetite for additional crude imports from Brazil, and the potential tariffs on U.S. crude is one of the reasons,” Tee said. Trade flow data on Eikon, however, shows Brazilian exports to Shandong look set to drop in the third quarter - before the additional Buzios platforms start up - as poor margins and tighter credit have forced teapots to cut runs. The tough environment is expected to push independents to seek more competitive oil supplies, Tee said. Other sellers of Brazilian crude include Royal Dutch Shell and Equinor. State-owned China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and CNOOC Ltd also have equity stakes in Brazilian oilfields. Reporting by Florence Tan in SINGAPORE and Alexandra Alper in

2018-07-27,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Ebbing trade tensions set stocks up for 4th weekly gain on trot * China shares underperform, yuan eases * Euro zone borrowing costs hold below 6-week highs * Dollar hits 5-day highs, euro eases, yen firms * Oil prices ease By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday as strong company earnings reports and an easing of transatlantic trade tensions on an agreement between the United States and Europe this week to try to cut trade barriers boosted investor confidence. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent after the start of European trading. It was set for a sixth straight sessions of gains, a run not seen since February, and was set for its fourth weekly gain on the trot. European stocks inched up in early trade and were set to end the week at six-week highs, helped by easing fears over U.S. tariffs and good company results. Shares rose in consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser , construction groups Saint Gobain and Vinci and bank BBVA following well-received results, lifting the STOXX 600 up 0.1 percent. European automaker stocks added to Thursday’s gains. Trade tensions had not disappeared altogether from investors radars however. Chinese shares underperformed an uptick in Asian shares, with the main Shanghai index in the red for most of the day. Traders attributed this to a still unresolved standoff between the U.S. and China on trade. “To see the way markets reacted early yesterday, and the DAX in particular, which closed at a five-week high, it was almost as if the EU and the U.S. were best buddies again,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “Nothing could be further from the truth, and while the prospect of tariffs on European cars has diminished, it hasn’t gone away completely, which means inevitably the market shifts its attention elsewhere. That elsewhere concerns what could happen next with respect to China, and the prospect of an escalation there.” So far this month, MSCI China A shares have fallen 2.6 percent, taking the biggest hit from U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats on tariffs and other issues among major markets, compared to 3.3 percent gains in the MSCI ACWI. The Chinese yuan eased, on course to mark its seventh week of losses, although the losses were cushioned by Chinese state banks’ swapping of dollars for yuan in the forward market. Traders suspected they had also been selling spot dollars. Borrowing costs in the euro zone’s biggest economy, Germany, held below six-week highs, a day after the European Central Bank’s president backed market expectations for a rise in interest rates late next year. Most 10-year bond yields in the bloc were steady ahead of second quarter U.S. economic growth data due at 1230 GMT that many economists expect to show a strong reading. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield edged up to 2.9880 percent, its highest level in 1-1/2 months, on receding worries about trade tensions. Japan’s 10-year government bond yield slipped off a one-year high after the BOJ conducted special, unlimited buying for the second time this week. Most market players expect central bankers meeting on Monday to stop short of making immediate policy changes and to say instead that they will study ways to reduce the side-effects of the prolonged easing, such as hits to banks’ profits. In currencies, the dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 111.13 yen as the yen got a lift from a rise in Japanese bond yields. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was up 0.1 percent at 94.845, hitting a five-day high. The euro traded down 0.1 percent at $1.1630, having fallen 0.73 percent on Thursday after the ECB signalled no change in its timetable to move away from ultra low rates or end its bond purchase program. “There was a dovish spin relative to what one could have expected, given a recent source-based story that some members of the governing council were not happy with the market pricing on rates,” said Christoph Rieger, head of rates at Commerzbank. In commodities, oil prices edged lower in quiet trading after three days of gains, but took support from Saudi Arabia halting crude transport through a key shipping lane and falling U.S. inventories. Brent crude futures traded down half a percent at $74.17 per barrel, having gained 2.0 percent so far this week. Spot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,221.03 an ounce as of 0824 GMT. The precious metal was, however, on track for its third straight weekly decline. Copper edged up, again boosted by receding trade tensions. It is on course to gain 2.4 percent on the London Metal Exchange and 3.7 percent on the Shanghai Futures Exchange this week, which would mark its first weekly rise in seven on both bourses after fears of a global trade war dragged prices down.

2018-07-27,"* Singapore margin rises 65 pct from June * Current margin contrasts with last month’s 2-year low * Supply of fuel oil, naphtha seen tight * Jet fuel in demand as people take to the sky By Seng Li Peng SINGAPORE, July 27 (Reuters) - Refining margins in Singapore are set for their biggest monthly gain since 2015 as surging demand for gasoline and jet fuel lifted fuel prices at the same time crude oil dropped, reducing feedstock costs for refiners. The profit DUB-SIN-REF from refining a barrel of benchmark Dubai crude into fuels in Singapore rose to $6.81 a barrel on Wednesday, the most since May 22. The margin, a proxy for refiners across Asia, was at $6.70 on Thursday, on pace for a 66 percent monthly increase since the of June, the most since September 2015. Profit margins in July rebounded from a two-year low $3.85 a barrel in June. Since the end of last month, the profit from producing gasoline GL92-SIN-CRK more than doubled and margins for naphtha rose 53 percent, pushing the gains in overall margins. NAF-SIN-CRK “Refining margins appear to have been supported by a combination of factors, including seasonally-stronger demand for gasoline and (middle) distillates, particularly across the emerging markets,” said Peter Lee, oil & gas analyst of BMI Research. Fuel oil margins in July were also supported as less supply arrived in Asia from Europe. Margins are unlikely to maintain their recent gains as Chinese fuel exports may continue to increase and oil prices rebound. “Risks to subsequent quarters’ margins lie to the downside, amid relentless fuels exports out of China, stronger oil prices and potential spill-over effects onto retail prices and consumer appetite,” said BMI’s Lee. China’s record-breaking gasoil, or diesel, exports have contributed to growing gasoil stockpiles in Asia. Gasoline inventories in Asia also remain high, despite solid demand in Europe and the United States, with Singapore inventories reported at four-month highs this week. Even fuel oil margins should drop as more supply comes onto the market. “We could see pressure on fuel oil cracks emerge as surging fuel-oil rich crude production in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Russia is likely to boost fuel oil supplies,” said Eugene Lindell, an analyst at JBC Energy.

2018-07-27,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s biggest electric utilities are firing up old fossil fuel power plants and ramping up others that are already operating, pushing to meet demand as power prices hit record highs amid a deadly heatwave. The deployment of older, dirtier stations that use commodities such as crude and fuel oil highlights the lingering effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, which has left most of the country’s reactors offline as operators upgrade them. Like many other regions of the world, Japan has been hit by record temperatures in a two-week heatwave, with more than 80 people dying and thousands rushed to emergency rooms. Surging appetite for power as households and businesses crank up their air conditioning has driven utilities to start up old fossil fuel plants that had been mothballed but kept on standby or to boost output at already-operational fossil units.  Kansai Electric Power, which supplies Japan’s western industrialized heartland where the heatwave has been most persistent, has started up two old oil-fired units, with total capacity of 1.2 gigawatts (GW), a spokesman told Reuters. The nation’s second-biggest utility has also run one station fueled by natural gas and another fired by oil at higher than planned output levels, he said, adding that Kansai had also received 1 GW of power from five other utilities. The sweltering weather has driven prices on the Japan Electric Power Exchange for the Kansai region to just above 100 yen ($0.90) yen per kilowatt hour this week, the highest on record. Meanwhile, Tokyo Electric Power the country’s biggest electricity provider and the operator of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, has run oil, coal and gas plants at rates higher than their typical maximum capacity, a spokesman told Reuters.  He declined to say which plants were operating at these levels. Japan relied on nuclear power for nearly a third of its electricity supply before the Fukushima disaster, but now has just six out of 40 available nuclear reactors running. And the scorching conditions could be set to stay as July turns to August, typically the hottest month in Japan. Western Japan has a 50 percent chance of experiencing above-average temperatures over the month, the country’s weather bureau said this week. Chubu Electric Power, the country’s third-biggest utility, sees electricity demand in July and August potentially exceeding initial estimates, President Satoru Katsuno told reporters on July 20. “Our old thermal power plants are working hard. We must get our act together to keep them well maintained,” he said.

2018-07-27,"* Fields off Darwin hold 30 Tcf of natural gas * Enough space at Ichthys and Darwin LNG to add 5 trains * Study recommends 4 million tonnes/year expansion of Darwin LNG But ConocoPhillips focused on backfill for Darwin LNG train By Sonali Paul and Osamu Tsukimori MELBOURNE/TOKYO, July 27 (Reuters) - Australia’s tropical city of Darwin wants to establish itself as a world-scale energy export hub, building on its closeness to demand centres in Asia and abundant nearby natural gas resources. With the imminent start-up of Inpex Corp’s $40 billion Ichthys liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, the capital of the Northern Territory will be home to two LNG exporting facilities, with a total capacity of 12.6 million tonnes a year, including ConocoPhillips’ Darwin LNG plant that opened in 2006. Darwin is poised to become the nucleus of the Northern Territory’s push to expand LNG exports by tapping 30 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas offshore northern Australia. Perched at the top of the continent in a region known for saltwater crocodiles, Darwin is closer to Jakarta than Sydney. The city will vie with projects from Alaska to Qatar that will beef up global LNG supply from 2022 onwards to meet growing demand in Asia, the world’s top consuming region. “We have the gas, location and proximity to markets — whether it’s China, India, Japan or Indonesia,” said Paul Tyrrell, chairman of the Northern Territory Gas Taskforce, appointed to lead the region’s gas push. Ichthys and Darwin LNG have the space to add five more LNG production units, know as trains, with a feasibility study at Darwin LNG suggesting another unit producing 4 million tonnes per year (tpy) of the fuel would be optimal. Darwin LNG’s expansion would build off existing facilities, an advantage over the $200 billion of projects built from scratch in Australia over the past decade, said Graeme Bethune, chief executive of advisory firm EnergyQuest. “There’s a reasonable chance an expansion decision could be made within the next five years,” Bethune said. A second train at Darwin LNG would raise the Northern Territory’s LNG output to nearly 17 million tpy, equivalent to Indonesia, the world’s fifth-biggest exporter, according to data from the International Gas Union (IGU). “We remain open to all options” for a potential expansion of Darwin LNG, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips Australia said, adding the company wanted to get the most out of the region’s reserves. But first Conoco wants to secure gas to keep the original train filled when supply from its current source, the Bayu Undan field in the Timor Sea north of Darwin, runs out in 2023. Conoco and its partners Santos and South Korea’s SK E&S have agreed to conduct preliminary design work to develop the Barossa field, 300 kilometres (188 miles) north of Darwin, to supply Darwin LNG. “Darwin excites the heck out of me,” said Santos Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher at an industry conference in May. Santos also has stakes in the Petrel Tern and Crown Lasseter fields that could also feed Darwin LNG. Other reserves offshore Darwin are Evans Shoal, operated by Italy’s Eni, Greater Sunrise, operated by Woodside Petroleum, Cash Maple, operated by Thailand’s PTTEP , and ConocoPhillips’ Poseidon. Inpex would only make a decision to expand exports after getting the initial Ichthys trains up and running after the project has missed several deadlines for first production. “We have to produce 8.9 million tonnes first and then examine whether there is demand. At this stage, there is no concrete plan,” Inpex Chief Executive Officer Takayuki Ueda told Reuters earlier this month. Still, Ueda said the infrastructure for an expansion is in place. “We can develop new gas fields nearby and send gas through the current pipeline,” he said. In addition to the offshore gas, the Northern Territory holds 200 Tcf of onshore shale gas resources that could fuel manufacturing around Darwin. The territory lifted a ban on fracking in April and is developing strict environmental rule before exploration starts. However, environmental groups, farmers and indigenous communities are concerned about damage to water supplies. “We don’t think the government here is up to the task of managing this high risk industry,” said Lauren Mellor, a spokeswoman for the Frack Free NT Alliance.

2018-07-27,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil producer Eni (ENI.MI) reported a 66 percent jump in second quarter profit on Friday on higher oil prices and production but fell short of analyst forecasts. Adjusted net profit rose to 767 million euros ($893.3 million), but fell short of an analyst consensus forecast of 1.0 billion euros. Eni faced higher taxes than a year earlier and its investment returns fell, its earnings showed. Eni shares were down 0.5 percent at 0701 GMT while the European oil and gas index was up 0.07 percent. Cash flow from operations rose 12 percent to 3 billion euros, the state-controlled company said. It will pay an interim dividend of 0.42 euros per share having earlier flagged it would pay an annual dividend of 0.83 euros per share. As the industry recovers from a three-year downturn some companies are starting to look for ways to reward shareholders. On Thursday Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) launched a $25 billion share buyback while France’s Total (TOTF.PA) has begun a $5 billion purchase program. Eni, which saw a 5 percent rise in oil and gas output in the quarter, stuck to its outlook for 4 percent growth in production for the year. The group, which has enjoyed one of the best discovery records in the sector in recent years, said it expected output to driven by ramp-ups in Egypt, Indonesia and Ghana as well as higher production at the giant Kashagan oilfield in Norway.

European shares are expected to be firm, with spread-betters looking at flat to higher openings of 0.3 percent in Britain’s FTSE, France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.3 percent, though Chinese shares underperformed with the CSI300 in the red for most of the day. “Markets are worried that the Chinese economy will slow as trade frictions with the U.S. intensify. We think if the U.S. slaps additional tariffs on $200 billion goods from China, that would shave off China’s growth by 0.5 percentage point,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macroeconomic strategy at HSBC in Tokyo. Japan’s Nikkei eked out a 0.1 percent gain though it was capped by worries that the Bank of Japan could scale down its asset purchase at its upcoming policy review next week. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe, ACWI, was up 0.05 percent after hitting four-month highs on Thursday, when European car maker shares gaining 2.6 percent after the European Union and the United States agreed to negotiate on trade, easing fears of a Transatlantic trade war. U.S. industrial shares also made gains, rising 0.8 percent though the S&P 500 Index dipped 0.30 percent on Thursday, due to a 19 percent dive in Facebook on its earnings showing slowing usage. While that pushed down the Nasdaq Composite 1.01 percent, other U.S. tech firms held firm, with Amazon.com shares gaining 3.2 percent in after-market hours following its stellar earnings. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield edged up to 2.9840 percent, its highest level in 1-1/2 months, on receding worries about trade tensions. Yet Asian shares were more subdued as a heated trade dispute between Washington and Beijing have shown few signs of abating. “Now that Washington does not need to use its energy to fight with Europe, it could increase pressure on China,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. So far this month, MSCI China A shares have fallen 2.6 percent, taking the biggest hit from U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats on tariffs and other issues among major markets, compared to 3.3 percent gains in MSCI ACWI. The Chinese yuan eased, on course to mark its seventh week of losses, although the losses were cushioned by Chinese state banks’ swapping of dollars for yuan in the forward market. Traders suspected they had also been selling spot dollars. The onshore yuan traded at 6.8065 per dollar, near Tuesday’s 13-month low of 6.8295. The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index, which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, fell to its lowest levels since May last year, having fallen 5.2 percent from a two year high hit in mid-May. The euro traded little changed at $1.1647, having fallen 0.73 percent on Thursday after the European Central Bank signalled no change in its timetable to move away from ultra low rates or end its bond purchase program. The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 110.98 yen as the yen got a lift from rise in Japanese bond yields. The 10-year government bond yield hit one-year high of 0.105 percent. In commodities, oil prices extended their recovery, after Saudi Arabia suspended oil shipments through a strait in the Red Sea following an attack on two oil tankers. Brent crude futures traded flat at $74.52 per barrel, having gained 2.0 percent so far this week.

2018-07-27,"PARIS, July 27 (Reuters) - French gas and power group Engie confirmed its 2018 earnings outlook despite a series of outages at its Belgian nuclear plants, and posted virtually flat first-half revenue. Core earnings rose 1.3 percent in the first half - in line with expectations but slower than the 3 percent seen in the first quarter - due to strong hydro power in France and despite the nuclear outages in Belgium. First-half revenue edged up 0.1 percent to 30.2 billion euros ($35.2 billion), while core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to 5.1 billion. The Benelux contribution to core earnings nearly halved to 133 million euros from 242 million. Current operating income rose 1.4 percent to 3.1 billion euros, with net recurring income up 11.4 percent to 1.5 billion. A Thomson Reuters poll of eight analysts had forecast EBITDA of 5.08 billion euros, current operating income of 3.08 billion euros and net recurring income of 1.43 billion euros. Engie confirmed its 2018 earnings guidance for 2.45-2.65 billion euros of net recurring income, core earnings of 9.3-9.7 billion euros and a cash dividend of 0.75 euros per share. $1 = 0.8587 euros

2018-07-27,"KOKHONG, Laos (Reuters) - The first warning came at 4.00 p.m., one hour later the water started to flow through the village, and by late evening it was a torrent. Inpon Sivatan was at home on Monday afternoon when the village chief knocked on his door to warn that their remote hamlet in the southern tip of Laos was about to be flooded. “The water came really fast. It just rushed through the village,” said Inpon, 55, as he tidied his house in Khokong, one of seven villages that was all but obliterated when a nearby hydropower dam collapsed on Monday, sending a wall of water crashing across mountains, jungle and rural communities. “I’ve lived here for 32 years and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Inpon said. A medical official in a nearby settlement, who asked not to be named, said locals received an alert about three to four hours before the dam burst but few took it seriously and did not expect the water to rise as high as it did. The Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company, a hydropower project that involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms, on Monday told local officials in a letter written in English that one of its subsidiary dams was “unsafety” and had started to overflow, and requested that they inform downstream villages.  It was not clear what time the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, was delivered. At 8:00 p.m. that evening, according to state media, Saddle Dam D - part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams - failed, and the deluge began. The scale of the disaster in the southern province of Attapeu was still unclear on Friday, in part because of the inaccessibility of the area but also because reports from the isolated and poverty-stricken country’s state media have been scant, sketchy and sometimes inconsistent. But in Khokong, the scale of the damage was palpable. Every inch of this sleepy farming community was covered in a swamp of viscous, burnt-orange mud. A dead baby water buffalo lay motionless, its head buried in the thick clay. Dogs still trapped in wooden stilt houses howled for their owners. “I lost everything,” said Inpon, who tried in vain to rescue his car by driving it to the highest point in the village - a nearby petrol station. “There was not enough time to get out”. “My pigs, my crops. My house is ruined”.  For graphic on how the Laos dam disaster unfolded click here RAG-TAG ARMADA OF BOATS The unstoppable force of the water released from the dam  devastated the meagre road between Khokong and its nearest big town, Attapeu, complicating rescue efforts to bring food and water across dangerous, muddied, roads and the search for trapped survivors. The Lao army has set up checkpoints to filter the deluge of well-wishing volunteers who have driven overland from other parts of Laos and from neighbouring Thailand into the secretive communist country. Some of those volunteers have donated a rag-tag armada of wooden fishing boats, jet-skis and inflatable banana boats to navigate the sea of mud so rescuers can ferry drinking water to villages like Khokong. As Inpon fruitlessly mopped the porch of his waterlogged house, a young family evacuated their stilt home in the rain. Outside, two young girls used a broken oar to steer mud-sodden mattresses like rafts. Initial reports had suggested the death toll from the burst dam could climb to several hundred, and on Wednesday the Vientiane Times reported some 3,000 people were still waiting to be rescued from swirling floodwaters, many of them on trees and the rooftops of submerged houses. But official media reported on Thursday that 27 people were confirmed dead, 131 were missing, and all those who were stranded had been plucked to safety. On Friday, the Vientiane Times reported that the official death toll had risen to four.  “I heard some people died but I haven’t seen any bodies,” said Inpon. “I just stayed with my house”.

2018-07-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s acting chief said late Thursday the government will withdraw a decision to lift strict sales limits on remanufactured heavy duty vehicles known as “glider trucks”. The vehicles have a used engine in a new frame and rules introduced under former U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, said nearly all new trucks on the road must use more efficient, less polluting engines.  The glider trucks emit up to 450 times more diesel particulate matter and up to 40 times more smog-forming nitrogen oxides than new trucks on the market, the EPA has said. Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) president Fred Krupp said the decision is “a huge win for all Americans who care about clean air and human health.” “These super-polluting diesel freight trucks fill our lungs with a toxic stew of pollution. EPA’s effort to create a loophole allowing more of them onto our roads was irresponsible and dangerous,” he added. The EPA issued a “no action” memo on July 6 that declared the agency would not enforce a limit of up to 300 gliders per manufacturer. Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who took over earlier this month, said in a memo Thursday withdrawing the guidance he had “concluded that the application of current regulations to the glider industry does not represent the kind of extremely unusual circumstances that support the EPA’s exercise of enforcement discretion.” A federal appeals court on July 18 temporarily blocked the EPA reversal after environmental groups, including EDF, sued the agency to force the agency to enforce the existing rules. On July 19, 16 states and the District of Columbia also sued the EPA. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said the July 6 memo “was blatantly unlawful... By letting more of these super polluting trucks on the road, EPA is putting politics before the public’s health and safety.” The EPA had said in its July 6 memo that enforcing the rules would result “in the loss of jobs” and threaten the viability of companies making the glider trucks. The EPA in November issued a proposal regulation to undo the glider rule but has not finalized it. Wheeler’s memo Thursday said the EPA will “move as expeditiously as possible” on revising the regulations “that apply to the introduction of glider vehicles into commerce to the extent consistent with statutory requirements and due consideration of air quality impacts.” An EPA spokesperson confirmed Thursday the guidance had been withdrawn. Volvo Group North America, Cummins Inc and Navistar International Corp told the EPA last year they opposed efforts to reverse the limits on glider trucks.  Glider kits “should not be used for circumventing purchase of currently certified powertrains.” The move could inflict “uncertainty and damage to our industry,” the companies said. The EPA has previously said that if gliders were allowed through 2025, they would make up 5 percent of the freight trucks on the road but would account for one third of all nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from the U.S. heavy truck fleet. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, one of the state officials suing, said the EPA has estimated that adding 10,000 glider trucks “with non-compliant engines onto our roads in a single year could result in up to 1,600 premature deaths” and 415,000 tons of additional nitrogen oxide emissions. Glider companies told the EPA that glider trucks are 25 percent cheaper than new vehicles. In August 2016, the Obama administration issued final rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from medium and heavy duty trucks through 2027, a sector that accounts for 20 percent of carbon pollution from vehicles. The commercial vehicle rules are expected to cut 1.1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the Obama administration estimated.

2018-07-27,"TOKYO, July 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged down on Friday after three days of gains, but were still supported by Saudi Arabia’s halt on transporting crude through a key shipping lane, falling U.S. inventories and easing trade tensions between Washington and Europe. Brent futures were down 6 cents at $74.48 a barrel by 0043 GMT, after gaining 0.8 percent on Thursday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were also 6 cents lower, at $69.55, after posting a nearly 0.5-percent gain the previous session. U.S. President Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, struck a surprise deal on Wednesday that ended the risk of an immediate trade war between the two powers. A trade war would likely hit demand for commodities like oil, which is used heavily in shipping, construction and other economic activity. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia said it was “temporarily halting” oil shipments through the Red Sea shipping lane of Bab al-Mandeb after an attack by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement. Any move to block the Bab al-Mandeb, which is between the coasts of Yemen and Africa at the southern end of the Red Sea, would virtually halt oil shipments through Egypt’s Suez Canal and the SUMED crude pipeline that link the Red Sea and Mediterranean. An estimated 4.8 million barrels per day of crude oil and refined products flowed through the Bab al-Mandeb strait in 2016 towards Europe, the United States and Asia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, Saudi Arabia has the Petroline, also known as the East-West Pipeline, which mainly transports crude from fields clustered in the east to Yanbu for export. That could offset a bottleneck caused by Bab al-Mandeb’s closure.

2018-07-27,"(Repeats July 26 column with no change to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2JVAFSZ By John Kemp LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - World trade volumes continued to rise in May, but the rate of growth is decelerating, consistent with other signs that the global economic expansion is moving into a slower phase. Trade volumes rose by 0.4 percent in May compared with April, according to the latest data from the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (“World Trade Monitor”, CPB, July 25). But volumes in the three months from March to May were just 3.1 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier, a marked slowdown from year-on-year growth of over 5 percent in late 2017 and early 2018. The fastest growth in May was reported in China, Asia, the Middle East and the United States, with volumes in most other regions actually declining during the month. Volumes on the trans-Pacific routes are likely to have been flattered by the race to beat tariffs announced by the United States and China, which led to an upsurge in container arrivals in May and June. The impact will probably prove temporary and is likely to unwind in the second half of the year as the tariffs go into effect and the supply chain digests higher than normal inventories after stocking up. In much of the rest of the world the picture is one of moderating and increasingly unbalanced growth, after the strong synchronised upturn in 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2JVAFSZ). The trade figures are consistent with leading indicators compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which show the rate of economic growth peaking in the second half of 2017. The OECD’s composite indicators show growth accelerating in the United States, China and India in the early months of this year but losing momentum in other countries. Signs of a moderation in growth are also evident in South Korea’s KOSPI share index, often seen as a leading indicator for world trade growth given the country’s heavy export orientation. Over the last two decades, the KOPSI 100 share index has been closely correlated with world trade volumes as measured by the Netherlands government statistics. The 100-share index peaked at the end of 2017 and has been steadily sliding throughout the first seven months of 2018. KOSPI was up 32 percent in the 12 months to October 2017, but the annual comparisons have gradually become less favourable and annual growth turned negative in June and July. If KOSPI remains a good early warning indicator, global trade growth seems likely to slow further over the next few months.

2018-07-27,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips (COP.N) posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday thanks to rising crude prices, prompting executives to boost capital spending and production targets for the year. The new targets are a bullish bet that oil prices CLc1, which have surged more than 15 percent since January, are not likely to drop in the near future, helping Conoco exploit its lucrative shale acreage around the United States. Houston-based ConocoPhillips, the world’s largest independent oil and gas producer, is one of the first major U.S. oil producers to report earnings for the second quarter. Its shares were up 0.3 percent at $71.74 on Thursday afternoon. The company said it expects to produce between 1.23 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) and 1.26 million boe/d in 2018. It had previously forecast production of between 1.2 million boe/d and 1.24 million boe/d. ConocoPhillips forecast capital spending of $6 billion this year, reflecting growing expenses from a higher U.S. oil price of $65 per barrel. It had initially budgeted $5.5 billion for 2018 capital expenditures and said the additional spending would be on well completions, work with production partners, and inflation. “We’re executing our operating plan and remain committed to our disciplined approach to the business,” Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in a statement. The company posted net income of $1.6 billion or $1.39 per share, compared with a loss of $3.4 billion or $2.78 per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, ConocoPhillips earned $1.09 per share, edging past analysts’ average estimate of $1.08 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Conoco said it realized an average price of $54.32 per barrel of oil equivalent in the three months ended June 30, from $36.08 a year earlier. Higher prices also are lifting its cash generation. Cash flow from operations will run between $11.5 billion and $12 billion this year with U.S. crude prices at $65 a barrel, finance chief Don Wallette told analysts on a conference call. That is up from an earlier estimate of about $7 billion at $50 a barrel.   “The market hasn’t yet fully appreciated the cash-generating capability of our assets,” he said.  Higher crude prices are driving cost inflation and U.S. tariffs on imported steel also are “a fairly significant item for us,” Alan Hirshberg, executive vice president for production, drilling and projects, said on the same call.   ConocoPhillips’ second-quarter production, excluding Libya, fell 214,000 boe/d year-over-year to 1.2 million boe/d, largely due to asset sales.
