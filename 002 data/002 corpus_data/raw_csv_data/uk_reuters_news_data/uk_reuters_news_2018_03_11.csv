2018-03-11,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Allison Martell HAMILTON, Ontario, March 11 (Reuters) - A temporary exemption from U.S. tariffs is little comfort to the Canadian steel city of Hamilton, coping with months of uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a potentially devastating 25 percent duty unless the North American Free Trade Agreement is renegotiated. Canadian negotiators are weighing the interests of the relatively small sector, responsible for about 22,000 direct Canadian jobs and C$9.0 billion ($7.0 billion) in U.S. exports, against those of bigger industries like auto manufacturing and politically influential groups like dairy farmers. “I don’t think we’re at the end of it. Now it’s being used as leverage,” said Hamilton Port Authority Chief Executive Officer Ian Hamilton. “President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on everybody.” Hamilton, population 700,000, has pushed to diversify its economy, with better transit links to Toronto and affordable homes that are attracting families priced out of Canada’s biggest city. A C$139-million project is underway to clean up coal tar that contaminates the harbor and condos are replacing once empty downtown storefronts. When Canadian steel escaped U.S. steel tariffs in 2002, the duties had diverted some cheap steel into Canada. In recent years, a global steel glut has made it difficult for Canadian mills to compete. But ArcelorMittal’s Dofasco mill, coking and finishing operations at Stelco, and a collection of smaller operations still directly employ 10,000 people in Hamilton. The North American steel industry is heavily integrated, with raw materials, steel and parts crossing the U.S.-Canadian border several times before a finished product such as a vehicle or refrigerator is sold to consumers. About 65 percent of the Hamilton port’s tonnage is iron ore and coal used to make steel. Hamilton, the port president, said one steel company called after Trump first signaled the tariffs on March 1, when it was unclear whether Canada would be exempt at all. The firm wanted to know if the agency might be willing to take over management of its warehouse and find different cargo to fill it. Hamilton Chamber of Commerce President Keanin Loomis, a former Washington lawyer, is part of a new generation in the city who have never worked in a steel mill. But like much of the city, he has a personal connection to steel, a father-in-law retired from the Dofasco mill. If a tariff is imposed, Loomis expects imports to lower domestic steel prices, potentially driving some employers south of the border, where tariffs are expected to boost prices. Loomis said high labor costs, environmental regulations and a looming carbon tax already make it difficult for the steel industry to compete. “This could be the thing that puts it over the edge,” he said. The city’s United Steelworkers Local 1005 has only about 550 active members, down from more than 13,000 in its heyday in the 1970s. The local union represents workers at Stelco, but not Dofasco, which never organized. Since 2004 it has weathered the closure of Stelco’s Hamilton mill, Stelco’s two trips through bankruptcy protection, and two new owners. Members at another plant, Max Aicher North America, have been locked out for almost five years over proposed wage and benefit cuts. And union president Gary Howe sees choppy waters ahead. “With Trump being in there, it’s probably never going to be over,” he said. The Canadian government has vowed to continue lobbying Washington until the threat of duties disappears. Pressed on Trump’s decision to link the exemption to NAFTA, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Thursday that Canada considers the two issues to be totally separate. “I think they should get some more backbone,” Steve Kajganic, a retired veteran of the Stelco mill and a second-generation steelworker, said of the Canadian government. “Stand up for our country, instead of selling it out.” (Editing by Denny Thomas and Jeffrey Benkoe)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-canada-hamilton/rpt-canadas-steel-town-still-nervous-despite-tariff-reprieve-idUKL1N1QT0JH,11 Mar 2018,"A temporary

2018-03-11,"ESSEN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Germany’s top utilities on Sunday announced plans to break up Innogy (IGY.DE), whose assets will be divided among parent RWE RWED.DE and rival E.ON EONGN.DE in the sector’s biggest overhaul since a landmark move to exit nuclear power. The deal, which includes E.ON making a 5.2 billion euro (£4.62 billion) takeover offer to Innogy’s minority shareholders, spells the end of the network, renewables and retail energy group, carved out from RWE two years ago, as a standalone unit. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to abandon nuclear power after Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 has forced the sector to radically restructure in order to survive and already caused major plant shutdowns and billions of euros of losses. Peter Altmaier, the next economy minister and a close ally of Merkel, said the deal was a consequence of that shift, known as the “Energiewende” in German. The companies had to adapt, he told the Rheinische Post newspaper. Through the deal, which includes a share issue and asset swaps, E.ON will acquire Innogy’s prized regulated energy networks and customer operations, while RWE will take on the renewables businesses of both E.ON and Innogy. That would position RWE, which relies heavily on coal and gas-fired power plants, as a champion of the shift away from fossil fuels towards a more sustainable mix of energy sources. RWE kept 76.8 percent of Innogy after the 2016 carve-out. A source involved in the deal said it would be slightly more beneficial to E.ON, which would become a bigger regulated business by adding more networks, while RWE would end up owning interests in the riskier and more competitive renewables sector. The source said that E.ON had been in a better bargaining position after RWE shopped Innogy to other European rivals, including France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA), Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI) and Spain’s Iberdrola (IBE.MC), without striking a deal. “This looks like an advantageous step for E.ON at first glance,” said Thomas Deser, fund manager at Union Investment, which holds shares in E.ON, RWE and Innogy. “Through the renewable pipeline, RWE, too, should be able to offset its dwindling nuclear and lignite business as well as attract partners for the expansion of its wind business.” The all-German transaction comes less than two years after E.ON and RWE both split up their businesses to separate legacy fossil fuel power plants from more promising networks and renewable assets. E.ON in January agreed to sell a remaining 46.65 percent stake in its power plant and trading unit Uniper (UN01.DE), which it spun off in 2016, to Finland’s Fortum (FORTUM.HE), a deal expected to close later this year. The RWE-E.ON swap will also hand RWE - Germany’s biggest electricity producer - a 16.67 percent stake in E.ON by way of a 20 percent capital increase. RWE will pay another 1.5 billion euros to E.ON to close a valuation gap that results from the complex structure of the asset swaps. The transactions, which still require approval from the company’s boards, face scrutiny by European Union regulators as well as from Germany’s Federal Cartel Office, which did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The European Commission declined to comment. Innogy has been in turmoil since Chief Executive Peter Terium resigned in December in the wake of a profit warning and Chief Financial Officer Bernhard Guenther fell victim to a recent acid attack. Innogy has been the target of persistent takeover talk, with sources saying recently that RWE had talked to Engie and Italy’s Enel about a possible asset-swap deal. Other firms linked to Innogy included Iberdrola and Australian bank Macquarie (MQG.AX), an acquisitive infrastructure investor. Innogy reports its annual results on Monday, while RWE does so on Tuesday and E.ON on Wednesday. The supervisory boards of both RWE and E.ON were due to meet on Sunday to review the deal, according to people familiar with the matter. RWE’s municipal shareholders, VkA, which jointly hold about 23 percent in the group, were caught off-guard by the announcement and said the plans would have to be thoroughly examined. If approved, the deal could result in synergies of about 500 million euros, analysts at Bernstein estimate, pointing to double-staffing on the customer support side. Labour sources welcomed the plans, saying that each company individually was unable to fund the networks, renewables and customer business in an adequate ways, but added talks about job protection would be a key demand. Under the proposed transaction, E.ON would make a voluntary cash offer to buy RWE’s Innogy stake valued at 40.00 euros per share, E.ON said in a filing issued early on Sunday. Innogy shares closed at 34.53 euros on Friday. This price includes an offer of 36.76 euros per share plus assumed dividends of Innogy for the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 in the total aggregate amount of 3.24 euros per share, E.ON said. RWE will not participate in the offer. E.ON also agreed to transfer most of its renewables business to RWE, including minority interests currently held by E.ON’s subsidiary PreussenElektra in the RWE-operated nuclear power plants Emsland and Gundremmingen. RWE in turn, will receive Innogy’s renewables and gas storage business as well as Innogy’s stake in Austrian energy supplier Kelag, E.ON said.

Zanganeh also told the WSJ in an interview that Iran wanted OPEC to work to keep oil prices around $60 a barrel to contain U.S. shale oil production. “If the price jumps [to] around $70 ... it will motivate more production in shale oil in the United States,” Zanganeh said.  Iran will press for carefully bringing back some of its own production, the WSJ cited Zanganeh as saying, adding the OPEC member currently pumps about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) and could produce about 100,000 bpd more. He did not say when Iran could raise its output. Iran is allowed to pump up to 3.8 million bpd under a global pact between OPEC, Russia and other oil producers to limit supply.

2018-03-11,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Any trade war with the United States will only bring disaster to the world economy, Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said on Sunday, as Beijing stepped up its criticism on proposed metals tariffs by Washington amid fears it could shatter global growth After pressure from allies, the United States has opened the way for more exemptions from tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum that U.S. President Donald Trump set last week. On Saturday, the European Union and Japan urged the United States to grant them exemptions from metal import tariffs, with Tokyo calling for “calm-headed behavior.” But the target of Trump’s ire is China, whose capacity expansions have helped add to global surpluses of steel. China has repeatedly vowed to defend its “legitimate rights and interests” if targeted by U.S. trade actions. Zhong, speaking on the sidelines of China’s annual session of parliament, said China does not want a trade war and will not initiate one. “There are no winners in a trade war,” Zhong said. “It will only bring disaster to China and the United States and the world.” China can handle any challenges and will resolutely protect its interests, but the two countries will continue to talk, he said. “Nobody wants to fight a trade war, and everyone knows fighting one harms others and does not benefit oneself.” Trump’s announcement on tariffs underlined concerns about rising U.S. protectionism, which has sparked bouts of turmoil in global financial markets over the past year as investors feared a damaging trade spat will shatter a synchronized uptick in world growth.  China’s metals industry issued the country’s most explicit threat yet in the row, urging on Friday for the government to retaliate by targeting U.S. coal - a sector that is central to Trump’s political base and his election pledge to restore American industries and blue-collar jobs. The U.S. is the world’s biggest importer of steel, purchasing 35 million tonnes of raw material in 2017. Of those imports, South Korea, Japan, China and India accounted for 6.6 million tonnes. Trade tensions between China and United States have risen since Trump took office. China accounts for only a small fraction of U.S. steel imports, but its massive industrial expansion has helped create a global glut of steel that has driven down prices. The dispute has fueled concerns that soybeans, the United States’ most valuable export to the world’s second largest economy, might be caught up in the trade actions after Beijing launched a probe into imports of U.S. sorghum, a grain used in animal feed and liquor. Zhong said U.S. official trade deficit figures had been over-estimated by about 20 percent, and in any case would be a lot lower if the United States relaxed export restrictions on some high-tech goods.  He also reiterated a previous pledge that China would lower import tariffs on consumer goods including automobiles, as part of an effort to boost domestic consumption.  Trump believes the tariffs will safeguard American jobs, though many economists say the impact of price increases for users of steel and aluminum, such as the auto and oil industries, will destroy more jobs than curbs on imports create. Nonetheless, there is growing bipartisan consensus in Washington, and support within some segments of the U.S. business community, for the U.S. government to counter what are seen as Beijing’s predatory industrial policies and market restrictions on foreign firms.  Trump’s administration has said the United States mistakenly supported China’s membership in the World Trade Organization in 2001 on terms that have failed to force Beijing to open its economy. Diplomatic and U.S. business sources say the United States has frozen a formal mechanism for talks on commercial disputes with China because it is not satisfied Beijing has met its promises to ease market restrictions.

2018-03-11,"DAESAN, South Korea (Reuters) - LG Chem (051910.KS), South Korea’s largest chemical company, sees the global petrochemical market being stable this year, and is diversifying its products to guard against falling plastic usage, the company’s chief executive said.         Asian petrochemical makers typically use crude-oil derived  naphtha as a feedstock to produce ethylene and other basic petrochemicals, which are mostly used to make plastics.  “The petrochemical business is largely affected by oil prices, but now oil prices are stable in the range of $60 (43.32 pounds) per barrel after rising for a while,” Park Jin-soo, LG Chem CEO and vice president, said at a press conference on Friday which was embargoed until Sunday. “The market may not be as robust as last year but I think it won’t go bad this year.”  The chief executive also raised concerns over protectionism after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium, prompting warnings of retaliation from U.S. trading partners. “We see relatively little impact because our export volume to the U.S. is not that much, however, in the long term we should be prepared for global trade protectionism,” Park said.  Asked about the potential impact of plastic usage bans on the petrochemical industry, Park said demand continued to increase steadily. “However we have been diversifying our businesses to maintain steady demand regardless of supply or demand changes,” he said.  LG Chem currently operates two naphtha crackers in the southwestern cities of Yeosu and Daesan with a combined 2.2 million tonnes per year (tpy) of ethylene output. It would increase the Daesan plant’s ethylene output capacity by 230,000 tonnes to 1.27 million tpy by 2019.      The company said in December it would expand its acrylic and superabsorbent polymer production capacity by the first half of 2019 in a bid to focus on more lucrative petrochemical products.     Apart from the petrochemical business, LG Chem is also one of the major South Korean battery makers, along with Samsung SDI (006400.KS) and SK Innovation (096770.KS). Growth in the battery business, fuelled by the boom in electric vehicles, boosted the company’s sales target to 36.4 trillion won (24.69 billion pounds) by 2020, from this year’s goal of 26.9 trillion won, Park said. LG Chem was on the lookout for ways to secure stable supplies of metals such as nickel and cobalt used in EV batteries, including joint ventures, he added.  “We could consider cooperating with companies which have such metals or, if needed, a joint venture or a long-term deal, and we are making a lot of plans for the next few years,” he said.  In February, SK Innovation signed a deal with battery technology metals developer Australian Mines Ltd (AUZ.AX) to source cobalt sulphate and nickel sulphate.
