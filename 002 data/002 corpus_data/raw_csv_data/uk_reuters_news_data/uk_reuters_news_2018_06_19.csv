2018-06-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran has no plans to extend the range of its missiles since their 2,000-km (1,240-mile) reach is enough to protect the country, the Revolutionary Guards commander said on Tuesday, amid mounting U.S. pressure over Tehran’s missile programme.  Iran’s government again ruled out negotiations with U.S. President Donald Trump over Tehran’s military capabilities and regional influence, saying such talks would be against the values of the Islamic Republic. Trump withdrew the United States last month from the 2015 accord between Iran and world powers that curbed Tehran’s nuclear activity in exchange for sanctions relief. He said the deal was deeply flawed as it had not curbed Iran’s ballistic missile programme or reined in its support for proxies in conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and said Washington would reimpose tough sanctions on Tehran. “We have the scientific ability to increase our missile range but it is not our current policy since most of the enemies’ strategic targets are already within this 2,000-km range. This range is enough to protect the Islamic Republic,” Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. Jafari said on Tuesday that previous negotiations with the United States about Iran’s nuclear programme were “an exception,” and called Iranian politicians and activists who have favoured fresh talks with Trump “traitors and anti-revolutionaries”.    On Saturday, over 100 activists associated with the moderate and reformist camps in Iranian politics welcomed Trump’s deal with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un envisaging a complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. In a statement published by Iranian media, the activists urged Tehran to start direct negotiations with Washington “with no preconditions” to resolve decades of enmity between the two countries dating to Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Jafari rejected their call. “The North Korean leader was a revolutionary but a communist, not an Islamic one. That is why he surrendered, but we will not do the same,” he was quoted by the semi-official Fars news agency as saying. Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Bagher Nobakht echoed Jafari’s remarks. “There are no grounds or logic to talk to such a person (Trump). Public opinion would not welcome that either,” Nobakht was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency. Since U.S. withdrawal from the deal, European signatories  France, Britain and Germany have been scrambling to ensure Iran retains enough economic benefits to persuade it not to pull out. Iran’s nuclear chief said on Tuesday that Europe’s proposals to salvage the deal were not satisfying for Tehran. IRNA reported that the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, had met with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and made clear Iran’s dissatisfaction with European proposals to save the nuclear deal.  Referring to Iran’s regional role, Salehi was quoted as saying, “If it continues like this, all sides will lose.” Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Mark Heinrich, Toni Reinhold",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-missiles-range/update-4-iran-says-no-plans-to-increase-missile-range-rejects-talks-with-trump-idUKL8N1TL1EI,19 Jun 2018,"Iran has no plans to extend the

2018-06-19,"BUENOS AIRES, June 19 (Reuters) - Small shale producers, which powered development of the sector in the United States, are struggling to break into Argentina due to financing difficulties and lack of infrastructure, analysts and industry sources say. The Vaca Muerta deposit, located in western Argentina, is a Belgium-sized play regarded as the world’s second-largest shale gas development. Successive governments in Argentina have targeted Vaca Muerta as the means of reversing its energy deficit but its development has been hindered by lack of infrastructure. Juan Jose Aranguren, who was replaced on Saturday as Argentina’s energy minister, said last week the investment by small- and medium-sized companies was essential to reduce costs at Vaca Muerta to unlock Argentina’s shale potential. Argentina has the world’s No. 2 shale gas and No. 4 shale oil reserves. Last year, Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc unit Pan American Energy, Wintershall Holding, Total SA and Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, announced investments in Vaca Muerta. Despite efforts by the national government and the regional government of Neuquen, one of the states spanned by Vaca Muerta, few small shale firms have been willing to invest. Retama Argentina, a subsidiary of U.S. firm Retamco Operating Inc, and Vista Oil, a company founded by the former chief executive of Argentine national oil company YPF SA , Miguel Galuccio, are the only two small firms with their own independent operations in Vaca Muerta. “Even if the returns are enormous, at the end of the day, the startup costs in Vaca Muerta are very high and there is a considerable risk involved,” said David Tawil, president of Maglan Capital, the largest shareholder in Madalena Energy, a small cap oil company that chose to partner with Pan American Energy LLC to enter Vaca Muerta. Madalena Energy hopes to start trading on the Buenos Aires stock exchange in the coming months. Vista Oil has said it expects to start producing from its first non-conventional oil in Vaca Muerta in the first quarter of next year. Retama is planning to drill between four and five horizontal wells and start selling gas in the second half of 2020. Industry sources and analysts told Reuters that lack of financing, high costs and lack of infrastructure makes Vaca Muerta unappetising for companies with scant resources. “The shale revolution in the United States was done by small companies, which requires more players and more diversification. You need investment which is not only carried out by the majors,” said an industry source who asked not to be identified. At the giant Eagle Ford shale field in Texas, there are currently more than 200 companies operating. In the United States, financing costs are much lower and shale producing areas have been better explored, considerably reducing the risk for companies investing there, Tawil said. That is not the case, however, for Vaca Muerta. Argentina’s central bank hiked its benchmark interest rate to 40 percent last month - the highest in the world - and supplies of credit from local banks are drying up. The central bank announced plans on Monday to raise reserve requirements for local banks. “The big challenge (in Argentina) is going to be capital. The financial system is small,” said Diego Garcia, an analyst with Bain & Company covering the oil and gas sector. Reporting by Juliana Castilla; Writing by Daniel Flynn;

2018-06-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell with U.S. bond yields and agricultural commodities on Tuesday, while the dollar rose and investors flocked to safety in the face of a rapidly escalating U.S.-China trade conflict. U.S. soybean futures were among the biggest casualties after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, a threat that China’s commerce ministry described as “blackmailing,” vowing to retaliate. Government bonds and the Japanese yen JPY= rallied as investors sought protection. Oil futures pulled back as the dollar rose, with U.S. crude seeing the deepest declines.  Wall Street’s three major indexes closed lower, though the S&P 500’s 0.4 percent drop was much more measured than that of overseas markets such as China’s. A preference for more domestically-focused U.S. sectors such as utilities and telecommunications showed investors trying to insulate themselves from a trade war, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth in Chicago. Stocks were vulnerable to a sell-off on trade headlines because some are overvalued at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising rates, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis “Trade is not as big an issue for us as overseas economies and it’s easy to believe Trump is bluffing because he does a lot of it.” said Paulsen. “It’s starting to feel more like a true trade war. I think people still don’t think we’ll blow up into a full global trade war that’ll cause a recession.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 287.12 points, or 1.15 percent, to 24,700.35, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 11.18 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,762.57 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 21.44 points, or 0.28 percent, to 7,725.59. While the strong dollar affected commodities across the board, investors in U.S. agricultural commodities appeared particularly worried. Cresset’s Ablin said Trump may be willing to suffer near-term pain in commodities in a spat that is “less about soybeans and more about intellectual property.”  Chicago Board of Trade front month soybean futures settled down 2.1 percent after falling as much as 7.3 percent, to the lowest spot price on a continuous chart Sc1 since December 2008. [L1N1TL1JF] “When you get in a fight with your biggest buyer of agriculture, and the world’s largest soybean buyer (China), even if (it) were to buy 20 percent less, it’s a big deal,” said Dan Basse, president of Chicago-based consultancy AgResource Co. He estimated that U.S. crop farmers have lost $100 per acre in revenue over the past two weeks in the most rapid erosion of U.S. farm profit since at least 1979 due to the administration’s battle with China.   In U.S. Treasuries, U.S. 10-year and 30-year yields fell to three-week lows, while two-year yields slid to two-week troughs.  Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.8894 percent, from 2.926 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 21/32 in price to yield 3.0228 percent, from 3.055 percent late on Monday. In currencies the dollar and the yen rose as investors piled in to currencies that are perceived less risky. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last up 0.24 percent at 95.02 after earlier reaching 95.296, its highest since last July. The euro EUR= was down 0.37 percent at $1.1579.  The Japanese yen strengthened 0.45 percent versus the greenback at 110.07 per dollar.  Earlier, the Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC ended 3.8 percent lower after slumping nearly 5 percent at one point to its lowest level since mid-2016. A skid by China's yuan CNY=CFXS to a five-month low, meanwhile, was its biggest fall in roughly a year and a half.

2018-06-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell on Tuesday ahead of a possible increase in OPEC crude supply, and as an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China unleashed sharp selloffs in many global markets. Brent crude futures LCOc1 slipped 26 cents to settle at $75.08 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 fell 78 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at  $65.07 a barrel. Russia plans to propose increasing oil production by the OPEC+ deal members by 1.5 million barrels per day, Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters, days ahead his visit to Vienna for the related summit. “This renewed commentary by Novak that they’re looking for 1.5 million bpd of production is putting downward pressure on prices in a significant manner.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and  allies, which have curbed supplies since 2017, meet on Friday in Vienna, where they had been expected to come to a decision as to whether to increase global oil production, and by how much.  Iran, however, said OPEC was unlikely to reach a deal on oil output this week, setting the stage for a clash with Saudi Arabia and Russia, which are pushing to raise production steeply from July to meet growing global demand. Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China were also weighing on global markets including oil, said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. The two countries are threatening punitive tariffs on each other’s exports, which could include oil. China’s imports of U.S. oil have surged since 2017 to a value of almost $1 billion per month. Chinese stocks fell to their lowest in almost a year, while in the United States, all three major stock indexes were down, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average erasing its gains for the year. [MKTS/GLOB]  “WTI is more vulnerable to spillover from today’s hard selloff in global equities than is Brent as the differential between the two benchmarks has stretched back to above $10 per barrel,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a note.  Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week, while gasoline and distillate inventories built, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said late Tuesday, ahead of the government’s report on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT).

2018-06-19,"LONDON, June 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world must reject “fear and despondency” wrought by political setbacks and protect hard-won gains to tackle climate change such as the Paris agreement, Norway’s former prime minister said in an interview on Tuesday. Decisions such as U.S. President Donald Trump’s move to pull out of the 2015 Paris deal mark “a tipping point” for the climate, Gro Harlem Brundtland told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “If meaningful action is not taken to protect our hard-won gains in the face of ... fear and despondency, the damage to our ecosystem could be irreparable,” said Brundtland, Norway’s first female prime minister. Trump announced last year his decision to abandon the Paris accord, claiming it would cost the United States trillions of dollars in lost jobs and damage to business. “The reaction to President Trump’s decision, both inside the United States and abroad, paradoxically gives us hope,” Brundtland said on the sidelines of the biennial Barbara Ward lecture convened by the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. “Below the federal level, U.S. states, cities, businesses and citizens have made it clear they reject the administration’s climate policies and are committed to making Paris succeed,” she said. An equally urgent task, said Brundtland, is to figure out how to finance climate action worldwide. Brundtland said wealthy countries must financially support developing nations’ shift to a low-carbon future, for example by finding private investment for green technologies such as electric cars. “This is a matter of climate justice,” she said. “The poorest countries in the world did not create the problem, but they are suffering first and worst from its impacts.” The Paris climate deal, agreed upon by nearly 200 nations, set a goal of keeping the rise in average global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times and ideally to 1.5 degrees. The world has already warmed by about 1 degree. Brundtland, a Harvard University-educated physician who is known as the ""mother of the nation"" in Norway, served as a United Nations special envoy for climate change from 2007 to 2010.

2018-06-19,"CAPE TOWN, June 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In just 30 years, cities around the world will face dramatically higher risks from extreme heat, coastal flooding, power blackouts and food and water shortages unless climate-changing emissions are curbed, urban researchers warned Tuesday. Today, for instance, over 200 million people in 350 cities face stifling heat where average daily peak temperatures hit 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) for three months of the year, according to a study released by C40 Cities, a network of major world cities pushing climate action. But by 2050, more than 1.6 billion people in 970 cities will face those conditions, researchers predicted. The number of people who are both in poverty and battling brutal heat - usually without air conditioning - will rise tenfold, they said. “This is a wake-up call,” said Kevin Austin, deputy executive director of C40 Cities, at an international meeting in the South African city of Cape Town on adapting to climate change. “The magnitude of people affected by heat will be (much) greater than today if we continue to increase greenhouse gases at this rate.” But cities can take action to directly curb the risks, besides working to cut emissions, he said. In Seoul, for example, a major elevated thoroughfare through the center of the city has been removed, opening up access to the river and lowering urban heat in the area by at least half a degree Celsius, he said. South Korea’s capital also has planted more than 16 million trees and created shaded cooling centres for those without air conditioning. “We want to encourage cities to adopt more of these solutions and implement them as quickly as possible. In the worst case scenario, they will need to do them quickly,” Austin said. The research, carried out by the New York-based Urban Climate Change Research Network, looked at data from more than 2,500 cities and predicted likely conditions if emissions continue to rise at their current rate. It found that Cape Town’s ongoing battle with drought-driven water shortages could become far more common, with over 650 million people in 500 cities - among them Sao Paulo and Tehran - likely to see their access to water reduced by 2050. Many thirsty cities are already aiming to set caps on water use per person, with Los Angeles pushing for 200 litres a day, Melbourne for 155 litres and Cape Town a dramatically reduced 50, Austin said. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that an average American today uses at least 300 litres of water per day. Sharing advice on how to make cuts happen - including insights gained in Cape Town, which has slashed its water use by half in the face of extreme drought - can save cities time and help them make changes faster, Austin said. But more cities “need to transition in a planned way, not in response to disaster,” he added. Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille said dealing with a crisis when it arrives leaves little room to manoeuvre. “In a crisis like this there is no time to go by trial and error. You unfortunately have to get it right the first time,” she said at the Adaptation Futures conference in Cape Town. The C40 Cities study also found that by mid-century over 800 million people will live in 570 coastal cities at risk of flooding from weather extremes and sea level rise. Flooding presents a particular risk to urban power supplies, with many power stations located in flood-prone areas - and everything from transportation to heating and hospitals at risk if power plants flood in cities from London to Rio de Janeiro, the study noted. Decentralising power systems - including by getting clean energy from a larger number of smaller power plants - could help cut the risks, researchers said. But flooding risks may be coming faster than expected. Patrick Child, the European Commission’s deputy director-general for research and innovation, said a predicted one metre (3-foot) rise in global sea level, once anticipated by 2100, is now expected by 2070. Last year already saw the highest-ever documented economic losses from severe weather and climate change globally, he said. Experts at the adaptation meeting also predicted that extreme weather could bring cascading problems for cities, with flooding, for instance, triggering everything from disease outbreaks to road failures, food shortages and closed schools. Looking at just one type of problem - such as a health threats from extreme heat, or sea level rise - isn’t enough to capture the risks, said Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and one of the authors of the report. “In cities, all of these impacts interact with each other, and are all happening at the same time,” she said. Solutions also need combined approaches, with engineering efforts to cut flooding, for instance, working hand in hand with things like better protection of flood-absorbing wetlands, Rosenzweig said. She said she hoped the research would help city officials prioritise what changes need to happen first to better protect their citizens from climate threats. In cities “it’s often overwhelming, with so many things to do,” she said. Reporting by Laurie Goering @lauriegoering ; editing by Zoe

2018-06-19,"VIENNA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday OPEC was unlikely to reach a deal on oil output this week, setting the stage for a clash with Saudi Arabia and Russia, which are pushing to raise production steeply from July to meet growing global demand. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Friday to set output policy amid calls from U.S. President Donald Trump and China to cool down oil prices and support the global economy by producing more crude. OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and non-member Russia have proposed gradually relaxing production cuts - in place since the start of 2017 - while OPEC members Iran, Iraq, Venezuela and Algeria have opposed such a move. “I don’t believe at this meeting we can reach agreement. OPEC is not the organization to receive instruction from President Trump ... OPEC is not part of the Department of Energy of the United States,” Iran’s oil minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters after arriving in Vienna, where OPEC is headquartered. Zanganeh said he would leave Vienna on Friday before OPEC holds talks with non-OPEC producers the next day and added a recent rise in oil prices was mainly the fault of Washington, which imposed new sanctions on OPEC members Iran and Venezuela. Trump has called on OPEC to raise output, and Saudi Arabia and Russia said in recent weeks the world needed more oil. “Oil demand usually grows at the steepest pace in the third quarter ... We could face a deficit if we don’t take measures,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday. “In our view, this could lead to market overheating.” Novak said Russia wanted OPEC and non-OPEC to raise output by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), effectively wiping out existing production cuts of 1.8 million bpd that have helped rebalance the market in the past 18 months and lifted oil prices LCOc1 to $75 per barrel from as low as $27 in 2016. In addition to Iran, OPEC members Iraq, Venezuela and Algeria said they opposed a production increase despite supply outages in countries such as Libya and Venezuela. Demand growth has surprised market watchers on the upside in the past two years, with annual increases exceeding 1.5 percent. Global oil consumption is expected to hit 100 million bpd next year. Novak said that if a decision were taken this week to raise output, OPEC and its allies could meet again in September to review the impact and fine-tune production policy. Iraq and Iran have said they would oppose output increases on the grounds that such moves would breach previous agreements to maintain cuts until the year-end. Both countries would struggle to increase output. Iran faces renewed U.S. sanctions that will impact its oil industry and Iraq has production constraints. Two OPEC sources told Reuters that even Saudi Arabia’s Gulf allies Kuwait and Oman were against big, immediate increases in output. One OPEC source said the Saudi-Russian proposal of a 1.5-million-bpd increase was “just a tactic” aimed at persuading fellow members to compromise on a smaller rise of around 0.5-0.7 million bpd. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have the capacity to raise output. Russia has also said that limiting supply for too long could encourage unacceptably high output growth from the United States, which is not part of the production agreement. On Tuesday, the head of Russia’s second-largest oil firm Lukoil (LKOH.MM), Vagit Alekperov, said global production cuts should be halved and that Lukoil could restore its oil output levels within two to three months. Commerzbank commodities analyst Carsten Fritsch said that given big differences in the positions of OPEC members, the Friday meeting was likely to be tough. “Unanimity is needed for any OPEC decision. This recalls the June 2011 meeting, when OPEC was unable to agree on an increase in production to compensate for the outages ... in Libya,” Fritsch said. “That meeting ended without any joint declaration. The then Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi described it as the worst OPEC meeting of all time.”  Adding to the tensions, Iran and Venezuela continued to insist that OPEC on Friday debate U.S. sanctions against the two countries, but the organization’s secretariat has rejected their requests, according to letters seen by Reuters.

2018-06-19,"(Adds details on halted soybean and ethanol purchases and soy shipments at risk, adds ethanol trader quote) By Karl Plume CHICAGO, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. crop and livestock prices tumbled on Tuesday, with soybean futures hitting lows not seen in nearly a decade, as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, stoking fears the trade battle between the two economic giants would have a wider impact on the global economy. Chicago Board of Trade soybeans fell as much as 6 percent and wheat slumped more than 4 percent. Corn , cotton and ethanol futures notched life-of-contract lows. Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog contacts shed more than 2 percent of their value early on Tuesday. Live cattle futures at one point dropped 1 percent, led by Wall Street’s retreat and a higher dollar that makes U.S. goods less attractive to foreign buyers. Trump’s threat followed his administration’s announcement of tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods last week, which triggered retaliatory tariffs by Beijing on a slate of U.S. products, including soybeans and corn. The U.S. exported $12.4 billion worth of soybeans to China last year, the single most valuable U.S. agricultural export product to its Asian rival. Trade tensions between the world’s top two economies have unnerved farmers and slammed agricultural markets on worries that China - the largest importer of U.S. soybeans, pork and cotton - would slow or halt purchases of those and other U.S. farm goods. U.S. crop farmers have lost an estimated $100 per acre in revenue with the swift escalation in the trade spat over the past two weeks, the most rapid erosion of U.S. farm profit since at least 1979, according to Dan Basse, president of Chicago-based consultancy AgResource Co. Net farm income was already projected to fall 6.7 percent to $59.5 billion in 2018, a 12-year low, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. “When you get in a fight with your biggest buyer of agriculture, and the world’s largest soybean buyer, even if (they) were to buy 20 percent less, it’s a big deal,” Basse said. Concerns about tariffs are already disrupting global trade. China, which imports about two-thirds of all soybeans traded globally, has not bought significant amounts of U.S. soybeans in three weeks. Traders fear that China will begin canceling the more than 3 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans that it has purchased but have yet to ship, valued at more than $1 billion. The country has also not bought significant U.S. ethanol volumes for about six months, despite increased targets for its use there, amid the threat of tariffs on the corn-based biofuel. The U.S. ethanol industry has become more dependent on exports due to big domestic stockpiles. “(China) has to be buying it from somewhere,” said a U.S. ethanol trader who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “It isn’t here.” The trade fight with China comes amid elevated trade tensions with several other top U.S. farm product importers, including Mexico and Canada, over Washington’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The steep grain slump rippled across agricultural commodities markets, with prices for hogs and cattle, which normally benefit from cheap feed prices, also dropping. Stock prices for U.S. grain merchants and meat processors were mixed. Archer Daniels Midland Co shares slipped 0.6 percent to $45.90, and CHS Inc shares lost 0.8 percent to $29.73. Bunge Ltd’s stock was up 1 percent at $71.81.

Soybeans were among the hardest hit after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, a threat that China’s commerce ministry described as “blackmailing,” vowing to retaliate. Government bonds and the Japanese yen rallied as investors sought protection. Oil futures pulled back, with U.S. crude seeing the deepest declines. Wall Street’s three major indexes were lower, though the S&P 500’s decline of less than 1 percent was much more measured than that of overseas markets. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index slumped nearly 5 percent at one point. A preference for more domestically-exposed U.S. sectors such as utilities and telecommunications showed investors were trying to insulate themselves from a trade war, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth in Chicago. “Investors recognize that China sells us about four times the amount of products we sell them so any diminishment in trade is going to hurt them that much more,” said Ablin. “If they were really concerned we were spiraling down the drain they’d sell (defensive) sectors including consumer staples. I don’t think (equity) investors believe this is the end of the world.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 346.91 points, or 1.39 percent, to 24,640.56, the S&P 500 lost 20.39 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,753.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 65.09 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,681.94. But investors in U.S. agricultural commodities appeared to be far more worried. Ablin said Trump may be willing to suffer near-term pain in commodities in a spat that is “less about soybeans and more about intellectual property.” Chicago Board of Trade soybeans fell as much as 6 percent, while wheat slumped more than 4 percent. Corn , cotton and ethanol futures notched life-of-contract lows. Among livestock, Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog contacts for July delivery shed more than 2 percent of their value. “When you get in a fight with your biggest buyer of agriculture, and the world’s largest soybean buyer (China), even if (it) were to buy 20 percent less, it’s a big deal,” said Dan Basse, president of Chicago-based consultancy AgResource Co. In U.S. treasuries, U.S. 10-year and 30-year yields fell to three-week lows on the news, while those on two-year notes slid to two-week troughs. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.8803 percent, from 2.926 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond last rose 27/32 in price to yield 3.0126 percent, from 3.055 percent late on Monday. In currencies the dollar, yen and Swiss franc rose as investors favored currencies that are perceived less risky. The dollar index rose 0.31 percent, with the euro down 0.46 percent to $1.1569, though the euro trimmed some losses as France’s and Germany’s leaders agreed on a euro zone budget. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.57 percent versus the greenback at 109.92 per dollar. The Swiss franc increased 0.4 percent against the euro at 1.1520 franc and was marginally higher versus the greenback at 0.9955 franc. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.7 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.95 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 2 percent while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 2.3 percent lower. The Shanghai Composite Index ended 3.8 percent lower after slumping nearly 5 percent at one point to its lowest level since mid-2016. A skid by China’s yuan to a five-month low, meanwhile, was its biggest fall in roughly a year and a half. Oil fell ahead of a possible increase in OPEC crude supply and due to the trade dispute, as China has threatened to impose tariffs on U.S. crude exports. U.S. crude fell 1.84 percent to $64.64 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.78, down 0.74 percent. With the dollar rising, spot gold dropped 0.2 percent to $1,275.49 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.18 percent to $1,277.80 an ounce. Copper lost 1.94 percent to $6,829.00 a tonne. Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange lost 2.10 percent to $2,173.00 a tonne.

2018-06-19,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House committee will kick off debate next week on three new bills aimed at boosting offshore wind energy leases in federal waters. The House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources will hold a hearing on Tuesday on three bipartisan offshore wind proposals. One proposal would require the Interior Department to develop a leasing plan or schedule for federal offshore leases, a second would create a federal grant for educational or career programs for the offshore industry, and a third would give Interior the authority to manage the federal submerged lands off of territories such as Guam for offshore energy. Turbines can be built on land beneath navigable waters.  The Trump administration has thrown its weight behind the nascent offshore wind industry by streamlining permitting processes and working to open up more areas for lease. The administration views offshore wind as an element in its goal for U.S. energy dominance. “We are committed to working with the Trump administration in pursuing an ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy, which includes a robust offshore renewable component,” according to a committee statement.    The U.S. market for offshore wind has been enjoying fresh momentum due to a sharp drop in costs, and policies in several northeastern states that require utilities to enter into contracts for wind energy generated off their coastlines.  Last month, three Massachusetts utilities were awarded the largest ever U.S. contract for offshore wind, and New Jersey’s governor signed a law that commits his state to procuring 3.5 gigawatts of offshore wind. A wind farm that generates up to 1.5 gigawatts of electricity can power roughly 1 million homes.  European companies have been especially interested in U.S. offshore acreage up for lease.  Mike Olsen, senior director of government affairs at Norway’s Equinor, formerly Statoil, is expected to testify at Tuesday’s hearing.  Statoil Wind has already won a bid for 80,000 acres of offshore leasing rights off of New York’s coast. James Bennett, chief of the Office of Renewable Energy Programs Department at the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Management and Randall Luthi, president of the National Oceans Industries Association are confirmed to testify.

2018-06-19,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine state oil and gas firm Naftogaz said on Tuesday a London court has granted its request to freeze the British assets of Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM), part of its efforts to enforce an earlier arbitration ruling from Sweden.  That ruling, made by the Stockholm arbitration court in February, was meant to conclude a legal battle over gas deliveries. But Naftogaz says Gazprom has not complied with the ruling, which obliged the Russian company to resume gas supplies to Ukraine at market equivalent prices and pay $2.6 billion (1.9 billion pounds). Naftogaz has said it would go to court to seize Gazprom assets in Europe, but would not touch Russian gas transit through Ukraine. “Within 48 hours of receiving the order (which will be deemed to occur when the courier delivers the order to Gazprom’s Moscow office), Gazprom must provide Naftogaz with a list of all its assets with a value greater than $50,000 located in England or Wales,” Naftogaz said in a statement.  It said here the ruling had been made by the Commercial Court in London on June 18. Gazprom said on Tuesday it was aware that Naftogaz is taking efforts to make the ruling of the Stockholm court effective in Britain. “Gazprom will continue defending its rights in accordance with the applicable legislation,” the company said in an emailed comment. It was not clear what assets Gazprom has in England and Wales that could be affected. Gazprom Marketing and Trading here has its headquarters in London where it has more than 450 employees, according to its web site. Earlier this month, Naftogaz said courts in the Netherlands and Switzerland had approved decisions to freeze assets of Gazprom. For its part, the Russian gas giant said it had won an interim appeals court ruling in Sweden that suspends attempts by Naftogaz to seize its foreign assets. Naftogaz has said that it would request that the decision be reversed. “The Swedish court ruling does not suspend the award itself, it only suspends enforcement in Sweden,” Naftogaz quoted its CEO Andriy Kobolyev as saying. “The Transit Award remains valid, and interest continues to accrue and we will seek enforcement in jurisdictions where enforcement is an option,” he added.

Agricultural commodities were also hammered with soybeans feeling the most pain after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods. China’s commerce ministry described the threat as “blackmailing” said Beijing would fight back with “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures.. Government bonds and the Japanese yen rallied as investors sought protection. Oil futures also pulled back with U.S. crude seeing the deepest declines. Wall Street’s three major indexes were lower, though the S&P 500’s decline was much more measured than that of overseas markets.

2018-06-19,"EDINBURGH/LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland’s highest court ruled against petrochemicals company INEOS on Tuesday, after it challenged a devolved Scottish government moratorium against fracking for oil and gas. INEOS, headed by billionaire founder Jim Ratcliffe, argued the Scottish government had imposed an unlawful ban on fracking in October 2017 and had sought a judicial review to overturn it. The Court of Session said the government had not imposed a ban, despite several statements to that effect, and had instead an “emerging and unfinalised planning policy expressing no support on the part of the Scottish government” for fracking. The extraction of oil and gas from tight rocks by fracturing them using chemicals has become a contentious issue in Europe after it helped reverse a fall in U.S. oil output, transformed its gas sector and boosted the economy of several states. Despite that, fracking is also associated with environmental issues such as increased industrial activity, fears over water contamination and objections that it boosts fossil fuel production when more renewable energy should be encouraged. INEOS operates a refinery at Grangemouth, down the Firth of Forth, and ships shale gas from the United States to supply it. It holds the rights, expiring on June 30, to explore for gas over a 400 km area between Glasgow and Falkirk. The devolved Scottish government announced last October it was against fracking, in line with public opinion.  It ordered local authorities to reject planning applications from companies seeking to frack, a measure that energy minister Paul Wheelhouse told parliament was “sufficient to effectively ban the development of unconventional oil and gas extraction”. “The decision that I am announcing means that fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland,” he said then. Judge Lord Pentland said, despite such ministerial statements which he cited in the court opinion, “there is indeed no prohibition against fracking in force at the present time”. INEOS welcomed the court’s decision which it said clarified the “confusion arising out of government announcements”. “Today’s judgement makes it clear the SNP government will now have to make decisions based on facts and science rather than prejudice and political expediency,” it said. “With an environmental assessment and business and regulatory assessments still to be carried out, there may never be a fracking ban in Scotland.” Wheelhouse said, in reaction to the court ruling, that the government’s position against fracking remained unchanged. Just over 100 miles south of the border, British shale gas developer Caudrilla expects to fracture its first two horizontal wells in Blackpool later this year, subject to approvals.

2018-06-19,"FRANKFURT, June 19 (Reuters) - The arrest and detention of Audi’s chief executive forces Volkswagen Group’s competing stakeholders to renegotiate the delicate balance of power that has helped keep Rupert Stadler in office. Volkswagen’s (VW) directors are discussing how to run Audi, its most profitable division, following the arrest of the brand’s long-time boss on Monday as part of Germany’s investigations into the carmaker’s emissions cheating scandal. The discussions risk reigniting tensions among VW’s controlling Piech and Porsche families, its powerful labour representatives and its home region of Lower Saxony. VW has insisted the development of illegal software, also known as “defeat devices” was the work of low level employees, and that no management board members were involved. U.S. prosecutors have challenged this by indicting VW’s former chief executive Martin Winterkorn. Stadler’s arrest raises further questions. Audi and VW said on Monday that Stadler was presumed innocent unless proved otherwise. Munich prosecutors detained Stadler to prevent him from obstructing a probe into Audi’s emissions cheating, they said on Monday. Stadler is being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising. Here are the main players deciding the fate of Audi. AUDI’s ROLE IN DIESELGATE Volkswagen Group was plunged into crisis in 2015 after U.S. regulators found Europe’s biggest carmaker had equipped cars with software to cheat emissions tests on diesel engines. The technique of using software to detect a pollution test procedure, and to increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests, was first developed at Audi. “In designing the defeat device, VW engineers borrowed the original concept of the dual-mode, emissions cycle-beating software from Audi,” VW said in its plea agreement with U.S. authorities in January 2017, in which the company agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to reach a settlement with U.S. regulators. Audi engineers developed a 3.0 liter diesel engine which was later also used in VW and Porsche models sold in the United States between 2009 and 2016. Stadler has denied any involvement in cheating, and Audi even denied the existence of illegal engine management software after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation against Audi on Nov. 2, 2015. Audi eventually admitted to violations on Nov. 19, 2015, according to VW’s plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice from January 2017. The deal revealed that Audi employees were also involved in a cover up once U.S. regulators began asking questions. “Within VW AG and Audi AG, thousands of documents were deleted by approximately 40 VW and Audi AG employees,” VW’s plea agreement revealed. In May 2017, Stadler was awarded a five-year contract extension until the end of 2022, but only because of a closed-door pact among supervisory board members that he would not serve out his full term, two sources close to the company’s supervisory board told Reuters at the time. Stadler has enjoyed backing from the Porsche and Piech families who control Porsche SE, the family’s holding company which has a 52 percent stake in VW. Stadler is close to the families because of his prior role at VW, where he was chief of staff to Ferdinand Piech, the former chairman and chief executive of VW. Piech and his cousin Wolfgang Porsche, who currently heads the family clan that controls VW, are grandchildren of Ferdinand Porsche who developed the iconic VW Beetle. Stadler’s continued presence at the helm of Audi has been criticised by VW’s labour representatives, who have half the seats on the carmaker’s supervisory board. Under pressure to cut costs within the VW empire in the wake of more than $25 billion in fines and penalties for emissions cheating, labour leaders have called on Stadler to cut costs at Audi and take responsibility for his division’s failings. Audi is the most profitable division within the VW group, which also owns the Skoda, Bentley, Bugatti and Porsche brands. The 20-seat VW supervisory board, or board of directors, grants equal representation to workforce and shareholder representatives. But VW differs from other German companies in one respect - Lower Saxony, where VW is headquartered, gets two of the 10 shareholder seats, tipping the balance of power. Analysts say the representatives from Lower Saxony and the workforce share the common goal of protecting jobs at the region’s biggest company, which employs over 100,000 people in the northwestern German state. PORSCHE-PIECH CLAN The Porsche and Piech families, controlling 52 percent of the votes in VW through Porsche SE, have the power to force change at VW, but have largely kept silent over “dieselgate”. The ruling clan encompasses about 80 people with diverse interests and careers ranging from design to real estate, with patriarchs Ferdinand Piech and Wolfgang Porsche being slow to hand the wheel over to their children. The clan lost its dominant figure at VW in April 2015 when Ferdinand Piech, who spearheaded its global expansion, quit as chairman after more than two decades at VW’s helm following a power struggle with then CEO Martin Winterkorn. With Piech gone, his cousin Wolfgang Porsche leads the family, which now occupies four seats on the supervisory board. In 2009, Qatar emerged as a VW stakeholder after it helped stabilise Porsche Automobil Holding SE’s rocky finances in the wake of the Stuttgart-based company’s failed takeover attempt of VW. A portfolio of derivatives on VW shares that Porsche had accumulated was hastily sold to Qatar, which now owns a 17 percent VW stake. Frustrated with the pace of reform at VW, Qatar had asked the carmaker for a seat on the company’s executive committee in 2016, a request that failed amid substantial opposition. Qatar has two seats on the supervisory board of VW.

2018-06-19,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen suspended Audi boss Rupert Stadler and announced an interim replacement on Tuesday, seeking to steady its most profitable business after German authorities arrested Stadler as part of an emissions probe. Audi said Stadler, 55, had requested to temporarily step down from his position, and named sales executive Abraham Schot as an interim replacement with immediate effect, confirming an earlier Reuters story. Stadler’s arrest has thrown Volkswagen (VW) back into turmoil almost three years after it admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines. Analysts said the arrest raised questions about whether Europe’s biggest carmaker had done enough to reform in the wake of the crisis, and that it threatened a delicate truce among the group’s powerful stakeholders, who had previously clashed about whether Stadler should remain in power. Schot joined the VW group in 2011 after having worked as president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Italia. He has been Audi board member for sales and marketing since last September. Munich prosecutors arrested Stadler at his home in Ingolstadt in the early hours of Monday, saying they saw a risk  he could try to suppress evidence. Prosecutors tapped his phone, a person familiar with the investigation told Reuters. He remains remanded in custody in Augsburg, but has not been charged with a crime.    VW and Audi said on Monday that Stadler was presumed innocent unless proven otherwise.  Last week, Munich prosecutors said they were investigating Stadler for suspected fraud and false advertising and for his alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the European market. VW has set aside around $30 billion (£22.7 billion) to cover the cost of fines, vehicle refits and lawsuits arising from its “dieselgate” scandal, and is spending billions more on electric vehicles to try to rebuild its reputation.    VW has for years said only lower-level managers knew of the emissions cheating. However, U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against former VW boss Martin Winterkorn earlier this year, and German prosecutors continue to investigate. The technique of using software to detect a pollution test procedure, and to increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests, was first developed at Audi. “In designing the defeat device, VW engineers borrowed the original concept of the dual-mode, emissions cycle-beating software from Audi,” VW said in its plea agreement with U.S. authorities in January 2017, in which the company agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to reach a settlement with U.S. regulators. Stadler has been under fire from the media, politicians and VW’s powerful trade unions for his handling of the scandal, but he survived a management reshuffle announced in August thanks to backing from the Piech and Porsche families that control VW.     Peter Mosch, deputy chairman on Audi’s supervisory board and head of its works council, said labour representatives had backed a move to appoint Schot as interim CEO to ensure that Audi’s business did not suffer from the leadership crisis. “For the employees it is now important that the interim CEO returns the company to calmer waters, drives the (diesel) investigation and brings it to a conclusion, but mostly keeps the day-to-day business in view,” he said in a statement. At 1415 GMT, VW shares were down 3 percent at 151.48 euros, extending Monday’s decline.

2018-06-19,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund’s process to blacklist firms for producing too much greenhouse gases has taken longer than expected, but recent clarifications from its ethics watchdog could mean a decision is near, a top official told Reuters. The fund is the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, with stakes in over 9,000 companies worldwide. It is forbidden from investing in firms that produce nuclear weapons or landmines, or are involved in the production of tobacco, among other criteria. Carbon emissions became a criteria for exclusion from the fund in 2016 and last year the Council on Ethics recommended “a small handful” of firms be excluded for producing too much greenhouse gas emissions in either the oil, cement and steel sectors. Since then recommendations have been under review with the board of the central bank, which oversees the fund. “We sent a letter to the council for further interpretation of that criteria and we just now got an answer, so the process is moving forward,” Deputy Central Bank Governor Egil Matsen told Reuters. “We will deal with the reply internally in the bank during the next weeks and months, but I can’t say exactly how long it will take,” Matsen said, adding that the dialogue with the council had been extensive. He said the main difficulty had been to define and limit this new type of criteria based on the companies’ conduct or behavior, rather than their products.

2018-06-19,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Many Egyptians hoped to ignore their economic hardship as they celebrated the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Instead, they were told they will have to tighten their belts even more. With the Eid al-Fitr feast in full swing, the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday declared it was slashing fuel subsidies, pushing up prices of petrol and public transport by as much as 50 percent. People returning to work in Cairo on Tuesday seethed at the new sums they had to pay to board buses or fill up their vehicles with petrol. “We knew there were going to be price rises, but didn’t expect it to be this big,” said Sabah Hassan, a mother of six who works as a cleaner at a nursery. Hassan said her transportation costs have jumped from around 5 pounds per trip ($0.28) to at least 10 ($0.56). “My household gas has doubled, and so has my water bill - how will my 1,000-pound ($55) wages cover it all?” The fuel price increase was the latest in a raft of austerity measures Egypt is carrying out as part of major economic reforms, the price of a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. The country’s economy, which was battered by the unrest that followed a 2011 popular uprising, has begun to improve since Sisi came to power in 2014. Authorities and many economists credit the reforms with helping to attract long-term foreign investment and accelerate growth in gross domestic product. But fiscal reforms have hit ordinary Egyptians hard. The fuel subsidy cuts came just days after the government said prices for electricity would rise by an average of 26 percent and for piped drinking water by nearly half. Sisi, who was re-elected against virtually no competition in a landslide April vote, has urged patience from the Egyptian people, saying recently the country could only reap the benefits of austerity with everyone on board. “I don’t like to talk about other countries, but I hope we take note,” he said earlier this month in an apparent reference to protests over tax rises in Jordan - warning that similar unrest in Egypt threatened stability. The government has said it will increase welfare spending to help out poor Egyptians. Some Egyptians said they would willingly foot the bill for stability and an improved economy. Aside from economic problems, Egypt faces an Islamist militancy in its Sinai Peninsula. “It’ll cost me more to fuel my motorbike, but this is a small price to pay to support Sisi and put Egypt back on track,” said Ahmed Mohamed, a 36-year-old cafe worker. Mohamed said he was glad to see the back of the 2011 uprising that had toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak and then the Muslim Brotherhood. Other Egyptians did not share his views. “Sisi should think of ordinary people for once,” said Nermin, a textile industry manager, declining to give her full name. “All we do is spend, and see nothing in return.” A taxi driver, who gave his name as Mohamed Mubarak, said it was becoming more and more expensive to run his car. “In Mubarak’s days, I would go to the petrol station with 50 pounds, fill her up, and have money left. Now it’s 140 pounds. All for the sake of tahiya Masr (long live Egypt)”, he said, mocking a Sisi slogan. Despite discontent, most Egyptians said they had no plans to protest - out of fear of chaos that might follow, or of arrest. Rare, small-scale protests broke out last month over a sudden increase in fares on Cairo’s metro system. Several people were arrested in connection with the demonstrations, which were made illegal in 2013 without permission from the interior ministry. “No one will raise their voice - people are scared and feel shackled,” Mubarak said. He charged 30 pounds for a normally 20-pound fare.

2018-06-19,"* Options could involve state-owned bank KfW - source * State Grid keen on 20 pct stake in 50Hertz - sources * Chinese group failed to buy stake previously (Recasts, adds info from sources) FRANKFURT, June 19 (Reuters) - Germany is considering options to prevent Chinese utility State Grid from buying a 20 percent stake in local network operator 50Hertz, which is majority-owned by Belgium’s Elia, a government source familiar with the matter said. The person said several options were being considered and German state-owned development bank KfW could play a role in deliberations. The source did not give further details. State Grid had previously tried to buy a 20 percent stake in 50Hertz from Australian infrastructure fund IFM but failed after Elia exercised a pre-emptive right, thereby raising its stake to 80 percent. IFM now wants to sell its remaining 20 percent stake and has already struck an agreement to sell it to State Grid, sources have said. Elia has until the end of July to decide whether it wants to pre-empt again. State Grid’s interest in 50Hertz is viewed critically by Berlin. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said last week he saw a problem in letting critical infrastructure fall into the hands of investors whose motivation and background were not clear, citing 50Hertz as an example. German business paper Handelsblatt earlier reported that Elia could buy the remaining stake and hand it over to KfW to ensure State Grid did not obtain it. The paper cited people close to the negotiations. Elia in March paid 976.5 million euros ($1.1 billion) to IFM for a 20 percent stake in 50Hertz. Elia, 50Hertz, Germany’s Economy Ministry and State Grid all declined to comment. $1 = 0.8654 euros

2018-06-19,"JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Reuters) - The South African Institute of Charted Accountants (SAICA) said on Tuesday said it would charge former Eskom’s chief financial officer Anoj Singh with serious misconduct related to a 600 million rand ($43 million) loan to the Gupta business family. Singh was suspended as CFO of the cash-strapped state firm last July before resigning in January as investigations into corruption at Eskom began. Eskom came under scrutiny in 2017 after leaked documents put it at the centre of allegations of improper dealings in the granting of lucrative coal-supply contracts to companies linked to the Guptas and former president Jacob Zuma. The Guptas and Zuma have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. But their relationship will be the focus of a government corruption inquiry due to start in August. SAICA said Singh’s conduct was “dishonest and irregular” and that a number of financial decisions he made showed a conflict of interest and undue influence by external players. It said Singh improperly authorised a 600 million rand pre-payment to Gupta-owned Tegeta Exploration and Resources to acquire Optimum Coal, which supplies the fossil-fuel to Eskom. The utility generates the lion’s share of its power from coal. Singh has 21 days to respond to the charges, SAICA said in a statement. The body said it had full power to caution, reprimand and impose a maximum fine of 250,000 rand per charge. Singh did not respond to telephone calls and texts from Reuters seeking comment. $1 = 13.8601 rand

2018-06-19,"* Risk sentiment hurt as Trump threatens China with new tariffs * China shares slump almost 4 percent * MSCI Asia-Pacific index slides to lowest since early February * European stocks 1-1.5 percent lower, Wall Street futures down 1-1.3 pct * Industrial metals fall around 2 percent, oil waits on OPEC By Marc Jones LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks fell almost 4 percent and alarm bells rang across global markets on Tuesday, as trade tensions between the United States and China escalated further. The yuan also hit a five-month low overnight after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing in turn warned about $50 billion of retaliatory penalties on U.S. goods . Asian stocks wilted to a four-month low and Australia’s dollar, South Africa’s rand and the euro were among a diverse group of currencies caught in the crossfire. Europe’s main equity benchmarks sank 1 to 1.5 percent and Wall Street futures were pointing to similar declines, while Government bonds and the Japanese yen rallied as investors sought protection. “You only have to look at how far the main Shanghai index has fallen to see that people would probably want some safe-haven assets at this point,” said DZ Bank analyst Andy Cossor. China’s falls came after it had warned it would take “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures if the U.S. government published an additional list of tariffs on its products. The trade frictions have unnerved financial markets, with investors and businesses increasingly worried that a full-blown trade battle could derail global growth. “Trump appears to be employing a similar tactic he used with North Korea, by blustering first in order to gain an advantage in negotiations,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “The problem is, such a tactic is unlikely to work with China.” Shares of planemaker Boeing, which have acted as a proxy for U.S. - China tensions in recent months as it is the single largest U.S. exporter to the country, fell 2.1 percent U.S. ‘premarket’ moves. Overnight the Shanghai Composite Index had slumped nearly 5 percent at one point to its lowest level since mid-2016, as more than 1,000 stocks slumped by their 10 percent daily limit. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also shed as much 3 percent and MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index fell 1.9 percent to its lowest since early December. The losses had intensified through the day as the rout deepened in China. China’s economy is already clouded by a sharp slowdown in fixed asset investment growth because of the government’s de-leveraging drive, a problematic property sector, mounting debt  and rising credit defaults. “The rising risk of a disruptive trade conflict makes a bad situation tentatively worse,” economists at Nomura wrote. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.8 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI retreated 1.5 percent. Australian stocks bucked the trend and stayed steady, helped by a depreciating currency and an overnight bounce in commodity prices. The dollar fell 0.75 percent to 109.715 yen following Trump’s tariff comments. The yen is often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions. Most other currencies lost against the dollar, though. The U.S. currency gained 0.6 percent on the euro to a near 11-month high at $1.1554. The skid by China’s yuan to a five-month low was its biggest fall in a year and a half. The Australian dollar , often considered a proxy for China-related trades, brushed a one-year low of $0.7381 too. “In the global environment - and due in particular to this trade issue - the risks are more on the downward side and a little bit worrying,” European Central Bank policymaker Jan Smets said in a CNBC interview. “Basically it is not good news.” With Russia and Saudi Arabia pushing for higher output, crude oil markets remained volatile ahead of Friday’s OPEC meeting. Brent crude futures fell 0.6 percent to $74.88 a barrel after rallying 2.5 percent overnight, while U.S. light crude futures retreated 1.4 percent to $65.27. Lower-risk assets gained on the latest round of trade threats. Spot gold was steady at $1,282.26 an ounce. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield - yields move inversely to price - touched 2.871 percent, its lowest since June 1. Most European yields dropped, too, with Germany’s 10-year government Bund, the benchmark for the region, at a two-week low of 0.363 percent. At the same time, Italian government bonds, which are considered less safe and have suffered from recent domestic political ructions, sold off, with their 10-year yields up 2 bps at 2.58 percent. But the stress was highest in emerging markets, where the average yield on domestic currency debt was the highest since March 2017 and fast approaching 7 percent. Industrial metals also buckled with copper tumbling 1.9 percent in its ninth fall in the last 10 sessions and nickel down 2.1 percent. “Escalation (of trade tensions) is a sort of impossible thing to forecast, but if it stops at this level you have probably created some nice risk premia in Asia and emerging markets,” said Hans Peterson, global head of asset allocation at SEB Investment Management. “So if it doesn’t get worse, it is probably a buying opportunity.” Additional reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan in London and

2018-06-19,"* EDF: 10-day strike from June 19-June 29 * France hit with strikes across country * But some signs that protests have been losing momentum (Recasts with EDF statement, grid operator data) PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - France’s EDF said workers had gone on strike on Tuesday at the utility’s hydroelectric plants and that a fall in power output was possible, although latest data from the grid operator showed no dip for the moment. Earlier, EDF said it had received notice from employees of their plans to launch a 10-day strike, the latest in a series of walkouts to hit the transport and energy sectors of the euro zone’s second biggest economy. State-controlled EDF did not give more details on the impact of the industrial action. Data on grid operator RTE’s website showed that at 1145 GMT hydropower output exceeded levels registered 24 hours earlier. Hydropower accounted for 10.1 percent of France’s power supply in 2017. The far-left CGT trade union said in a statement that the strike was a protest against government plans to sell down the state’s stake in energy group Engie and against broader reforms in the energy sector. The CGT workers are striking alongside workers from the left-wing Force Ouvriere union. They argue that energy is a strategic asset and should remain in public hands. The industrial action at EDF comes after President Emmanuel Macron appeared last week to have broken the back of rail strikes over reform of the SNCF state railway monopoly after parliament approved new legislation. Yet transport costs for grain firms have spiralled following the rail strike, raising the risk that the EU’s biggest crop producer could be saddled with more stocks than expected when the summer harvest arrives. Air France too has been hit with strikes in a dispute over pay, although Air France unions on Monday suspended a planned four-day strike planned for this week.

2018-06-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain still plans to end the sale of new diesel and petrol cars by 2040 and will set out more detail as soon as this week, a government source told Reuters on Tuesday after a report suggested the plans were being watered down. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative government said last year it would ban new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 although the Financial Times said on Monday that the plans had been downgraded to a “mission”. There has also been confusion over whether the proposals will include hybrid models, which have both an electric and combustion engine. A government source told Reuters that there had been no change. “We will end the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel engine cars by 2040,” the source said on condition of anonymity. “It’s not government policy to ban hybrids.” The earliest ministers will detail the plans, known as “Road to Zero”, is on Wednesday but they are unlikely to come so soon, the source added. The document has already been delayed as Britain’s transport, business and environment ministries discuss the final proposals. Carmakers have been particularly angry about any restrictions on hybrid models, which are seen by some as a transitional technology as the uptake of purely electric cars ramps up.

Swedish utility Vattenfall [VATN.UL] and Dutch-German grid operator TenneT agreed last week to conduct a feasibility study on the link, called WindConnector, which Vattenfall says could lower the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the shore. Gunnar Groebler, Vattenfall’s senior vice president for wind business, told Reuters the study would be completed by the end of 2018 or early 2019, and the link could be in place after 2023. He said the cable would help reduce the costs of wind power, which now has to compete with smaller subsidies. He said the project “makes the whole business case much more attractive.” The new link could offer Britain an additional source of renewable energy as it works to phase out coal power by 2025. TenneT and Vattenfall will need to address regulatory issues, such as how wind farms linked to the cable will be treated under subsidy schemes in their respective countries. “Obviously we have a tonne of regulatory questions on that. When a wind farm feeds to one country and another country, how is that treated from support scheme perspective, renewable balance?” said Groebler. Vattenfall has estimated that the cable would likely have 400 to 500 megawatts (MW) capacity, but the partners have yet to confirm the final cable capacity and which wind farms it would link to. The cost also has to be determined, Groebler said. Vattenfall wants to be involved in new wind farm projects in Britain and the Netherlands, as well as Germany, Denmark, France and the Nordic nations, Chief Executive Magnus Hall told Reuters on the sidelines of the firm’s capital markets day. Vattenfall already runs wind farms with total generation capacity of 2.8 gigawatt (GW) in Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Germany, with a further 0.7 GW under construction.

2018-06-19,"* Risk sentiment hurt as Trump threatens China with new tariffs * China shares slump almost 4 percent * MSCI Asia-Pacific index slides to lowest since early February * European stocks 1-1.5 percent lower, Wall Street futures down * Industrial metals fall around 2 percent, oil waits on OPEC By Marc Jones LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks fell almost 4 percent and alarm bells rang across global markets on Tuesday, as trade tensions between the United States and China escalated further. The yuan also hit a five-month low overnight after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on another $200 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing in turn warned about $50 billion of retaliatory penalties on U.S. goods . Asian stocks wilted to a four-month low and Australia’s dollar, South Africa’s rand and the euro were among a diverse group of currencies caught in the crossfire. Europe’s main equity benchmarks sank 1 to 1.5 percent and Wall Street futures were pointing to similar declines there . Government bonds and the Japanese yen rallied as investors sought protection. “You only have to look at how far the main Shanghai index has fallen to see that people would probably want some safe-haven assets at this point,” said DZ Bank analyst Andy Cossor. China’s falls came after it had warned it would take “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures if the U.S. government published an additional list of tariffs on its products. The trade frictions have unnerved financial markets, with investors and businesses increasingly worried that a full-blown trade battle could derail global growth. “Trump appears to be employing a similar tactic he used with North Korea, by blustering first in order to gain an advantage in negotiations,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “The problem is, such a tactic is unlikely to work with China.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.9 percent to its lowest since early December. The losses had intensified through the day as the rout deepened in China. The Shanghai Composite Index slumped nearly 5 percent at one point to its lowest level since mid-2016 as more than 1,000 stocks slumped by their 10 percent daily limit. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed as much 3 percent. China’s economy is already clouded by a sharp slowdown in fixed asset investment growth because of the government’s de-leveraging drive, a problematic property sector, mounting debt  and rising credit defaults. “The rising risk of a disruptive trade conflict makes a bad situation tentatively worse,” economists at Nomura wrote. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.8 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI retreated 1.5 percent. Australian stocks bucked the trend and stayed steady, helped by a depreciating currency and an overnight bounce in commodity prices. The dollar fell 0.75 percent to 109.715 yen following Trump’s tariff comments. The yen is often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions. Most other currencies lost against the dollar, though. The U.S. currency gained 0.4 percent on the euro to a near 11-month high at $1.1547. The skid by China’s yuan to a five-month low was its biggest fall in a year and a half. The Australian dollar , often considered a proxy for China-related trades, brushed a one-year low of $0.7381 too. “In the global environment - and due in particular to this trade issue - the risks are more on the downward side and a little bit worrying,” European Central Bank policymaker Jan Smets said in a CNBC interview. “Basically it is not good news.” With Russia and Saudi Arabia pushing for higher output, crude oil markets remained volatile ahead of Friday’s OPEC meeting. Brent crude futures fell 0.6 percent to $74.88 a barrel after rallying 2.5 percent overnight, while U.S. light crude futures retreated 1.4 percent to $65.27. Lower-risk assets gained on the latest round of trade threats. Spot gold was steady at $1,282.26 an ounce. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield - yields move inversely to price - touched 2.871 percent, its lowest since June 1. Most European yields dropped, too, with Germany’s 10-year government Bund, the benchmark for the region, at a two-week low of 0.363 percent. At the same time, Italian government bonds, which are considered less safe and have suffered from recent domestic political ructions, sold off, with their 10-year yields up 2 bps at 2.58 percent. But the stress was highest in emerging markets, where the average yield on domestic currency debt was the highest since March 2017 and fast approaching 7 percent. Industrial metals also buckled with copper tumbling 1.9 percent in its ninth fall in the last 10 sessions and nickel down 2.1 percent. “Escalation (of trade tensions) is a sort of impossible thing to forecast, but if it stops at this level you have probably created some nice risk premia in Asia and emerging markets,” said Hans Peterson, global head of asset allocation at SEB Investment Management. “So if it doesn’t get worse, it is probably a buying opportunity.” Additional reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan in London and

Femi Adesina, in an emailed statement issued on Tuesday, said the spending plan passed by parliament last month would be signed on Wednesday at 12 p.m. (1100 GMT). Africa’s top oil producer emerged from its first recession in 25 years in 2017, helped by higher crude prices, but growth remains fragile. The recession was largely caused by low crude prices and militant attacks on energy facilities, since oil sales make up two-thirds of government revenue. Parliament passed a 9.12 trillion naira (29.8 billion) spending plan last month which is higher than the 8.6 trillion naira budget presented to parliament by Buhari in November, because lawmakers increased the assumed oil price to $51 per barrel, from $45. The spending plan must be signed by the president to be passed into law, but it was not immediately clear whether Buhari would sign off on the budget in its expanded form.

2018-06-19,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is examining whether to extend measures to control imports of solar panels from China, a move that could fuel tensions with Beijing which had welcomed plans to phase them out in September. The Commission is studying a request from at least one EU solar panel producer to open an “expiry review”, according to EU sources familiar with the procedure.  Controls would remain in place for the duration of a review — about a year — and for longer if the Commission found reason to prolong them. The Commission should decide whether to conduct a review in August. The European Union extended anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures for Chinese solar panels, wafers and cells by 18 months in March 2017, signaling that they should then end. Chinese solar panel makers are allowed to sell their products in Europe free of duties if they do so at a minimum price that has progressively declined. If sold for less, they are subject to a duty of up to 64.9 percent. The European Union has faced a delicate balancing act between the interests of EU manufacturers and those pressing for a reduction in the cost of solar power generation. It has also been concerned about the response from Beijing given the two sides were on the verge of a trade war over the issue in 2013. EU ProSun, the grouping of EU producers that launched the initial complaint in 2012, said there were good reasons for measures to be prolonged. The minimum price was approaching the international market price, as designed, but the latter was a reflection of Chinese overcapacity rather than the cost of production, it said. Beijing’s own decision to limit installations meant Chinese producers had some 20-30 gigawatts of excess capacity to shift with few markets to sell into after tariffs imposed by the United States and considered by India, the second and third largest markets behind China. The total EU market is some 7 gigawatts. SolarPower Europe, which represents those in the solar industry opposed to duties, said it did not see how a phase-out would really harm EU producers, given the two largest were either closed or in liquidation despite the measures. The two sides dispute whether lower costs will spur installations. SolarPower Europe referred to Commission and EY studies indicating demand could increase by up to 30 percent, creating about 45,000 jobs if the measures were removed. EU ProSun says lower prices over the last five years have not boosted demand, which it says is determined by installation caps and rules set by individual countries.

2018-06-19,"June 19 (Reuters) - All of Britain’s biggest energy companies have announced price increases this year, citing higher wholesale prices and the cost of government policies to support renewable energy generation. Britain’s dominant energy companies have been under scrutiny by the government, which is putting a price cap on standard variable tariffs to combat what it has called “rip off” energy prices. Energy regulator Ofgem said the cap should be in place by the end of the year. Below are tariff changes so far this year (in alphabetical order): Centrica-owned British Gas is increasing its standard variable tariff for electricity and gas by an average of 5.5 percent from May 29. The move will add 60 pounds ($79) to annual bills for 4.1 million customers on the tariff, raising them to an average of 1,161 pounds, the company said. EDF Energy, a unit of French utility EDF, said it will increase the cost of its standard dual fuel energy bills by 1.4 percent (or 16 pounds) to 1,158 pounds a year from June 7. E.ON said it would raise the price of its standard dual fuel bill by 4.8 percent from August 16 to reflect higher increases in wholesale and policy costs. The rise equates to around an extra 55 pounds per year, it said. Npower, owned by Germany’s Innogy, will raise its variable dual fuel bill by 5.3 percent as of June 17, impacting about 1 million customers. The rise represents a 64 pound increase on annual bills and a direct debit customer on the tariff will typically pay 1230 pounds  ($1,633) a year. The hike is made up of average rises of 4.4 percent on gas and 6.2 percent on electricity. Iberdrola-owned Scottish Power said it will raise standard variable domestic gas and electricity prices from June 1 by an average 5.5 percent, or 63 pounds on a typical annual dual fuel bill. The move will affect around a third of homes supplied by Scottish Power, around 960,000. SSE said it would raise the price of its standard dual fuel bill by 6.7 percent from July 11 to reflect sustained increases in wholesale and policy costs. The rise equates to a typical annual bill increase of 76 pounds and will affect 2.36 million customer of SSE and M&S Energy, which is supplied by SSE.

2018-06-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - E.ON will raise prices for British customers taking both gas and electricity by 4.8 percent from Aug. 16, the German utility said on Tuesday, the last of the “big six” energy suppliers to increase its tariffs. The move follows similar increases announced this year by the other five big suppliers in the country, and comes as regulator Ofgem is working to set a cap on standard prices by the end of the year. The British government has asked Ofgem to put the price cap on to combat what it has called “rip off” energy prices. Utilities have denied overcharging, but the Competition and Markets Authority found they had overcharged some British households a total of 1.4 billion pounds a year on average from 2012 to 2015, prompting the government to act. E.ON said the increase was needed “due to the significant rise in the cost of wholesale energy, and in common with similar pressures faced by a number of other suppliers of all sizes across the industry over recent months.”  It said wholesale energy costs have increased more than 20 percent since March, largely due to the impact of extremely cold temperatures earlier this year depleting European gas storage. E.ON said the latest rise equated to an average extra cost of 55 pounds per year per customer, and it had not increased its standard gas and electricity unit prices since April 2017. However, earlier this year it changed the way it structured bills including scrapping discounts for people who take both gas and electricity from the company and for those who opt for paperless billing, which added around 22 pounds per year to average bills. Britain’s big six energy suppliers, controlling around 80 percent of the market are Centrica’s British Gas, SSE, E.ON, EDF Energy, Innogy’s Npower and Iberdrola’s Scottish Power.

2018-06-19,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - Major U.S. energy companies including Plains All American Pipeline, Hess Corp and Kinder Morgan Inc are among many seeking exemptions from steel-import tariffs as the United States ratchets up trade tensions with exporters including China, Canada and Mexico. There have been nearly 21,000 requests overall for exclusions submitted to the U.S. Commerce Department since the Trump administration imposed levies this year. Of those, more than 500 petitions involve pipes and related materials. Initial decisions are expected this month, offering the first clues as to how the administration will balance an agenda favoring oil and gas exports while also supporting the U.S. steel and aluminum industries. For the energy industry, the potential for relief has taken on added importance after China surprised markets last week by proposing 25 percent levies on about $1 billion a month in U.S. oil imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. The pipeline industry could face higher costs from tariffs as about 77 percent of the steel used in U.S. pipelines is imported, according to a 2017 study for the pipeline industry. Benchmark hot-rolled U.S. steel coil prices are up more than 50 percent from a year ago, according to S&P Global Platts. Pipelines from the nation’s largest oilfield in west Texas to the Gulf Coast are nearly full, depressing crude prices as output is projected to rise by about 850,000 barrels per day this year, and significant projects are not expected to be completed until at least next year. Plains sought a tariff exclusion for its 500-mile Cactus II oil pipeline, which will connect West Texas oil fields to export docks near Corpus Christi, Texas. This month, it expects to receive its first material from Corinth Pipeworks SA, a Greek manufacturer, according to a Commerce Department filing. “We think tariffs would be unjust, but we can tolerate” them, Greg Armstrong, chief executive of Plains All American Pipeline, told investors this month, adding that tariffs and import quotas could hurt U.S. production growth. No U.S. mills can produce pipe with the specifications needed for Plains’ line. Only three mills in the world make such pipe, and delivery delays could exacerbate constraints, the company wrote in its petition, affecting the price of oil from the largest U.S. oilfield. The 585,000-barrel per day line is due to start flowing next year, just as analysts warn a bottleneck of crude could force some producers to shut in production. Total pipeline, rail and local refining capacity from the Permian Basin oilfield in March was 3.175 million barrels per day (bpd), according to energy intelligence service Genscape, just shy of the oilfield’s roughly 3.3 million bpd output in June. Rival pipeline operator Kinder Morgan also wants an exclusion for its $1.75 billion Gulf Coast Express natural gas pipeline from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. It ordered 47 percent of specialized pipe needed for the project from Turkish steel maker Borusan Mannesmann. Only one U.S. producer could meet Kinder Morgan’s needs, but it could not meet the volume required within the necessary timeline, Kinder said in a filing. The United States is committed to acting on exclusion requests within 90 days of a petition being posted for comments, a Commerce Department spokesman said. The United States could offer refunds on tariffs paid since a petition became active. For companies unwilling to take the risk of having a request denied, “it may mean cutting back or pushing the timeline out farther” for some projects, said Brigham McCown, former head of regulator U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Oil and gas producer Hess cited safety concerns in a request to use Japanese pipe for its Stampede offshore project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. “Without the ability to use this product, we will not be able to guarantee corrosion resistance in deepwater operations using other currently available steel products - potentially compromising both safety and environmental protection,” the company wrote in its filing. Between 2015 and 2016, the U.S. imported between about $5 billion and $8 billion in steel line pipe, valves and fittings for the pipeline industry, according to a study by consultancy ICF for the American Petroleum Institute. “There’s lots of concern that the increased cost in pipe will increase the costs for our oil,” said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who wants Congress to vote on tariffs imposed under national security grounds. “You pull on one string in international trade and it unravels in ways you could not have predicted.” (Reporting by Liz Hampton; additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder Editing by Tom Brown)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-tariffs/rpt-u-s-oil-pipeline-companies-producers-seek-relief-from-steel-tariffs-idUKL1N1TK1VG,19 Jun 2018,"Major U.S. energy companies

2018-06-19,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - U.S. petroleum company Anadarko has placed staff working on a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in northern Mozambique under “lock-down” due to the threat from suspected Islamist militants in the area, a regional security consultant said on Tuesday. Anadarko, which is looking to raise a record $14-$15 billion for the plant, said last week it was monitoring the situation after a spate of beheadings and kidnappings but declined to comment on specific security issues. The consultant, who is familiar with the security situation, said the firm had prevented its workers from going beyond the perimeter of the planned plant on the coast of Cabo Delgado province, abutting the border with Tanzania. “They can’t leave the site,” the consultant said. Besides Anadarko, Italian energy giant Eni is piling into northern Mozambique to develop gas fields in the offshore Rovuma Basin, believed to hold 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas - enough to supply Germany, Britain, France and Italy for nearly two decades. The first attacks by suspected Islamist militants came in October, when locals reported gangs armed with machetes attacking police stations, torching villages and executing religious leaders. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Tuesday at least 39 people had been killed and more than 1,000 displaced since May. The United States and Britain have advised their citizens to steer clear of the area. Security consultants and domestic media have described the attackers as members of Al-Sunna wa Jama’a, an unknown Islamist group. Locals have also referred to the attackers as “Al-Shabab”, although there are no known links to the Somali group of the same name. People in Cabo Delgado told HRW attackers had burnt a mosque and beheaded an Islamic leader in a June 5 attack in which hundreds of homes were torched and scores of cattle slaughtered. The New York-based rights group also accused the Mozambique security forces of an indiscriminate and heavy-handed response, citing one military unit commander who said his troops would not “waste our time” handing over suspects. “If we find them in the bush, we will kill them there,” the soldier was quoted as saying. A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Mozambique has no history of Islamist militancy and authorities have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists. About 30 percent of Mozambique’s 30 million people are Roman Catholics, while 18 percent are Muslim.

2018-06-19,"* Plans higher July-September exports, refinery runs * Russia has proposed global producers raise output from July 1 * OPEC, non-OPEC producers to meet in Vienna this week By Gleb Gorodyankin and Olga Yagova MOSCOW, June 19 (Reuters) - Ahead of a meeting with Saudi Arabia and other producers, Russia already plans to increase oil exports, its July-September schedule shows, which coupled with increasing refinery runs suggests Moscow is gearing up to raise production. OPEC and non-OPEC producers are scheduled to meet on June 22-23 in Vienna to discuss a possible increase in output after more than a year and a half of coordinated cuts which have taken 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) out of the market. Those cuts, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, having helped slash global oversupply and raised prices by almost $20 a barrel, but there are now calls, from Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak and others, that the deal be re-examined. Crude exports and transit from Russia is expected to rise to 63.34 million tonnes in the July-September quarter from 62.45 million planned for April-June, Russia’s export schedule shows. That works out to an increase of around 20,000 bpd - not significant in itself - but comes alongside plans by Russian refiners to raise third-quarter throughput by 2.2 million tonnes versus the second quarter, energy ministry forecasts show. Raising both would typically require a production increase. Under the deal among OPEC and non-OPEC producers, Russia agreed to cut production by 300,000 bpd compared to its output in October 2016. It has exceeded its production quota for the last three months, however, pumping an average 10.97 million bpd in May - or around 20,000 bpd more than agreed, ministry data showed. Russia could quickly add back at least 300,000 bpd of production, the ministry has said. Top producer Rosneft could increase output by 70,000 bpd in just two days, according to analysts who have recently visited the company.

2018-06-19,"VIENNA, June 19 (Reuters) - Global oil demand is set to stay strong in the second half of 2018, an OPEC technical panel forecast this week, suggesting the market could absorb extra production from the group. OPEC meets on Friday to decide on output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the United States and China to cool down oil prices and therefore support the global economy by producing more crude. OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and non-member Russia have proposed relaxing production cuts gradually, while OPEC members Iran, Iraq, Venezuela and Algeria have opposed such a move. Three sources in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries told Reuters on Tuesday a technical OPEC panel - OPEC’s economic commission - met on Monday to review the market outlook and present it to the ministers later in the week. “If OPEC and its allies continue to produce at May levels then the market could be in deficit for the next six months,” one of the sources said. Another source said: “The market outlook in the second half is strong.” Some countries including Algeria, Iran and Venezuela said at the meeting that they still opposed an oil output increase, one of the sources said.

Violence first broke out in Mozambique’s northern province of Cabo Delgado in October last year, with local residents reporting gangs armed with machetes attacking police stations, torching villages and executing religious leaders. The United States embassy last week advised its citizens to leave the province after attacks increased in a region where Anadarko Petroleum is beginning to develop a $15 billion liquefied natural gas project. Britain has also advised against travelling to the area. The group implicated is known locally as Al-Sunna wa Jama’a and Al-Shabab, although there are no known links to the Somali group of the same name or any other Islamist movement. Residents told Human Rights Watch attackers had burned a mosque and beheaded an Islamic leader in a June 5 attack where hundreds of homes and dozens of cattle were burned. “Armed groups should immediately cease attacking villages and executing people,” Dewa Mavhinga, Southern Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said in a report. “Mozambican authorities should assist those displaced and establish conditions that will allow them to return home voluntarily, in safety and with dignity.” Mozambique has not been a focal point of Islamist militant activity in the past and police have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists.

2018-06-19,"MUNICH, June 19 (Reuters) - Audi’s board of directors will resume talks on Tuesday to address a leadership crisis at Volkswagen’s most profitable brand, sources familiar with the matter said, following Audi chief Rupert Stadler’s arrest. Hours of negotiations by Volkswagen and Audi’s supervisory boards on Monday failed to reach an agreement on how to move on from news that German authorities had detained Stadler as part of their investigation into the group’s emissions test cheating. The arrest of 55-year-old on Monday threw Volkswagen (VW) into turmoil as it struggles to draw a line under the scandal, which emerged after U.S. regulators blew the whistle in September 2015 on the use of illegal software. Stadler has been under fire from the media, politicians and VW’s powerful trade unions for his handling of the scandal, but he survived a major management reshuffle announced in August thanks to backing from the Piech and Porsche families that control Europe’s biggest automaker. Last week, Munich prosecutors said they were investigating Stadler for suspected fraud and false advertising and for his alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the European market. They said the decision to arrest him at his home in Ingolstadt in the early hours of Monday was made because they saw a risk that he could try to suppress evidence. One source has said that Dutchman Bram Schot was the front runner to become interim Audi chief if Stadler is suspended from his duties. VW shares were down 2.6 percent in early trading.

2018-06-19," (This June 18 story has been refiled to add dropped word “boards” in paragraph one.) By Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory boards suspended crisis talks to find a stand-in boss for its Audi brand which were convened after German authorities arrested current Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler as part of a probe into emissions test cheating.  Stadler’s arrest on Monday threw Volkswagen (VW) into turmoil as it struggles to recover from cheating revelations, which emerged after regulators blew the whistle in September 2015 on the carmaker’s use of illegal software. The directors of Audi and Volkswagen discussed how to run its more profitable division without Stadler, but failed to come to a conclusion, the carmaker said late on Monday. “The supervisory boards of VW and Audi have not yet reached a decision and continue to assess the situation,” a spokesman for VW said.      The arrest has kicked off a new debate over VW’s governance which could raise tensions on its supervisory board, putting at risk a fragile truce between management, VW’s controlling Piech and Porsche families, as well as representatives from labour and the region of Lower Saxony. VW has for years said only lower-level managers knew of the emissions cheating, but U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against former VW boss Martin Winterkorn earlier this year, and Munich prosecutors widened their probe into Audi this month. Munich prosecutors said Stadler was being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising and for his alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the European market. Following his arrest, Munich prosecutors said Stadler, the most senior active VW official to be remanded in custody since the scandal broke, was being held on fears he might hinder their investigation. “We need to find a solution for Audi’s leadership for the time when he is not here,” the source familiar with the talks said about Stadler’s position. “We will comment on this later.” Stadler was given additional responsibilities for group sales in a revamp announced by VW’s new Chief Executive Herbert Diess in April. On Monday, VW and Audi directors were discussing the leadership crisis in separate meetings, with one source saying Dutchman Bram Schot was the front runner to become interim Audi chief.  Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said VW’s supervisory board had already picked Schot for the job and only needed the formal approval of Audi’s directors. VW denied any such appointment had been made. VW has set aside around $30 billion to cover fines, vehicle refits and lawsuits since its “dieselgate” scandal broke, and has announced plans to spend billions more on a shift to electric vehicles as it seeks to rebuild its reputation.  Whereas group CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned in the days after the cheating was disclosed, Stadler resisted requests to fall on his sword, and instead received backing from the Porsche and Piech families to remain in his post. “His arrest is another low point in VW’s diesel saga,” said Evercore ISI analysts, who have criticised the group for a slow pace of reform. “Almost three years after the diesel scandal broke, it takes police to take action against the Audi CEO.”    The United States filed criminal charges against Winterkorn in May, but he is unlikely to face U.S. authorities because Germany does not extradite its nationals to countries outside the European Union. The Munich prosecutors said the move against Stadler was not made at the behest of U.S. authorities. The 55-year-old was arrested at his home in Ingolstadt in the early hours on Monday, they said. “The arrest warrant was made because of a risk that evidence might be suppressed,” Stephan Necknig, a spokesman for the Munich prosecutor’s office, told Reuters Television. “During a search last week there were signs that the accused may tamper with evidence. To influence other suspects or witnesses, or people who could provide information to the investigating authorities,” he added. Sueddeutsche Zeitung, citing sources close to the investigation, said prosecutors had tapped Stadler’s phone just before searching his premises last week. Audi and VW said Stadler was presumed innocent unless proved otherwise. Stadler himself was not immediately available for comment. VW shares closed down 3 percent at 156.06 euros, one of the biggest falls by a European blue-chip stock.  Asked whether U.S. authorities were also seeking to arrest Stadler, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said: “As a general matter, the department will neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing investigation.”      Stadler has been under fire since Audi admitted in November 2015 - two months after parent VW - that it also installed illegal “defeat device” software to cheat U.S. emissions tests.  Munich prosecutors are investigating whether Stadler acted swiftly enough to stop deliveries of manipulated Audi models in Europe once emissions problems had emerged, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters. Stadler has held onto his post mainly thanks to the backing of members of VW’s controlling Porsche-Piech families. Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler worked as chief of staff to VW’s former chairman and industry scion Ferdinand Piech. Earlier this month, Munich prosecutors widened their probe at Audi to include Stadler and another member of Audi’s top management, investigating them for suspected fraud and false advertising. Most of VW’s emissions problems have been in the United States, where a total of nine people have been charged and two former VW executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison terms. But investigations are continuing elsewhere. Last week, German prosecutors fined VW 1 billion euros (905.73 million pounds) over the scandal.

2018-06-19,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index slides to lowest since early Feb * European stocks seen opening lower * Risk sentiment hurt as Trump threatens China with new tariffs * Yen, Treasuries and gold gain * Crude oil prices dip after overnight rally loses steam By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, June 19 (Reuters) - Asian stocks sank on Tuesday and Shanghai shares plunged to near two-year lows as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on Chinese goods in an escalating tit-for-tat trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. U.S. and European equity markets looked set to follow Asia into the red. S&P 500 futures were off 1 percent and Dow Jones futures were 1.1 percent lower. Spreadbetters expected Britain’s FTSE to open down 0.3 percent, with Germany’s DAX seen shedding 0.7 percent and France’s CAC losing 0.8 percent. Trump threatened to impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting a swift warning from Beijing of retaliation, as the trade conflict between the world’s two biggest economies quickly escalated. It was retaliation, Trump said, for China’s decision to raise tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods, which came after Trump announced similar tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday. China warned it will take “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures if the U.S. government publishes an additional list of tariffs on its products. The trade frictions have unnerved financial markets, with investors and businesses increasingly worried that a full-blown trade battle could derail global growth. “Trump appears to be employing a similar tactic he used with North Korea, by blustering first in order to gain an advantage in negotiations. The problem is, such a tactic is unlikely to work with China,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “A U.S.-China trade spat alone won’t hurt global growth. But there is always potential for Trump to keep increasing his threats which could have broader implications. Increasing trade has helped growth in emerging markets and this could be negatively affected.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5 percent to its lowest since early February, with losses intensifying through the day as the rout deepened in China. The Shanghai Composite Index slumped nearly 5 percent at one point to its lowest level since mid-2016, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 3 percent. “China’s economy has already been clouded by a sharp slowdown in fixed asset investment growth due to the government’s deleveraging drive, a problematic property sector, a mounting debt burden and rising credit defaults,” economists at Nomura wrote. “The rising risk of a disruptive trade conflict makes a bad situation tentatively worse.” Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.8 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI retreated 1.3 percent while Australian stocks bucked the trend and added 0.1 percent helped by a depreciating currency and an overnight bounce in commodity prices. The dollar fell 0.75 percent to 109.715 yen following Trump’s tariff comments. The yen is often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions. The euro was steady at $1.1622. China’s yuan skidded to a five-month low. The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy to China-related trades, brushed a one-year low of $0.7381. In commodities, crude oil markets remained volatile ahead of Friday’s OPEC meeting at a time when Russia and Saudi Arabia are pushing for higher output. Brent crude futures fell 0.8 percent to $74.76 a barrel after rallying 2.5 percent overnight, while U.S. light crude futures retreated 0.9 percent to $65.27.

The quake in Osaka, Japan’s second-biggest metropolis, killed four people, injured hundreds more and halted factory lines in an industrial area, government and company officials said on Tuesday. Osaka Gas would try to resume normal supplies to affected customers by June 25, ahead of its previous schedule of between June 26 and 30, the company said in a statement. The move comes after Osaka Gas and other firms in the industry nearly tripled the number of staff tackling the restoration effort to about 2,900 from an original plan of 1,000. Piped gas supplies were cut off to about 112,000 Osaka Gas customers in Takatsuki, Ibaraki and two other cities in Osaka prefecture, for safety checks following the quake, the trade ministry said.

Spreadbetters expect European stocks to follow their Asian peers and open lower, with Britain’s FTSE dropping 0.3 percent, Germany’s DAX shedding 0.7 percent and France’s CAC losing 0.75 percent. Trump warned on Monday that Washington would impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods after Beijing’s decision to raise tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods, which was in retaliation for U.S. tariffs announced on Friday. Trump said if China increases its tariffs again in response to the latest U.S. move, “we will meet that action by pursuing additional tariffs on another $200 billion of goods.” China warned it will take “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures if the U.S. government publishes an additional list of tariffs on its products. The trade frictions have unnerved financial markets, with investors and businesses increasingly worried that a full-blown trade battle could derail global growth. “Trump appears to be employing a similar tactic he used with North Korea, by blustering first in order to gain an advantage in negotiations. The problem is, such a tactic is unlikely to work with China,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “A U.S.-China trade spat alone won’t hurt global growth. But there is always potential for Trump to keep increasing his threats which could have broader implications. Increasing trade has helped growth in emerging markets and this could be negatively affected.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.2 percent to its lowest since early February, dragged down by a slide in Chinese shares. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 3 percent and plumbed its lowest since July 2016 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed more than 2 percent. “China’s economy has already been clouded by a sharp slowdown in fixed asset investment growth due to the government’s deleveraging drive, a problematic property sector, a mounting debt burden and rising credit defaults,” economists at Nomura wrote. “The rising risk of a disruptive trade conflict makes a bad situation tentatively worse.” Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.4 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI retreated 0.9 percent while Australian stocks bucked the trend and added 0.2 percent helped by a depreciating currency and an overnight bounce in commodity prices.

2018-06-19,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. energy companies including Plains All American Pipeline (PAA.N), Hess Corp (HES.N) and Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) are among many seeking exemptions from steel-import tariffs as the United States ratchets up trade tensions with exporters including China, Canada and Mexico. There have been nearly 21,000 requests overall for exclusions submitted to the U.S. Commerce Department since the Trump administration imposed levies this year. Of those, more than 500 petitions involve pipes and related materials.  Initial decisions are expected this month, offering the first clues as to how the administration will balance an agenda favoring oil and gas exports while also supporting the U.S. steel and aluminum industries.  For the energy industry, the potential for relief has taken on added importance after China surprised markets last week by proposing 25 percent levies on about $1 billion a month in U.S. oil imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. The pipeline industry could face higher costs from tariffs as about 77 percent of the steel used in U.S. pipelines is imported, according to a 2017 study for the pipeline industry. Benchmark hot-rolled U.S. steel coil prices are up more than 50 percent from a year ago, according to S&P Global Platts. Pipelines from the nation’s largest oilfield in west Texas to the Gulf Coast are nearly full, depressing crude prices as output is projected to rise by about 850,000 barrels per day this year, and significant projects are not expected to be completed until at least next year.     Plains sought a tariff exclusion for its 500-mile Cactus II oil pipeline, which will connect West Texas oil fields to export docks near Corpus Christi, Texas. This month, it expects to receive its first material from Corinth Pipeworks SA, a Greek manufacturer, according to a Commerce Department filing.  “We think tariffs would be unjust, but we can tolerate” them, Greg Armstrong, chief executive of Plains All American Pipeline (PAA.N), told investors this month, adding that tariffs and import quotas could hurt U.S. production growth. No U.S. mills can produce pipe with the specifications needed for Plains’ line. Only three mills in the world make such pipe, and delivery delays could exacerbate constraints, the company wrote in its petition, affecting the price of oil from the largest U.S. oilfield. The 585,000-barrel per day line is due to start flowing next year, just as analysts warn a bottleneck of crude could force some producers to shut in production.  Total pipeline, rail and local refining capacity from the Permian Basin oilfield in March was 3.175 million barrels per day (bpd), according to energy intelligence service Genscape, just shy of the oilfield’s roughly 3.3 million bpd output in June.    Rival pipeline operator Kinder Morgan also wants an exclusion for its $1.75 billion Gulf Coast Express natural gas pipeline from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. It ordered 47 percent of specialized pipe needed for the project from Turkish steel maker Borusan Mannesmann.  Only one U.S. producer could meet Kinder Morgan’s needs, but it could not meet the volume required within the necessary timeline, Kinder said in a filing.   The United States is committed to acting on exclusion requests within 90 days of a petition being posted for comments, a Commerce Department spokesman said. The United States could offer refunds on tariffs paid since a petition became active. For companies unwilling to take the risk of having a request denied, “it may mean cutting back or pushing the timeline out farther” for some projects, said Brigham McCown, former head of regulator U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Oil and gas producer Hess cited safety concerns in a request to use Japanese pipe for its Stampede offshore project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. “Without the ability to use this product, we will not be able to guarantee corrosion resistance in deepwater operations using other currently available steel products - potentially compromising both safety and environmental protection,” the company wrote in its filing.  Between 2015 and 2016, the U.S. imported between about $5 billion and $8 billion in steel line pipe, valves and fittings for the pipeline industry, according to a study by consultancy ICF for the American Petroleum Institute. “There’s lots of concern that the increased cost in pipe will increase the costs for our oil,” said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who wants Congress to vote on tariffs imposed under national security grounds. “You pull on one string in international trade and it unravels in ways you could not have predicted.” Reporting by Liz Hampton; additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Tom Brown",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-tariffs/u-s-oil-pipeline-companies-producers-seek-relief-from-steel-tariffs-idUKL1N1TH19A,19 Jun 2018,"Major U.S. energy companies

2018-06-19,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - ExxonMobil PNG (XOM.N) said on Tuesday it was investigating reports of vandalism on its Angore gas pipeline construction project in Papua New Guinea, amid ongoing tension in the Highlands region of the South Pacific nation. Papua New Guinea security forces are in the area and are also investigating, ExxonMobil PNG, a wholly owned unit of ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), said. The government declared a state of emergency and sent troops into the highlands region on the weekend after rioters went on a rampage protesting a failed court challenge to a provincial governor’s election. The 11-km (7-mile) Angore pipeline is being built to connect the Angore gas field to the Hides gas conditioning plant. “We are investigating reports of vandalism relating to the Angore pipeline construction project,” an ExxonMobil spokeswoman said in emailed comments. Pictures on PNG’s EMTV Online showed burnt out heavy machinery and a fire burning in a shipping container at the site in Angore. The highlands region has long been the scene of unrest and protests, especially among landowners who have not yet received payments due from the government out of royalties paid by the $19 billion PNG LNG project which shipped its first LNG four years ago. ExxonMobil said production at its Hides gas conditioning plant was continuing normally.  The plant treats gas produced in the rugged mountain region and then sends it down a 700-km pipeline to ExxonMobil’s PNG LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant on the coast where it is chilled for export. Reuters could not immediately reach police in Tari, the capital of Hela province, where the Angore pipeline is being built.

2018-06-19,"* Saudi Arabia, Russia pushing for modest output increase * U.S., China trade dispute threatens American oil exports By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell in early Asian trading on Tuesday on expectations that producer cartel OPEC and key ally Russia will gradually increase output after withholding supplies since 2017. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $78.05 per barrel at 0021 GMT, down 29 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $65.63 a barrel, down 22 cents, or 0.3 percent. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) together with a group of non-OPEC producers that includes Russia started withholding oil supplies in 2017 to end a global glut and prop up prices. Following a sharp increase in crude prices from their sub-$30 per barrel lows in 2016, the group on June 22 will meet in Vienna, Austria, to discuss forward policy. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader said there would likely be oil price volatility in the week ahead of the meeting. “OPEC is fractured or fracturing,” McKenna said, as Iran, Venezuela, and Iraq “seek to veto the production increase”. “We could be seeing the long-term relationship between the Saudis and Russia pushing OPEC into second place,” he added. Rob Thummel, managing director at asset management firm Tortoise said he “would recommend a small increase in production ... (as) the global oil market is potentially vulnerable to an oil price spike” due to low inventories. “We believe that OPEC will act like a central bank going forward, raising and lowering production as necessary with an objective of keeping global oil inventories at normal, 5-year levels,” Thummel said. The other key development for global markets is the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China, in which both sides have threatened stiff tariffs on each others’ key export goods. If implemented, China may react to U.S. tariffs by putting a 25 percent duty on U.S. crude oil imports, which have been surging since 2017, to a business now worth almost $1 billion per month. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the United States “would find it hard to find an alternative market that is as big as China”.

2018-06-19,"(Repeats item with no changes to text) * Teapot refiners swing into losses on stricter tax collection * Some teapots shut for maintenance amid high crude prices * Independents losing market share to state-owned rivals * Processing losses for teapots at 300 yuan a tonne - analyst By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING, June 15 (Reuters) - China’s independent oil refiners are suffering a drastic change of fortune as new tax rules, shrinking diesel demand and higher crude prices threaten their nearly three-year profit bonanza. Industry executives and analysts said nearly 40 private refiners, often called “teapots” - which account for a fifth of China’s almost 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in crude oil imports - are losing money and market share. Several have shut for maintenance to cut exposure to the market, and some teapots may have to shut for good if the conditions continue. “The gains in retail prices at pumps in recent weeks have been completely wiped out by higher costs of crude and a hefty consumption tax,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group. “We expect much weaker margins in June and July as more orders booked at peak crude prices arrive,” Gao said. Asian refining margins have thinned as crude prices surged amid output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Venezuela supply disruptions and looming U.S. sanctions against major exporter Iran. But China’s independents have also been hit hard by new tax rules that cut even further into their profit. Last month, teapots lost 300 yuan ($46.80) per tonne of crude oil processed, data provided by Zibo Longzong Information Group showed. That is a stunning reversal from a profit of 900 yuan a tonne in early 2016. Beijing enacted new rules in March to enforce collection of a $38 per barrel gasoline consumption tax and a $29 per barrel tax on diesel, a response to the alleged use of illicit fuel invoices by many of the teapots to evade the taxes. The teapots’ plight throws into sharp relief the performances of their state rivals, including top refiners PetroChina and Sinopec, where 2018 profits so far are running at their best in two or more years. State refiners have to pay the consumption tax as well, but their massive local marketing networks and control of China’s fuel exports help to offset the domestic market pressures. The teapots’ influence and size has grown significantly since they began winning crude import licences in 2015. Last year was a blockbuster, as they churned out record earnings, expanded into petrochemicals and beefed up trading teams. This year, in contrast, has been one of deepening trouble, with several teapots shutting for maintenance to avoid losses. Jincheng Petrochemical Co launched a month of maintenance in May at its 5.9 million-tonne-per-year (118,000 bpd) refinery, after losing money on rising crude prices since late March, said a marketing manager with the refinery, declining to be named due to company policy. At an oil trade show late last month in Dongying in Shandong province, home to many teapots, sales managers from more than 20 independents were jostling about trying to sell fuel to major trading firms, state refiners and other teapots. Several, including Wudi Xinyue Fuel and Chemicals Co and Fuhai Group, plan to keep product inventories low, fearing that domestic oversupply could further dampen fuel prices, according to interviews with sales managers at the trade show. “We barely keep any inventory for diesel and gasoline. There are more uncertainties in the market with more refineries coming online this year,” said an executive with a teapot in Dongying. Others like the Haike Group were retreating from the northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, where last year’s strong sales were not repeating. Haike is instead focusing on areas around Shandong in the east, an executive with the group said. State refiners have access to a surging export market, and dominate China’s retail fuel market, making it easier for them to pass higher crude costs and tax burdens on to consumers. Teapots, however, have to offer more competitive prices and their margins are much thinner. Several independent refiners, including Shandong Zhonghai Fine Chemical Group, Guangrao Kelida Petrochemicals Technology and ChemChina’s Huaxing Petrochemical, said PetroChina and Sinopec were paying for products only at steep discounts to market values and were also reducing purchases. A manager at Kelida, a major supplier of asphalt to PetroChina, said his firm was now struggling to break even compared with a 400 yuan a tonne profit last year. “Wholesale prices offered by PetroChina are so cheap that we will be running at a loss,” the manager said, declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. Zhonghai Fine Chemical, with 2.3 million tonnes a year in crude processing capacity, said Sinopec was ordering far less fuel than last year. “Sinopec has halted buying diesel from us this year. Last year the volume was at least 10,000 tonnes each month,” a manager said, also declining to be named. Teapot managers said they are urging the government to give them leeway in paying the consumption taxes. “We urged the government to reconsider the tax policies. Otherwise some of us are going to fail,” said a manager with ChemChina Huaxing refinery. Sinopec declined to comment on its purchase plans, and PetroChina did not respond to inquiries.
