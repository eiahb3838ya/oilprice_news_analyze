2018-07-18,"(Reuters) - Texas homes and businesses set an all-time power consumption record on Wednesday as consumers crank up air conditioners to escape a brutal heat wave, according to the operator of most of the state’s power grid. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) said demand reached 71,438 megawatts (MW) on Wednesday, topping the grid’s August 2016 high of 71,110 MW. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. To keep air conditioners humming, Texas utilities bought electricity from all sources, boosting power prices to their highest in almost seven years. “Electric providers and ERCOT are working around the clock to ensure they have air conditioning to see them through this,” ERCOT spokeswoman Theresa Gage said in an email. ERCOT expects to keep hitting new demand records as summer 2018 continues, it said in a statement.  High temperatures in Houston were expected to reach 98-100 Fahrenheit (37-38 Celsius) every day from July 16-24, according to AccuWeather. The normal high in Houston, the fourth-largest U.S. city,  at this time of year is 94-95 Fahrenheit. ERCOT had forecast usage would reach an all-time high of 72,492 MW on Wednesday, followed by 74,620 MW on Thursday, 75,225 MW on Friday, 72,200 MW on Saturday, 72,145 MW on Sunday, 75,896 MW on July 23 and 75,016 MW on July 24 before easing to 73,059 MW on July 25. Power prices in the ERCOT North hub jumped to $351 per megawatt-hour on Tuesday, their highest since August 2011. That compares with an average of $37.15 so far this year and $26.67 for all of 2017. Despite the retirement of three big coal plants in early 2018, ERCOT said it expects to have sufficient tools to manage tight reserves and maintain system reliability this summer. Those tools include using a previously mothballed power plant, imports from other regions and consumer conservation. ERCOT manages the flow of electricity to 24 million Texas customers, representing about 90 percent of the state’s power load.

2018-07-18,"July 18 (Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum Corp, the U.S. subsidiary of Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA , said on Wednesday that the U.S. visa of its President and Chief Executive Asdrubal Chavez has been revoked. The company statement did not give a reason. But Citgo executives have been targeted for individual sanctions by the United States in an effort to isolate the country’s leadership under President Nicolas Maduro. Citgo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chavez, the cousin of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had previously been granted a U.S. visa. He was named head of Citgo by Maduro in 2017. U.S. efforts to target Venezuela included sanctions against state-run companies, individual sanctions against dozens of officials close to Maduro, and Maduro himself. Adan Chavez, the late president’s brother, is among the officials sanctioned by the United States. “The day-to-day operations of CITGO remain uninterrupted and senior leadership remains unchanged,” a Citgo spokeswoman said in a statement.

2018-07-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Biofuel groups urged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday to either stop granting exemptions from the nation’s biofuel laws to smaller oil refineries or to force larger plants to make up the difference. The comments came during the first public hearing, held in Michigan, on the agency’s proposed 2019 biofuel mandates under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The RFS requires oil refiners to blend biofuels into the nation’s fuel pool or buy tradable compliance credits from those who do. The EPA can provide exemptions from the law to refineries who process less than 75,000 barrels-per-day of crude oil and who can prove a disproportionate hardship.  Former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned earlier this month, oversaw a surge in small refinery waivers. The EPA put out data last week that said it granted 48 such waivers for the years 2016 and 2017, representing some 2.25 billion gallons of biofuels. Biofuel groups argued that the waivers reduce demand for biofuels like ethanol and create regulatory uncertainty that dampens investment.  “Small refinery exemptions are a cancer to every RFS category,” Lucy Norton, managing director at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, told the EPA on Wednesday. LeAnn Johnson, who represents small refineries, said the EPA needs to continue to follow the law and protect smaller plants from the high regulatory costs. She noted that the agency was following a federal court decision that said the EPA was using too strict a test when evaluating hardship applications. “In the last six months, we have seen ethanol blending remain robust, and in fact slightly up, compared to the same period from last year. This proves there is no ‘demand destruction,’ which is logical since many of the small refiners receiving exemptions do not blend their own fuel,” Johnson said.  Merchant refiners who sell blended fuel but do not have their own operations, like PBF Energy and Valero, have said that the compliance credits, called RINs, have become too volatile and costly. Though many of them do not own plants that qualify under the small refining waivers, they have benefited from a crash in credit prices driven by the rise in exemptions. Refiners also want to limit speculation in the trading of credits and allow exports of ethanol and other biofuels to qualify under the program. “EPA needs to control RFS compliance costs so they don’t continue to get out of hand. Over the last year, RIN prices have been as high as a dollar and as low as a quarter,” Kary Taylor, Vice President of Marketing and Renewable Fuels at HollyFrontier Corporation, told the EPA on Wednesday.  The volatility has nothing to do with the cost of petroleum or biofuel, but reflects a market that is overly sensitive to political uncertainty and market manipulation, Taylor said.

2018-07-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets climbed to a one-month high on Wednesday after a raft of strong corporate earnings, while the U.S. dollar hit a three-week high against major currencies. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.17 percent and touched its highest point in a month. Stock markets were also supported by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell reiterating that the U.S. economy was healthy, even though he warned that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to the global economic expansion. “He’s been constructive on the economy and downplayed the risk of a recession,” said Jonathan Cohn, interest rate strategist with Credit Suisse in New York. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 79.4 points, or 0.32 percent, to 25,199.29, the S&P 500 gained 6.07 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,815.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.67 points, or 0.01 percent, to 7,854.44. The S&P 500 hit a more than five-month high. Shares of Morgan Stanley, airline United Continental and railroad CSX all jumped after the companies reported better-than-expected results. Amazon.com Inc’s stock market value reached $900 billion for the first time, though the shares later reversed course to trade slightly lower. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.60 percent, hitting a one-month high. The region’s shares were supported by currency weakness and a rally in technology stocks following well-received earnings updates, including from Sweden’s Ericsson. In the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.17 percent, to 95.104 after rising as high 95.407. The euro was down 0.16 percent to $1.164.  Federal Reserve chairman Powell’s comments to Congress about the health of the U.S. economy reinforced the view that interest rates would continue to rise supporting demand for the dollar.     Traders saw his comments as signifying that authorities were comfortable with the greenback’s near 6 percent rise against its rivals in the last three months. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.8766 percent, from 2.862 percent late on Tuesday. The U.S. yield curve remained near its flattest in nearly 11 years. Oil prices rose 1.0 percent after U.S. government data indicated bullish demand for gasoline and distillates, which overshadowed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories and U.S. crude oil production’s hitting 11 million barrels per day for the first time. U.S. crude settled up 1 percent at $68.76 per barrel, and Brent settled at $72.90, up 1 percent. Spot gold fell to a one-year low as the U.S. dollar rose before settling at $1,227.81 an ounce.

2018-07-18,"(Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as Canada’s no.2 railroad operator was helped by higher shipments of commodities like grains and potash. CP said total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into freight cars during a specified period, rose 2 percent. The Calgary-based company said revenue from grains jumped 2.5 percent to C$372 million in the reported quarter, while revenue from potash rose 6.4 percent.     However, the company saw an 8.8 percent increase in expenses largely driven by a rise in fuel costs. CP’s net income fell to C$436 million ($331.08 million), or C$3.04 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from C$480 million, or C$3.27 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned C$3.16 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of C$3.12, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-07-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday temporarily blocked a decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that would have lifted strict limits on the number of remanufactured heavy duty vehicles known as “glider trucks” that could be sold. The vehicles have a used engine in a new frame and rules introduced under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, said nearly all new trucks on the road must use more efficient, less polluting engines. The glider trucks emit up to 450 times more diesel particulate matter and up to 40 times more smog-forming nitrogen oxides than new trucks on the market, the EPA has said EPA issued a memo on July 6 that said the agency would not enforce a limit of up to 300 gliders per manufacturer. The EPA in November formally proposed undoing the glider rule but has not finalized it. The EPA, which said Wednesday it was reviewing the decision, had said in its memo that enforcing the rules would result “in the loss of jobs” and threaten the viability of companies making the glider trucks. Volvo Group North America, Cummins Inc and Navistar International Corp said last year they opposed efforts to reverse the limits on glider trucks.  Glider kits “should not be used for circumventing purchase of currently certified powertrains.” The move could inflict “uncertainty and damage to our industry,” the companies said. Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp said the “decision today is an important step toward protecting the health of all Americans from super-polluting diesel freight trucks.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the EPA must respond to the lawsuit from environmental groups by July 25. The court order said the “stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion” and not a ruling “on the merits” of blocking the memo. The EPA has previously said that if gliders were allowed through 2025, they would make up 5 percent of the freight trucks on the road but would account for one third of all nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from the heavy truck fleet. Glider companies told the EPA that glider trucks are 25 percent cheaper than new vehicles. In August 2016, the Obama administration issued final rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from medium and heavy duty trucks through 2027, a sector that accounts for 20 percent of carbon pollution from vehicles. The commercial vehicle rules are expected to cut 1.1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the Obama administration estimated.

2018-07-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday after U.S. government data indicated bullish demand for gasoline and distillates, which overshadowed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories and U.S. crude oil production hitting 11 million bpd for the first time. Brent crude futures rose 74 cents to settle at $72.90 a barrel, a one percent gain. The contract hit a session low of $71.19 a barrel, its lowest since April 17. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 68 cents, or one percent, to settle at $68.76 a barrel. U.S. crude stocks surprised the market and rose by 5.8 million barrels last week as oil production hit 11 million barrels a day for the first time ever, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.  Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 2.2 million barrels per day, the data showed. “Weekly shifts in the U.S. crude stocks are being increasingly influenced by international trade and this was certainly the case with this week’s data,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note. “While we had expected a pop in imports and a drop in exports, changes in both categories far exceeded our expectations especially on the import side.” Crude futures extended losses immediately following the data release, before edging higher as the market weighed some of the more supportive points in the report, such as a larger-than-expected draw in gasoline stocks.  Gasoline inventories fell by 3.2 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 371,000 barrels, the EIA data showed. Oil markets have fallen over the last week as Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia increased production and as some supply disruptions eased. OPEC and non-OPEC’s compliance with oil output curbs has declined to around 120 percent in June from 147 percent in May, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. Investors have also begun to worry about the impact on energy demand of the trade dispute between the United States and its trading partners, including China. Trade tension between the United States and China could drag on the global economy, BMI Research said. “The economic outlook is broadly positive, but a number of headwinds are emerging, not least a stronger dollar, rising inflationary pressures and tightening liquidity,” BMI said. “Slowing trade growth will weigh on physical demand for oil.” Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said on Tuesday uncertainty over U.S. trade policy could slow the economy, even if recently imposed tariffs are too small to have a big impact.  Trade policy was a “significant” downside risk to the outlook for economic growth, George said.

2018-07-18," (This July 12 story corrects to say that the U.S. listed 89 illicit transactions, not 89 North Korean tankers in paragraph four and ten.) By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States accused North Korea on Thursday of breaching a U.N. sanctions cap on refined petroleum by making illicit transfers between ships at sea, according to a document seen by Reuters, and demanded an immediate end to all sales of the fuel. The United States submitted the complaint to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee. The charge of a sanctions breach comes as Washington engages North Korea in a bid to convince Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons. The North Korea U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. accusation. North Korea relies on imported fuel to keep its struggling economy functioning. The United States said that as of May 30, there had been 89 illicit ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products this year.  The United States did not broadly say which countries it believed were illicitly providing North Korea with refined petroleum. But it does mention one case of a ship-to-ship transfer involving a Russian-flagged ship and one case involving a Belize-flagged ship. Reuters in December reported that Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea by transferring cargoes at sea. The 15-member Security Council capped refined petroleum product exports to North Korea at 500,000 barrels a year in December, down from a previous limit, adopted in September, of 2 million barrels a year.    According to the Security Council North Korea sanctions committee website, only Russia and China have reported legitimate sales of some 14,000 tons of refined petroleum to North Korea in 2018. “These sales and any other transfer must immediately stop since the United States believes the DPRK has breached the ... refined petroleum products quota for 2018,” the United States said in a document submitted to the committee, using an acronym for North Korea. The United States provided a list to the Security Council committee of 89 illicit North Korean transactions and a few select photos, seen by Reuters. “If fully loaded at around 90 percent laden, DPRK tankers have delivered nearly triple the 2018 quota at 1,367,628 barrels,” the United States said. It asked the North Korea sanctions committee to issue an urgent note to all U.N. member states notifying them that North Korea has breached the refined petroleum cap and order an immediate halt to all transfers. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. In March the council blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping companies over oil and coal smuggling by North Korea.

2018-07-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Reaching a denuclearisation deal with North Korea “may take some time,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, reiterating that sanctions would continue to be enforced in the meantime, even as Russia’s envoy to Pyongyang proposed discussions on easing them. Speaking at a cabinet meeting chaired by U.S. President Donald Trump, Pompeo, who held inconclusive talks in North Korea earlier this month, said progress had been made on some issues. “There’s a lot of work to do. It may take some time to get where we need to go. But all of this will be taking place against the backdrop of continued enforcement of existing sanctions,” he said. Pompeo said North Korea had reaffirmed its commitment to give up its nuclear weapons and that progress had been made on arranging the return of remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War. “I think in the next couple weeks we’ll have the first remains returned. That’s the commitment,” Pompeo said, adding that the issue was very important for the families involved. Pompeo said that while more work was needed, it was “a very hopeful place that we find ourselves with, making a strategic change for North Korea, giving them the opportunity for a brighter future for their people.” Pompeo travelled to North Korea this month hoping to agree a roadmap for denuclearisation, but any progress has appeared limited, and Pyongyang issued an angry statement as soon as he left, accusing his delegation of making “gangster-like” demands. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a broad commitment to denuclearize at an unprecedented summit with Trump in June, but  offered no details as to how and when this might take place, leaving considerable doubts about Pyongyang’s intentions. The U.S. administration has given no indication as to when dialogue on denuclearisation might resume and has appeared to back away from trying to set a timeline for the process. On Tuesday, Trump said there was “no time limit” and reiterated in a tweet on Wednesday that there was “no rush,” noting that sanctions remained in place and there would be big benefits for North Korea at the end of the process.  Trump also said he elicited a promise from Russian President Vladimir Putin in their Helsinki meeting this week to help negotiate with North Korea, but did not say how. While the United States has stressed the need to maintain sanctions on North Korea, Russia’s envoy to Pyongyang was quoted  by the RIA news agency as saying it would be logical to raise the question of easing sanctions with the U.N. Security Council, given positive changes. Trump announced after the June summit that Kim had agreed to return the remains of “thousands and thousands” of Americans killed in the Korean War, but no remains have been handed over since then, raising further questions about North Korean intentions. A senior U.S. defence official said on Tuesday Washington hoped North Korea would return about 50 sets of remains within two weeks but details were still uncertain, in spite of two days of talks between U.S. and North Korean officials on Sunday and Monday.

2018-07-18,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Iranian-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen said it had attacked a Saudi Aramco refinery in Riyadh on Wednesday using a drone, but the oil company said a limited fire at the plant was due to “an operational incident”. “Our drone air forces have targeted the refinery of ARAMCO company in Riyadh,” read a tweet on the account of the Houthi-run television channel al-Masirah. “The operation by the drone air force is a strong start in a new stage of deterring the aggression,” it quoted a Houthi military spokesman as saying in a tweet. Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment.  Just before al-Masirah’s tweet, Aramco announced that its fire control teams and the Saudi civil defences had contained a minor fire that erupted in the early evening in a storage containers at its refinery in Riyadh.  It tweeted that the fire had not affected the activities of the refinery and there were no casualties.  It later added on its official twitter account that the fire was due to “an operational incident”. The Houthis, who control Yemen’s capital Sanaa, have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi Arabia in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict widely seen as a proxy battle between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran. Most of the missiles have been intercepted by the Saudi military. A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to try to unseat the Houthis and restore the internationally recognised government-in-exile.

2018-07-18,"(Adds proposals from ACP, comment) By Helen Murphy and Luis Jaime Acosta BOGOTA, July 18 (Reuters) - Colombia’s President-elect Ivan Duque on Wednesday named Maria Fernanda Suarez as mining and energy minister when he takes office next month, a role that will require her to bolster oil output to help a weak economy and settle messy mining disputes. Suarez, 44, is currently executive vice president at state oil company Ecopetrol. She served as director of public credit at the finance ministry and as vice president of investments for the Porvenir pension fund. She has also held senior positions at Citibank, ABN AMRO and Bank of America. Suarez has a Masters degree in public policy from Georgetown University. She will replace German Arce on Aug. 7. “She has a brilliant resume in the public and private sectors,” Duque said in a statement. As mines and energy minister, Suarez faces a difficult task as Colombia struggles to increase oil production to help increase revenue and stimulate a slugglish economy after years of weak international oil prices. “With her, we will promote greater diversification of national energy, efficiency and competitiveness in the sector, provide energy security for Colombia, and social and environmental responsibility in all energy mining production sectors,” Duque said. At current rates of production, Colombia has less than six years worth of oil reserves - about 1.8 billion barrels - the energy ministry says, and urgent investment in exploration is needed to replace reserves. Duque’s solution to dwindling oil reserves is to encourage investment in exploration, which he says could provide years more oil production, and give tax relief to the sector. He has also pledged additional investment at state-run Ecopetrol’s refineries to allow exports of more higher-value derivatives. Still, with the economy growing at an expected pace of just 2.7 percent this year and a budget deficit that needs to be reduced, funding such expenditure may be tough. The Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP), which represents private oil companies, says the industry needs to spend about $7 billion a year just to keep output between 800,000 and 860,000 barrels per day. In a presentation on Wednesday, the ACP said oil companies could invest $34.7 billion over the next five years to help growth in the economy and boost reserves by about 2 billion barrels, but tax cuts per barrel and legal security are needed. “We need to create and keep conditions to invest around $7 billion a year in exploration and production of hydrocarbons,” said Francisco Jose Lloreda, ACP president. “It’s necessary that we have a fiscal regime that’s more competitive, that the royalty system is reformed so that its distribution is more equitable and fair with producing regions.” Oil companies are already grappling with security concerns as well as local referendums - on whether to allow mining in certain areas - and environmental court rulings that have stymied major mining projects in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy. A recent paper by the ACP, which represents private crude producers, warned that planned referendums put one-fifth of oil production at risk.

2018-07-18,"(Adds reaction from other Russian steel producers, analysts) By Anastasia Lyrchikova and Polina Devitt MOSCOW, July 18 (Reuters) - Russian steel producers played down the impact of the European Union’s curbs on steel imports on Wednesday, which, according to analysts, may even allow some of them to increase supplies to the bloc compared with a year ago. On Thursday, the EU will set the quotas for 23 steel product categories at the average of imports over the past three years, with a 25 percent tariff set for volumes exceeding those amounts. The quotas, which are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, are designed to prevent a surge of steel imports into the bloc following the U.S. imposition of tariffs on incoming steel and aluminium. “We regret that world-leading states continue to maintain a policy of protectionism and are thereby damaging the longstanding world trading system and contributing to further uncertainty in the markets,” said Severstal, the largest supplier of Russian steel products to the EU. The EU’s decision will not have a significant impact on Severstal’s financial results due to the flexibility of its distribution channels, it said, adding that it planned to continue its supplies to European customers within the announced quotas. Russia is one of the main exporters of steel to the EU along with China, India, South Korea, Turkey and Ukraine. For Russian steel products, the EU is the largest export market due to the relatively short transportation distance. Severstal’s rival, NLMK, also hopes to continue business as usual despite the EU’s curbs, it said. Other players in the Russian steel market - Evraz, for which Europe is not the main market, and MMK, which supplies steel products to the bloc - declined to comment. Severstal, NLMK and MMK may even increase their 2018 sales to the EU compared with 2017 as the new quotas are estimated to be materially higher then their 2017 sales to the bloc, analysts at BCS said.

The government said it wants businesses and industry to improve energy efficiency by at least 20 percent by 2030.  A previous company reporting scheme, called the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme, was too complex for businesses and will be closed. The new framework will simplify and streamline reporting requirements. The new framework will apply to all quoted companies. It will also apply to big UK-incorporated unquoted companies and limited liability partnerships with at least 250 employees or an annual turnover greater than 36 million pounds and annual balance sheet total greater than 18 million pounds, the department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in a statement. Companies will not be obliged to disclose information that their directors believe would seriously harm the company’s interests, the government said.

2018-07-18,"MOSCOW/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia’s envoy to North Korea said on Wednesday it would be logical to raise the question of easing sanctions on North Korea with the United Nations Security Council, as the United States pushes for a halt to refined petroleum exports to Pyongyang. “The positive change on the Korean peninsula is now obvious,” said the ambassador, Alexander Matsegora, according to the RIA news agency, adding that Russia was ready to help modernise North Korea’s energy system if sanctions were lifted and if Pyongyang can find funding for the modernisation. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. China tried late last month to get the Security Council to issue a statement praising the June 12 Singapore meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and expressing its “willingness to adjust the measures on the DPRK in light of the DPRK’s compliance with the resolutions.” North Korea’s official name is Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).  But the United States blocked the statement on June 28 given “ongoing and very sensitive talks between the United States and the DPRK at this time,” diplomats said. The same day, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi about the importance of sanctions enforcement. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to informally brief U.N. Security Council envoys along with South Korea and Japan on Friday. Diplomats say they expect Pompeo to stress the need to maintain pressure on North Korea during his briefing on Friday. In a tweet on Wednesday Trump said he elicited a promise from Russian President Vladimir Putin to help negotiate with North Korea but did not say how. He also said: “There is no rush, the sanctions remain!” The United States accused North Korea last week of breaching a U.N. sanctions cap on refined petroleum by making illicit transfers between ships at sea and demanded an immediate end to all sales of the fuel. The United States submitted the complaint to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee, which is due to decide by Thursday whether it will tell all U.N. member states to halt all transfers of refined petroleum to Pyongyang.  Such decisions are made by consensus and some diplomats said they expected China or Russia to delay or block the move. When asked on June 13 about whether sanctions should be loosened, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said: “We should be thinking about steps in that direction because inevitably there is progress on the track that should be reciprocal, that should be a two-way street. The other side should see encouragement to go forward.” Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh in Moscow and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Writing by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/northkorea-russia-sanctions/update-1-russia-urges-u-n-to-mull-easing-n-korea-sanctions-as-u-s-seeks-action-idUKL8N1UE4W1,18 Jul 2018,"Russia's envoy to

2018-07-18,"* Tullow to pay Seadrill over cancelled rig contract * Tullow wanted to claim money back from its partners * Arbitration panel rules Kosmos does not have to pay (Adds details) LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Britain’s Tullow Oil has to cover nearly $65 million of costs linked to a cancelled rig contract in Ghana after losing a dispute with partner Kosmos Energy, the companies said on Wednesday. The costs relate to a rig contract with Seadrill that Tullow cancelled in December 2016 after Ghana set a drilling moratorium on its TEN offshore oil and gas field, which is located in waters then claimed by both Ghana and Ivory Coast. Tullow is lead operator of the project, in which Kosmos Energy, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and PetroSA also hold stakes. A London judge ordered Tullow this month to pay Seadrill around $254 million, saying Tullow was wrong to end a contract between the companies on the grounds of force majeure over a maritime border dispute in West Africa. The company had originally said its partners would pay in keeping with their stakes in the project, but Kosmos challenged this. A panel of arbitrators at the International Chamber of Commerce ruled in favour of Kosmos, which means Tullow will not be able to claim back Kosmos’ $50.8 million share of the Seadrill cost and will have to reimburse Kosmos around $14 million in legal and rig demobilisation costs. A Tullow spokesman said Anadarko has answered Tullow’s cash call over the Seadrill ruling. Anadarko had no immediate comment. A Tullow spokesman on Wednesday said the company had decided not to appeal the original court ruling. With Tullow’s 47 percent stake in TEN and its duty to pay costs for Ghana National Petroleum Corporation’s (GNPC) stake, the British company had expected to pay around $140 million net. “The challenge for Tullow is to demonstrate that the events of 2015-16 are behind it, and in H2/18 it is pushing ahead with a strategy that involves doing more with less and unlocking the upside potential in East Africa,” RBC said in a note. Tullow is working towards final investment decisions for its Kenya and Uganda projects.

2018-07-18,"(Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production last week hit 11 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in the nation’s history, the Energy Department said on Wednesday, as the ongoing boom in shale production continues to drive output. The gains represent a rapid increase in output, as the data, if confirmed by monthly figures, puts the United States as the second largest producer of crude oil, just behind Russia, which was producing 11.2 million bpd in early July, according to sources.  “Eleven million would have made us the biggest producer in the world; but actually Russian production in June was above 11 million. So, this is kind of like the space race,” said Sandy Fielden, director of research in commodities and energy at Morningstar. The United States has added nearly 1 million bpd in production since November, thanks to rapid increases in shale drilling. “I don’t think production is plateauing at 11. It’s fully expected to grow beyond 11 - we won’t be topping out there,” said Scott Shelton, a broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina. Crude inventories USOILC=ECI increased 5.8 million barrels in the week to July 13, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 3.6 million barrels. Crude futures edged down on the data. U.S. crude CLc1 was down 55 cents to $67.51 a barrel, while Brent LCOc1 dropped 39 cents to $71.77 a barrel. The benchmarks have gained steadily since bottoming out below $30 a barrel in early 2016; U.S. crude is up nearly 12 percent this year. Weekly production figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are notorious for revisions, as monthly data, released on a lag, shows U.S. production at 10.5 million bpd as of April. In the last several weeks, the EIA has rounded off U.S. production to the nearest hundred thousand barrels, so that figure had been stuck at 10.9 million bpd for over a month. This report comes amidst worries that infrastructure bottlenecks, which make it difficult for producers to get their oil to market, could soon start curtailing output.  Morgan Stanley analysts said recently that pipeline constraints could cap 2019 growth in west Texas. They said the Permian shale play has about 3.56 million bpd of pipeline capacity, about what is being produced there now. Even as production ramps up, the United States, the world’s top oil consumer, still depends on imports. Net U.S. crude imports USOICI=ECI rose last week by 2.2 million bpd to about 9 million bpd.  Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell by 3.2 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations for a 44,000-barrel drop.

Demand increased after upbeat comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the U.S. economy in congressional testimony on Tuesday, a message he reiterated on Wednesday before a U.S. House panel. “Strengthening economic growth and a confident Fed is helping to support the dollar,” said Alan Gayle, president of Via Nova Investment Management LLC in Fredericksburg, Virginia. “Higher short-term interest rates make the dollar more attractive relative to other currencies.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 57.03 points, or 0.23 percent, to 25,176.92, the S&P 500 gained 2.19 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,811.74 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.72 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,849.39.

2018-07-18,"(Reuters) - Marriott International Inc, the world’s largest hotel chain, plans to remove disposable plastic straws and stirrers from its 6,500 hotels and resorts worldwide by July 2019, the company said on Wednesday. The Maryland-based company, which said it could eliminate 1 billion straws and a quarter of a billion stirrers a year, said it would provide alternatives, for example paper straws, to customers upon request. “Removing plastic straws is one of the simplest ways our guests can contribute to plastic reduction when staying with us – something they are increasingly concerned about and are already doing in their own homes,” Arne Sorenson, president and CEO of Marriott International, said in a statement. The U.N. Environment Programme estimated in its global Clean Seas campaign launched last year that some 8 million tons of plastic is dumped into the ocean every year, damaging the marine eco-system. Although plastic straws represent a relatively small portion of all plastic waste, they are difficult to recycle and often end up in landfills where they decompose at a much slower rate than paper alternatives. Marriott joins a growing number of hospitality companies that have said they will do away with disposable plastic straws. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc said in May it plans to remove plastic straws from 650 of its managed properties by the end of this year. Hyatt Hotels Corp said last week it would eliminate plastic straws and picks and starting in September, the items would be available by request only.

2018-07-18,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s government is considering a plan under which Aramco would buy a stake in Saudi petrochemical maker SABIC 2010.SE, a move that could boost the state oil giant’s market valuation ahead of a planned initial public offering. Saudi Aramco IPO-ARAM.SE has invited banks to pitch for an advisory role on the potential acquisition of a strategic stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the world’s largest oil producer, possibly by next year. Boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help attract potential investors for the IPO.  The Aramco IPO is the centrepiece of an ambitious plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond oil.  Aramco made the invitation to the banks last month, said the sources, declining to be identified due to commercial sensitivities. Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is 70 percent owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s top sovereign wealth fund. It has a market capitalisation of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals ($102.7 billion). The process is in the initial stages and Aramco may or may not decide to go ahead with the deal, the sources said.  Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. SABIC declined to comment. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude, and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to lessen the risk of a slowdown in oil demand. Aramco is expanding its footprint globally by signing downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its plants. Aramco’s push into chemicals also includes a mega project it is building at home with SABIC. The $20 billion project would build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly, bypassing the refining stage.

2018-07-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Azerbaijan’s Socar is refocusing its trading arm’s activities on LNG and its new Turkish refinery while winding down less profitable trades as it feels the sting of weak profits, sources familiar with the matter said.  Many trading houses had weaker performances in 2017 due to a less lucrative, backwardated market structure for much of the year and relatively low volatility. Geneva-based Socar Trading also was stung, costing its chief executive Arzu Azimov his job.  The firm was set up in 2007 and has become a global player in the last few years, having previously been only a marketer of its country’s crude, Azeri Light. Poaching top traders from established rivals, it moved into paper trading and third-party oil.  At the end of May, executive chairman Adnan Ahmadzada was appointed and the CEO role was taken by Mariam Almaszade, formerly of trading firm Maddox. Last year the firm traded 1.54 million barrels per day of crude, of which about 1.06 million bpd was third-party, the company said. Combining crude and oil products, it traded 104 million tonnes.  The firm closed its back office in Estonia’s capital Talinn last month and plans to exit fuel oil trading by the end of the year, one of the sources said.  At least four traders in the heavy distillates division have left, including manager Pino Petricone, the sources said. Adding impetus is an upcoming change in shipping fuels. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will ban ships using fuel with a sulphur content higher than 0.5 percent, compared to 3.5 percent now, unless a vessel has equipment to clean up its sulphur emissions. The industry expects demand for fuel oil to plummet as few ships have such equipment.  Socar has previously grappled with some over-stretches. The firm announced the closure of its Calgary office at the end of 2017 to focus on its Houston one instead. It also previously left middle distillates, such as diesel. For traders, liquefied natural gas is the flavor of the month. As the market slowly becomes more liquid, firms are rapidly expanding their LNG divisions and investing in infrastructure. Socar sold its first cargo of LNG in 2017 as part of its investment in an LNG-to-power project in Malta. It is studying several options in Africa and Asia and plans to increase its headcount in London, including with more LNG-focussed hires, one of the sources said.  Looking forward, the firm may beef up products trading once more after its Star refinery in Turkey starts up, including a return to middle distillates depending on possible export volumes and how the market looks after the IMO change, they said.  Socar is sending a cargo of Azeri Light and Russian Urals crude to start the commissioning of its new 200,000-barrels-per-day refinery in Turkey. The process is expected to be complete by the end of October and the plant will later run mainly on medium sour grades, namely Russian and Iraqi oil, one of the sources added.

Nigeria is Africa’s biggest crude oil producer and oil sales make up around two-thirds of government revenue. Oil companies must periodically renew their oil block licences to continue extraction or exploration. The Senate voted for a committee to “report to the Senate the anomalies in the ongoing lease renewal process and identify appropriate measures to correct the said anomalies”. It followed the reading of a motion on the floor of the Senate which stated that “illegal discounts and rebates” had been granted by the ministry. “The ongoing lease renewal process is capable of denying government revenue in excess of $10 billion as a result of illegal discounts and rebates in the process of lease renewal,” the motion stated. Idang Alibi, director of press at the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, declined to comment.

The dollar’s advance took its toll on a host of global currencies and melted gold to its lowest level in a year, but otherwise traders’ spirits were definitely up. Morgan Stanley became the latest heavyweight U.S. bank to deliver a jump in profits m though Wall Street looked set for a groggy start after reclaiming the 2,600-point mark on Tuesday. In Europe, London’s FTSE rose 0.5 percent as Brexit continued to hit the pound. Germany’s DAX climbed to its a one-month high on hopes the European Union and United States would cut a deal on car tariffs. In Asia overnight, Japan’s Nikkei had also hit a one-month peak as a weakening yen promised to fatten exporters’ profits. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose as much as 0.1 percent and Australia 0.6 percent. Shanghai blue chips flagged as China’s yuan lost ground to the advancing dollar. “Morgan Stanley has beaten expectations. Well, actually they have blown them out the water and it is now a consistent theme,” said CMC markets senior analyst Michael Hewson. “I think the big question now is that now we have moved past the near-term boost of the tax cuts and the decent Q2 performances is whether it is sustainable... have we got any upside?” U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was due to speak again at 10.00 am ET. On Tuesday, he stuck with an upbeat assessment on the U.S. economy and downplayed the impact of global trade risks on the outlook for interest rate rises. BofA Merrill Lynch’s latest fund manager survey showed a trade war remained the biggest threat cited by 60 percent of respondents. For now, U.S. companies seem to be profiting from tax cuts as the earnings season shifts into top gear. Analysts now see second-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 21.2 percent, up from 20.7 percent on July 1. Of the 39 companies in the index that have reported so far, 84.6 percent have beat market expectations. EBay and IBM are among firms reporting after the closing bell. “The S&P has finally broken to the upside through 2,800, out of the range that has confined it for most of this year, and this could now be the start of a grind higher in global equities over the next few weeks,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. Next stop is the all-time top of 2,872 from January. Powell’s support for more rate hikes had sent two-year Treasury yields to their highest for nearly a decade and lifted the dollar broadly. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up at 95.231 , after jumping 0.46 percent overnight. It also climbed to its highest since January against the yen at 113.07. The euro slipped further to $1.1627, after weakening 0.4 percent on Tuesday. The pound suffered after UK inflation data came in weaker than expected, adding to the pressure created when British Prime Minister Theresa May barely cleared the latest parliamentary hurdle to leave the European Union . Wednesday’s edition of the Times reported May threatened rebel lawmakers in her own party with a general election if they defeated the bill. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a no-deal Brexit would have “big” economic consequences and force a review of plans to raise interest rates. Sterling was at a 10-month low of $1.3035, after sliding 0.9 percent on Tuesday. The rising U.S. dollar coupled with the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates also spelled trouble for gold, which crashed through major chart support to hit a one-year low. Spot gold was hovering at $1,224.86 per ounce, having fallen to $1,223.78. The steadily less-precious metal is down more than 5 percent for the year. Oil prices also eased after an industry group reported an unexpected increase in U.S. crude inventories. Brent fell 70 cents to $71.40 a barrel, while U.S. crude was quoted down 54 cents at $67.55 a barrel. Reporting by Marc Jones, additional reporting by Wayne Cole in

2018-07-18,"BOGOTA, July 18 (Reuters) - Colombia’s President-elect Ivan Duque on Wednesday named Maria Fernanda Suarez as mining and energy minister when he takes office in August, a role that will require her to bolster oil production to help weak economic growth and settle messy mining disputes. Suarez, 44, is currently executive vice president at state oil company Ecopetrol. She served as director of public credit at the finance ministry and as vice president of investments for the Porvenir pension fund. She has also held senior positions at Citibank, ABN AMRO and Bank of America. Suarez has a Masters degree in public policy from Georgetown University. She will replace German Arce. “She has a brilliant resume in the public and private sectors,” Duque said in a statement. As mines and energy minister, Suarez faces a difficult task as Colombia struggles to increase oil production to help increase revenue and bolster the weak economy after years of weak international oil prices. “With her, we will promote greater diversification of national energy, efficiency and competitiveness in the sector, provide energy security for Colombia, and social and environmental responsibility in all energy mining production sectors,” Duque said. At current rates of production, Colombia has less than six years worth of oil reserves, the energy ministry says, and urgent investment in exploration is needed to replace reserves. Duque’s solution to dwindling oil reserves is to encourage investment in exploration, which he says could provide years more oil production, and give tax relief to the sector. He has also pledged additional investment at state-run Ecopetrol’s refineries to allow exports of more higher-value derivatives. Still, with the economy growing at an expected pace of just 2.7 percent this year and a budget deficit that needs to be reduced, funding such expenditure may be tough. The Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP), says the industry needs to spend up to $7 billion a year just to keep output between 800,000 and 860,000 barrels per day. Oil companies are already grappling with security concerns as well as local referendums - on whether to allow mining in certain areas - and environmental court rulings that have stymied major mining projects in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy. A recent paper by the ACP, which represents private crude producers, warned that planned referendums put one-fifth of oil production at risk. Private oil companies plan to invest up to $4.9 billion this year, ACP said, while Ecopetrol plans to spend up to $4 billion. Reporting by Helen Murphy

2018-07-18,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to text) By Julia Payne LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Energy trader Vitol and coal miner Peabody Energy are partnering with start-up Arq to turn coal waste into a low-sulphur oil product that could be an alternative fuel for shippers as new U.N. pollution rules loom, the companies said in a statement. Global oil and shipping companies are looking at any and all options to avoid becoming a casualty of the major market dislocations that the new standards will create when they come into effect in 2020. The U.N. International Maritime Organization (IMO) will ban ships using fuel with a sulphur content higher than 0.5 percent, compared to 3.5 percent now, unless a vessel has equipment to clean up its sulphur emissions. But few have added such equipment. As a result, most ship-owners will face a skyrocketing fuel bill as they switch to more expensive but cleaner marine gasoil. Arq CEO Julian McIntyre told Reuters in an interview that its fuel would meet the new standards and could be used by the shipping industry to cut costs. It would also reduce the volume of pollutants coming from the coal industry. Its technology isolates hydrocarbon particles from feedstock coal waste to produce a fine powder that can be blended into fuel oil and marine gasoil as well as crude. “The coal industry throws away anything below 2-3 millimeters and that fine particle coal becomes waste,” McIntyre said. “We take that feedstock and turn it into products that are worth much more than the coal.” Those hydrocarbons are essentially free, McIntyre said. “The coal industry throws out 1 billion tonnes of them a year, the equivalent of 5 million barrels of oil per day,” he said. Including transport, McIntyre said the firm is aiming to produce and deliver its fuel to port for less than $10 a barrel of oil equivalent, which could be blended into fuel oil to account for up to 20-25 percent of a barrel. London-based Arq is in the process of building its first plant in Kentucky, United States, which is expected to start up by early 2019. “Our basic plant design is to produce 1 million tonnes per annum,” McIntyre said. “Our plan is to build 50 full-scale plants over the next 7 years, (with production) equivalent of about 1 million bpd of oil.” He added that a single plant costs about $200-300 million to build and takes about 12-18 months to complete. Other uses for Arq’s fuel would be to blend it into crude oil that would give refiners a greater yield of middle distillates, which are low-sulphur products, or to press it back together into coal-like pieces to be sold to utilities. The partnership will allow Arq to set up plants alongside Peabody mines to capture its waste, while Vitol will provide logistics, including blending the new fuel before it reaches customers. Arq said it has a post-money valuation of over $500 million from industry and financial investors. In its latest $50 million funding round, Vitol and Peabody agreed to each invest $10 million. “It is an interesting technology with good potential. We’ll offer a range of solutions to help our customers comply with IMO 2020. There are many factors which will dictate which method of compliance is adopted,” Mike Muller of Vitol said, in his first statement since joining the firm from Shell. Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader, has made a few forays into green and alternative fuel investments including in UK battery projects, a new synthetic fuel from recycled plastic and a new fund to develop renewable energies like wind power.

2018-07-18,"* Tullow to pay Seadrill over cancelled rig contract * Tullow wanted to claim money back from its partners * Arbitration panel rules Kosmos does not have to pay LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Britain’s Tullow Oil has to cough up around $65 million for Kosmos Energy’s share and legal fees over a cancelled rig contract in Ghana, the companies said on Wednesday. A London judge had ordered Tullow this month to pay rig owner Seadrill around $254 million, saying Tullow was wrong to end the contract on the grounds of force majeure over a maritime border dispute in West Africa. Tullow cancelled the contract for Seadrill’s West Leo rig in December 2016 after Ghana set a drilling moratorium on its TEN offshore oil and gas field which is located in waters then claimed by both Ghana and Ivory Coast. Tullow is lead operator of the project, while Kosmos Energy, along with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and PetroSA also hold stakes. Tullow said its partners would pay in keeping with their stakes in the project, but Kosmos challenged this logic. A panel of arbitrators at the International Chamber of Commerce ruled in favour of Kosmos, which means Tullow will not be able to claim back Kosmos’ $50.8 million share of the Seadrill cost and will have to reimburse Kosmos around $14 million in legal legal and rig demobilisation costs. With Tullow’s 47 percent stake in TEN and its duty to pay costs for Ghana National Petroleum Corporation’s (GNPC) stake, the British company had expected to pay around $140 million net. “The challenge for Tullow is to demonstrate that the events of 2015-16 are behind it, and in H2/18 it is pushing ahead with a strategy that involves doing more with less and unlocking the upside potential in East Africa,” RBC said in a note. Tullow is working towards final investment decisions for its Kenya and Uganda projects.

2018-07-18,"(Repeats July 17 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2L4BeiI By John Kemp LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - No one likes to predict recession, but the global economy is likely to experience a significant slowdown before the end of 2019, and the slowdown may be necessary to relieve upward pressure on oil prices. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund forecasts the global economy will expand at 3.9 percent in both 2018 and 2019, slightly faster than the 3.7 percent achieved in 2017. But beneath the sanguine headline numbers, the outlook provides a long list of downside risk factors, including mounting trade tensions, rising interest rates, political uncertainty and complacent financial markets. “Growth generally remains strong in advanced economies, but it has slowed in many of them, including countries in the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdom,” the IMF admits. “Even U.S. growth is projected to decelerate over the next few years, however, as the long cyclical recovery runs its course and the effects of temporary fiscal stimulus wane”. The broad global expansion that began roughly two years ago has plateaued and become less balanced, according to the Fund (“Global expansion: still strong but less even, more fragile, under threat”, IMF, July 16). The principal economies are still growingly rapidly, with high levels of business and consumer confidence, and contributing to optimism among investors, but there are signs of a potential future slowdown. Global trade volumes are still increasing but the growth rate has slowed significantly since the second half of 2017, according to the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis (“World Trade Monitor”, CPB, July 2018). Leading economic indicators monitored by the OECD have weakened since the start of the year and point to slower expansion over the next six to nine months (“Composite leading indicators”, OECD, July 2018). The OECD says that growth momentum is stable in the United States and Japan but is easing in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. At global level, the expansion is exhibiting increasing signs of maturity, with commodity prices and interest rates rising and capacity constraints emerging in some sectors. For example, aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus are struggling to deliver orders on time as they strive to expand production and their supply chain (“Boeing and Airbus land $43 billion worth of airliner orders”, WSJ, July 16). U.S. trucking firms are complaining about the lack of qualified drivers, and U.S. airlines are preparing to cut their schedules in response to rising fuel costs. In the United States, where growth remains strong, the expansion now shows unmistakeable signs of being at a late stage (tmsnrt.rs/2L4BeiI). The U.S. economy has been expanding for over nine years, according to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research. The current expansion is already the second-longest on record and will overtake the long boom of the 1990s if the economy is still growing in July 2019. Unemployment is close to its lowest level for 50 years and at or below the levels seen at the height of previous booms. Industrial production is growing at some of the fastest rates for 20 years. The Institute for Supply Management’s composite index shows one of the broadest increases in manufacturing activity in the last 70 years. And the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index shows household confidence close to multi-decade highs. But consumer prices are rising at the fastest rate since early 2012, cancelling out hourly wage growth, despite a strong economy. And the yield curve for U.S. government securities shows signs of inverting, which has often been a harbinger of previous economic slowdowns. All these indicators show strong cyclical behaviour; in every case, they point to an expansion fast-approaching the top of the cycle. The global economy is rapidly running out of spare capacity and nowhere is that more obvious than in the oil market. The oil market’s unused production capacity has fallen to multi-decade lows as a result of strong consumption growth and a series of output disruptions in Venezuela, Libya and elsewhere. Iran sanctions threaten to reduce spare capacity even further from the start of November, pushing it down to the lowest level since the oil shocks of 1973/74 and 1979/80. Global oil consumption has surged by an average of 1.7 million barrels per day in each of the last three years, and is forecast to rise by a similar amount in 2018 and 2019. The result is that the global oil industry is being “stretched to the limit”, according to the International Energy Agency (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, July 2018). Oil prices have already climbed by more than 75 percent over the last year, putting upward pressure on global inflation, though they have subsequently eased back slightly in recent days. In the past, the final stages of an economic expansion have usually coincided with a sharp escalation in oil prices, with prices dropping back during the subsequent economic contraction. The causality between economic growth and oil prices runs in both directions, with economic growth as a key driver of oil consumption and prices, and oil prices acting as a check on expansion. U.S. recessions in 1973/74, 1981/82, 1990/91, 2001 and 2007-2009 all helped cool previous rapid increases in oil prices by cutting consumption growth. With the oil market running out of capacity, commodity prices rising and interest rates turning higher, it seems increasingly likely the global economy will experience a slowdown within the next 18 months. The coming slowdown need not be as wrenching as the recession which accompanied the financial crisis in 2008/09. In fact, it probably won’t be. The last downturn was exceptional in terms of its length and severity. Most of the business cycle contractions since 1945 have been much shorter and shallower. Like several previous slowdowns, the next one might be marked by a “pause” in growth rather than an actual decline in economic activity. And it need not be global in scale. Some slowdowns were confined to a subset to economies, such as the East Asian financial crisis of 1997/98, while others continue expanding. But the global economy and the oil market appear to be on an unsustainable trajectory, and the only way to resolve the growing contradictions is likely to be a slowdown in the next 18 months.

2018-07-18,"(Reuters) - Europe’s biggest plastics packager RPC Group Plc (RPC.L) said pressure from investors was preventing it from pursuing some growth opportunities, sending its shares down nearly 8 percent. The British company has been investing heavily to take advantage of strong demand in China as well as produce more recyclable plastics, stoking fears that the higher spending will hit its cash flow. The plastics industry is facing tighter regulation in Europe and elsewhere due to environmental concerns, with China this year banning lower-grade materials for recycling. “Pressure on the company’s market valuation and differing investor views on the appropriate level of leverage is constraining the Group’s ability to pursue some attractive opportunities for growth,” RPC’s Chairman Jamie Pike said on Wednesday. The company, which has spent over $1.5 billion on acquisitions in the past two years, said it would prioritise the proposed disposal of some non-core assets as it looks to generate capital for business expansion or to return money to shareholders. Brokerage Jefferies said there was some disappointment as the company did not announce a buyback. The brokerage had expected a 100-million pound buyback. RPC's shares were down 6.7 percent in early trading and the stock sat at the bottom of the FTSE Midcap Index .FTMC. The company said profitability and cash flow development were in line with its expectations, but did not provide numbers. Revenue rose 5.8 percent to 964.7 million pounds in the quarter ended June 30, helped by its acquisition of Astrapak business in 2017 and favourable polymer prices.

2018-07-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - A giant vessel docked at the port of Moheshkhali in Bangladesh two months ago, propelling the populous but poor nation into the fast-expanding club of liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers. The Excellence is the latest floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), a type of carrier that has proliferated since 2015 as many countries switch to a cleaner and increasingly cheaper fuel than oil and coal. But the young FSRU industry has been beset by more project delays than successes in the past 12 months as fluctuating energy prices, shipping rates, government policies and not least strong demand for gas in China reshape the sector. With the number of countries importing LNG having risen to 42 from 30 in three years, “plug and play” projects, in which regasification vessels link to well-worn physical and commercial infrastructure, are expected to continue if at a slower pace. But strong Chinese demand for super-chilled LNG has dampened the allure of projects in other countries by lapping up excess supply, and new entrants are trying to develop smaller ventures. “In the last year or so, FSRUs have suffered a bit of a setback from the stellar growth they were previously enjoying,” Andrew Buckland, Wood Mackenzie’s global LNG trade and shipping principal analyst, said. “Some of that is down to conditions unique to particular proposed projects. But a lot of it is more to do with demand being stronger than expected in existing conventional markets.” Since a golden period between 2015 and 2017, when almost half of the world’s 34 FSRUs came onstream, projects in Ghana, Pakistan and Ivory Coast have been scrapped and in countries such as Chile, Croatia and South Africa, delayed. Those stung include oil majors such as ExxonMobil (XOM.N), trading houses including Trafigura and shipping companies that provide FSRUs such as Norway’s Hoegh LNG (HLNGH.OL). Some have backed off; others have regrouped in different configurations. For graphic on imports of LNG by floating regasification vessels vs select countries and oil and LNG prices click reut.rs/2KZZ9j6 FSRUs are relatively new - the first was put in operation in 2005 by Excelerate, which figured out how to fit an entire LNG terminal onto a single ship. The unlisted U.S. company, together with Golar (GLNG.O) and Hoegh, now dominates the industry. On the face of it, they have a big advantage over onshore import terminals - cheaper by half at around $300-400 million, twice as quick to deliver and flexible to boot because the vessel can journey to other destinations once it is not needed.  This was shown by Egypt’s first FSRU project, completed by privately owned BW Group within just five months at Ain Sokhna on the Suez canal. But the project was an ideal “plug and play” venture: suffering severe power cuts as its own gas output fell, Egypt had the infrastructure to accept regasified LNG. Conversely, Ghana demonstrates the difficulties of what are still complex projects despite their lower costs and lead times. The country has yet to enter the LNG club despite coming so close that two FSRUs were earmarked for two projects.  Here, issues related to the construction of onshore infrastructure and solid contracts with power plants, the end consumers of the LNG, delayed and scuppered successive ventures. The Golar and Hoegh FSRUs were reassigned to other locations. “Developing countries by their nature have limited capacity when it comes to policy and regulatory structures,” said Lance Crist, head of natural resources for International Finance Corp, a World Bank arm that has lent to several FSRU projects. “Many of these are much smaller markets. You’re not talking about large, liquid markets with established infrastructure where you can just plug and play,” he said. While the Ghana saga unravelled over the past three years, global LNG market trends changed the dynamics of FSRU projects. Rates for transporting LNG rose, boosting the revenues of LNG shipping companies that were thinking of branching into FSRUs, and China’s demand for gas skyrocketed, soaking up an anticipated oversupply in the market. China’s environmental drive to convert heating plants from coal to gas drove 40 percent of global LNG demand growth last year and increased Chinese gas imports by 15 percent, making it the second-largest LNG buyer after Japan, the International Energy Agency said in June. This created less urgency to open new markets by parking FSRUs in countries that had hitherto not bought LNG. Existing terminals, usually underused, took more supplies.  The result has been a slowdown in the delivery of planned projects. “Prior to last winter, when it looked like there’d be excess LNG, creating new demand centres via FSRUs looked a more attractive strategy than it does now,” Buckland said. “Which is not to say they won’t come back to that in the future.” Meanwhile, LNG carrier rates, which slumped to $25,000 per day in 2017, more than tripled to $85,000 a day. This meant those companies that operate LNG carriers but wanted to join the FSRU bonanza had missed the boat - at least for now. For example, LNG carrier company Flex LNG (FLNG.OL) backed out of the FSRU business in May, saying shipping rates and project delays had made the move unattractive compared to improved carrier rates, its chief source of revenue. Some large projects are still due to come onstream, if at a slower pace: Ivory Coast is scheduled to become an LNG-buying nation by 2020 with a Total (TOTF.PA) project using a Golar FSRU.  The rush of new projects between 2015 and 2017 together with predictions of LNG oversupply also attracted trading houses wanting to secure markets for the rising volumes they bought and sold. Trafigura, Vitol and Gunvor have competing plans for FSRUs in Pakistan after the country became an LNG importer in 2016 but have failed to get projects in Bangladesh off the ground. Now the urgency has receded with China’s growing appetite for LNG.  But there has been a proliferation of much smaller projects: LNG-to-power ventures, FSRUs for single users such as gas-intensive fertiliser plants and “petrol stations” for ships using LNG as bunker fuel in northern Europe. “The old ‘FSRU only’ business model is becoming crowded with pressure on returns,” Golar told investors in June, saying it was turning to LNG-to-power projects to drive some of its growth. The World Bank’s IFC has also recognised the new trends and is hunting for more projects. “We are still in the very early stages of a pretty dramatic transformation,” Crist said. “You require critical mass or scale. Once you have an anchor project then you can start doing the milk run - smaller cargos that will proliferate pretty soon over the next five years.”      Reporting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/lng-fsru/analysis-for-the-global-lng-industry-is-the-fsru-honeymoon-over-idUKL1N1TY081,18 Jul 2018,"A giant vessel docked at the

2018-07-18,"* Dollar up as Fed’s Powell sticks with gradual rate hikes * Weakening yen helps Nikkei reach one-month peak * Gold hits one-year lows, oil eases on inventories * Pound pressured as UK politics in disarray By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, July 18 (Reuters) - Asian share markets were mostly firmer on Wednesday as a bullish outlook from the head of the U.S. central bank buoyed the dollar, lifted Tokyo shares to a one-month top and sent gold to a one-year trough. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.43 percent as a weakening yen promised to fatten exporters’ profits. Spreadbetters and futures also pointed to opening gains for European bourses. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1 percent and Australia 0.6 percent. Shanghai blue chips started firm only to flag as China’s yuan lost ground to the advancing dollar. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stuck with an upbeat assessment on the U.S. economy while downplaying the impact of global trade risks on the outlook for rate rises. “The outlook is consistent with two further quarter point rate increases this year, likely in September and December,” said Barclays economist Michael Gaspen. “The main risk is that individuals, business, and financial markets have underestimated the desire of Trump to re-orient trade flows and that further steps to implement tariffs will lead to a reduction in confidence, a slowdown in hiring, and a correction in equity markets,” he added. BofA Merrill Lynch’s latest fund manager survey showed a trade war remained the biggest threat cited by no less than 60 percent of respondents. For now, U.S. companies seem to be profiting mightily from tax cuts as the earnings season shifts into high gear. Analysts now see second-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 21.2 percent, up from 20.7 percent on July 1. Of the 39 companies in the index that have reported so far, 84.6 percent have come in ahead of street expectations. The Dow ended Tuesday up 0.22 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.40 percent and the Nasdaq 0.63 percent. “The S&P has finally broken to the upside through 2,800 out of the range that has confined it for most of this year, and this could now be the start of a grind higher in global equities over the next few weeks,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan in a note. Next stop is the all-time top of 2,872 from January. Powell’s support for more rate hikes sent two-year Treasury yields to the highest in nearly a decade and lifted the dollar broadly. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up at 95.210 , after jumping 0.46 percent overnight. It also climbed to its highest since January against the yen at 113.07. The euro slipped further to $1.1634, after weakening 0.4 percent on Tuesday. The pound suffered another bout of Brexit blues after British Prime Minister Theresa May only just cleared the latest parliamentary hurdle to her leaving plans. Wednesday’s edition of the Times reported May threatened rebel lawmakers in her own party with a general election they defeated the bill. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a no-deal Brexit would have “big” economic consequences and force a review of plans to raise interest rates. Sterling was last huddled at $1.3090, after sliding 0.9 percent on Tuesday. The rising U.S. dollar coupled with the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates spelt trouble for gold, which crashed through major chart support to hit a one-year low. Spot gold was hovering at $1,224.92 per ounce, having cratered at $1,223.78. The steadily less-precious metal is down more than 5 percent for the year. Oil prices also eased after an industry group reported an unexpected increase in U.S. crude inventories.

2018-07-18,"(Repeating story with no changes to text) * North Sea revival seen due to government, industry initiatives * UK authorities cut taxes, established benchmarks * Unit costs halved by efficiencies, technology * Changing of guard to small firms, many backed by private equity By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Oil giant BP’s Eastern Trough Area Project off the coast of Scotland wasn’t supposed to be viable beyond 2018. But government and industry working together have given ETAP a new lease of life that is being closely watched by countries and companies eyeing other ageing projects around the world. When ETAP was launched 20 years ago today, some experts predicted the UK sector of the North Sea would cease most production by 2030. Government efforts to keep producers in the basin, home to the Brent crude that underpins the price benchmark, gained urgency with the 2014 oil price crash. Cheaper oil also forced the industry to upgrade technology and find more efficiencies. From original plans to stop production at ETAP, BP decided to invest $1 billion in 2015. “One has to take stock of the potential going forward and make an intervention that allows for the right investment to extend life,” Ariel Flores, BP’s North Sea Chief, told Reuters. “We’ve done that on ETAP.” ETAP’s example shows how efforts to extend the production in the North Sea are succeeding, providing lessons for producers in other fields near exhaustion such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and southeast Asia. ETAP produces around 37,000 barrels per day of oil now against as much as 217,000 bpd in 2000. But BP production in the entirety of the North Sea is set to double in 2020 to 200,000 bpd from 2014 as fields such as Clair Ridge west of Shetland islands come on line, Flores said. “There are a number of fields in the central North Sea area waiting for final investment decisions (FIDs). And for some of those, the potential host is ETAP,” Flores said. Long-established oil giants such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total as well as smaller, nimbler North Sea-focused producers such as Enquest and Premier Oil are all finding business opportunities in the area. The region has also seen something of a changing of the guard in recent years. Shell, BP, OMV, and Engie have sold fields and infrastructure to smaller players, many of which are backed by private equity or specialise in squeezing more life out of mature assets, such as Chrysaor, Siccar Point and Neptune. Chrysaor acquired around half of Shell’s North Sea portfolio last year and is now one of the largest operators in the basin, boosting reserves by drilling wells around ageing fields, such as the Armada field. “Six years ago you went to the U.S. raising money and everyone was talking about fiscal instability, decommissioning, a basin in decline, and that has completely changed,” Chrysaor CEO Phil Kirk told Reuters. “Now people talk about opportunity, about a change in the ownership of the basin.” Oil and gas companies invested billions in the North Sea in the late 2000s to meet surging demand from Asia but the subsequent oil price rally masked huge inefficiencies and waste. When the bottom fell out in 2014 as shale producers in the United States competed with OPEC for market share, output had already dwindled to around 1 million barrels per day from a peak of 2.6 million in 1999. Investments were drying up and many operators were focused on plugging wells and dismantling fields. That’s where the UK government stepped in. Scottish oil and gas magnate Ian Wood was commissioned in 2013 to look at how government could stem the outflow from an industry that provides 300,000 jobs in the region. The 2014 Wood report led to the creation of the independent Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) and a regulatory overhaul, including scrapping a 50 percent petroleum revenue tax and, starting in November, allowing the transfer of the tax history of an asset to the buyer who can then offset tax on decommissioning. “On the decommissioning side ... they (operators) can see that it’s more manageable, they can see there are improvements happening, they can see that the government has listened,” OGA Director of Operations Gunther Newcombe told Reuters. Tax cuts for the industry in 2015 and 2016 alone amounted to 2.7 billion pounds, the government says. The OGA also started working hand-in-hand with North Sea operators to assemble and share cost benchmarks. “Some thought the UK North Sea was facing a terminal decline but it wasn’t for lack of resource in the ground, it was investment appetite, it was portfolio issues and perceived barriers for investment,” said Chrysaor’s Kirk. Industry made its own changes. Using simpler field designs, replacing custom-made kit from paints to seabed pumps with off-the-shelf equipment, and increasing cooperation among producers to save on transportation and development costs, the North Sea today can compete with other offshore basins and in some cases, even onshore U.S. shale. Sensors that BP has installed on drilling equipment and pumps now detect minuscule vibrations that give engineers precious extra hours, or even minutes, to change a valve or shut down a unit, preventing serious damage and minimising downtime for a field, for example. “We are looking at things more collaboratively, trusting contractors to be able to come up with solutions for us,” Flores said. “At times there had been duplication of work, checking and recalculating calculations. Now there’s a drive towards eliminating that.” BP’s operating efficiency in the North Sea is now more than 80 percent, up from 65 percent earlier this decade, he said. For the UK oil sector as a whole, including the North Sea, production efficiency, measured as a percentage of potential maximum output, is now 74 percent compared to a low of 60 percent in 2012, the OGA said this week. Industry body UK Oil and Gas says unit operating costs last year were around $15 per barrel of oil equivalent, half that in 2014. Producers have also become effective in slowing the natural decline of fields, according to the Bernstein brokerage and research group. The rate of output decline has come down to 5 percent in 2017 from 18 percent in 2012. In the ultimate show of confidence, companies are green-lighting new projects. Dozens of companies competed for 229 blocks to explore and develop new fields in May. Another licencing round for 1,766 blocks will close in November. “We’re finding a huge appetite for the UK. We’re looking currently at possibly sanctioning 14 projects this year,” said the OGA’s Newcombe. “We’ve got around 50 that we’re looking at right now. Last year we sanctioned two. This year we sanctioned five already.” Shell in February decided to go ahead with the development of the Penguins, its first new project in the basin in six years, followed by the FID in June on the Fram condensate field. BP has approved the development of the Alligin and Vorlich fields west of the Shetlands. “Two FIDs in six months tells you that the North Sea competes for capital against other opportunities in other jurisdictions, helped enormously by the government’s commitment,” said Sinead Lynch, Shell’s UK country chair. Total expenditure in the North Sea in 2017, including exploration, development and decommissioning, was half that of 2014 at around 14 billion pounds. But production of both oil and gas is expected to grow to around 1.7 million of oil equivalent per day this year from 1.4 million in 2014, the OGA said. “I don’t think the UK North Sea is ready to turn its lights out for some years to come,” said Premier chief Tony Durrant.

Of the 39 companies in the index that have reported so far, 84.6 percent have come in ahead of street expectations. The Dow ended Tuesday up 0.22 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.40 percent and the Nasdaq 0.63 percent. “The S&P has finally broken to the upside through 2,800 out of the range that has confined it for most of this year, and this could now be the start of a grind higher in global equities over the next few weeks,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan in a note. Next stop is the all-time top of 2,872 from January. Powell’s support for more rate hikes sent two-year Treasury yields to the highest in nearly a decade and lifted the dollar broadly. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up at 95.010 , after jumping 0.46 percent overnight. It also climbed to its highest since January against the yen at 113.07, before steadying at 112.92. The euro was stuck at $1.1655, after weakening 0.4 percent on Tuesday. The pound suffered another bout of Brexit blues after British Prime Minister Theresa May only just cleared the latest parliamentary hurdle to her leaving plans. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned a no-deal Brexit would have “big” economic consequences and force a review of plans to raise interest rates. Sterling was last huddled at $1.3110, after sliding 0.9 percent overnight. The rising U.S. dollar coupled with the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates spelt trouble for gold, which crashed through major chart support to hit a one-year low. Spot gold was hovering at $1,228.11 per ounce, having cratered at $1,225.58. The slightly less precious metal is down more than 5 percent for the year. Oil prices also eased after an industry group reported an unexpected increase in U.S. crude inventories. Brent fell 29 cents to $71.87 a barrel, while U.S. crude was quoted down 32 cents at $67.76 a barrel. Reporting by Wayne Cole

2018-07-18,"TOKYO, July 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped on Wednesday after an industry group reported that U.S. crude inventories rose last week, defying analyst expectations for a significant reduction. Brent futures were down 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $71.76 a barrel by 0027 GMT. They rose 32 cents to $72.16 a barrel on Tuesday, after earlier touching a three-month low. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $67.82. It settled up 2 cents at $68.08 a barrel the session before, coming off a nearly one-month low. The benchmarks had steadied after big declines on Monday and last week as supply disruptions in Venezuela came to the fore and as analysts had been forecasting a decline of 3.5 million barrels in U.S. inventories for the week through July 13. But the spectre of oversupply quickly returned, with a rise of more than 600,000 barrels in U.S. crude stockpiles, reported by the American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday. Gasoline stocks rose by 425,000 barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 44,000-barrel decline. Distillate fuels stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 1.7 million barrels, compared with expectations for an 873,000-barrel gain, the data showed. Refinery crude runs fell by 279,000 barrels per day, the API data showed.

2018-07-18,"* Nikkei hits one-month peak as dollar climbs on yen * Fed’s Powell sticks with gradual rate hikes * Gold sinks to one-year lows, oil eases By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, July 18 (Reuters) - Asian shares followed Wall Street higher on Wednesday as a bullish outlook from the head of the U.S. central bank buoyed the dollar, lifted Tokyo shares to a one-month top and sent gold to a one-year trough. Japan’s Nikkei leapt out of the blocks with a 1 percent gain as a weakening yen promised to fatten exporters’ profits. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.16 percent and South Korea’s market 0.85 percent. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stuck with an upbeat assessment on the U.S. economy while downplaying the impact of global trade risks on the outlook for rate rises. “The outlook is consistent with two further quarter point rate increases this year, likely in September and December,” said Barclays economist Michael Gaspen. “The main risk is that individuals, business, and financial markets have underestimated the desire of Trump to re-orient trade flows and that further steps to implement tariffs will lead to a reduction in confidence, a slowdown in hiring, and a correction in equity markets,” he added. BofA Merrill Lynch’s latest fund manager survey showed a trade war remained the biggest risk cited by no less than 60 percent of respondents.

2018-07-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil giant BP’s (BP.L) Eastern Trough Area Project off the coast of Scotland wasn’t supposed to be viable beyond 2018.    But government and industry working together have given ETAP a new lease of life that is being closely watched by countries and companies eyeing other ageing projects around the world. When ETAP was launched 20 years ago today, some experts predicted the UK sector of the North Sea would cease most production by 2030. Government efforts to keep producers in the basin, home to the Brent crude that underpins the price benchmark, gained urgency with the 2014 oil price crash. Cheaper oil also forced the industry to upgrade technology and find more efficiencies.   From original plans to stop production at ETAP, BP decided to invest $1 billion in 2015.  “One has to take stock of the potential going forward and make an intervention that allows for the right investment to extend life,” Ariel Flores, BP’s North Sea Chief, told Reuters. “We’ve done that on ETAP.” ETAP’s example shows how efforts to extend the production in  the North Sea are succeeding, providing lessons for producers in other fields near exhaustion such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and southeast Asia.    ETAP produces around 37,000 barrels per day of oil now against as much as 217,000 bpd in 2000. But BP production in the entirety of the North Sea is set to double in 2020 to 200,000 bpd from 2014 as fields such as Clair Ridge west of Shetland islands come on line, Flores said.    “There are a number of fields in the central North Sea area waiting for final investment decisions (FIDs). And for some of those, the potential host is ETAP,” Flores said. Long-established oil giants such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) as well as smaller, nimbler North Sea-focused producers such as Enquest (ENQ.L) and Premier Oil (PMO.L) are all finding business opportunities in the area.     The region has also seen something of a changing of the guard in recent years. Shell, BP, OMV (OMVV.VI), and Engie have sold fields and infrastructure to smaller players, many of which are backed by private equity or specialise in squeezing more life out of mature assets, such as Chrysaor, Siccar Point and Neptune.       Chrysaor acquired around half of Shell's North Sea portfolio last year and is now one of the largest operators in the basin, boosting reserves by drilling wells around ageing fields, such as the Armada field.     ""Six years ago you went to the U.S. raising money and everyone was talking about fiscal instability, decommissioning, a basin in decline, and that has completely changed,"" Chrysaor CEO Phil Kirk told Reuters. ""Now people talk about opportunity, about a change in the ownership of the basin."" GRAPHIC - North Sea oil and gas PIC: tmsnrt.rs/2NIBgdB Oil and gas companies invested billions in the North Sea in the late 2000s to meet surging demand from Asia but the subsequent oil price rally masked huge inefficiencies and waste. When the bottom fell out in 2014 as shale producers in the United States competed with OPEC for market share, output had already dwindled to around 1 million barrels per day from a peak of 2.6 million in 1999. Investments were drying up and many operators were focused on plugging wells and dismantling fields.    That’s where the UK government stepped in.  Scottish oil and gas magnate Ian Wood was commissioned in 2013 to look at how government could stem the outflow from an industry that provides 300,000 jobs in the region. The 2014 Wood report led to the creation of the independent Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) and a regulatory overhaul, including scrapping a 50 percent petroleum revenue tax and, starting in November, allowing the transfer of the tax history of an asset to the buyer who can then offset tax on decommissioning.     “On the decommissioning side ... they (operators) can see that it’s more manageable, they can see there are improvements happening, they can see that the government has listened,” OGA Director of Operations Gunther Newcombe told Reuters. Tax cuts for the industry in 2015 and 2016 alone amounted to 2.7 billion pounds, the government says. The OGA also started working hand-in-hand with North Sea operators to assemble and share cost benchmarks. “Some thought the UK North Sea was facing a terminal decline but it wasn’t for lack of resource in the ground, it was investment appetite, it was portfolio issues and perceived barriers for investment,” said Chrysaor’s Kirk.  Industry made its own changes. Using simpler field designs, replacing custom-made kit from paints to seabed pumps with off-the-shelf equipment, and increasing cooperation among producers to save on transportation and development costs, the North Sea today can compete with other offshore basins and in some cases, even onshore U.S. shale.    Sensors that BP has installed on drilling equipment and pumps now detect minuscule vibrations that give engineers precious extra hours, or even minutes, to change a valve or shut down a unit, preventing serious damage and minimising downtime for a field, for example. “We are looking at things more collaboratively, trusting contractors to be able to come up with solutions for us,” Flores said. “At times there had been duplication of work, checking and recalculating calculations. Now there’s a drive towards eliminating that.” BP’s operating efficiency in the North Sea is now more than 80 percent, up from 65 percent earlier this decade, he said.  For the UK oil sector as a whole, including the North Sea, production efficiency, measured as a percentage of potential maximum output, is now 74 percent compared to a low of 60 percent in 2012, the OGA said this week. Industry body UK Oil and Gas says unit operating costs last year were around $15 per barrel of oil equivalent, half that in 2014. Producers have also become effective in slowing the natural decline of fields, according to the Bernstein brokerage and research group. The rate of output decline has come down to 5 percent in 2017 from 18 percent in 2012. NEW INTEREST       In the ultimate show of confidence, companies are green-lighting new projects. Dozens of companies competed for 229 blocks to explore and develop new fields in May. Another licencing round for 1,766 blocks will close in November. “We’re finding a huge appetite for the UK. We’re looking currently at possibly sanctioning 14 projects this year,” said the OGA’s Newcombe.    “We’ve got around 50 that we’re looking at right now. Last year we sanctioned two. This year we sanctioned five already.”    Shell in February decided to go ahead with the development of the Penguins, its first new project in the basin in six years, followed by the FID in June on the Fram condensate field.    BP has approved the development of the Alligin and Vorlich fields west of the Shetlands.     “Two FIDs in six months tells you that the North Sea competes for capital against other opportunities in other jurisdictions, helped enormously by the government’s commitment,” said Sinead Lynch, Shell’s UK country chair.   Total expenditure in the North Sea in 2017, including exploration, development and decommissioning, was half that of 2014 at around 14 billion pounds. But production of both oil and gas is expected to grow to around 1.7 million of oil equivalent per day this year from 1.4 million in 2014, the OGA said. “I don’t think the UK North Sea is ready to turn its lights out for some years to come,” said Premier chief Tony Durrant.
