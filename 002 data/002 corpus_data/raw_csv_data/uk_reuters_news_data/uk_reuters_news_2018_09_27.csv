2018-09-27,"(Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), BMW AG (BMWG.DE) and Daimler AG-owned Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE) have halted sales of some of their plug-in hybrid cars in Europe in the wake of new emissions regulations, Automotive News reported on Thursday. The new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) regime, which went into effect on Sept. 1, gives higher CO2 readings than the old New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) system, pushing vehicles into a higher tax bracket. The new rules could take away tax incentives offered to cars with ultra-low emissions in certain countries, the Automotive News report said. Automakers have to decide whether the extra cost to fit a bigger battery is worth the incentives given, according to the report. The introduction of WLTP has forced some carmakers to withhold non-conforming models from showrooms, prompting them to discount other models to defend their market share.(reut.rs/2QYxxKH) Reporting by Bharath Manjesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autos-emissions/top-german-automakers-halt-sales-of-some-plug-in-hybrid-cars-report-idUKL4N1WD5G4,27 Sep 2018,"Volkswagen AG, BMW AG

2018-09-27,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Petróleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) will pay an $853.2 million fine to settle charges that former executives and directors of the state-run Brazilian oil company broke U.S. anti-corruption laws by bribing politicians and then seeking to conceal the payments, the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) said on Thursday. Shares in Petrobras, as the company is known, were up 6.3 percent in afternoon trading, helped by the latest milestone in turning the page on the landmark “Car Wash” investigation, which ensnared senior executives and high ranking politicians in Latin America’s largest economy. The state oil company was the initial epicenter of that probe, which found evidence that political appointees on its board and elsewhere handed overpriced contracts to engineering firms in return for illicit party funding and bribes.  “Executives at the highest levels of Petrobras - including members of its executive board and board of directors -facilitated the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Brazilian politicians and political parties and then cooked the books to conceal the bribe payments from investors and regulators,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski said in a statement. Because Petrobras securities trade on U.S. markets, regulators and prosecutors in the United States joined the investigation, alleging that related accounting fraud at Petrobras violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that Petrobras had inflated its assets by about $2.5 billion. “Petrobras fraudulently raised billions of dollars from U.S. investors while its senior executives operated a massive, undisclosed bribery and corruption scheme,” said Steven Peikin, co-Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. “If an international company sells securities in the United States, it must provide truthful information about its business.”  Petrobras said in a statement that it had acknowledged responsibility for “violations of books and records and internal controls provisions.” The executives at fault have already left Petrobras, the company said, noting that the company did not admit wrongdoing to the bribery allegation. Under the agreement, which settles the FCPA case, Petrobras will deposit $682.6 million, or 80 percent of the penalties, in a special fund in Brazil, with the rest of the fine being split between the DOJ and the SEC. Brazilian federal prosecutors will determine how Petrobras should allocate the funds in Brazil between social and educational programs in a future agreement. Petrobras said in a statement that the deal “puts an end to the uncertainties, risks, burdens and costs of potential prosecution and protracted litigation in the United States.” The oil company will book a charge of 3.6 billion reais in the third quarter - the local currency equivalent of the penalty - in the latest in a series of Car Wash-related payouts, which also included a $2.95 billion payment to settle a U.S. class action corruption lawsuit earlier this year.  Although Petrobras had not already provisioned for the U.S. settlement, XP Investimentos’ analyst Gabriel Francisco said the penalties will not seriously hurt the company. “The fines will not hinder Petrobras’ plans of reaching a net debt of $69 billion by year-end, as it has a comfortable cash position” said the analyst. “The deal means the end of a chapter.” Despite the settlements with U.S. authorities and shareholders, Petrobras still faces other demands for compensation related to the corruption scandal. Earlier this month, a Dutch court ruled that Petrobras shareholders will have their complaints heard. Argentine investors also initiated this month an arbitration proceeding against the firm for losses related to the corruption probe.    Rafael Mendes Gomes, executive director of governance at Petrobras, said in an interview that admissions made by the oil giant as part of the settlement would not necessarily be used against it in the outstanding class action suits.

Vienna prosecutors launched an investigation into the consortium last year after the defence ministry said it believed they had misled Austria about the price, equipment, and deliverability of the 2003 deal. The probe includes individuals such as Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders. The consortium and Enders have denied the accusations. Parts of the new expert report, commissioned by the Vienna regional court, were seen by Reuters on Thursday. “There were no delivery problems,” said the report, which was submitted in September. “Eurofighter has the necessary expertise to successfully complete its contracts and to deliver its products to the customer in the contractually agreed quality, on the contractually agreed dates and at the agreed costs,” it added. The prosecutor’s office on Thursday confirmed there was a new expert opinion but declined to give any further information. Austria’s chief lawyer Wolfgang Peschorn rejected the expert study. A report from a police special commission provided “clear evidence” that there was “an inability to deliver,” Peschorn told Austrian broadcaster ORF, which first reported on the new expert report on Wednesday night. Airbus declined to comment on the report. Austria initially ordered 18 Eurofighter jets but reduced the order to 15 in 2007.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised rates for the third time this year, indicating its confidence in the U.S. economy. That sentiment carried the dollar higher into a second day and dented the euro, which was further pressured by worries about Italy’s budget. “The Fed is moving faster than most central banks and that’s dollar-supportive,” said Erik Nelson, currency strategist, at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The dollar index rose 0.75 percent, with the euro down 0.7 percent to $1.1656. The greenback also hit a two-week peak against the Swiss franc and Canadian dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 93 points, or 0.35 percent, to 26,478.28, the S&P 500 gained 12.64 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,918.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 62.23 points, or 0.78 percent, to 8,052.60. Apple rose 2.5 percent at one point, the biggest boost to the three main indexes after JP Morgan started coverage of the stock with an “overweight” rating. Amazon rose 1.8 percent after brokerage Stifel talked up its businesses. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.07 percent. In Egypt, the central bank left its main interest rate unchanged on Thursday, saying the decision was consistent with achieving inflation targets. Reports that Italy’s long-awaited budget was facing delay initially dented European shares, which then recovered. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.44 percent. Italy’s main Milan bourse slumped as much as 2 percent , and was last down 0.6 percent, with the country’s big banks sinking even more as the country’s borrowing costs hit a three-week high in the government bond markets. Rome confirmed that a cabinet meeting over budget targets was still planned for later, dismissing an earlier report in the Corriere della Sera newspaper that it could be delayed. Still, Italy’s economic ministry was forced to deny that its chief Giovanni Tria, an academic who does not belong to any one party, had threatened to resign. “It is very fluid and it is changing by the minute it seems,” head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Tim Graf said. “Even if things get resolved positively today, Italy is not a situation that is going to go away,” he added, pointing to the growing popularity of the country’s fractious anti-establishment coalition government. Japan’s Nikkei briefly touched an eight-month high as signs that the United States may not impose further tariffs on Japanese automotive products for now lifted carmakers, though the index eventually ended down nearly 1 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 3.0536 percent, from 3.061 percent late on Wednesday. Spot gold dropped 0.8 percent to $1,184.31 an ounce, tumbling on the stronger dollar. Oil edged higher, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supply once U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in just five weeks’ time. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $72.12 per barrel, up 55 cents or 0.77 percent. Brent crude futures settled at $81.72, up 38 cents or 0.47 percent. Reporting by Hilary Russ;

2018-09-27,"(Removes old oil union quote) * Talks between government, unions break down * Oil union says it will join stoppage * Evidence shows patchy adherence to strike * NNPC says no sign oil output affected By Chijioke Ohuocha and Camillus Eboh LAGOS/ABUJA, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main unions launched an indefinite strike on Thursday in a dispute over the minimum wage and a key oil industry union said it would join, in a decision that could potentially impact crude output. The strike began a day after talks between President Muhammadu Buhari’s government and unions broke down. It is intended to raise pressure on authorities to produce a minimum wage proposal. Unions want the monthly minimum wage raised to about 50,000 naira ($164) from 18,000 naira. Buhari had vowed to review the wage due to a fuel price hike and currency devaluation in the last two years aimed at countering the effects of a global oil price plunge that hit the country hard, given its status as Africa’s biggest crude producer. Buhari plans to stand for a second term at an election next February and his economic record will come under scrutiny, given previous pledges to raise living standards, tackle corruption and improve security. Evidence suggested patchy adherence to the strike. Government offices were shut in the capital, Abuja, while most of the city’s banks were closed, but witnesses said the commercial capital Lagos was largely unaffected. Schools in Maiduguri, capital of northeastern Borno state, were closed. “I am in total support of the strike because almost all commodities have increased - food stuffs, rent is very high. Basically all necessities have doubled in price,” said civil servant Stan James. The possible impact of the strike on oil is important because it is a mainstay in Nigeria, a country with the biggest economy in Africa. Oil union PENGASSAN said: “We are to proceed on the action with immediate effect. However, those on critical and essential services are required to remain on their duty posts.” But a spokesman for Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation said he had seen no sign the strike was affecting production, while Cogent Ojobor, a leader in the Niger Delta region for the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, said: “No oil company is affected for now.” South African telecoms company MTN told staff to work from home due to the strike. Last year Nigeria emerged from its first recession in a quarter of a century. Growth remains fragile and consumer spending is yet to recover. Analysts said a prolonged strike could tip the country back into recession. Nigeria’s accountant general urged workers to call off the strike, saying the government was looking into their grievances.

2018-09-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - The European Commission has decided not to impose provisional import tariffs on a flood of low-priced Argentine biodiesel until it gathers more information, although it considers the fuel to be subsidised and a potential threat to local producers. The decision, detailed in a document seen by Reuters, comes as a major blow for European producers of fuels made from vegetable and recycled oil. They have been hit hard since the EU scrapped duties last year in response to a ruling by the World Trade Organisation.  The Commission had been expected to reinstate provisional duties this month or in October and Argentine sales to the EU had stalled in anticipation. “The Commission’s preliminary conclusions are that the Argentinian imports of the product concerned into the Union are subsidised and that there appears to be a threat of material injury to the Union industry,” the Commission said in the document.  “However, the Commission finds it necessary to collect further information on developments after the investigation period which could further confirm the Commission’s preliminary findings in this investigation as well as shed more light on the Union interest,” it said. “In view of its findings, the Commission will continue the investigation without the imposition of provisional measures.” The Commission said Argentina provided support to its industry through a set of measures, including export duties on soybeans, a biodiesel feedstock, that depressed prices to an artificially low level to the advantage of the downstream biodiesel industry. The EU’s removal of duties on low-price biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia last September and subsequent surge in imports has forced European producers to cut production. French biodiesel maker Saipol, the EU’s largest producer and part of oilseed group Avril, implemented a six-month plan to reduce production in March, blaming huge Argentine biodiesel imports for exacerbating poor market conditions. Other major producers such as Bunge (BG.N) and Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) announced they would cut output or close plants in the EU. According to Argentina’s official statistics agency INDEC, the country has exported a total of 1.1 million tonnes of biodiesel in 2018 as of Aug. 22, of which more than 900,000 tonnes headed to the EU.  Following the WTO ruling, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) launched a fresh challenge and asked the EU for an investigation into the alleged subsidies which was formally opened in January. The final decision is due in February. “We’re very confident that this subsidy investigation will finish in the same way: without any kind of duty for Argentina, which we believe in no way should be applied,” Luis Zubizarreta, president of Carbio, Argentina’s biofuels industry chamber, told Reuters on Thursday.

Last month, Moraeus Hanssen said the deal likely would be concluded this month and approved by government regulators six months later. “Both Mario Mehren, the CEO of Wintershall, and I gave signals that we thought it was very close,” she added. The merged entity is expected to become the biggest independent oil and gas firm in Europe with output of around 600,000 barrels of oil and gas equivalent per day and estimated annual earnings of more than $2.4 billion. Company executives have previously said the new firm could become public on the Frankfurt stock market. DEA, which has been rapidly expanding in Mexico through exploration and production contracts awarded during the energy reform that started in 2014, is a vehicle of Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman.

2018-09-27,"YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Separatist militants raided a prison in northwestern Cameroon and freed about 100 inmates, the government and separatists said on Thursday, as the rebels vowed to block next month’s presidential election in English-speaking regions.   President Paul Biya is expected to easily extend his 36-year rule in the Oct. 7 vote but the insurgency by Anglophone rebels has emerged as his government’s most serious challenge in years.  The separatists complain of discrimination against English speakers in the predominantly Francophone country and want to create an independent state called Ambazonia in the oil and cocoa-producing northwest and southwest regions. Their hit-and-run raids have killed more than 160 members of Cameroon’s security forces in the past year, Amnesty International has said. State forces have also shot at civilians from helicopters, burned villages and killed residents, forcing thousands to flee. Nchia Martin Achuo, the head of the Tigers of Ambazonia, a separatist group that says it has around 2,000 fighters, said his men had attacked the prison in the northwest town of Wum around 4 a.m. on Wednesday and freed 106 “innocent people”.  “There was a shootout between our boys and the prison guards,” he said. “I heard that they (government soldiers) have been arresting innocent people on the street. They are not criminals in that prison.” Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary confirmed the separatists had freed about 100 prisoners but did not provide additional details.  Martin and the leader of another separatist group, Cho Ayaba, both vowed to prevent the presidential election from going ahead in Anglophone Cameroon. Separatists have set up check points blocking traffic on major roads, helping to paralyse activity across the region.  “There will be no election in Ambazonia,” Ayaba told Reuters. “We want to make sure there is no movement from Cameroon into Ambazonia, including election materials.”  The governments in the Anglophone regions have imposed curfews and other security restrictions in recent weeks in order to contain the violence and ensure the vote can take place.   Cameroon’s linguistic divide harks back to the end of World War One, when the League of Nations divided the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors. Biya has ruled virtually by decree since taking office in 1982. Of Africa’s living leaders, only Equatorial Guinea’s President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has ruled uninterrupted for longer.

The British government has said it wants to work with industry to clamp down on the huge waste that litters the land and sea every year. According to government data Britain recycled only 57 percent of the bottles that were sold in 2016, well behind the rates achieved in, for example, Denmark where a deposit return scheme has boosted rates to 90 percent. Tesco said on Thursday the trial of “reverse vending machines” will take place at stores in Borehamwood, north of London, Manchester, Birmingham, Swansea and Edinburgh. The first machine opened in Borehamwood with customers paid 10 pence for each bottle returned. Tesco’s trial follows the launch of similar initiatives by Morrisons (MRW.L), Britain’s No. 4 grocer, the Co-operative, the No. 6 and Iceland, the No. 9. Tesco, which has a UK grocery market share of 27.4 percent, cited polling data by YouGov which found that nearly 75 percent of Britons would be likely to return plastic bottles and aluminium cans under a reverse vending scheme. Tesco said that from Oct. 3 customers would also be able to reuse their own plastic containers when they buy meat, cheese or fish from deli and fish counters in British stores. The group, which has committed to making all its packaging fully recyclable or compostable by 2025, also called on the government to introduce a consistent nationwide approach to recycling. Britain has managed to slash the use of plastic bags since 2015 by charging 5 pence for each bag.

While gasoline prices typically drop following peak summer demand season, they have not fallen as fast as expected, said Jeanette Casselano, spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association. The national price average was at $2.867 a gallon as of Wednesday, its highest seasonally since 2014, according to AAA. For monthly U.S. retail gasoline prices, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zszA2U Fuel prices have risen due to a surge in crude oil prices. U.S. crude futures have gained in part because of U.S. sanctions affecting Iran’s petroleum sector, which have already cut into that nation’s exports, according to market participants. That has forced others, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, to make up the difference. The price of global benchmark Brent hit a four-year high of $82.55 a barrel this week, while U.S. crude hit $72.78, the highest since July 11. The sanctions are expected to take supply off the market when they go into effect in November. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ended a meeting on Sunday with no formal recommendation to boost output. Increased pressure on global supply could cause gasoline prices to remain at current levels or even rise this fall, which would be unusual, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at tracking firm GasBuddy. That could have an effect on voter psyche with the midterm congressional elections approaching. “The absence of a decline at the pump in the fall could be notable as voters head to the polls,” DeHaan said. Yet, prices might not be high enough to sway voter sentiment. Consumers do not usually make “lifestyle changes” until prices rise to $3.25 a gallon or more, Casselano said. Wholesale prices have risen in the Midwest as the region’s refineries undergo maintenance, DeHaan said. In the physical market, gasoline cash differentials in Group Three RUV-DIFF-G3, a region that encompasses several Midwestern states, rose to a near three-year high last week, traders said. For Group Three cash differentials, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zugRUH U.S. gasoline inventories are at seasonal record highs, which could help temper price increases, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. For U.S. gasoline inventories, see: tmsnrt.rs/2ztmrXh The wide discount of U.S. crude to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 has incentivized refiners to make gasoline with cheaper U.S. crude and put it into storage for later sale, Yawger said.

2018-09-27,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is committed to buying Iranian oil and continuing the two nations’ economic cooperation, the Iranian foreign minister said after a meeting with his Indian counterpart and ahead of U.S. sanctions aimed at halting Tehran’s oil exports. U.S. President Donald Trump’s May withdrawal from an international nuclear pact with Iran was followed up with plans to impose new sanctions against the third-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Washington is pushing allies to cut Iranian oil imports to zero once the sanctions start on Nov. 4. Iran’s Foreign Affairs Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met his Indian counterpart, Sushma Swaraj, in New York on the sidelines of United Nation General Assembly, according to a video from news agency ANI, a Reuters affiliate. “Our Indian friends have always been categorical in terms of their intention to continue economic cooperation and (the) import of oil from Iran. And I heard the same statement from my Indian counterpart,”  Zarif said when asked if India has given an assurance about continuing with oil imports. India, Iran’s second-biggest oil client behind China, has already reduced its intake of Iranian oil but has not yet decided whether to end purchases completely. “We have comprehensive cooperation with India and that comprehensive cooperation also includes energy cooperation because Iran has always been a reliable source of energy for India,” Zarif added. Iran is India’s third-biggest oil supplier and the South Asian nation had drawn plans to increase purchases this financial year after Tehran offered almost free shipping and extended credit period. In the previous round of sanctions, India was one of the few countries that continued to trade with Iran. Zarif said Iran wants to expand its bilateral relations with India. The Indian-backed Chabahar port complex in Iran is being developed as part of a new transportation corridor for land-locked Afghanistan. The complex could open the way for millions of dollars in trade and cut India’s dependence on sometimes-hostile neighbor Pakistan. The plant is expected to be operational by 2019. India is looking at providing a $3.5 million-equivalent  bank guarantee for development of the port through UCO Bank, another Indian government source said. Zarif said that Chabahar is still functional and Iran wants  to expand its capacity with support from Indian and other investors.

Italy’s main Milan bourse slumped as much as 2 percent with the country’s big banks down even more as the country’s borrowing costs also hit a three-week high in the government bond markets. Investors have been anxious about Italy’s budget which some fear could lead to a blowout of the country’s deficit, and put the coalition government on a collision course with the European Union. Rome confirmed that a cabinet meeting over budget targets was still planned for later, dismissing an earlier report in the Corriere della Sera newspaper that it could be delayed. But it couldn’t soothe the markets, especially after the economy ministry was forced to deny its chief Giovanni Tria, an academic who doesn’t belong to any one party, had threatened to resign. “It is very fluid and it is changing by the minute it seems,” head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Tim Graf said. “Even if things get resolved positively today, Italy is not a situation that is going to go away,” he added, pointing to the growing popularity of the country’s fractious anti-establishment coalition government. The strains weighed on the rest of Europe too, with the STOXX 600 still in the red despite an attempted rebound and the euro down 0.25 percent in the currency markets having skidded all the way down to $1.17. That fall also gave the dollar a boost after it had only managed a lazy gain after the Federal Reserve hiked U.S. interest rates on Wednesday by another 25 basis points to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. The dollar index which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was last up 0.4 percent to 94.529. The index had scaled a 13-month high in mid-August, drawing safe-haven demand as trade tensions buffeted riskier emerging market currencies. The index has since fallen about 2.8 percent though as investors have become more nuanced in their views. Fed ratesetters still see another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020. Wall Street futures pointed to a broadly steady start having largely expected the move with traders also getting the taste for Apple again after JP Morgan started coverage of the iPhone giant with an “overweight” buy rating. The Australian dollar seen as a barometer of global investor risk appetite and Chinese demand, fell 0.4 percent to $0.7226, its lowest since Sept. 19 and not far off its 2-1/2 year lows of $0.7085 hit earlier this month. Overnight, MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended lower. There were, however, pockets of resilience such as South Korea’s Kospi, which hit three-month highs, as it resumed trade after a three-day public holiday. Japan’s Nikkei briefly touched an eight-month high too as signs that the United States may not impose further tariffs on Japanese automotive products for now lifted carmakers, though the index eventually ended down 1 percent. With the Fed’s steady message still fresh in the mind 10-year U.S. Treasuries yields fell to 3.05 percent, from Tuesday’s four-month high of 3.113 percent when traders had been expecting a more hawkish signal for the U.S. central bank. FOMC members did drop a description of its policy stance as “accommodative”, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell then downplayed the significance of the change at a news conference saying rates were still generally accommodative. Falling Treasury yields were good news for emerging markets. Plenty of EM currencies were firmer despite the dollar’s broader gains against the likes of the euro. Turkey’s lira was back up to 6 per dollar for the first time in almost two week despite data showing that confidence among businesses had seen its biggest month on month slump in a almost decade. EM currencies have been pressured for months by concerns that higher U.S. yields would encourage investors to move funds out of those economies back into the U.S. That’s on top of worries over the U.S.-China trade feud. Indeed, the Philippino finance minister warned the world will be in “deep kimchi” if the current trade war drags on. The country’s central bank raised its rates for a fourth straight meeting on Thursday in an effort to stem the slide in its currency. Rising oil prices are another major pressure point for energy importers and they gained again ahead of U.S. sanctions coming into force on Iranian exports due in November. Global benchmark Brent was 0.7 percent at $81.88 per barrel, near the four-year high of $82.55 set on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1 percent to $72.34 a barrel. “The real big impact is the fuel price...that is what is really worrying me,” Philippines finance minister Carlos Dominguez told Reuters.

France wants to develop more wind, solar and other low-carbon energy sources to cut its dependence on nuclear energy power, which currently counts for over 75 percent of its needs. Latest data from the ministry shows France is lagging on its target to install 10,200 MW solar capacity by the end of the year, and 18,200 MW to 20,200 MW capacity by 2023. Total installed solar capacity was at 8,500 MW as of the end of June. The average price for the projects was at 76.8 euros per megawatt hour (MWh), the minister said in a statement on Thursday.

2018-09-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil edged higher on Thursday, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supply once U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in five weeks. U.S. President Donald Trump this week demanded that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raise production to prevent further price rises ahead of midterm elections in November for U.S. Congress members. “The market continues to move higher on fears that the loss of Iranian exports is not going to be made up,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research  at Tradition Energy, in Stamford Connecticut.  Analysts said that OPEC and Russia appear unlikely to immediately boost production as Trump has demanded. U.S Energy Secretary Rick Perry has ruled out using U.S. strategic crude reserves to lower oil prices.    The most-active December Brent crude futures contract LCOv1 settled up 59 cents at $81.38 a barrel, below the session high of $81.90 but still within sight of Tuesday’s four-year high of $82.55. The front-month November contract expires on Friday. U.S futures CLc1 settled up 55 cents at $72.12 a barrel.  “On paper, you could argue that the technical and fundamental perspective points to higher prices, so I think that will carry on into next week and further out,” Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said. Yet Hansen said he was “struggling to see” the price reaching $100 a barrel.  “Already at $80, we are seeing emerging-market local oil prices pretty close to where we peaked a few years ago ... the race to protect consumers from further price rises from here could potentially impact demand growth sooner than would otherwise have been expected,” Hansen said. But Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said in a note to clients that market risks “are heavily skewed to the upside and whilst we are not explicitly forecasting Brent to rise to $100 per barrel, we see material risks of this coming to fruition.”     Estimates vary widely on how much Iranian crude U.S. sanctions could remove from the market, from 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 2 million bpd. At its 2018 peak in May, Iran exported 2.71 million bpd, nearly 3 percent of daily global crude consumption. Saudi Arabia will quietly add extra oil to the market in coming months to offset a drop in Iranian production but is worried it might need to limit output next year as the United States pumps more crude.     OPEC has little spare capacity. Iran is the group’s third-largest producer.

The new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) regime, which went into effect on Sept. 1, gives higher CO2 readings than the old New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) system, pushing vehicles into a higher tax bracket. The new rules could take away tax incentives offered to cars with ultra-low emissions in certain countries, the Automotive News report said. Automakers have to decide whether the extra cost to fit a bigger battery is worth the incentives given, according to the report. The introduction of WLTP has forced some carmakers to withhold non-conforming models from showrooms, prompting them to discount other models to defend their market share.(reut.rs/2QYxxKH) Reporting by Bharath Manjesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autos-emissions/top-german-automakers-halt-sales-of-some-plug-in-hybrid-cars-report-idUKL4N1WD5G4,27 Sep 2018,"Volkswagen AG, BMW AG

2018-09-27,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Petróleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) will pay an $853.2 million fine to settle charges that former executives and directors of the state-run Brazilian oil company broke U.S. anti-corruption laws by bribing politicians and then seeking to conceal the payments, the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) said on Thursday. Shares in Petrobras, as the company is known, were up 6.3 percent in afternoon trading, helped by the latest milestone in turning the page on the landmark “Car Wash” investigation, which ensnared senior executives and high ranking politicians in Latin America’s largest economy. The state oil company was the initial epicenter of that probe, which found evidence that political appointees on its board and elsewhere handed overpriced contracts to engineering firms in return for illicit party funding and bribes.  “Executives at the highest levels of Petrobras - including members of its executive board and board of directors -facilitated the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Brazilian politicians and political parties and then cooked the books to conceal the bribe payments from investors and regulators,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski said in a statement. Because Petrobras securities trade on U.S. markets, regulators and prosecutors in the United States joined the investigation, alleging that related accounting fraud at Petrobras violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that Petrobras had inflated its assets by about $2.5 billion. “Petrobras fraudulently raised billions of dollars from U.S. investors while its senior executives operated a massive, undisclosed bribery and corruption scheme,” said Steven Peikin, co-Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. “If an international company sells securities in the United States, it must provide truthful information about its business.”  Petrobras said in a statement that it had acknowledged responsibility for “violations of books and records and internal controls provisions.” The executives at fault have already left Petrobras, the company said, noting that the company did not admit wrongdoing to the bribery allegation. Under the agreement, which settles the FCPA case, Petrobras will deposit $682.6 million, or 80 percent of the penalties, in a special fund in Brazil, with the rest of the fine being split between the DOJ and the SEC. Brazilian federal prosecutors will determine how Petrobras should allocate the funds in Brazil between social and educational programs in a future agreement. Petrobras said in a statement that the deal “puts an end to the uncertainties, risks, burdens and costs of potential prosecution and protracted litigation in the United States.” The oil company will book a charge of 3.6 billion reais in the third quarter - the local currency equivalent of the penalty - in the latest in a series of Car Wash-related payouts, which also included a $2.95 billion payment to settle a U.S. class action corruption lawsuit earlier this year.  Although Petrobras had not already provisioned for the U.S. settlement, XP Investimentos’ analyst Gabriel Francisco said the penalties will not seriously hurt the company. “The fines will not hinder Petrobras’ plans of reaching a net debt of $69 billion by year-end, as it has a comfortable cash position” said the analyst. “The deal means the end of a chapter.” Despite the settlements with U.S. authorities and shareholders, Petrobras still faces other demands for compensation related to the corruption scandal. Earlier this month, a Dutch court ruled that Petrobras shareholders will have their complaints heard. Argentine investors also initiated this month an arbitration proceeding against the firm for losses related to the corruption probe.    Rafael Mendes Gomes, executive director of governance at Petrobras, said in an interview that admissions made by the oil giant as part of the settlement would not necessarily be used against it in the outstanding class action suits.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised rates for the third time this year, indicating its confidence in the U.S. economy. That sentiment carried the dollar higher into a second day and dented the euro, which was further pressured by worries about Italy’s budget. “The Fed is moving faster than most central banks and that’s dollar-supportive,” said Erik Nelson, currency strategist, at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The dollar index rose 0.75 percent, with the euro down 0.7 percent to $1.1656. The greenback also hit a two-week peak against the Swiss franc and Canadian dollar.

Apple rose 2.5 percent at one point, the biggest boost to the three main indexes after JP Morgan started coverage of the stock with an “overweight” rating. Amazon rose 1.8 percent after brokerage Stifel talked up its businesses. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.07 percent. In Egypt, the central bank left its main interest rate unchanged on Thursday, saying the decision was consistent with achieving inflation targets. Reports that Italy’s long-awaited budget was facing delay initially dented European shares, which then recovered. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.44 percent. Italy’s main Milan bourse slumped as much as 2 percent , and was last down 0.6 percent, with the country’s big banks sinking even more as the country’s borrowing costs hit a three-week high in the government bond markets.

2018-09-27,"(Removes old oil union quote) * Talks between government, unions break down * Oil union says it will join stoppage * Evidence shows patchy adherence to strike * NNPC says no sign oil output affected By Chijioke Ohuocha and Camillus Eboh LAGOS/ABUJA, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main unions launched an indefinite strike on Thursday in a dispute over the minimum wage and a key oil industry union said it would join, in a decision that could potentially impact crude output. The strike began a day after talks between President Muhammadu Buhari’s government and unions broke down. It is intended to raise pressure on authorities to produce a minimum wage proposal. Unions want the monthly minimum wage raised to about 50,000 naira ($164) from 18,000 naira. Buhari had vowed to review the wage due to a fuel price hike and currency devaluation in the last two years aimed at countering the effects of a global oil price plunge that hit the country hard, given its status as Africa’s biggest crude producer. Buhari plans to stand for a second term at an election next February and his economic record will come under scrutiny, given previous pledges to raise living standards, tackle corruption and improve security. Evidence suggested patchy adherence to the strike. Government offices were shut in the capital, Abuja, while most of the city’s banks were closed, but witnesses said the commercial capital Lagos was largely unaffected. Schools in Maiduguri, capital of northeastern Borno state, were closed. “I am in total support of the strike because almost all commodities have increased - food stuffs, rent is very high. Basically all necessities have doubled in price,” said civil servant Stan James. The possible impact of the strike on oil is important because it is a mainstay in Nigeria, a country with the biggest economy in Africa. Oil union PENGASSAN said: “We are to proceed on the action with immediate effect. However, those on critical and essential services are required to remain on their duty posts.” But a spokesman for Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation said he had seen no sign the strike was affecting production, while Cogent Ojobor, a leader in the Niger Delta region for the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, said: “No oil company is affected for now.” South African telecoms company MTN told staff to work from home due to the strike. Last year Nigeria emerged from its first recession in a quarter of a century. Growth remains fragile and consumer spending is yet to recover. Analysts said a prolonged strike could tip the country back into recession. Nigeria’s accountant general urged workers to call off the strike, saying the government was looking into their grievances.

2018-09-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - The European Commission has decided not to impose provisional import tariffs on a flood of low-priced Argentine biodiesel until it gathers more information, although it considers the fuel to be subsidised and a potential threat to local producers. The decision, detailed in a document seen by Reuters, comes as a major blow for European producers of fuels made from vegetable and recycled oil. They have been hit hard since the EU scrapped duties last year in response to a ruling by the World Trade Organisation.  The Commission had been expected to reinstate provisional duties this month or in October and Argentine sales to the EU had stalled in anticipation. “The Commission’s preliminary conclusions are that the Argentinian imports of the product concerned into the Union are subsidised and that there appears to be a threat of material injury to the Union industry,” the Commission said in the document.  “However, the Commission finds it necessary to collect further information on developments after the investigation period which could further confirm the Commission’s preliminary findings in this investigation as well as shed more light on the Union interest,” it said. “In view of its findings, the Commission will continue the investigation without the imposition of provisional measures.” The Commission said Argentina provided support to its industry through a set of measures, including export duties on soybeans, a biodiesel feedstock, that depressed prices to an artificially low level to the advantage of the downstream biodiesel industry. The EU’s removal of duties on low-price biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia last September and subsequent surge in imports has forced European producers to cut production. French biodiesel maker Saipol, the EU’s largest producer and part of oilseed group Avril, implemented a six-month plan to reduce production in March, blaming huge Argentine biodiesel imports for exacerbating poor market conditions. Other major producers such as Bunge (BG.N) and Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) announced they would cut output or close plants in the EU. According to Argentina’s official statistics agency INDEC, the country has exported a total of 1.1 million tonnes of biodiesel in 2018 as of Aug. 22, of which more than 900,000 tonnes headed to the EU.  Following the WTO ruling, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) launched a fresh challenge and asked the EU for an investigation into the alleged subsidies which was formally opened in January. The final decision is due in February. “We’re very confident that this subsidy investigation will finish in the same way: without any kind of duty for Argentina, which we believe in no way should be applied,” Luis Zubizarreta, president of Carbio, Argentina’s biofuels industry chamber, told Reuters on Thursday.

Last month, Moraeus Hanssen said the deal likely would be concluded this month and approved by government regulators six months later. “Both Mario Mehren, the CEO of Wintershall, and I gave signals that we thought it was very close,” she added. The merged entity is expected to become the biggest independent oil and gas firm in Europe with output of around 600,000 barrels of oil and gas equivalent per day and estimated annual earnings of more than $2.4 billion. Company executives have previously said the new firm could become public on the Frankfurt stock market. DEA, which has been rapidly expanding in Mexico through exploration and production contracts awarded during the energy reform that started in 2014, is a vehicle of Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman.

Exxon also sees new opportunities in Brazil’s biofuels, bioenergy and gas sectors, Lacerda said during a panel discussion at the Rio Oil & Gas convention in Rio de Janeiro. “We are principally in the exploration phase so my big task now is to drill some wells so that we can start up production some day,” Lacerda said. Exxon has plowed big money into Brazil to replenish its dwindling reserves, starting with an oil auction in September of last year. Before that, it was among the few oil majors without an exploration presence in Brazil’s pre-salt, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor.

2018-09-27,"SARAJEVO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The EU energy watchdog urged a Bosnian regional parliament on Thursday not to approve a government guarantee for a China Exim Bank loan that is designed to help power utility EPBiH add a new unit at its Tuzla coal-fired power plant. The guarantee covers 85 percent of the total value of the contract signed last November for the largest investment in Bosnia’s postwar energy infrastructure. EPBiH’s shareholders gave it the go-ahead this month but it must still be approved by the parliament of the autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation. The Energy Community, an international body established by the EU and eight aspiring member states to extend the bloc’s energy policy to would-be members, said the guarantee may constitute illegal state aid and that the vote should be put on hold until the case has been properly investigated. “Such approval could lead to lengthy and costly recovery procedures. Besides, the (Energy Community) Secretariat may have to open infringement procedures against Bosnia and Herzegovina,” its head Janez Kopac said in a letter to lawmakers made available to Reuters. The move follows a complaint from environmentalist groups opposed to the project. They accused the government of the Bosniak-Croat Federation of trying to rush the deal through the parliament before national and regional elections in Bosnia on Oct. 7. They argued that under the Energy Community Treaty, Bosnia must follow EU rules on subsidies in the energy sector. “Among other things, in most cases state guarantees may only cover a maximum 80 percent of the total loan amount,” they said in the complaint. The Balkans are increasingly turning to China for funding as the European Union, the World Bank and other institutions cut back on financing coal-based projects. China Gezhouba Group and Guandong Electric Power were picked to build the 450 megawatt (MW) unit in the city of Tuzla at a cost of 1.8 billion Bosnian marka ($1.1 billion), to replace three outdated units at the 715 MW plant. Chinese firms are implementing a series of projects in the Balkans, mainly in the energy sector, and worth around 3.8 billion euros  in Bosnia alone. Environmentalists object to the coal projects planned with China, saying they do not meet EU rules and could add to already high levels of air pollution, while also exposing cash-strapped Bosnia to costly plant upgrades once it joins the EU.

2018-09-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The White House is considering imposing restrictions on trading of biofuel credits, hoping to discourage speculation and reduce costs for oil refiners to comply with U.S. biofuels policy, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to comment on the discussions, said an announcement could be made in coming weeks. The move would be part of a widely anticipated deal to help U.S. corn farmers and biofuels producers by lifting a ban on summer sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he supports lifting that ban on so-called E15 gasoline to help expand the market for corn. This could also bolster vulnerable Midwest Republican members of the U.S. Congress in competitive races heading into the November elections, and appease corn farmers stung by Trump’s escalating trade wars. But lifting the ban could draw legal challenges from the oil industry, which worries such a move would eat into their market share. The White House and the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers U.S. biofuels regulations, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool each year, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that must buy the credits have complained about volatile prices in recent years. The White House is considering trade restrictions such as capping the number of credits a dealer can hold at 120 percent of their company’s annual compliance obligation, the sources said. It is also considering restricting certain parties from holding the credits for more than 30 days. Such moves could prevent credit traders from hoarding credits to pump up prices artificially. Some refiners that have complained of high credit prices, such as like PBF Energy (PBF.N) and Valero Energy Corp. (VLO.N), may welcome such restrictions. But other fuel companies that have managed to land trading profits in the credit market are likely to oppose the plan. Biofuel credit prices were near five-year highs last year, but have dropped sharply to their lowest since 2013, due mainly to the EPA’s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations. Trump is expected to direct the EPA to seek a rule lifting the E15 ban during a trip to Iowa in October, sources told Reuters. The ban was put in place as an anti-smog measure, though studies have since shown its environmental benefits are limited. The rule would have to be fast-tracked to have it finalized before the next summer driving season. This is not the first time Trump has waded into the debate over biofuels policy which pits two groups that have supported him against each other: farmers and refiners. He tried to broker a deal between the rival corn and oil industries earlier this year, but those efforts stumbled as the corn lobby dug in its heels against certain changes.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised rates for the third time this year, indicating its confidence in the U.S. economy. That sentiment carried the dollar higher into a second day and dented the euro, which was further pressured by worries about Italy’s budget. “The Fed is moving faster than most central banks and that’s dollar-supportive,” said Erik Nelson, currency strategist, at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, rose 0.68 percent, while the euro dipped 0.6 percent to $1.1668. The greenback hit a two-week peak against the Swiss franc and Canadian dollar. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 117.28 points, or 0.44 percent, to 26,502.56, the S&P 500 gained 15.89 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,921.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.42 points, or 0.86 percent, to 8,058.79. Apple rose 2.5 percent, the biggest boost to the three main indexes after JP Morgan started coverage of the stock with an “overweight” rating. Amazon.com rose 1.5 percent after brokerage Stifel talked up its businesses. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.17 percent. Reports that Italy’s long-awaited budget was facing delay initially dented European shares, which then recovered. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.48 percent. Italy’s main Milan bourse slumped as much as 2 percent , and was last down 0.6 percent, with the country’s big banks sinking even more as the country’s borrowing costs hit a three-week high in the government bond markets. Rome confirmed that a cabinet meeting over budget targets was still planned for later, dismissing an earlier report in the Corriere della Sera newspaper that it could be delayed. Still, Italy’s economic ministry was forced to deny that its chief Giovanni Tria, an academic who doesn’t belong to any one party, had threatened to resign. “It is very fluid and it is changing by the minute it seems,” head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Tim Graf said. “Even if things get resolved positively today, Italy is not a situation that is going to go away,” he added, pointing to the growing popularity of the country’s fractious anti-establishment coalition government. Japan’s Nikkei briefly touched an eight-month high as signs that the United States may not impose further tariffs on Japanese automotive products for now lifted carmakers, though the index eventually ended down nearly 1 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 3.0667 percent, from 3.061 percent late Wednesday. Oil edged higher, driven by the prospect of a shortfall in global supply once U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran come into force in just five weeks’ time. U.S. crude rose 0.43 percent to $71.88 per barrel and Brent was last at $81.01, up 0.27 percent. Additional reporting by Marc Jones and Amanda Cooper in

2018-09-27,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian fibers producer Lenzing (LENV.VI) will focus on setting up a new production facility in Thailand after halting its planned U.S. expansion due in part to rising trade tensions, its chief executive said on Thursday. The firm, which makes cellulose fibers used in textiles, said late Wednesday it was mothballing a $322 million project in Alabama, partly due to rising tariffs between the United States and China, where much of the project’s production was destined. Stefan Doboczky told Reuters on Thursday that a final investment decision on a new facility in Thailand would be made in a few months.  Thai production volumes would be around 90,000 tons per year - roughly the same as initially planned for the new U.S. plant, he added.  Lenzing is expanding internationally and announced in summer last year that it planned to enter the Thai market. “It is ... one of the few countries that have free trade agreements in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)region as well as with China and India,” Doboczky said, when asked why the new focus on Thailand.  “(To be able) to supply customers worldwide is extremely important in our business.” Chinese textile exports to the United States now face a 10 percent tariff, and Doboczky said it was possible those tariffs might increase and that China would respond with counter-duties. “Our assessment is that products such as our Lyocell fiber may be affected.” Lyocell, a fiber produced from wood, is one of the group’s top-sellers. Lenzing shares closed down around 14 percent on Thursday.    Doboczky said the company would wait until there was clarity regarding tariffs before deciding when to restart the U.S. project.  He also wants to see signs that the local jobs market is easing, as a big rise in labor costs was another reason for stopping construction at the Alabama site.  “It is our clear target to continue (building the U.S. site) and to push the start button again at the right time.”       The CEO said he did not expect substantial impairments due to the construction halt and 2018 earnings would not suffer.  “We now have neither a profit warning for 2018, neither a change in our earnings, nor do we face a write-off,” he said. Lenzing expects 2018 earnings to be lower than in the last two years, partly due to increased commodity prices and strong competition on the fibers market.

2018-09-27,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will quietly add extra oil to the market over the next couple of months to offset a drop in Iranian production but is worried it might need to limit output next year to balance global supply and demand as the United States pumps more crude.  The kingdom, OPEC’s top producer, came under renewed pressure last week from U.S. President Donald Trump to cool oil prices ahead of a meeting in Algiers between a number of OPEC ministers and allies including Russia. Two sources familiar with OPEC policy said Saudi Arabia and other producers discussed a possible production increase of about 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies. But Riyadh decided against pressing for an official increase now as it realized it would not secure agreement from all producers present at the talks, some of which lack spare production capacity and would be unable to boost output quickly. Such a move would have unsettled relations among producers, the sources said, with the Saudis keen to maintain unity among the so-called OPEC+ alliance in case Riyadh wants to change course in future and seek their collaboration on an output cut. “There are only two months left until the end of the year, so why create tensions now between Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia?” one source familiar with the Algiers discussions said. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday he was concerned that oil production gains, mainly from the United States, could outstrip a projected increase in oil demand and result in an inventory overhang globally.  “There are more demand threats next year compared to supply threats,” said the second source, who also has knowledge of the talks. Oil prices LCOc1 rose to their highest since 2014 above $80 per barrel this week on fears that a steep decline in Iranian oil exports because of new U.S. sanctions will deepen an oil deficit, along with production declines in Venezuela. However, OPEC’s latest report released at the weekend forecast that its non-OPEC rivals led by the United States would increase output by 2.4 million bpd in 2019 while global oil demand should grow by just 1.5 million bpd. That, Saudi thinking goes, could create a large surplus of crude next year, especially if a stronger dollar and weaker emerging market economies reduce global demand for oil. The big unknown, however, is to what extent Iran will be forced to reduce output next year as customers in Europe and Asia walk away from its oil, in reaction to U.S. sanctions. OPEC’s own reports show Iranian supply has already fallen by around 300,000 bpd in recent weeks, although Iran insists it has remained steady at some 3.8 million bpd. Sources familiar with Saudi production plans said the kingdom would raise output by some 200,000-300,000 bpd in September and October on top of the 10.4 million bpd it produced in August, to meet additional client demand, mainly in Asia. State firm Saudi Aramco plans to add new crude output capacity of some 550,000 bpd in the fourth quarter from the Khurais and Manifa oilfields, allowing it more flexibility to raise production if needed, a source told Reuters on Thursday. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, is the only major producer with enough spare capacity to raise output quickly, balancing supply and demand. The kingdom effectively acts as the oil market’s central banker, its thinking and action on supply closely watched by traders.  At the moment, Riyadh is gathering data and has not decided on its exact course of action for next year.  If Iranian supply turns out tighter than anticipated and prices rise further, a formal production increase from OPEC and allies next year may still be possible and will be discussed at a meeting on Dec. 6-7, the two sources said. The exact, additional volumes and the timeline for any increase would depend on producers’ compliance with their current output agreement in coming months and the market outlook for 2019, one of the sources said. “The reality is that no one (outside Saudi Arabia) can raise output in the next few weeks. But many can do that in 12 months or so,” one of the sources said.

2018-09-27,"ZAGREB, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Croatia has again extended a deadline for submitting binding bids for the use of a planned floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the northern Adriatic. “The deadline has been moved from Sept. 28 to Dec. 20 this year,” state-owned LNG Croatia said in a statement on its website on Thursday. The decision was taken after a request from potential bidders, it added. The first time the deadline was extended in early August was for the same reason. The terminal on the northern Adriatic island of Krk is planned as part of the European Union’s efforts to diversify from Russian energy imports. The targeted markets are countries in central and southeastern Europe. The value of the terminal is seen at 250 million euros ($291.63 million) with the European Union financing just over 120 million euros. The capacity of the terminal, which has a tentative date for operation from early 2020, will eventually depend on demand. Local media reported earlier this year that initial demand for the terminal had been rather low, causing a delay in the final investment decision originally planned for last June.

2018-09-27,"(Adds Pemex CEO comments, background, tweaks headline) By David Alire Garcia and Marianna Parraga ACAPULCO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Mexican state-run oil company Pemex expects to begin importing up to 100,000 barrels per day of light crude oil, likely from the United States, from late October and at least until the end of November, its chief executive said on Wednesday. “A hundred thousand barrels (per day) more or less is what we’re going to import to process and incorporate into our refineries, mostly at Salina Cruz,” Pemex CEO Carlos Trevino said in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the Mexican Petroleum Congress in Acapulco. The imports, planned to run through at least the end of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s tenure in office on Nov. 30, mark a stark shift for historically major crude exporter Mexico, where decades of oil self-sufficiency are a badge of pride. Years of under investment and declining crude output have severely hampered Mexico’s refineries and helped necessitate the move. Salina Cruz, like Pemex’s other five refineries, has recently been producing far below capacity due to accidents and operational problems, as well as Pemex’s focus on maximizing the value of its oil even if that means refining less domestically. “We’re going to mix it with Mexican crude, with some of our mix to be able to process at the levels we want to get back to in refining. We should be around 800,000 barrels (per day of refining in the country’s entire system) by the end of the year,” he added. Mexico’s refining network can process up to 1.6 million bpd of crude. It has been working this year at around 40 percent. Trevino said he expects auctions of oil exploration and production blocks scheduled for February, which include the selection of key partners for Pemex, will take place as planned. “I think there is total certainty” that Mexico’s oil regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), will carry out the auctions. Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that oil auctions are suspended until contracts already awarded over the past few years have been reviewed, but he has not specifically weighed in on the February tenders. Pemex, whose oil production and refining volumes have continued declining this year amid the depletion of some of its main oilfields, will not meet its crude output target of 1.95 million barrels per day in 2018. “We’re going to be considerably below that,” Trevino told reporters at the conference later in the evening, declining to provide a specific volume. He expects another year of production decline in 2019, even though Pemex had originally planned to stabilize output by then. Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, handily won Mexico’s presidential election in part by promising sweeping changes to Mexico’s energy industry. His energy team has signaled they want Pemex to select its own partners instead of having them chosen in auctions run by the CNH. Trevino said the new process would be “easier,” underscoring that the current selection process “costs us time.” (Writing by Anthony Esposito; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Richard Pullin)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-pemex-oil/update-2-pemex-plans-up-to-100000-bpd-light-crude-imports-says-ceo-idUKL2N1WD00R,27 Sep 2018,"Mexican state-run oil company

2018-09-27,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Union officials representing 30,000 workers at U.S. oil refineries and chemical plants on Wednesday said they will pursue sizable wage increases and a 3-year contract in coming negotiations.      Contract talks, which begin in January, come as U.S. refiners are enjoying strong profits, near-full utilization rates and record product exports. In the June quarter, the margin on turning crude to gasoline, diesel and other products was the highest since 2015. The United Steelworkers union (USW) wants a wage increase comparable to the 6 percent per year increase it originally sought during 2015 talks, Kim Nibarger, chairman of the USW’s national oil bargaining program, said in an interview following a three-day union meeting in San Diego.  In 2015, USW members went on a six-week strike at 12 U.S. refineries and three chemical plants. In the end, they accepted a four-year contract that provided members between 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent annual increases each year and changes to working conditions.  Nibarger declined to provide specifics of the proposals that union officials will bring to their members in coming weeks. Local union members will have 45 days to vote on the proposals reached on Wednesday. If 75 percent of locals agree, the wage increase will be presented to companies in January. “They are in the range of the proposals made in 2015,” he said. “I think it is an aggressive proposal, but not unreasonable given the dedication of members to keep their facilities operating at top notch.” Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) was once again named lead negotiator on behalf of companies that own U.S. refineries, including Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) BP Plc (BP.L), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N) and Delek US Holdings Inc (DK.N). Shell declined immediate comment on Wednesday. “Our goal is a mutually beneficial agreement for our members and the companies they work for,” said Nibarger.  The USW also wants improvements in a standard meant to reduce fatigue among its workers. It sought a similar change in 2015, he said.  In 2015, the national strike lasted six weeks and some local strikes continued for months with workers at the Marathon Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas not returning to work until July. The current USW contract runs out on Feb. 1.

2018-09-27,"* Wall Street, Nikkei down a tad after Fed policy review * Fed sees 5 more rate hikes by 2020, above neutral levels By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Global equities ran out of steam and U.S. bond yields fell after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected, sticking  to its script of gradual policy tightening with forecasts of five more rate hikes by 2020. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.05 percent in early trade while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.45 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 percent and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 percent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.21 percent. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell more than 5 basis points to 3.048 percent. The Fed bumped up its policy target by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.00-2.25 percent and indicated that it foresees another rate rise in December, three more next year, and one in 2020. While that was little changed from its previous projections in June, it would put the benchmark overnight lending rate at 3.4 percent, roughly half a percentage point above the Fed’s estimated “neutral” rate of interest, by 2020. “The Fed seems to have grown more convinced of the need to keep raising rates beyond the neutral levels. I cannot see reasons to slow down raising rates as long as the jobless rate keeps falling,” said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income strategist at Nomura Securities. But some investors see a limited need for the Fed to keep raising rates as inflation has shown no sign of picking up so far, despite continued economic growth and a tight labour market. The U.S. unemployment rate stood near its lowest level since 2001. “Three hikes next year is absurd,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa. “With an additional rate hike likely in 2018 and one in March next year, we will reach what many Fed governors feel is a neutral rate level. With the low odds of a spike in inflation, it makes sense that the Fed would pause after the March rate hike and allow the markets to adjust to its new policy,” he said. Some investors also say trade disputes between the Trump administration and several trading partners are adding more uncertainty to the economic outlook. U.S. tariffs and retaliatory levies by others could slow the global economic growth, but broad-based tariffs could also stoke inflation by raising the prices of imported goods. In the currency market, the dollar was mixed after the Fed’s decision. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 94.266, having gained 0.13 percent on Wednesday. It hovered above Friday’s 2 1/2-month low of 93.808. The euro traded at $1.1749, off three-month high of $1.18155 touched on Monday. The yen hit a 10-week low of 113.145 to the dollar in a choppy trade after the Fed’s policy announcement but it bounced back to 112.75. Emerging market currencies, which had been pressured by concerns higher U.S. yields will encourage investors to move funds out of emerging markets to the United States, were firmer. MSCI emerging market currency index rose 0.2 percent on Wednesday. The gains means its performance so far this month is up 0.25 percent, raising hopes it could post its first monthly rise in six months. Oil prices gained on an impending fall in Iranian exports. Global benchmark Brent rose 0.9 percent to $82.10 per barrel, near the four-year high of $82.55 set on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.2 percent to $72.45 a barrel.

Brent crude futures were at $82.04 per barrel at 0104 GMT, up by 70 cents, or 0.9 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $72.35 a barrel, up 78 cents, or 1.1 percent from their last settlement. Traders said oil markets were tightening ahead of Washington’s planned sanctions on Iran’s petroleum industry from Nov. 4. At its 2018 peak, Iran exported around 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, equivalent to 3 percent of global consumption, and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has little spare capacity to make up for an expected shortfall in Iranian exports. Reflecting expectations of lower supply from the Middle East, Oman crude futures on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange touched their highest in four years on Wednesday, briefly jumping above $90 a barrel. “Oil prices remain in the Bulls domain amid concern that U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude oil exports will result in much tighter physical market conditions once they take effect in November,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “Markets could still be underestimating the supply crunch from Iran sanctions,” he added. While global oil markets tighten, supply in the United States is ample, thanks to rising output. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA hit a record 11.1 million bpd in the week ending Sept. 21, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). That’s an increase of almost a third since mid-2016. Commercial crude stocks C-STK-T-EIA rose by 1.85 million barrels, to 395.99 million barrels, the EIA data showed.

2018-09-27,"(Repeats Sept. 26 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ObCbGz By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Despite political support from the White House, U.S. coal consumption continues to fall, as power producers shutter coal-fired units in favour of cheaper and more flexible natural gas as well as solar and wind. Electric power producers’ coal consumption fell to 298 million short tons in the first half of 2018, down from 312 million in the same period in 2017, marginally below 2016, and the lowest since 1983 (tmsnrt.rs/2ObCbGz). U.S. power producers generated almost 6 percent less electricity from coal in the first half of the year even as total generation rose almost 5 percent and gas-fired generation was up 17 percent. Coal-fired generation declined by 32 billion kilowatt hours in the first six months, while gas-fired generation rose by 89 billion, nuclear was up by 16 billion, solar rose 7 billion and wind was up by 15 billion. Generators continued to close coal units, with coal-fired generating capacity down to 246 gigawatts at the end of June 2018, compared with 262 gigawatts in June 2017 and 273 gigawatts in June 2016. Remaining coal units are being run for fewer hours and/or at lower rates than last year, another indication they are struggling to compete with cheap natural gas. Capacity utilisation at the remaining coal-fired units was at or below prior-year levels in six of the first seven months in 2018 (“Electric Power Monthly”, Energy Information Administration, September 2018). Another 9 gigawatts of coal-fired generation capacity are scheduled to close before the end of 2020, so coal consumption is unlikely to rise and will probably continue to decline in the next few years. Most coal-fired power plants still in operation were commissioned in the 1970s and 1980s, when surging oil prices caused a shift from oil-fired to coal-fired generation. Most are now 35-50 years old and as a result of corrosion and fatigue require expensive replacements of steam generators and other large pieces of equipment. Ageing power plants also suffer from rising operation and maintenance costs, increased outages, reduced reliability and reduced thermal efficiency. Retrofitting them to comply with tougher pollution controls adds to the financial burden of keeping them in service though in many cases is not the major reason why they struggle to compete. By contrast, gas-fired units are faster and cheaper to build, cause less pollution, and can start up and ramp down quickly, so they are more flexible and better suited to following daily changes in power consumption. Technology and economics rather than government regulations are driving the shift away from coal and towards gas-fired generation. Coal-fired power plants have been losing market share for 30 years, with their share of total generation falling from a peak of 57 percent in 1988 to just 30 percent in 2017. The principal competitor has been gas, which has seen its share of generation rise from 10 percent in 1988 to 32 percent in 2017 (“Monthly Energy Review”, EIA, September 2018). Until 2007, overall growth in electricity consumption enabled coal-fired and gas-fired generation to increase in absolute terms, even as coal went into relative decline. Since then, however, power demand has flattened, while gas-fired generation has continued to grow, ensuring that coal-fired electricity generation has been steadily declining in absolute as well as relative terms. The shale revolution has entrenched the shift from coal to gas by making gas supplies plentiful and keeping prices low and relatively stable. Coal’s major advantage over gas was, traditionally, its lower price and volatility, but the fall in gas prices and increasing efficiency of gas-fired power plants has removed even this benefit. Low gas prices now hit the number of hours that coal-fired units run and ultimately the number of coal units that remain in service as they become increasingly old. As the remaining capacity of coal-fired power plants falls, coal consumption will continue to trend lower in the medium term. Unless the federal government steps in to ensure coal-fired power plants run, even when they are more expensive than natural gas, the downtrend in coal consumption will continue.

2018-09-27,"(Repeats Sept. 26 item. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Jamie McGeever LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s interest rate hikes of 2008 and 2011 were perhaps the biggest policy errors in recent central banking history. With $100 oil coming into view again, the last thing the ECB wants is a repeat. Twice bitten, thrice shy. The price of Brent crude oil this week hit $82.55 a barrel, the highest in almost four years. It’s up 40 percent over the past year, an inflationary red flag the ECB would normally find difficult to ignore. Also this week, ECB President Mario Draghi told the European Parliament that an acceleration in underlying inflation in the euro zone was “relatively vigorous” and expressed confidence that a pick-up in wage growth would continue. Add all that together, you might think the ECB would quite readily backtrack on its pledge to keep interest rates at historically rock-bottom levels “through the summer” of next year, and deliver an inflation-cooling rate hike or two earlier. Not this time. If anything, an oil price shock of crude breaking above $100 a barrel could tempt the current incumbents in Frankfurt’s Eurotower to ease policy, or at the very least go looser for longer, rather than tighten. Firstly, the current spike in oil is more a function of supply constraints than surging demand. U.S. sanctions on OPEC members Venezuela and Iran have hit production there, while spare capacity from OPEC and its allies remains historically low, according to Nomura. The world economy, led by the United States, is growing at a robust and steady clip. But the balance of risks to growth, from trade wars to rising U.S. interest rates, is tilted to the downside. Slowing economic growth will cap oil demand. Secondly, oil prices notoriously overshoot, accelerating in the run-up to cyclical peaks and troughs. This means they rise far higher, and fall much further, than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier. Thirdly, signs of oil remaining high, say above $100 for an extended period, could squeeze corporate profits and potentially force companies to lay off workers. Rising unemployment, in what is already a fractious and dangerous political environment, would surely be viewed with alarm in Frankfurt. In short, there’s a case to be made that this would be “bad” inflation, not “good” inflation. Certainly not the time for a re-run of 2008 or 2011. The ECB raised rates in July 2008 as oil hit a record high $147/barrel, having doubled over the previous year. This was right in the midst of the global credit crunch: Bear Stearns had been rescued only a few months before, and Lehman Brothers would collapse a few weeks later. In 2011 oil was again above $100 and the ECB raised rates not once but twice, just as the euro zone debt crisis was bubbling up: Greece and Ireland had already received bailout packages, and bond yields in Spain and Italy were ballooning to levels that would eventually prompt Draghi’s “whatever it takes” intervention a year later. Policymakers will be more cautious this time around, not least because inflation, although at target, is lower than it was then. Headline inflation is running at 2 percent, whereas it nudged 4 percent in 2008 and 3 percent in 2011. The ECB expects its 2.6 trillion euro ($3.1 trillion) bond purchase scheme to end at the close of this year and keep rates low “through” the summer of next. The guidance on rates is vague enough to give the ECB a lot of leeway. It could raise rates in September next year, or December, or not at all, and still justifiably have kept its pledge.

2018-09-27,"(Adds comments from Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels) Sept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. nuclear power generators urged the federal government against taking action in a dispute over imported uranium, arguing tariffs or quotas would increase costs for the struggling industry and possibly cause some reactors to shut, according to a statement emailed on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) launched a “Section 232” investigation into uranium imports in July following complaints by two U.S. uranium mining companies, Ur-Energy Inc and Energy Fuels Inc, that subsidized foreign competitors have caused them to cut capacity and lay off workers. The move is a double-edged sword for President Donald Trump. While it helps domestic uranium producers by targeting importers, it undercuts the administration’s efforts to give a boost to U.S. nuclear power operators, who would see their fuel costs increase. “Imposing additional regulatory burdens on the already struggling nuclear energy industry will put 100,000 good paying domestic jobs and careers at risk and is inconsistent with President Trump’s and the Department of Energy’s policy pronouncements,” David Tamasi, spokesperson for nuclear group, called the Ad Hoc Utilities Group (AHUG), said in a statement. The White House has been trying to find a way to prevent additional coal and nuclear plants from shutting, which the administration sees as vital for national energy security, as they struggle to compete with cheaper alternatives like natural gas and renewable generation. Uranium is used in the U.S. nuclear arsenal and powers the Navy’s nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines, along with 98 U.S. commercial nuclear reactors that produce 20 percent of the electricity consumed in the country. The nuclear industry said a diverse uranium supply is essential to keep that power flowing. In 2017, about 58 percent of the U.S. uranium supply came from the United States, Canada and Australia, with the rest coming from Russia (16 percent), Kazakhstan (11 percent), Uzbekistan (5 percent), Namibia (5 percent), South Africa (2 percent) and Niger (2 percent), according to the nuclear power group. “If the U.S. uranium mining industry does not survive, we will essentially hand over to unfriendly countries control of our nuclear sector,” Jeffrey Klenda, president and CEO at Ur-Energy, and Mark Chalmers, president and CEO at Energy Fuels, said in a joint statement. “The DOC investigation represents a significant step toward protecting our national and energy security,” the two company executives said in the statement. The investigation, which the Commerce Department said on Wednesday is still ongoing, is one of several launched by the Trump administration under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, previously a seldom-invoked Cold War-era law. Probes on steel and aluminum imports have led to tariffs and quotas on the metals, prompting retaliation from trading partners including Canada, Mexico and the European Union.

2018-09-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - British car production fell by an annual 12.9 percent in August, the third consecutive drop in a row, due to model changeovers and preparations for new, tougher emissions rules, a car industry body said on Thursday. Output stood at 89,254 units last month, driven down by a nearly 40 percent drop in production for domestic buyers compared with a 4 percent fall in exports, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.  “The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns,” said Chief Executive Mike Hawes.   “This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on September 1.”  The tougher new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) became mandatory from the start of September, forcing certain carmakers to halt deliveries and change plans regarding some models that had yet to have re-certified for emissions. The car industry is also concerned that any loss of free and unfettered trade after Britain’s exit from the European Union next year could hit sales and output, especially if politicians fail to strike an agreement.  “With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade; for our sector, ‘no deal’ is not an option,” said Hawes.

2018-09-27,"* Danske’s trading model can be replicated in Asia * Oil supply tight, Equinor bullish on demand in 2019 * Moves more condensate to Asia to replace Iran oil By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor ASA could look into trading in power markets in Asia after it completes the acquisition of a Danish power trading company, a senior company official said. Danske Commodities, one of Denmark’s largest commodity traders, agreed in July to a takeover by Norwegian oil firm Equinor pending regulatory approval. Danske has “a trading model that can be exported to any market where there is space or room for power trading,” Tor Martin Anfinnsen, Equinor’s senior vice president for marketing and trading told Reuters this week. There is a “high probability that their competence will also be applied by us in some of the Asian markets,” he said. “They have just established themselves in Australia but there’s no reason it will not go beyond Australia,” Anfinnsen added, but declined to specify which markets the company has in mind. Danske Commodities operates in 38 countries but it has recently reduced its trading position on Nasdaq’s Nordic power exchange after one trader’s default left a 114 million euro ($134 million) hole in Nasdaq’s clearing house buffers. The Danske acquisition comes as Equinor is ramping up investments in renewable energy, especially offshore wind projects. The company plans to spend 15 percent to 20 percent of its capital expenditures on renewables, diversifying its oil and gas portfolio. Equinor will open a new office in Tokyo later this week and its first office in India by early next year, as it expands its presence in Asia. “We are changing as a company. Nevertheless, for the foreseeable future, oil and gas will still dominate our agenda,” Anfinnsen said. Equinor sees a risk to upside for oil prices as supply from Iran, Venezuela, Nigeria and Libya has tightened and the company is quite bullish about economic growth next year despite headwinds from emerging economies and the China-U.S. trade war, its executives said. “Not many companies are expected to be given waivers, if any, around U.S. sanctions on Iran. There is certainly a bullish upward momentum,” said Simon James, the company’s vice president crude and refining. Equinor has exported three of its four condensate grades in recent months to Asia as buyers of Iranian condensate sought replacements, James said. These include Snohvit and Ormen Lange from the North Sea, Algerian condensate and U.S. Eagle Ford. “We wish we have access to more. It looks tight right now,” James said.

2018-09-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s energy regulator has four cases open against UK energy suppliers over their poor handling of customer complaints, following a survey, it said on Thursday.  Energy market regulator Ofgem said it has opened compliance cases into First Utility, Ovo Energy and Utilita and is expanding a recent case on Iberdrola SA’s (IBE.MC) ScottishPower.     The regulator also said it was requiring all other domestic suppliers surveyed - Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, Innogy SE’s (IGY.DE) Npower, Utility Warehouse, SSE (SSE.L), EDF’s (EDF.PA) EDF Energy, E.ON EONGnDE and Co-operative Energy - to provide improvement plans on how they will deal with complaints and provide appropriate updates. The survey of around 3,100 complainants - carried out every two years - found that satisfaction has improved since the last survey in 2016, with a third (32 percent) of domestic customers satisfied with how their complaint was dealt with, an increase of five percentage points from 2016, Ofgem said. However, it also found that the proportion of customers who are dissatisfied (57 percent) remains higher than those satisfied with how their complaint had been dealt with. The main reasons for dissatisfaction were the length of time taken to resolve an issue, not being kept up to date with the progress of the complaint and suppliers not providing complainants with a clear idea of how long a resolution would take. “Although the level of satisfaction about complaint handling has increased over the past two years, it is still unacceptably low,” Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, said in a statement. “We will be monitoring the level of all suppliers’ customer service performance particularly closely after announcing proposals to introduce a price cap to protect those on poor value default deals from being overcharged,” he added.

2018-09-27,"* Asian shares weaker but outperform Wall Street * Kospi hits 3-month highs * Fed sees 5 more rate hikes by 2020, above neutral levels * Dollar mixed, emerging market currencies gain * European shares seen falling 0.1-0.3 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Global shares struggled in volatile trade on Thursday with Asian markets giving up earlier gains after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and affirmed plans for more policy tightening through to 2020. European shares are expected to open slightly weaker, with financial spread-betters seeing Germany’s DAX falling 0.3 percent and Britain’s FTSE and France’s CAC 0.1 percent. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1 percent, reversing from an 0.3 percent gain earlier in the session. There were, however, pockets of resilience such as South Korea’s Kospi, which hit three-month highs, as it resumed trade after a three-day public holiday. Japan’s Nikkei briefly touched an eight-month high as automakers rose after the United States indicated it would not impose further tariffs on Japanese automotive products for now, though it ended down 1.0 percent. Asia generally fared better than Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 percent and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 percent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.21 percent. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 3.043 percent, from Tuesday’s four-month high of 3.113 percent as market participants braced for a more hawkish stance. The fall in Treasury yields was good news for Asia and other emerging markets, which had been pressured by concerns that higher U.S. yields would encourage investors to move funds out of emerging markets to the United States, on top of worries over the Sino-U.S. trade feud. The Fed bumped up its policy target by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.00-2.25 percent and indicated that it foresees another rate rise in December, three more next year, and one in 2020. While that forecast was little changed from June, the Fed’s projected hikes will put the benchmark overnight lending rate at 3.4 percent by 2020, roughly half a percentage point above the Fed’s estimated “neutral” rate of interest. “The Fed seems to have grown more convinced of the need to keep raising rates beyond neutral levels. I cannot see reasons to slow down raising rates as long as the jobless rate keeps falling,” said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income strategist at Nomura Securities. The Fed also dropped a reference in its statement to the word “accommodative”, although Chairman Jerome Powell later said policy was still accommodative. He also said the Fed didn’t have any precise understanding of when policy would be neutral, suggesting Powell himself may not be attaching major importance to the Fed’s median estimate of the neutral rate of 2.9 percent. Yet Some investors see limited need for the Fed to keep raising rates as inflation shows no signs of picking up, despite continued economic growth and the jobless rate near a two-decade low. “Three hikes next year is absurd,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa. “With an additional rate hike likely in 2018 and one in March next year, we will reach what many Fed governors feel is a neutral rate level. With the low odds of a spike in inflation, it makes sense that the Fed would pause after the March rate hike and allow the markets to adjust to its new policy,” he said. Adding more uncertainty to the economic outlook were trade disputes between the Trump administration and several trading partners. U.S. tariffs and retaliatory levies by others could slow the global economic growth, but broad-based tariffs could also stoke inflation by raising the prices of imported goods. A boost to the U.S. economy from Trump’s tax cuts looks set to wane next year, raising more doubts on the view that the U.S. economy could retain strength beyond next year. Indeed, the European Central Bank said on Wednesday the United States would have the most to lose if it started a trade war with other countries, while China would be better off after retaliating. The stock markets have been also paring earlier expectations that the U.S. will win its trade wars, with shares outside the United States starting to outperform since the middle of this month. In the currency market, the dollar gained a tad after the Fed’s decision. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 94.529, extending its recovery from Friday’s 2-1/2-month low of 93.808. The euro traded at $1.1704, down 0.3 percent and off a three-month high of $1.18155 touched on Monday. The yen hit a 10-week low of 113.145 to the dollar in a choppy trade after the Fed’s policy announcement but it bounced back to 112.64. Emerging market currencies were firmer, with MSCI’s emerging market currency index rising 0.2 percent on Wednesday and another 0.2 percent in Asia on Thursday. These gains have sent up the index by 0.25 percent, raising hopes it could post its first monthly rise in six months. Oil prices gained on an impending fall in Iranian exports due to U.S. sanctions, which are set to be implemented in November. Global benchmark Brent rose 1.1 percent to $82.22 per barrel, near the four-year high of $82.55 set on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.3 percent to $72.47 a barrel.

2018-09-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - EDF Energy (EDF.PA) said it was making progress on the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Britain, which has faced cost overruns and previous delays. France’s EDF Energy said in a statement on Thursday that the project was on track to meet its next major milestone in 2019, namely the completion of the 4,500 tonne concrete platform on which the reactor buildings sit. It said the Hinkley project was on track to come online by the end of 2025. The plant, being built by the British arm of EDF along with China General Nuclear Power Corp, has been beset by delays and higher cost estimates. Last year, EDF raised the cost estimate for Hinkley to 19.6 billion pounds. Hinkley Point C had been thrown into doubt in 2016 when newly installed British Prime Minister Theresa May delayed a decision on whether to approve it, amid criticism over its pricing policy. The government eventually approved the project. Hinkley Point C will be the first nuclear plant built in Britain in decades. It is expected to provide 7 percent of Britain’s power needs while helping to replace the country’s ageing nuclear fleet and closing coal plants. “The project is making good progress and is on track to meet its next major milestone, creating more than 25,000 job opportunities. Nuclear has an important role to play in the UK’s energy future,” said British nuclear energy minister Richard Harrington in a statement.

2018-09-27,"(Repeats Wednesday story with no changes to text) * Move comes after Norwegian trader defaulted * Eidsiva Energi, EWII discuss leaving clearing house * Graphic: reut.rs/2xBrdRp By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Danske Commodities, one of Denmark’s largest commodity traders, has reduced its trading position on Nasdaq’s Nordic power exchange after one trader’s default left a 114 million euro ($134 million) hole in Nasdaq’s clearing house buffers. Separately, Norway’s Eidsiva Energi and Denmark’s EWII said they were talking internally about leaving Nasdaq’s Nordic clearing house operation. Danske Commodities, which agreed in July to a takeover by Norwegian oil firm Equinor pending regulatory approval, said Norwegian trader Einar Aas’ default on Sept. 10 had hit market liquidity. Aas, a veteran derivatives trader, made large bets on the power market. His default triggered a demand to replenish buffers and post increased cash guarantees that all market participants must have to trade on the exchange. In addition, traded electricity volumes have fallen by two-thirds since a 2002 peak, making the market less liquid and thus less attractive and riskier for traders. (Graphic: reut.rs/2xBrdRp) “We have sized our position down by 30 to 40 percent,” Tor Mosegaard, Danske Commodities head of power markets, told Reuters without giving a value for its total position. “Depending on how liquidity on the market evolves, we may downsize it further.” “The biggest liquidity provider (Aas) defaulted and that created a lot of illiquid products,” he added. “We can’t leave a big position in the market ... We need to close it, we need to size down our mandate on Nasdaq.” Danske Commodities trades on Nasdaq’s Nordic commodities exchange to hedge against German power prices, which it trades on Nasdaq’s rival exchange, EEX. “We use EEX in all our German products. If liquidity picks up in its Nordic products we will follow and quit Nasdaq. We will not be the first movers but we will follow,” said Mosegaard. Nasdaq declined to comment on Danske Commodities’ decision. Reuters contacted more than twenty companies, a majority of which said they expected liquidity to decrease further as a result of Aas’ default and the higher collateral they are now asked to pay. “I know that liquidity is gone... It increases the risk in swings (in the market), if you want to get out of the market, you can’t,” said the head of trading at a Nordic trading firm, who declined to be named. Eidsiva Energi, Norway’s fifth-largest power firm by number of customers, and Denmark’s EWII, which posted revenues of 200 million euros last year, said they would soon decide whether to stop clearing power trades via Nasdaq. They will continue to use Nasdaq to trade Nordic power contracts, but could use banks instead of Nasdaq’s clearing house for that function. The clearing house, which is run by Nasdaq to ensure that electricity contracts traded on the company’s Nordic commodities exchange are completed on time, forced members to replenish funds lost when Aas ran out of cash on Sept. 10. “We are discussing leaving Nasdaq Clearing and clearing through banks ... because of the collateral cost,” Staale Stoerdal, a corporate adviser at Eidsiva Energi told Reuters. Oliver Wolgast, EWII’s senior director for renewables, trading and consulting, said the company would decide within a few weeks whether to leave Nasdaq’s clearing house. “Quitting as a direct clearing member and going to clear through banks is on the table after what happened,” he said. Nasdaq said it continued to have an open dialogue with the 166 members of its Nordic clearing house. “Nasdaq has been supporting a General Clearing Model for our Commodities Market for many years, and we support any member’s decisions to change their clearing model,” said a Nasdaq spokesman. Rival trading platform EEX is the dominant exchange in European power markets and stands to benefit. Other exchanges include CME and ICE. “After what happened with Aas, a number of members of Nasdaq asked for information to join, or increase their position with, EEX,” EEX’s Nordics chief, Heine Roenningen said. Six traders told Reuters they were considering joining, or trading more, on EEX. Five declined to be named as the topic is sensitive. Three of the six traders already had an account with EEX and could increase trading there, while the other three said they may join EEX and move most, if not all of their activity, there. To reduce risk and restore trust after Aas’ default, Nasdaq raised initial margin levels and said it was considering lowering the maximum allowed positions in the Nordics. The estimated margin level on a Nordic 2019 power year contract was around 8.9 percent and is 10.1 percent now. For German power, the margin levels were 7.9 percent before and 9.9 percent after, Nasdaq said. Trading firms who already clear through banks said they expected banks to raise their fees as a result of the firms’ default-related losses and the higher collateral they are now asked to post. SEB and ABN AMRO, which clear trades with Nasdaq told Reuters they were considering the possibility of raising their fees, among other options. “We will have a discussion with the members clearing through us and Nasdaq. One possible outcome after assessing the risk could be raising the cost of clearing fees,” said SEB spokesman Frank Hojem.

2018-09-27,"BEIJING, Sept 27 (Reuters) - China has ditched blanket production cuts on heavy industry in its finalised winter anti-pollution plan, allowing local authorities to adopt measures based on regional emission levels. The plan, issued by the Ministry of Environment and Ecology (MEE) on Thursday, is the latest sign of Beijing fine-tuning its policy in a years-long fight against smog. Earlier this month Reuters reported that China was considering such a move for its northern provinces. Before the revision, in an earlier draft of its winter anti-pollution campaign, the MEE had still been planning blanket production cuts of 30-50 percent on heavy industry in 28 northern cities. “Local authorities should carry out production cuts based on their individual situation and refrain from adopting blanket cuts,” the MEE said, however, in the finalised plan. Local governments can also shorten or extend the timeframe of production restrictions based on their monthly air quality, the ministry said. Production cuts for last winter started from mid-November 2017 and lasted until mid-March of this year. Heavy industry, including steelmaking, cement factories, coke plants, metal casting and chemical production, will be the main targets of any restrictions, but output cuts for individual companies will be based on their emissions record. Steel mills with blast furnaces, coke plants, and primary aluminium and alumina producers able to meet ultra-low emission standards will be exempt from winter output cuts. Steelmakers that use electric-arc furnaces and mini-mills that only use scrap steel as raw material will also be pardoned from output limits. Provincial authorities will be given until end-October to submit their own production cutting plans to the central government. No changes will be allowed afterwards, the MEE said. The ministry also said it will continue its clean-heating project by replacing coal-fired systems with gas or electrical systems in an additional 3.62 million households in 28 northern Chinese cities. Last year, China converted the heating systems in 3.94 million households in the same cities. The MEE aims over the coming winter to reduce average PM2.5 concentration by around 3 percent from levels recorded in the same period last year. The reduction target has been revised lowered from 5 percent in the earlier draft.

This is the sixth-largest domestic merger-and-acquisition deal, and the fourth biggest in the local energy sector, over the past three years, data from Thomson Reuters showed. The deal will provide fresh funds to Ayala’s unit, AC Energy, to help expand its domestic and offshore renewable energy businesses, and is in line with its target of achieving a 50-50 capacity mix between coal and renewables from the current 80-20 mix. Aboitiz will acquire a 49 percent voting stake and 60 percent economic interest in AA Thermal, AC Energy’s newly formed thermal platform in the Philippines. AA Thermal’s assets will initially comprise AC Energy’s limited partnership interests in GNPower Mariveles Coal Plant Ltd Co, which owns and operates a 632-megawatt facility in Bataan province, north of Manila, and in GNPower Dinginin Ltd Co, which is constructing a 1,336-MW plant also in Bataan. Aboitiz, which is already one of Ayala’s existing partners in both GNPower Mariveles and GNPower Dinginin Ltd, said the acquisition will increase its beneficial ownership in Mariveles project to 78.325 percent, and to about 70 percent in the Dinginin project. The first of the two 668-MW Dinginin units is scheduled to go online in 2019. Ayala, one of the Philippines’ biggest conglomerates, and Aboitiz said the base price of $579 million is subject to adjustment at transaction closing, the timetable for which was not specified in the stock market disclosures. The Philippine Stock Exchange suspended trading in Aboitiz Power shares on Thursday pending the company’s compliance with disclosure requirements. Ayala Corp was down 0.8 percent by midday. AC Energy expects to expand its overall capacity to more than 5,000 MW by 2025 from 1,600 MW, as it looks for more potential acquisitions in renewables in Southeast Asia, company officials had told Reuters in an interview in May. Aboitiz, in a statement, said the acquisition is part of its strategy to reach its goal of 4,000 MW net attributable capacity by 2020, from around 3,300 MW currently.

2018-09-27,"* CNPC says to keep drilling through winter at some fields * Harsh winter conditions can make drilling tougher, more pricey * China wants to boost energy security amid trade spat with U.S. BEIJING, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Energy giant China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) will keep drilling through the winter at oilfields in the west of the country to boost domestic crude output, answering calls from Beijing to bolster the nation’s energy independence. Some of CNPC’s oilfields in western Chinese regions such as Qinghai, Xinjiang and Shaanxi will not take their usual four-month winter break this year, CNPC’s official newspaper said on Thursday, citing a document from the firm’s oil engineering and services unit. Fields in western China typically take such breaks due to harsh winter conditions that make drilling more difficult and expensive. More easterly fields tend to operate year-round. “CNPC will need to take more forceful measure to boost domestic production as China stresses the importance of energy security,” the newspaper said. CNPC is the nation’s largest crude oil producer. China has been pushing to curb its appetite for overseas energy supplies amid a tit-for-tat trade war with the United States. A CNPC official told Reuters that the cost of oil engineering services had fallen to the lowest level in five years, helping make winter production economic. China’s crude oil output climbed in August, ramped up after President Xi Jinping called for a boost to national energy security. Prior to that, output had seen nearly three years of decline. CNPC’s engineering unit, China Petroleum Engineering Corp , will carry out an additional 2 million metres of drilling from November to February, CNPC said via the newspaper.

2018-09-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is close to working with Saudi Arabia on building nuclear power reactors, but talks on tough non-proliferation standards with the kingdom remain a challenge, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Wednesday. Perry has held talks with several Saudi leaders this year, including King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, on the kingdom’s ambition of initially building two nuclear power stations. Saudi Arabia wants to ultimately construct 16 reactors in coming decades at a cost of about $80 billion (61 billion pounds). Discussions had been held up on Saudi Arabia’s desire to relax nonproliferation standards and potentially allow the country to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium, technologies that non-proliferation advocates worry could one day be covertly altered to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. Perry said progress on non-proliferation standards had been made, but that talks were not going as quickly as either side would have hoped. Perry has shared with Saudi leaders that being “perceived as very, very strong on non-proliferation was a most important message, globally,” he told reporters at the Energy Department headquarters. Perry said part of the talks centre on making sure any nuclear inspections would not be intrusive for sensitive areas in the kingdom.  In July, South Korea said its state-run utility KEPCO along with the United States, France, China and Russia had been shortlisted to bid for a nuclear power project in Saudi Arabia and that the winner would likely be selected in 2019. Washington hopes Saudi Arabia will buy nuclear power technology from U.S. companies, including Westinghouse, which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and abandoned plans to build two advanced AP1000 reactors in the United States. If Saudi Arabia signs a deal that relaxes the safeguards, the United Arab Emirates could be free to break a deal it signed with Washington years ago and enrich uranium. The UAE deal contained the “gold standard” in such 123 nuclear agreements, because it contained safeguards against enriching and preprocessing. Westinghouse said it would defer to the customer, Saudi Arabia, for comment. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2018-09-27,"(Adds Pemex CEO comments, background, tweaks headline) By David Alire Garcia and Marianna Parraga ACAPULCO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Mexican state-run oil company Pemex expects to begin importing up to 100,000 barrels per day of light crude oil, likely from the United States, from late October and at least until the end of November, its chief executive said on Wednesday. “A hundred thousand barrels (per day) more or less is what we’re going to import to process and incorporate into our refineries, mostly at Salina Cruz,” Pemex CEO Carlos Trevino said in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the Mexican Petroleum Congress in Acapulco. The imports, planned to run through at least the end of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s tenure in office on Nov. 30, mark a stark shift for historically major crude exporter Mexico, where decades of oil self-sufficiency are a badge of pride. Years of under investment and declining crude output have severely hampered Mexico’s refineries and helped necessitate the move. Salina Cruz, like Pemex’s other five refineries, has recently been producing far below capacity due to accidents and operational problems, as well as Pemex’s focus on maximizing the value of its oil even if that means refining less domestically. “We’re going to mix it with Mexican crude, with some of our mix to be able to process at the levels we want to get back to in refining. We should be around 800,000 barrels (per day of refining in the country’s entire system) by the end of the year,” he added. Mexico’s refining network can process up to 1.6 million bpd of crude. It has been working this year at around 40 percent. Trevino said he expects auctions of oil exploration and production blocks scheduled for February, which include the selection of key partners for Pemex, will take place as planned. “I think there is total certainty” that Mexico’s oil regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), will carry out the auctions. Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that oil auctions are suspended until contracts already awarded over the past few years have been reviewed, but he has not specifically weighed in on the February tenders. Pemex, whose oil production and refining volumes have continued declining this year amid the depletion of some of its main oilfields, will not meet its crude output target of 1.95 million barrels per day in 2018. “We’re going to be considerably below that,” Trevino told reporters at the conference later in the evening, declining to provide a specific volume. He expects another year of production decline in 2019, even though Pemex had originally planned to stabilize output by then. Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, handily won Mexico’s presidential election in part by promising sweeping changes to Mexico’s energy industry. His energy team has signaled they want Pemex to select its own partners instead of having them chosen in auctions run by the CNH. Trevino said the new process would be “easier,” underscoring that the current selection process “costs us time.” (Writing by Anthony Esposito; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Richard Pullin)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-pemex-oil/update-2-pemex-plans-up-to-100000-bpd-light-crude-imports-says-ceo-idUKL2N1WD00R,27 Sep 2018,"Mexican state-run oil company

2018-09-27,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Union officials representing 30,000 workers at U.S. oil refineries and chemical plants on Wednesday said they will pursue sizable wage increases and a 3-year contract in coming negotiations.      Contract talks, which begin in January, come as U.S. refiners are enjoying strong profits, near-full utilization rates and record product exports. In the June quarter, the margin on turning crude to gasoline, diesel and other products was the highest since 2015. The United Steelworkers union (USW) wants a wage increase comparable to the 6 percent per year increase it originally sought during 2015 talks, Kim Nibarger, chairman of the USW’s national oil bargaining program, said in an interview following a three-day union meeting in San Diego.  In 2015, USW members went on a six-week strike at 12 U.S. refineries and three chemical plants. In the end, they accepted a four-year contract that provided members between 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent annual increases each year and changes to working conditions.  Nibarger declined to provide specifics of the proposals that union officials will bring to their members in coming weeks. Local union members will have 45 days to vote on the proposals reached on Wednesday. If 75 percent of locals agree, the wage increase will be presented to companies in January. “They are in the range of the proposals made in 2015,” he said. “I think it is an aggressive proposal, but not unreasonable given the dedication of members to keep their facilities operating at top notch.” Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) was once again named lead negotiator on behalf of companies that own U.S. refineries, including Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) BP Plc (BP.L), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N) and Delek US Holdings Inc (DK.N). Shell declined immediate comment on Wednesday. “Our goal is a mutually beneficial agreement for our members and the companies they work for,” said Nibarger.  The USW also wants improvements in a standard meant to reduce fatigue among its workers. It sought a similar change in 2015, he said.  In 2015, the national strike lasted six weeks and some local strikes continued for months with workers at the Marathon Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas not returning to work until July. The current USW contract runs out on Feb. 1.

2018-09-27,"* Wall Street, Nikkei down a tad after Fed policy review * Fed sees 5 more rate hikes by 2020, above neutral levels By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Global equities ran out of steam and U.S. bond yields fell after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected, sticking  to its script of gradual policy tightening with forecasts of five more rate hikes by 2020. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.05 percent in early trade while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.45 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 percent and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 percent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.21 percent. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell more than 5 basis points to 3.048 percent. The Fed bumped up its policy target by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.00-2.25 percent and indicated that it foresees another rate rise in December, three more next year, and one in 2020. While that was little changed from its previous projections in June, it would put the benchmark overnight lending rate at 3.4 percent, roughly half a percentage point above the Fed’s estimated “neutral” rate of interest, by 2020. “The Fed seems to have grown more convinced of the need to keep raising rates beyond the neutral levels. I cannot see reasons to slow down raising rates as long as the jobless rate keeps falling,” said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income strategist at Nomura Securities. But some investors see a limited need for the Fed to keep raising rates as inflation has shown no sign of picking up so far, despite continued economic growth and a tight labour market. The U.S. unemployment rate stood near its lowest level since 2001. “Three hikes next year is absurd,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa. “With an additional rate hike likely in 2018 and one in March next year, we will reach what many Fed governors feel is a neutral rate level. With the low odds of a spike in inflation, it makes sense that the Fed would pause after the March rate hike and allow the markets to adjust to its new policy,” he said. Some investors also say trade disputes between the Trump administration and several trading partners are adding more uncertainty to the economic outlook. U.S. tariffs and retaliatory levies by others could slow the global economic growth, but broad-based tariffs could also stoke inflation by raising the prices of imported goods. In the currency market, the dollar was mixed after the Fed’s decision. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 94.266, having gained 0.13 percent on Wednesday. It hovered above Friday’s 2 1/2-month low of 93.808. The euro traded at $1.1749, off three-month high of $1.18155 touched on Monday. The yen hit a 10-week low of 113.145 to the dollar in a choppy trade after the Fed’s policy announcement but it bounced back to 112.75. Emerging market currencies, which had been pressured by concerns higher U.S. yields will encourage investors to move funds out of emerging markets to the United States, were firmer. MSCI emerging market currency index rose 0.2 percent on Wednesday. The gains means its performance so far this month is up 0.25 percent, raising hopes it could post its first monthly rise in six months. Oil prices gained on an impending fall in Iranian exports. Global benchmark Brent rose 0.9 percent to $82.10 per barrel, near the four-year high of $82.55 set on Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.2 percent to $72.45 a barrel.

Brent crude futures were at $82.04 per barrel at 0104 GMT, up by 70 cents, or 0.9 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $72.35 a barrel, up 78 cents, or 1.1 percent from their last settlement. Traders said oil markets were tightening ahead of Washington’s planned sanctions on Iran’s petroleum industry from Nov. 4. At its 2018 peak, Iran exported around 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, equivalent to 3 percent of global consumption, and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has little spare capacity to make up for an expected shortfall in Iranian exports. Reflecting expectations of lower supply from the Middle East, Oman crude futures on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange touched their highest in four years on Wednesday, briefly jumping above $90 a barrel. “Oil prices remain in the Bulls domain amid concern that U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude oil exports will result in much tighter physical market conditions once they take effect in November,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “Markets could still be underestimating the supply crunch from Iran sanctions,” he added. While global oil markets tighten, supply in the United States is ample, thanks to rising output. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA hit a record 11.1 million bpd in the week ending Sept. 21, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). That’s an increase of almost a third since mid-2016. Commercial crude stocks C-STK-T-EIA rose by 1.85 million barrels, to 395.99 million barrels, the EIA data showed.

2018-09-27,"(Repeats Sept. 26 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ObCbGz By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Despite political support from the White House, U.S. coal consumption continues to fall, as power producers shutter coal-fired units in favour of cheaper and more flexible natural gas as well as solar and wind. Electric power producers’ coal consumption fell to 298 million short tons in the first half of 2018, down from 312 million in the same period in 2017, marginally below 2016, and the lowest since 1983 (tmsnrt.rs/2ObCbGz). U.S. power producers generated almost 6 percent less electricity from coal in the first half of the year even as total generation rose almost 5 percent and gas-fired generation was up 17 percent. Coal-fired generation declined by 32 billion kilowatt hours in the first six months, while gas-fired generation rose by 89 billion, nuclear was up by 16 billion, solar rose 7 billion and wind was up by 15 billion. Generators continued to close coal units, with coal-fired generating capacity down to 246 gigawatts at the end of June 2018, compared with 262 gigawatts in June 2017 and 273 gigawatts in June 2016. Remaining coal units are being run for fewer hours and/or at lower rates than last year, another indication they are struggling to compete with cheap natural gas. Capacity utilisation at the remaining coal-fired units was at or below prior-year levels in six of the first seven months in 2018 (“Electric Power Monthly”, Energy Information Administration, September 2018). Another 9 gigawatts of coal-fired generation capacity are scheduled to close before the end of 2020, so coal consumption is unlikely to rise and will probably continue to decline in the next few years. Most coal-fired power plants still in operation were commissioned in the 1970s and 1980s, when surging oil prices caused a shift from oil-fired to coal-fired generation. Most are now 35-50 years old and as a result of corrosion and fatigue require expensive replacements of steam generators and other large pieces of equipment. Ageing power plants also suffer from rising operation and maintenance costs, increased outages, reduced reliability and reduced thermal efficiency. Retrofitting them to comply with tougher pollution controls adds to the financial burden of keeping them in service though in many cases is not the major reason why they struggle to compete. By contrast, gas-fired units are faster and cheaper to build, cause less pollution, and can start up and ramp down quickly, so they are more flexible and better suited to following daily changes in power consumption. Technology and economics rather than government regulations are driving the shift away from coal and towards gas-fired generation. Coal-fired power plants have been losing market share for 30 years, with their share of total generation falling from a peak of 57 percent in 1988 to just 30 percent in 2017. The principal competitor has been gas, which has seen its share of generation rise from 10 percent in 1988 to 32 percent in 2017 (“Monthly Energy Review”, EIA, September 2018). Until 2007, overall growth in electricity consumption enabled coal-fired and gas-fired generation to increase in absolute terms, even as coal went into relative decline. Since then, however, power demand has flattened, while gas-fired generation has continued to grow, ensuring that coal-fired electricity generation has been steadily declining in absolute as well as relative terms. The shale revolution has entrenched the shift from coal to gas by making gas supplies plentiful and keeping prices low and relatively stable. Coal’s major advantage over gas was, traditionally, its lower price and volatility, but the fall in gas prices and increasing efficiency of gas-fired power plants has removed even this benefit. Low gas prices now hit the number of hours that coal-fired units run and ultimately the number of coal units that remain in service as they become increasingly old. As the remaining capacity of coal-fired power plants falls, coal consumption will continue to trend lower in the medium term. Unless the federal government steps in to ensure coal-fired power plants run, even when they are more expensive than natural gas, the downtrend in coal consumption will continue.

2018-09-27,"(Repeats Sept. 26 item. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Jamie McGeever LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s interest rate hikes of 2008 and 2011 were perhaps the biggest policy errors in recent central banking history. With $100 oil coming into view again, the last thing the ECB wants is a repeat. Twice bitten, thrice shy. The price of Brent crude oil this week hit $82.55 a barrel, the highest in almost four years. It’s up 40 percent over the past year, an inflationary red flag the ECB would normally find difficult to ignore. Also this week, ECB President Mario Draghi told the European Parliament that an acceleration in underlying inflation in the euro zone was “relatively vigorous” and expressed confidence that a pick-up in wage growth would continue. Add all that together, you might think the ECB would quite readily backtrack on its pledge to keep interest rates at historically rock-bottom levels “through the summer” of next year, and deliver an inflation-cooling rate hike or two earlier. Not this time. If anything, an oil price shock of crude breaking above $100 a barrel could tempt the current incumbents in Frankfurt’s Eurotower to ease policy, or at the very least go looser for longer, rather than tighten. Firstly, the current spike in oil is more a function of supply constraints than surging demand. U.S. sanctions on OPEC members Venezuela and Iran have hit production there, while spare capacity from OPEC and its allies remains historically low, according to Nomura. The world economy, led by the United States, is growing at a robust and steady clip. But the balance of risks to growth, from trade wars to rising U.S. interest rates, is tilted to the downside. Slowing economic growth will cap oil demand. Secondly, oil prices notoriously overshoot, accelerating in the run-up to cyclical peaks and troughs. This means they rise far higher, and fall much further, than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier. Thirdly, signs of oil remaining high, say above $100 for an extended period, could squeeze corporate profits and potentially force companies to lay off workers. Rising unemployment, in what is already a fractious and dangerous political environment, would surely be viewed with alarm in Frankfurt. In short, there’s a case to be made that this would be “bad” inflation, not “good” inflation. Certainly not the time for a re-run of 2008 or 2011. The ECB raised rates in July 2008 as oil hit a record high $147/barrel, having doubled over the previous year. This was right in the midst of the global credit crunch: Bear Stearns had been rescued only a few months before, and Lehman Brothers would collapse a few weeks later. In 2011 oil was again above $100 and the ECB raised rates not once but twice, just as the euro zone debt crisis was bubbling up: Greece and Ireland had already received bailout packages, and bond yields in Spain and Italy were ballooning to levels that would eventually prompt Draghi’s “whatever it takes” intervention a year later. Policymakers will be more cautious this time around, not least because inflation, although at target, is lower than it was then. Headline inflation is running at 2 percent, whereas it nudged 4 percent in 2008 and 3 percent in 2011. The ECB expects its 2.6 trillion euro ($3.1 trillion) bond purchase scheme to end at the close of this year and keep rates low “through” the summer of next. The guidance on rates is vague enough to give the ECB a lot of leeway. It could raise rates in September next year, or December, or not at all, and still justifiably have kept its pledge.

2018-09-27,"(Adds comments from Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels) Sept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. nuclear power generators urged the federal government against taking action in a dispute over imported uranium, arguing tariffs or quotas would increase costs for the struggling industry and possibly cause some reactors to shut, according to a statement emailed on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) launched a “Section 232” investigation into uranium imports in July following complaints by two U.S. uranium mining companies, Ur-Energy Inc and Energy Fuels Inc, that subsidized foreign competitors have caused them to cut capacity and lay off workers. The move is a double-edged sword for President Donald Trump. While it helps domestic uranium producers by targeting importers, it undercuts the administration’s efforts to give a boost to U.S. nuclear power operators, who would see their fuel costs increase. “Imposing additional regulatory burdens on the already struggling nuclear energy industry will put 100,000 good paying domestic jobs and careers at risk and is inconsistent with President Trump’s and the Department of Energy’s policy pronouncements,” David Tamasi, spokesperson for nuclear group, called the Ad Hoc Utilities Group (AHUG), said in a statement. The White House has been trying to find a way to prevent additional coal and nuclear plants from shutting, which the administration sees as vital for national energy security, as they struggle to compete with cheaper alternatives like natural gas and renewable generation. Uranium is used in the U.S. nuclear arsenal and powers the Navy’s nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines, along with 98 U.S. commercial nuclear reactors that produce 20 percent of the electricity consumed in the country. The nuclear industry said a diverse uranium supply is essential to keep that power flowing. In 2017, about 58 percent of the U.S. uranium supply came from the United States, Canada and Australia, with the rest coming from Russia (16 percent), Kazakhstan (11 percent), Uzbekistan (5 percent), Namibia (5 percent), South Africa (2 percent) and Niger (2 percent), according to the nuclear power group. “If the U.S. uranium mining industry does not survive, we will essentially hand over to unfriendly countries control of our nuclear sector,” Jeffrey Klenda, president and CEO at Ur-Energy, and Mark Chalmers, president and CEO at Energy Fuels, said in a joint statement. “The DOC investigation represents a significant step toward protecting our national and energy security,” the two company executives said in the statement. The investigation, which the Commerce Department said on Wednesday is still ongoing, is one of several launched by the Trump administration under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, previously a seldom-invoked Cold War-era law. Probes on steel and aluminum imports have led to tariffs and quotas on the metals, prompting retaliation from trading partners including Canada, Mexico and the European Union.

2018-09-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - British car production fell by an annual 12.9 percent in August, the third consecutive drop in a row, due to model changeovers and preparations for new, tougher emissions rules, a car industry body said on Thursday. Output stood at 89,254 units last month, driven down by a nearly 40 percent drop in production for domestic buyers compared with a 4 percent fall in exports, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.  “The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns,” said Chief Executive Mike Hawes.   “This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on September 1.”  The tougher new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) became mandatory from the start of September, forcing certain carmakers to halt deliveries and change plans regarding some models that had yet to have re-certified for emissions. The car industry is also concerned that any loss of free and unfettered trade after Britain’s exit from the European Union next year could hit sales and output, especially if politicians fail to strike an agreement.  “With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade; for our sector, ‘no deal’ is not an option,” said Hawes.
