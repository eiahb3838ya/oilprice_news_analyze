2018-10-09,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Union nations, voicing concern over a U.N. report on global warming, agreed on Tuesday to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030, as Germany warned that overly challenging targets risked harming industry and jobs. Torn between reducing pollution and preserving industry competitiveness, EU environment ministers meeting in Luxembourg talked for more than 13 hours until nearly midnight to reach a compromise over what 2030 carbon dioxide limits to impose on Europe’s powerful carmakers. “We saw a really complicated discussion,” Europe’s Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said of the compromise that gained the support of 20 nations, with 4 voting against and 4 abstaining. “I never believed in the beginning that such a strong support would be obtained.” The final rules will now be hashed out in talks beginning on Wednesday with the EU’s two other lawmaking bodies: the European Parliament, which is seeking a more ambitious climate target, and the European Commission, which proposed a lower one. In a joint statement earlier, the EU ministers expressed deep concern over a U.N. report calling for rapid and unprecedented action to contain global warming and renewed commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord. Several countries had sought a higher, 40 percent reduction in car emissions, in line with targets backed by EU lawmakers last week, but softened their position in talks. However, Ireland and the Netherlands were among those who voiced disappointment with the compromise deal, which also set a 30 percent target for cutting emissions from vans by 2030. Germany, with its big auto sector, had backed an EU executive proposal for a 30 percent cut for fleets of new cars and vans by 2030, compared with 2021 levels. Climate campaigners say Germany has still not learned to be tougher on the auto industry, despite the scandal that engulfed Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in 2015 when it admitted to using illegal software to mask emissions on up to 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide. Germany had the backing of several eastern European nations early in the talks against more ambitious targets, EU sources said. But a last-minute amendment helped ease concerns over the new rules, which also create a crediting system encouraging carmakers to raise sales of electric cars. It would allow for a different accounting in countries where the current market penetration of zero- and low-emissions vehicles is less than 60 percent below the average in the bloc. Curbs on the transport sector, the only industry in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fuelled concerns climate change is gathering pace, leading some countries to call for emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. But a call by the EU’s climate commissioner and 15 EU nations for the bloc to increase its pledge to cut emissions by 45 percent under the Paris accord has met with resistance. Ahead of U.N. climate talks in Poland in December, the bloc’s 28 environment ministers reiterated their commitment to leading the fight to limit global warming. They said the EU was ready to “communicate or update” its Nationally Determined Contribution, the efforts by each country to reduce emissions, by 2020. Raising it would require the approval of all 28 nations.

2018-10-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets edged lower on Tuesday, with a decline in the materials sector offsetting rising energy shares, while long-dated U.S. Treasury yields pulled back from multi-year highs and helped weaken the U.S. dollar. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, a global benchmark, rose to a seven-year high at 3.261 percent before paring gains to trade at 3.2044 percent on worries about global growth. The International Monetary Fund cut global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, as well as its U.S. and China estimates for next year, saying the two countries would feel the brunt of the impact of their trade war next year. European shares closed higher in a choppy session, rising above six-month lows, as worries about a likely clash in Europe over Italy’s budget plans eased and energy heavyweights such as Eni SpA and Total lifted benchmarks.    The oil and gas index was the biggest sectoral gainer in Europe, up 1.5 percent after crude prices rose as more evidence emerged that Iran’s crude exports were falling. [O/R] Wall Street’s materials index fell 3.4 percent, with PPG Industries leading the decline after the chemicals company warned late on Monday that its earnings would be hit by higher raw material costs and softer demand in China. PPG fell 10.1 percent and the industrials sector, the second-biggest drag on the S&P 500, slid 1.5 percent. S&P 500 companies are vulnerable to global growth since  about half their business comes from overseas, noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “If industrials and materials are weighed on because of concerns about global activity, it’s going to cast a pall over the market at large,” Luschini said. Tech stocks edged off two-month lows in a sign the recent sell-off has dissipated as the speed of rapidly rising bond yields drove investor reactions. The strength of the U.S. economy has generated a rotation from the higher valuation areas of the market to more reasonably valued areas, said Andrew Acheson, director of U.S. growth equities at Amundi Pioneer in Boston. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 56.21 points, or 0.21 percent, to 26,430.57 and the S&P 500 shed 4.09 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,880.34. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.07 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,738.02. MSCI’s index of stock performance in 47 countries fell 0.13 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.31 percent. The dollar dipped due to a fall in U.S. bond yields after touching a seven-week peak against a basket of currencies. Sterling rose after a report that rekindled hopes that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit deal. Ongoing worries about a stand-off between the European Union and Italy over the country’s budget had pushed Italian borrowing costs to their highest since 2014 and had weighed on the euro. Investors dumped U.S. bonds last week on fears that domesticinflation might accelerate and prompt the Federal Reserve tohasten the pace of interest rate hikes.

2018-10-09,"(Recasts first sentence with potential impact on Mexican oil production, adds comments by energy minister, Pemex CEO, other details) By Ana Isabel Martinez and Marianna Parraga MEXICO CITY, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state-run Pemex said on Tuesday it has discovered up to 180 million barrels of crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico’s shallow waters, a find that is expected to help boost the country’s dwindling oil production. Pemex, whose oil and gas output has been declining since 2004, said light and heavy crudes were found in seven reservoirs along the Mulach and Manik fields in the southern Gulf of Mexico, close to existing infrastructure for production and transportation. “These are the reservoirs that will feed the country’s reserves,” said Mexican Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell at a news conference with Pemex executives. The discovery of proven, possible and probable reserves (3P) in Mulach and Manik follows discoveries announced by Pemex in recent years in four nearby fields. Together they will require $7 billion to $10 billion in investment, including drilling rigs, pipelines and at least one production platform. Even amid budgetary constraints, Pemex in recent years has increased exploration efforts, with a 25 percent success rate in confirming reserves, below rates registered in previous decades, according to the firm’s exploration chief Jose Antonio Escalera. Rising crude prices and an expanding budget now allow the company to do more to reverse the country’s falling proven reserves, which last year declined 7 percent to 8.48 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Pemex expects new production from the Xikin, Esah, Kinbe, Koban, Mulach and Manik offshore fields to add up to 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and 350 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of natural gas by the second half of 2020. The first field to add barrels would be Xikin, discovered three years ago, where early production is expected in 2019. The Esah field would follow in the first quarter of 2020. Mexico expects the downward trend in its oil reserves to turn positive in two years, following a constitutional energy overhaul enacted in 2013, said Joaquin Coldwell. The new fields will also contribute relatively quickly to Pemex output in shallow waters, where the vast majority of its production originates. Pemex has recently been facing production problems at one of its main shallow-water areas, the Xanab light crude field. “We still don’t have a specific production goal for this year. There’s an emergency plan to ease Xanab’s (output) declination,” Pemex’s CEO, Carlos Trevino Medina, said at the news conference.

2018-10-09,"(Recasts, adds minister comments, background) MILAN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will transport Russian gas to Germany will be completed on time even if new sanctions are imposed on Moscow, Russia’s energy minister said on Tuesday. “We hope there will be no additional sanctions but if there are the project will be completed anyway,” Alexander Novak said on the sidelines of an energy conference in Milan. Nord Stream 2 AG, which will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity, is led by Russian gas giant Gazprom and financed by five Western companies. The United States opposes the project and President Donald Trump has accused Germany of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance, saying it was wrong to support the Baltic gas pipeline. Divisions exist among EU member states over whether to do more business with Moscow despite its military incursions in Ukraine and Syria. “Everything is on time and as of today the first commercial gas will be ready by the end of 2019,” Novak said. Russia is keen to press ahead with Nord Stream 2 which will bypass traditional routes through Ukraine. Asked about the Gazprom-led Turkish Stream project to pipe Russian gas via the Black Sea to southern and southeast Europe, Novak said that was also on track for first commercial gas by end-2019. “The second marine-based part of the project is 85 percent complete,” he said. At the conference on Tuesday, Novak had a bilateral meeting with EDF’s Italian energy unit Edison. Last year, Gazprom signed an agreement with Edison and Greece’s state-controlled gas company DEPA to work on building a southern route for Russian gas supplies from Russia to Europe, across Turkey and Greece to Italy. “We agreed to continue this,” Novak said. Later on Tuesday an Edison spokeswoman confirmed the meeting. “It was a positive and warm meeting that we thank the minister for, ahead of the planned visit by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to Moscow later this month,” she said.

2018-10-09,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s latest shift on climate includes a $1 million donation to a political action committee’s lobbying campaign to promote a U.S. tax on carbon-gas emissions, a central factor in global warming. The contribution, made to the Americans for Carbon Dividends  political action committee of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), was disclosed by the group on Tuesday, less than a month after Exxon agreed to contribute $100 million to oil companies’ efforts to develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.      “Applying a uniform cost across the economy is consistent with our principles on how to manage the risk of climate change,” Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an email. “We’ve been supportive of a revenue-neutral price on carbon for a decade.”  The $1 million contribution will be spread over two years. Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, has supported a carbon tax in the past and has stepped up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations. Those efforts came amid lawsuits brought by U.S. city and state officials  seeking damages to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels that result from global warming.  The Climate Leadership Council’s PAC aims to spend $5 million on an initial lobbying campaign to win support for the tax, said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice president at the group. “We’re in the very early days of this organization,” said Bertelsen, who said the PAC is looking to build legislative support for its carbon tax. It proposes an initial $40-a-ton tax on carbon dioxide that would increase over time, with the money  raised to be returned to consumers.  The PAC, led by former U.S. Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott, also has raised $1 million each from Exelon Corp, First Solar Inc and the American Wind Energy Association, he said. It expects to reach its goal of a $5 million in coming months, he said.  The council’s proposal was developed by former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz.

2018-10-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about one percent on Tuesday on growing evidence of falling Iranian crude exports before the imposition of new U.S. sanctions, as well as a partial production shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Michael.  Brent crude futures rose $1.09 to settle at $85.00 a barrel, a 1.30 percent gain. The global benchmark hit a four-year high of $86.74 last week but slipped as low as $82.66 on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 67 cents to settle at $74.96 a barrel, a 0.90 percent gain. Iran’s crude exports fell further in the first week of October, according to tanker data and an industry source, as buyers sought alternatives ahead of U.S. sanctions that take effect on Nov. 4. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, exported 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in that seven-day period, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. An industry source who also tracks exports said October shipments so far were below 1 million bpd. That is down from at least 2.5 million bpd in April, before U.S. President Donald Trump in May withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions. The figure also marks a further fall from 1.6 million bpd in September. A vessel carrying 2 million barrels of Iranian oil discharged the crude into a bonded storage tank at the port of Dalian in northeast China on Monday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and a shipping agent with knowledge of the matter. The country previously held oil in storage at Dalian during the last round of sanctions in 2014 that was later sold to buyers in South Korea and India.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, last week said it would increase crude output next month to 10.7 million bpd, a record. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Monday described a Saudi claim that the kingdom could replace Iran’s crude exports as “nonsense.” “There is growing concern that suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia will struggle to compensate for potential production declines from Iran and Venezuela, which has supported oil prices in today’s trading session,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. Meanwhile, producers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday cut oil production by about 40 percent as Hurricane Michael approached the Florida coast, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said, citing reports from 27 companies. If forecasts prove accurate, the hurricane would largely miss major oil-producing assets, analysts said, but a change of track could widen the impact. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, saying trade tensions and rising import tariffs were taking a toll on commerce while emerging markets struggle with tighter financial conditions and capital outflows.  Industry and government data on U.S. crude inventories will be delayed by one day this week because of Monday’s U.S. Columbus Day holiday. The American Petroleum Institute is due to release data on Wednesday, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to publish on Thursday.

2018-10-09,"(Adds details from interview) By Ron Bousso and Ernest Scheyder LONDON/HOUSTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp wants to build or buy a refinery along the U.S. Gulf Coast to process crude oil from its rapidly growing Permian Basin operations, a senior executive said on Tuesday. The company would like to have refining operations on the Houston Ship Channel, in the western part of the U.S. Gulf, to complement an existing eastern Gulf refinery in Mississippi that makes lubricants and other materials, Pierre Breber, Chevron’s head of downstream and chemicals, said. “Something on the ship channel side could make a lot of sense for our company,” Breber said in an interview on the sidelines of the Oil & Money conference in London. Chevron is a major oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. The company’s Permian production jumped 51 percent sequentially in the second quarter to 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By expanding its refining capacity to Houston, Chevron would be able to process its Permian crude closer to where it is produced. Most of Chevron’s refineries are in California and use a heavier type of crude than the light, sweet kind pumped from Permian shale wells. “The ingredients to invest in the U.S. Gulf are very sound,” said Breber, who assumed his current role in 2016 and previously oversaw Chevron’s pipeline operations. Rival Exxon Mobil Corp said last year it would invest $20 billion on U.S. Gulf refining projects. The Houston Ship Channel links the busiest U.S. petrochemical port to the Gulf of Mexico and is home to dozens of refineries and chemical facilities. Mike Wirth, who became Chevron’s chief executive earlier this year, formerly ran the company’s refining arm and is widely seen by Wall Street as an advocate for expanding refining operations. Separately, Berber said Chevron’s existing Mississippi refinery has seen shipments from Venezuela drop 25 percent to 75,000 barrels per day over the last two years. Chevron is the only remaining major U.S. oil producer in the strife-torn country.

Those efforts came amid lawsuits brought by U.S. city and state officials seeking damages to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels that result from global warming. The Climate Leadership Council’s PAC aims to spend $5 million on an initial lobbying campaign to win support for the tax, said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice president at the group. “We’re in the very early days of this organization,” said Bertelsen, who said the PAC is looking to build legislative support for its carbon tax. It proposes an initial $40 a ton tax on carbon dioxide that would increase over time, with the money raised to be returned to consumers. The PAC, led by former U.S. Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott, also has raised $1 million each from Exelon Corp, First Solar Inc and the American Wind Energy Association, he said. It expects to reach its goal of a $5 million in coming months, he said. The council’s proposal was developed by former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz. Council’s members include BP Plc, Total SA and General Motors Co .

2018-10-09,"* Power plant delivery bypasses Palestinian leader Abbas * Qatar says wants to prevent escalation of violence * UN Sec-General, United States, welcome fuel delivery (Adds United Nations, U.S. comments) By Saleh Salem GAZA, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Two trucks brought fuel across Israel’s border into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in a Qatari- and U.N.-backed effort to ease conditions in the enclave and stem any escalation in Palestinian-Israeli violence. The shipment was a potential slap to the Western-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which opposed the foreign relief plan. Gaza is controlled by Abbas’s rival, the Islamist Hamas group, and the Palestinian president has been using economic pressure in order to wrest back control. Under a blockade by Israel and Egypt designed to isolate Hamas, Gaza has plunged into poverty. Over the last half year it has seen weekly, often violent Palestinian border protests and lethal counter-fire by the Israeli military. “The Secretary-General expresses his deep appreciation to the Government of Qatar for its $60 million contribution, which made this delivery possible and will allow its continuation for the coming months,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in New York. Each of the two trucks entering Gaza carried some 35,000 litres of fuel and seven more trucks are expected on Wednesday, Dujarric said. Qatar’s donation is intended to provide fuel to Gaza’s power plant for six months, local sources said. The cash-starved plant has been providing Gazans with only around four hours of electricity daily. The United States’ Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, tweeted: “The U.S. appreciates the efforts of the U.N., Egypt, Qatar and Israel to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Gaza and efforts to achieve the goal of an enduring ceasefire.” A spokesman for the Abbas-appointed Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, voiced disapproval of the fuel delivery. “Any international financial aid to the Gaza Strip should be through, or with the coordination of, the Palestinian government,” he said, in order “to preserve Palestinian unity” and to stop any plans to separate Gaza from the West Bank. A Qatari official, speaking to Reuters on Sunday, said Doha planned to help with Gaza’s power crisis “at the request of donor states in the United Nations, to prevent an escalation of the existing humanitarian disaster”. Israel’s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, told Reuters on Monday that Qatar “was trying to help” prevent a Gaza flare-up. Steinitz accused Abbas, who has restricted funding for Gaza, of “seeking to make gains on two counts: by encouraging a conflict in which Israel will clobber Hamas and over which he will then be able to clobber Israel on the world stage”. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008. Months of Egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks between Hamas and Abbas have been held up by power-sharing disputes. “Abbas believes that if he keeps the Gaza closure tight, it will make Hamas accept his reconciliation plan, which would give the Abbas government full control - or the people in Gaza will launch a revolution against Hamas,” said Palestinian political analyst Hani al-Masri. “This is making it easy for others to bypass the Palestinian Authority ... They are trying to give them (Gazans) a sedative, sometimes through Egypt, and this time through Israel.” Palestinians launched the border protests on March 30 to demand an easing of the Gaza blockade and the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel’s founding in 1948. Israeli forces have killed at least 195 Palestinians since. Israel has lost a soldier to a Gaza sniper and tracts of forest and farmland to fires set in cross-border incendiary attacks.

2018-10-09,"WASHINGTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday plans to lift a ban on summer sales of higher-ethanol blend of gasoline, known as E15, delivering a long-sought win to the Farm Belt ahead of November’s midterm elections and angering the refining industry. The move will be coupled with restrictions, a senior administration official said on Monday, on the multibillion-dollar biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc. Those rules will seek stop parties from hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws. The announcement will cap a months-long effort by the White House to bring rival corn and oil industries together over reforms to boost ethanol demand while alleviating compliance costs for refiners. In the end, Trump is moving ahead without the support of the refining industry, who wanted more in return for agreeing to lift the summer E15 ban. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently prohibits summer sales of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, or E15, due to smog concerns. The EPA must now draft a rule ahead and potentially fend off lawsuits from the refining industry who argue the agency lacks the power. Biofuel advocates hope the lifting of the ban will lead to E15 replacing the year-round E10 grade that contains 10 percent of ethanol as the gasoline of choice for U.S. consumers, a move that could boost corn demand by some 2 billion bushels. And as ethanol is cheaper than gasoline, the administration hopes to lower pump prices, which currently average $2.91 a gallon, more than 40 cents higher than this time a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association. “It’s about time,” Warren Bachman, a 72-year-old corn and soybean farmer in Iowa. “With all the trade wars, tariffs and low crop prices, it seems like we are taking it in the shorts and bearing all the burden. So, it’s some good news.” Farmers have been frustrated with weak corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the United States and China; Trump has promised the trade war with China will eventually boost the U.S. economy. Trump will celebrate the move at a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later on Tuesday. Council Bluffs is in a moderate congressional district represented by incumbent Republican Dave Young, who is locked in a tight race in the mid-term Congressional elections on Nov. 6. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade association, opposes lifting the ban, which would hurt their market share. They say E15 gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties, and have threatened to sue, arguing the EPA lacks the legal authority to strike the ban. The refining industry came out against the proposal, arguing they should have gotten more than trade restrictions in exchange for lifting the summer ban. “The president has promised to broker a deal to reform the RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard) that works for all stakeholders. This isn’t it,” Chet Thompson, chief executive of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said in an statement. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices. The EPA will consider forcing blenders, retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly, the White House official said. The agency may only allow obligated parties like refiners to buy credits, and may require greater public disclosure as well. Biofuel credit prices were near five-year highs last year, hitting nearly $1 each, drawing the Trump administration into the debate as merchant refiners said plants may be forced to close without presidential action. Credit prices dropped sharply in the past year, hitting a five-year low, due to EPA’s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations. The credits were trading at roughly 12 cents each on Tuesday morning, traders said.

Stock markets in Asia and Europe trimmed earlier losses after a four-day selloff that had pushed shares in Asia to a 17-month low and knocked European shares to six-month lows. Ongoing worries about a standoff between the European Union and Italy over the country’s budget had pushed Italian borrowing costs to their highest since 2014 and weighed on the euro, while Treasury yields hovered at seven-year highs. The Chinese yuan steadied near a seven-week low against the greenback as a liquidity squeeze in the offshore market for renminbi in Hong Kong helped stabilize sentiment. “The rise in U.S. yields is much more important” to the day’s foreign exchange trading than Italy’s fiscal problems, said Thomas Flury, head of currency strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Office in Zurich. “The market needs to digest this to see whether it’s a long-term spike.” MSCI’s index of stock markets across the globe traded flat after paring losses, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.33 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.81 points, or 0.05 percent, to 26,493.40. The S&P 500 gained 2.97 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,887.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.47 points, or 0.35 percent, to 7,761.86. “Techs actually right now are strong today. That was weighing on the market and when that turned around that helped drive the market higher this morning,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading, in Chatham, New Jersey. “People are nervous and worried about growth. The IMF had the growth forecast going lower. But interest rates are going up because of the growth. That’s a good thing,” Saluzzi said. The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, saying trade tensions and import tariffs were taking a toll on commerce while emerging markets struggled with tighter financial conditions and capital outflows. U.S. long-dated Treasury yields slipped from multi-year highs in choppy trading as investors took a breather from selling last week. Those sales had come on fears inflation might accelerate and prompt the Federal Reserve to hasten the pace of interest rate hikes. The bond market was closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 3.22 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 6/32 in price to pull the yield down to 3.38 percent. The dollar index rose 0.01 percent, with the euro down 0.06 percent to $1.1483. The dollar fell 0.09 percent to 113.10 yen. Oil prices rose on evidence of falling crude exports from key producer Iran, before the imposition of new U.S. sanctions and a partial shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Michael. U.S. crude rose 0.75 percent to $74.85 per barrel and Brent was last at $84.76, up 1.01 percent on the day.

2018-10-09,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China has choked back on imports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States, traders and analysts said, turning to the Middle East for extra supplies amid the two countries’ trade dispute. China bought nearly 3.6 million tonnes of U.S. LPG in 2017, making the United States the country’s second-largest supplier of the fuel used in petrochemicals, as well as for cooking, transport and heating.  However, U.S. imports have come off dramatically over the course of 2018, before stalling completely in late August when China imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on over 300 U.S. goods, including LPG, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Consultancy IHS Markit estimates U.S. imports fell to barely 1 million tonnes during the first eight months of 2018, down from about 2.1 million tonnes for the same period last year, said He Yanyu, Executive Director for Natural Gas Liquids. (GRAPHIC: China LPG imports from top suppliers - tmsnrt.rs/2ynjtSn) The fall came as Chinese buyers wound back U.S. purchases of LPG amid uncertainty about the impact of buying product from the United States, said a trader who tracks the fuel.  No U.S. LPG cargoes have landed in China since tariffs were imposed in late August, said Ong Han Wee at consultancy FGE. “China has stopped shipping in U.S. LPG cargoes as they are now too expensive,” added a second trader who tracks LPG cargoes. The United States last year accounted for about 20 percent of China’s total LPG imports, which are currently running at about $1 billion a month, based on Thomson Reuters calculation.  The U.S. gap is being filled largely by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, analysts said. The change comes as prices for the fuel, often a mix of propane and butane, spike in line with higher oil prices. State-owned Saudi Aramco, whose contract prices are used as benchmarks in Asia, fixed its propane and butane contract prices for October at $655 a tonne, the highest since 2014.   U.S. prices are also rising. The propane price at the Texan Mont Belvieu hub hit its highest since 2014 on Sept. 28 at around 108 cents per gallon before easing to around 104 cents on Oct. 9.  (GRAPHIC: LPG prices on the rise in line with crude oil - tmsnrt.rs/2ynl3nh) This works out to about $542 a tonne, based on Reuters calculations, but is above the Saudi Aramco price after taking into account freight and terminal charges and the additional 25 percent tariff. China’s LPG imports rose about 15 percent to nearly 18.3 million tonnes in 2017, driven partly by new petrochemicals plants which use the propane dehydrogenation method to produce the raw material for plastics..

The waiver extension will allow Serica to complete the acquisition of BP’s stake in the Rhum, Bruce and Keith fields, as well as buying Total’s (TOTF.PA) stakes in Bruce and Keith, Serica said in a statement. Rhum, which supplies around 5 percent of Britain’s gas demand, is half owned by Iranian Oil Company, a subsidiary of the national oil company.  The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control extended a licence for U.S. and U.S.-owned or controlled entities to provide goods, services and support the Rhum field. Renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which will take full effect on Nov. 4, ban U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with Iranian companies as well as transactions in dollars. The new licence is conditional on the setting up of an escrow account that will hold all profits from the field for as long as the sanctions are in place, Serica said.

2018-10-09,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia is looking into converting two of the country’s older crude oil refineries into plants for producing biofuels, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday. The government is conducting a study with Italian energy company ENI, which has successfully converted one of its refineries to the production of biofuels, Rini Soemarno, the minister overseeing state-controlled companies, told reporters on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Bali. The move is part of a drive to reduce energy imports as the government tries to narrow the country’s current account gap amid emerging market volatility that has dragged the rupiah currency to its weakest in over 20 years. ENI is conducting a study on state energy company Pertamina’s Plaju and Dumai refineries, which were built around the 1930s, according to Soemarno. “We have been planning to modernise those refineries, but we found out that they could be turned (into biofuel plants) - most likely these two will be converted,” Soemarno said. According to Pertamina’s website, the Plaju plant has an oil refining capacity of 133,700 barrels per day (bpd), with Dumai at 170,000 bpd. Indonesia’s biodiesel drive also aims to absorb the country’s rising crude palm oil output amid sluggish global demand. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of the commodity. Starting in September, Indonesia enforced a mandatory use of B20 fuel, which has 20 percent bio-content mix, for all diesel machines in the country, including train locomotives and heavy equipment. Government officials have estimated the nation could save billion of dollars in energy imports per year through the B20 programme.

That seemingly simple but bold sentiment is likely to set much of the political, social and economic agenda for the coming decades, but in the end it will come down to what China does. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a report on Monday that “unprecedented” changes will have to take place to limit the rise in the Earth’s temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), warning of devastating weather events and species loss if the target is exceeded. In order to achieve the goal, the IPCC said coal burning would have to drop to between zero and 2 percent by 2050, while even natural gas, coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS), would have to decline to 8 percent of electricity generation by the middle of this century. While coal has long been the bogeyman of climate activists, the IPCC has effectively thrown down the gauntlet and given world leaders a little over 30 years to phase it out entirely. Initial reaction to the IPCC report has been predictable, with supporters of renewable energy cheering it, and backers of fossil fuels resorting to the familiar arguments that somehow the science is either wrong or a hoax. (Graphic: reut.rs/2CzFPoz) Australia’s Environment Minister Melissa Price told ABC radio on Tuesday that the IPCC was “drawing a long bow” by calling for an end to coal by 2050, and touted new technologies as a way of saving the polluting fuel. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and relies on the fuel for more than 70 percent of its electricity generation. Price isn’t alone in touting CCS and other technologies, with the World Coal Association responding to the IPCC report by saying in a statement on its website that CCS is “vital” and that the coal lobby group will push for it to be adopted. However, elsewhere on the group’s website it acknowledges that currently progress of CCS “is too slow to allow necessary emissions reductions goals to be achieved”. Its solution is to spend more on research and development. But it’s here that the coal lobby will run into problems. Already renewable technologies, which have benefited from subsidies, are becoming cheaper than conventional coal-fired power generation, a trend likely to continue. Coal-fired generation with CCS would likely require huge subsidies in order to be cost-competitive, and selling such largesse with public money will be incredibly hard for governments in democracies. It’s therefore likely that the scenario currently being played out in Europe will be extended to other parts of the world, with coal-fired power being replaced by a combination of renewables, battery storage, gas-fired back-up and even nuclear. Coal will further be hamstrung by the flight of capital from the sector, with commercial and development banks, insurers and trading companies starting to retreat from financing and insuring mines and power plants. While it’s likely that the developed world will witness ongoing bitter debates over policy toward fossil fuels, the actual key to the IPCC target is China, and to a lesser extent the rest of developing Asia. China is the world’s largest producer, consumer and importer of coal and any genuine attempt to remove coal from the world’s energy mix by 2050 will require massive commitment from Beijing. While the Chinese government has a policy of limiting the use of coal and of boosting the use of renewables and natural gas, it’s well within the realms of wishful thinking to imagine the world’s second-largest economy is on track to abandon the use of coal by 2050. According to the Global Coal Plant Tracker, China currently has 957 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power operating - more than four times India’s 219 GW. The positive news for both China and India, the world’s second-biggest coal importer, is that the pipeline of coal-fired plant construction has been consistently shrinking and retirements of older units has been accelerating. But given that once built, coal-fired plants generally operate for at least 30 years, it would be imperative that virtually all construction is halted now, and no new plants commissioned. In reality, China currently has 126 GW of coal-fired power in construction and 76 GW either announced, in pre-permit phase or with permits already in place. India has 39 GW being built and 63 GW in the approval process. There are also new coal plants being built or planned in numerous other Asian countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. What the IPCC report may do is accelerate pressure on those countries to re-think their power generation plans, especially if renewables can be shown to be as cheap and as reliable. It’s also likely that any technological advances in energy in the next decades will not be in favour of coal, given that vast sums are being invested in renewables and comparatively little in CCS or other coal-friendly technologies. The IPCC report highlights that coal now has its back very much against the wall, but equally that the real power for change lies in Beijing. Natural gas also tends to get off lightly in much of the media reporting about climate change, especially given the obvious target of coal. But like silent flatulence in an elevator, eventually natural gas will be unable to avoid the attention that is making life so difficult for the coal industry.

The Pakistani rupee plunged about 5 percent in an apparent devaluation by the central bank, market participants said. The IMF added to the malaise by cutting forecasts of global growth for both this year and next, including downgrades to the outlook for the United States, China and Europe. “Risk sentiment is in a foul mood and stocks are sinking everywhere,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. “With Chinese economic momentum continuing to weaken alongside increasing pressure from the United States, currency weakness is the obvious release valve,” they warned. “A lurch through the 7.0 level by year end is possible.” China’s central bank fixed its yuan at 6.9019 per dollar on Tuesday, so breaching the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9120 in the spot market. The drop should be a positive for exporters and did help Shanghai blue chips edge up 0.3 percent. Yet that follows a 4.3 percent slide on Monday which was the largest daily drop since early 2016. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan went flat after ending Monday at its lowest point since May last year. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.3 percent, hurt in part by a rise in the safe-harbour yen. On Monday, a senior U.S. Treasury official expressed concern at the fall in the yuan, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with any Chinese officials this week. On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen for the third straight day on Monday and growth stocks were pressured by worries rising bond yields might ultimately hobble the economy. The S&P 500 lost 0.04 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.67 percent, while the Dow rose 0.15 percent as defensive stocks found buyers. Yields on 10-year Treasury paper notched a new seven-year top on Tuesday at 3.252 percent. Treasuries have had a sort of safety net up to now as rising yields tend to dampen stocks and threaten the economic outlook, thus putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to go slow on policy tightening. Yet recently the Fed has sounded so bullish on the economy and so hawkish on rates that the net has become frayed. “The size and speed of the bearish bond impulse would suggest a collective shift in market thinking about the US growth prospects and policy projections,” said Damien McColough, Westpac’s head of rates strategy. “The Fed’s expected 2019 profile has moved from just below 2 hikes to 2.5 hikes being factored-in.” That shift has underpinned the dollar against a basket of currencies where it stood at 95.677, from a low of 93.814 just a couple of weeks ago. The dollar had less luck on the safe-haven yen pulling back to 113.07 from a 114.54 peak last week. The euro was undermined by political troubles in Italy and loitered at $1.1496, well off September’s $1.1815 top. Italy’s borrowing costs have surged as a war of words between Rome and the European Union over the country’s budget plans escalated. The yield on Italian government 10-year bonds rose more than 20 basis points to 3.626 percent, the highest since February 2014, while Italy’s FTSE MIB stock index fell to its weakest since April 2017. Brazil’s real currency hit a two-month high and stocks jumped after market-preferred presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro’s strong first-round win on Sunday. In commodity markets, gold got a modest safety bid at $1,191.10, having fallen 1.4 percent overnight. Oil prices rose on Tuesday as more evidence emerged that crude exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, are declining in the run-up to the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions and as a hurricane moved across the Gulf of Mexico.

2018-10-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will seek to lift a federal ban on summer sales of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline on Tuesday, a senior White House official said, delivering on a move long sought by anxious Midwestern farmers ahead of the Nov. 6 elections. The move will be coupled with restrictions on the multibillion-dollar biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc. Those rules would be aimed at retailers and oil majors accused by merchant refiners of hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently prohibits summer sales of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, or E15, due to smog concerns.  Because ethanol is cheaper than gasoline, the administration hopes it will bring down retail prices, which currently average $2.91 a gallon, more than 40 cents higher than this time a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association.  The announcement will mark the end of a months-long effort by the White House to bring rival corn and oil industries together over reforms to boost ethanol demand while alleviating compliance costs for refiners. The rival camps cut across Trump’s strong base of rural voters and blue-collar workers,  The refining industry came out against the proposal, arguing they should have gotten more than trade restrictions in exchange for lifting the summer ban.  “The president has promised to broker a deal to reform the RFS that works for all stakeholders. This isn’t it,” Chet Thompson, chief executive of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said in an statement. Trump plans to hold a closed-door event with ethanol producers in Washington before a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Tuesday to highlight the change. Council Bluffs is in a moderate congressional district represented by incumbent Republican Dave Young, who is locked in a tight race. “Rural America needs a shot in the arm, and this is it,” said Emily Skor, chief executive officer of Growth Energy, a biofuel trade association. Farmers have been frustrated with weak corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the United States and China; Trump has promised the trade war with China will eventually boost the U.S. economy. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices. The EPA will consider forcing blenders, retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly, the official said. The agency may only allow obligated parties like refiners to buy credits, and may require greater public disclosure as well. Biofuel credit prices were near five-year highs last year, hitting nearly $1 each, but have dropped sharply to their lowest since 2013, due mainly to the EPA’s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations. The credits were trading at roughly 12 cents each on Tuesday morning, traders said.  About 400 million gallons of E15 are sold in the U.S. annually, a fraction of the roughly 142 billion gallons in U.S. gasoline sales last year.  The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade association, opposes lifting the ban, which would hurt their market share. They say E15 gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties, and have threatened to sue, arguing the EPA lacks the legal authority to strike the ban. The National Association of Truck Stop Owners, or NATSO, came out against the trade restrictions, arguing they are solutions in search of a problem. The retailers can benefit from trading credits and the restriction could hurt profits. “The RIN market as it exists today is structurally sound; it provides the necessary price discovery and risk management vehicles for parties in the production, distribution, and blending of renewable fuels,” said David Fialkov, head of the association.

2018-10-09,"* Power plant delivery bypasses Palestinian leader Abbas * Qatar says wants to prevent escalation of violence By Saleh Salem GAZA, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A truck brought fuel across Israel’s border into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in what sources said was a Qatari- and U.N.-backed drive to ease conditions in the enclave and stem any escalation in Palestinian-Israeli violence. The shipment was a potential slap to the Western-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which opposed the foreign relief plan. Gaza is controlled by Abbas’s rival, the Islamist Hamas group and the Palestinian president has been using economic pressure in order to wrest back control. Under a blockade by Israel and Egypt designed to isolate Hamas, Gaza has plunged into poverty. Over the last half year it has seen weekly, often violent Palestinian border protests and lethal counter-fire by the Israeli military. The truck that entered Gaza brought the first delivery out of a $60 million fuel donation by Qatar meant to provide the power plant with enough fuel to operate for six months, local sources said. The cash-starved plant has been providing Gazans with only around four hours of electricity daily. A spokesman for the Abbas-appointed Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, voiced disapproval of the fuel delivery. “Any international financial aid to the Gaza Strip should be through, or with the coordination of, the Palestinian government,” he said, in order “to preserve Palestinian unity” and to stop any plans to separate Gaza from the West Bank. A Qatari official, speaking to Reuters on Sunday, said Doha planned to help with Gaza’s power crisis “at the request of donor states in the United Nations, to prevent an escalation of the existing humanitarian disaster”. U.N. officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Israel’s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, told Reuters on Monday that Qatar “was trying to help” prevent a Gaza flare-up. Steinitz accused Abbas, who has restricted PA funding for Gaza, of “seeking to make gains on two counts: by encouraging a conflict in which Israel will clobber Hamas and over which he will then be able to clobber Israel on the world stage”. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008. Months of Egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks between Hamas and Abbas have been held up by power-sharing disputes. “Abbas believes that if he keeps the Gaza closure tight, it will make Hamas accept his reconciliation plan, which would give the Abbas government full control - or the people in Gaza will launch a revolution against Hamas,” said Palestinian political analyst Hani al-Masri. “This is making it easy for others to bypass the Palestinian Authority ... They are trying to give them (Gazans) a sedative, sometimes through Egypt, and this time through Israel.” Palestinians launched the border protests on March 30 to demand an easing of the Gaza blockade and the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel’s founding in 1948. Israeli forces have killed at least 195 Palestinians since. Israel has lost a soldier to a Gaza sniper and tracts of forest and farmland to fires set in cross-border incendiary attacks.

There was plenty to keep the stress levels high. Ongoing worries about Italy’s finances pushed its borrowing costs to their highest since 2014 and the euro lower, while U.S. Treasury yields were hovering at a seven-year high. There was still strength in Europe’s oil stocks on higher crude prices, but most sectors had buckled to leave the Euro STOXX 600 down 0.7 percent at a six-month low and S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures down around 0.5 percent. If the S&P ends the day lower it will be its fourth red day in a row for the seventh time this year. It hasn’t seen five falls yet. “It all feels like it’s quite nervous here over whether things are going to break (out of ranges) or not,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX Strategy John Hardy. He also pointed to the rising U.S. and Japanese government bond yields, which tend to set the bar for borrowing costs globally, as well as the latest lows for China’s yuan. China’s central bank fixed its yuan rate at 6.9019 per dollar on Tuesday, so breaching the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9120 in the spot market. The drop should be a positive for exporters and did help Shanghai blue chips edge up 0.3 percent. Yet that followed a 4.3 percent slide on Monday, which was the largest daily fall since early 2016. Asian shares overall fell to a 17-month low. Pakistan’s rupee slumped 7 percent in an apparent devaluation before an expected International Monetary Fund programme. The Indian and Sri Lankan  rupees both hit record lows. That also followed the IMF’s first downgrade to its global growth forecast since 2016. “U.S. growth will decline once parts of its fiscal stimulus go into reverse,” IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld predicted. Italian government bond yields rose to a 4 1/2-year high of 3.71 percent after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria’s address to parliament on the government’s budget plans did little to reassure nervous investors. Tria called for a constructive discussion with Brussels over the budget and said he did not think Italy’s deficit forecasts were so shocking. EU Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said Italy’s situation is vulnerable and negotiations may prove difficult. “Maybe some people were expecting some reassurance from Tria, but he’s not calling the shots,” said Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea. “The general background is that the budget continues to cause uncertainty.” Back in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei had dropped 1.3 percent, hurt in part by a rise in the safe-harbour yen and as yields on Tokyo’s government bonds prodded the 0.15 percent cap the Bank of Japan effectively has on them . A senior U.S. Treasury official on Monday had also expressed concern at the fall in the Chinese yuan, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with Chinese officials this week. On Wall Street, the broad spread of red in futures markets came after growth and tech stocks were pressured on Monday by worries that rising bond yields, which raise borrowing costs, might ultimately hobble the economy. Yields on 10-year Treasury paper reached a seven-year top on Tuesday at 3.252 percent, but were edging back slightly ahead of U.S. trading. Treasuries have had a sort of safety net up to now: rising yields tend to dampen stocks and threaten the economic outlook, thus putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to go slow on policy tightening. But the Fed has sounded so bullish on the economy and so hawkish on rates that the net has become frayed. “The size and speed of the bearish bond impulse would suggest a collective shift in market thinking about the U.S. growth prospects and policy projections,” said Damien McColough, Westpac’s head of rates strategy. “The Fed’s expected 2019 profile has moved from just below 2 hikes to 2.5 hikes being factored in.” That shift has underpinned the dollar against a basket of currencies where it stood up 0.4 percent at 96.128, from a low of 93.814 a couple of weeks ago. Against the safe-haven yen, the dollar pulled back to 113.15 from a 114.54 peak last week. The euro was undermined by Italy’s political troubles and loitered at $1.1436, well off September’s $1.1815 top. In commodity markets, gold got a modest safety bid at $1,191.10, having fallen 1.4 percent overnight. Industrial bellwethers copper and nickel jumped as much 1.4 and 2 percent. Oil prices also rose as more evidence emerged that crude exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, are declining in the run-up to the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions and as a hurricane moved across the Gulf of Mexico. Brent crude added 60 cents to $84.51 a barrel and U.S. crude gained 41 cents to $74.70. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and Virginia

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Drink companies Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestle were found to be the world’s biggest producers of plastic trash, a report by environmental group Greenpeace said on Tuesday.  Working with the Break Free From Plastic movement, Greenpeace said it orchestrated 239 plastic clean-ups in 42 countries around the world, which resulted in the audit of 187,000 pieces of plastic trash. The aim was to get a picture of how large corporations contribute to the problem of pollution. Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drink maker, was the top waste producer, Greenpeace said, with Coke-branded plastic trash found in 40 of the 42 countries.  “These brand audits offer undeniable proof of the role that corporations play in perpetuating the global plastic pollution crisis,” said Von Hernandez, global coordinator for Break Free From Plastic.  Overall, the most common type of plastic found was polystyrene, which goes into packaging and foam coffee cups, followed closely by PET, used in bottles and containers.  “We share Greenpeace’s goal of eliminating waste from the ocean and are prepared to do our part to help address this important challenge,” a Coke spokesman said in a statement. The company has pledged to collect and recycle a bottle or can for every one it sells by 2030.  All three companies have made pledges about their packaging for 2025. Coke says all its packaging will be recyclable, Nestle says it will be recyclable or reusable and PepsiCo says it will be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable.  They are all also working to use recycled content in their packaging.  Nestle, the world’s largest food and drink maker, said it recognized the issue and is working hard to eliminate non-recyclable plastics. It said it was also exploring different packaging solutions and ways to facilitate recycling and eliminate plastic waste.

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two British-based researchers have created an award-winning new design for a mini wind turbine that looks like a volleyball and can catch a breeze blowing in any direction, which they say will make green energy more attainable for people who live in cities. The O-Wind Turbine, created by Nicolas Orellana and Yaseen Noorani from Lancaster University, is a small plastic sphere with vents that catch wind from any direction, causing it to spin on its axis like a ball balanced on the end of a finger. It is better suited than traditional turbines for harnessing the ever-changing winds that blow through built-up locations, the inventors say. “Cities are windy places but we are currently not harnessing this resource,” said Orellana, who is from Chile. “We hope that O-Wind Turbine will improve the usability and affordability of turbines for people across the world.”  The duo, who recently finished their master’s degrees in international innovation, say the 25 cm sphere can be attached to the side of buildings or balconies and provide green energy for the home or send it to the grid.  The duo’s interest in broadening the capabilities of wind turbines came after studying the limitations of NASA’s Mars Tumbleweed Rover, an inflatable ball designed to autonomously bounce across the surface of Mars. The O-Wind Turbine claimed the UK version of the James Dyson Award last month and is in contention next month for the international version of the prize, which was set up by Dyson, the billionaire British vacuum cleaner inventor and designer. The duo hope to have the product launched to market within five years and also plan to research the possibility of adapting the technology to generate wave energy from the sea.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Curbing emissions: tmsnrt.rs/2fd44vX By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Coal-fired power has to end by 2050 to save the planet. That seemingly simple but bold sentiment is likely to set much of the political, social and economic agenda for the coming decades, but in the end it will come down to what China does. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a report on Monday that “unprecedented” changes will have to take place to limit the rise in the Earth’s temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), warning of devastating weather events and species loss if the target is exceeded. In order to achieve the goal, the IPCC said coal burning would have to drop to between zero and 2 percent by 2050, while even natural gas, coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS), would have to decline to 8 percent of electricity generation by the middle of this century. While coal has long been the bogeyman of climate activists, the IPCC has effectively thrown down the gauntlet and given world leaders a little over 30 years to phase it out entirely. Initial reaction to the IPCC report has been predictable, with supporters of renewable energy cheering it, and backers of fossil fuels resorting to the familiar arguments that somehow the science is either wrong or a hoax. Australia’s Environment Minister Melissa Price told ABC radio on Tuesday that the IPCC was “drawing a long bow” by calling for an end to coal by 2050, and touted new technologies as a way of saving the polluting fuel. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and relies on the fuel for more than 70 percent of its electricity generation. Price isn’t alone in touting CCS and other technologies, with the World Coal Association responding to the IPCC report by saying in a statement on its website that CCS is “vital” and that the coal lobby group will push for it to be adopted. However, elsewhere on the group’s website it acknowledges that currently progress of CCS “is too slow to allow necessary emissions reductions goals to be achieved”. Its solution is to spend more on research and development. But it’s here that the coal lobby will run into problems. Already renewable technologies, which have benefited from subsidies, are becoming cheaper than conventional coal-fired power generation, a trend likely to continue. Coal-fired generation with CCS would likely require huge subsidies in order to be cost-competitive, and selling such largesse with public money will be incredibly hard for governments in democracies. It’s therefore likely that the scenario currently being played out in Europe will be extended to other parts of the world, with coal-fired power being replaced by a combination of renewables, battery storage, gas-fired back-up and even nuclear. Coal will further be hamstrung by the flight of capital from the sector, with commercial and development banks, insurers and trading companies starting to retreat from financing and insuring mines and power plants. While it’s likely that the developed world will witness ongoing bitter debates over policy toward fossil fuels, the actual key to the IPCC target is China, and to a lesser extent the rest of developing Asia. China is the world’s largest producer, consumer and importer of coal and any genuine attempt to remove coal from the world’s energy mix by 2050 will require massive commitment from Beijing. While the Chinese government has a policy of limiting the use of coal and of boosting the use of renewables and natural gas, it’s well within the realms of wishful thinking to imagine the world’s second-largest economy is on track to abandon the use of coal by 2050. According to the Global Coal Plant Tracker, China currently has 957 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power operating - more than four times India’s 219 GW. The positive news for both China and India, the world’s second-biggest coal importer, is that the pipeline of coal-fired plant construction has been consistently shrinking and retirements of older units has been accelerating. But given that once built, coal-fired plants generally operate for at least 30 years, it would be imperative that virtually all construction is halted now, and no new plants commissioned. In reality, China currently has 126 GW of coal-fired power in construction and 76 GW either announced, in pre-permit phase or with permits already in place. India has 39 GW being built and 63 GW in the approval process. There are also new coal plants being built or planned in numerous other Asian countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. What the IPCC report may do is accelerate pressure on those countries to re-think their power generation plans, especially if renewables can be shown to be as cheap and as reliable. It’s also likely that any technological advances in energy in the next decades will not be in favour of coal, given that vast sums are being invested in renewables and comparatively little in CCS or other coal-friendly technologies. The IPCC report highlights that coal now has its back very much against the wall, but equally that the real power for change lies in Beijing. Natural gas also tends to get off lightly in much of the media reporting about climate change, especially given the obvious target of coal. But like silent flatulence in an elevator, eventually natural gas will be unable to avoid the attention that is making life so difficult for the coal industry.

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Science shows that nothing does more to cause climate change than burning coal, a former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Tuesday, a position in contrast to President Donald Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies. Trump announced last year that the United States would quit a 2015 global climate pact, citing concerns for the U.S. economy and touting fossil-fuel energy anew but alarming nearly 200 signatories to the accord including close U.S. allies. On Monday, a U.N. report said that even limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), below the 2 degree target agreed in Paris, would entail rapid and unprecedented changes across every aspect of society or the world risks even more extreme weather and loss of species.  Without real change, the world is not even on course to reach the 2C target, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, the main scientific guide for governments on how to implement the Paris Agreement. “We have big challenges ahead of us and I think that is what the (report) has told us...a low-carbon future is better. From a climate perspective, nothing is worse than burning coal,” former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy told a Financial Times climate finance summit in London. “I would like to see climate change presented as what science is telling us rather than a political statement, which is what many in the U.S. are positioning it as,” she added, referring to the Trump administration. Under the Paris Agreement rules, the United States cannot actually pull out of the pact until late 2020. “The U.S. is pretty much on target to reach its (climate) targets at least in the short-term - the market is driving this,” said McCarthy, who ran the EPA under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama from 2013-2017. “Markets drive change more quickly than regulation. Governments are not going to be the ones which make it run as fast as it needs to.” But Trump aims to roll back many environmental rules put in place by Obama, such as acting to replace a clean power plant policy with weaker environmental rules for such plants. The U.S. government also intends to freeze mandates that ensure new cars pollute less and cut limits on the greenhouse gas methane that is released during oil production. McCarthy said such moves, however, do not necessarily translate into action. “The announcements and proposals made by the new administration have not been finalised, they are not based on science and the law, and that is not exactly a winning formula when you go to the courts,” she said.  “There is a long process behind all of this and eventually they will end up in the courts for a long period of time. Those rules were solidly done and based on science and the law, and it will take a lot to do undo them.”   The IPCC report will be a talking point at the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December.

2018-10-09,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China has choked back on imports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States, traders and analysts said, turning to the Middle East for extra supplies amid the two countries’ trade dispute. China bought nearly 3.6 million tonnes of U.S. LPG in 2017, making the United States the country’s second-largest supplier of the fuel used in petrochemicals, as well as for cooking, transport and heating.  However, U.S. imports have come off dramatically over the course of 2018, before stalling completely in late August when China imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on over 300 U.S. goods, including LPG, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Consultancy IHS Markit estimates U.S. imports fell to barely 1 million tonnes during the first eight months of 2018, down from about 2.1 million tonnes for the same period last year, said He Yanyu, Executive Director for Natural Gas Liquids. (GRAPHIC: China LPG imports from top suppliers - tmsnrt.rs/2ynjtSn) The fall came as Chinese buyers wound back U.S. purchases of LPG amid uncertainty about the impact of buying product from the United States, said a trader who tracks the fuel.  No U.S. LPG cargoes have landed in China since tariffs were imposed in late August, said Ong Han Wee at consultancy FGE. “China has stopped shipping in U.S. LPG cargoes as they are now too expensive,” added a second trader who tracks LPG cargoes. The United States last year accounted for about 20 percent of China’s total LPG imports, which are currently running at about $1 billion a month, based on Thomson Reuters calculation.  The U.S. gap is being filled largely by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, analysts said. The change comes as prices for the fuel, often a mix of propane and butane, spike in line with higher oil prices. State-owned Saudi Aramco, whose contract prices are used as benchmarks in Asia, fixed its propane and butane contract prices for October at $655 a tonne, the highest since 2014.   U.S. prices are also rising. The propane price at the Texan Mont Belvieu hub hit its highest since 2014 on Sept. 28 at around 108 cents per gallon before easing to around 104 cents on Oct. 9.  (GRAPHIC: LPG prices on the rise in line with crude oil - tmsnrt.rs/2ynl3nh) This works out to about $542 a tonne, based on Reuters calculations, but is above the Saudi Aramco price after taking into account freight and terminal charges and the additional 25 percent tariff. China’s LPG imports rose about 15 percent to nearly 18.3 million tonnes in 2017, driven partly by new petrochemicals plants which use the propane dehydrogenation method to produce the raw material for plastics..

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has granted BP (BP.L) and Serica Energy (SQZ.L) a new licence to run a North Sea gas field partly owned by Iran in a rare exemption by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration as it prepares to renew sanctions on Tehran next month. The waiver extension will allow Serica to complete the acquisition of BP’s stake in the Rhum, Bruce and Keith fields, as well as buying Total’s (TOTF.PA) stakes in Bruce and Keith, Serica said in a statement. Rhum, which supplies around 5 percent of Britain’s gas demand, is half owned by Iranian Oil Company, a subsidiary of the national oil company.  The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control extended a licence for U.S. and U.S.-owned or controlled entities to provide goods, services and support the Rhum field. Renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which will take full effect on Nov. 4, ban U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with Iranian companies as well as transactions in dollars. The new licence is conditional on the setting up of an escrow account that will hold all profits from the field for as long as the sanctions are in place, Serica said.  A similar mechanism was set in place in the previous round of U.S. sanctions on Iran. The new licence is valid until October 31, 2019 and may be renewed upon application, Serica said.

2018-10-09,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia is looking into converting two of the country’s older crude oil refineries into plants for producing biofuels, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday. The government is conducting a study with Italian energy company ENI, which has successfully converted one of its refineries to the production of biofuels, Rini Soemarno, the minister overseeing state-controlled companies, told reporters on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Bali. The move is part of a drive to reduce energy imports as the government tries to narrow the country’s current account gap amid emerging market volatility that has dragged the rupiah currency to its weakest in over 20 years. ENI is conducting a study on state energy company Pertamina’s Plaju and Dumai refineries, which were built around the 1930s, according to Soemarno. “We have been planning to modernise those refineries, but we found out that they could be turned (into biofuel plants) - most likely these two will be converted,” Soemarno said. According to Pertamina’s website, the Plaju plant has an oil refining capacity of 133,700 barrels per day (bpd), with Dumai at 170,000 bpd. Indonesia’s biodiesel drive also aims to absorb the country’s rising crude palm oil output amid sluggish global demand. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of the commodity. Starting in September, Indonesia enforced a mandatory use of B20 fuel, which has 20 percent bio-content mix, for all diesel machines in the country, including train locomotives and heavy equipment.

The Pakistani rupee plunged about 5 percent in an apparent devaluation by the central bank, market participants said. The IMF added to the malaise by cutting forecasts of global growth for both this year and next, including downgrades to the outlook for the United States, China and Europe. “Risk sentiment is in a foul mood and stocks are sinking everywhere,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. “With Chinese economic momentum continuing to weaken alongside increasing pressure from the United States, currency weakness is the obvious release valve,” they warned. “A lurch through the 7.0 level by year end is possible.” China’s central bank fixed its yuan at 6.9019 per dollar on Tuesday, so breaching the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9120 in the spot market. The drop should be a positive for exporters and did help Shanghai blue chips edge up 0.3 percent. Yet that follows a 4.3 percent slide on Monday which was the largest daily drop since early 2016. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan went flat after ending Monday at its lowest point since May last year. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.3 percent, hurt in part by a rise in the safe-harbour yen. On Monday, a senior U.S. Treasury official expressed concern at the fall in the yuan, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with any Chinese officials this week. On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen for the third straight day on Monday and growth stocks were pressured by worries rising bond yields might ultimately hobble the economy. The S&P 500 lost 0.04 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.67 percent, while the Dow rose 0.15 percent as defensive stocks found buyers. Yields on 10-year Treasury paper notched a new seven-year top on Tuesday at 3.252 percent. Treasuries have had a sort of safety net up to now as rising yields tend to dampen stocks and threaten the economic outlook, thus putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to go slow on policy tightening. Yet recently the Fed has sounded so bullish on the economy and so hawkish on rates that the net has become frayed. “The size and speed of the bearish bond impulse would suggest a collective shift in market thinking about the US growth prospects and policy projections,” said Damien McColough, Westpac’s head of rates strategy. “The Fed’s expected 2019 profile has moved from just below 2 hikes to 2.5 hikes being factored-in.” That shift has underpinned the dollar against a basket of currencies where it stood at 95.677, from a low of 93.814 just a couple of weeks ago. The dollar had less luck on the safe-haven yen pulling back to 113.07 from a 114.54 peak last week. The euro was undermined by political troubles in Italy and loitered at $1.1496, well off September’s $1.1815 top. Italy’s borrowing costs have surged as a war of words between Rome and the European Union over the country’s budget plans escalated. The yield on Italian government 10-year bonds rose more than 20 basis points to 3.626 percent, the highest since February 2014, while Italy’s FTSE MIB stock index fell to its weakest since April 2017. Brazil’s real currency hit a two-month high and stocks jumped after market-preferred presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro’s strong first-round win on Sunday. In commodity markets, gold got a modest safety bid at $1,191.10, having fallen 1.4 percent overnight. Oil prices rose on Tuesday as more evidence emerged that crude exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, are declining in the run-up to the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions and as a hurricane moved across the Gulf of Mexico. Brent crude added 50 cents to $84.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude firmed 41 cents to $74.70.

The IMF added to the malaise by cutting forecasts of global growth for both this year and next, including downgrades to the outlook for the United States, China and Europe. “Risk sentiment is in a foul mood and stocks are sinking everywhere,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. “With Chinese economic momentum continuing to weaken alongside increasing pressure from the U.S., currency weakness is the obvious release valve,” they warned. “A lurch through the 7.0 level by year end is possible.” China’s central bank on Tuesday fixed its yuan at 6.9019 per dollar, so breaching the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9320 in the spot market. The drop should be a positive for exporters and did help Shanghai blue chips briefly edge up 0.1 percent in early trade before trading almost flat. Yet that follows a 4.3 percent slide on Monday which was the largest daily drop since early 2016. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased another 0.2 percent after ending Monday at its lowest point since May last year. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2 percent, hurt in part by a rise in the safe-harbour yen.
