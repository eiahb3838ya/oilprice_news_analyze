2018-04-01,"NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - FirstEnergy Corp said late on Saturday its nuclear and coal power plant units filed for bankruptcy court protection as the company looks to restructure, sell assets and win government support to cope with competitors using lower-cost natural gas. The Chapter 11 filing was made by FirstEnergy Solutions and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Co. The companies said they have over $550 million in cash and “sufficient liquidity to continue normal operations” while restructuring. The company’s chief executive signaled earlier this year that FirstEnergy Solutions was headed for bankruptcy protection. . The legal move came after FirstEnergy urged the federal government on Thursday to evoke little-used emergency powers to help it keep several struggling nuclear and coal-fired power plants open, a move critics described as an appeal for a corporate bailout. On Wednesday, Ohio-based FirstEnergy said it would shut several nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania in the next three years without some kind of state or federal relief. In November 2017 the company had said it would exit the competitive, non-regulated power generation business. The units in bankruptcy operate three nuclear power plants, two coal-fired plants, one gas-and-oil plant and one pet-coke plant. FirstEnergy has sought government relief by calling on U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to use the emergency powers to order PJM Interconnection, the regional power grid operator, to negotiate a contract that would compensate owners of coal and nuclear plants for providing reliable power and jobs. Coal and nuclear power plant operators have struggled in recent years because of low natural gas prices delivered by the shale boom. “The Chapter 11 filing represents our best path forward as we continue to pursue opportunities for restructuring, asset sales and legislative and regulatory relief,” Donald Schneider, president of FirstEnergy Solutions, said in announcing the filing.

2018-04-01,"HANOI (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday China and Vietnam should settle their disputes in the South China Sea through talks and move to jointly exploit its waters. “We have agreed that settling the maritime issues is extremely important for the healthy and sustainable development of bilateral relations,” he told reporters after a meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Pham Binh Minh in Hanoi. China claims 90 percent of the potentially energy-rich maritime territory and has been building on and militarising  rocky outcrops and reefs in its waters. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it, through which about $5 trillion (£3.6 trillion) of trade passes each year. Vietnam is the country most openly at odds with China over the issue. “The two sides should better manage disputes through talks and refrain from taking unilateral actions that may further complicate and expand the disputes,” Wang said. “At the same time, (the two sides) should promote cooperation at the sea, including holding talks on joint exploitation.” Wang and Minh said bilateral relations had seen positive development, with rising trade and investment as the two neighbours further opened up markets to each other. Bilateral trade exceeded $100 billion last year. Minh said Vietnam and China shared responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the region, reiterating Vietnam’s stance that the maritime disputes must be resolved peacefully manner and according to international law.

The new tight oil and deep gas resource is expected to contain many times the amount of oil produced by Bahrain’s existing oilfields, as well as large amounts of gas, BNA reported. The oil discovery is the kingdom’s largest since 1932, BNA said. It did not give any details on the oil reserves discovered. “Initial analysis demonstrates the find is at substantial levels, capable of supporting the long-term extraction of tight oil and deep gas,” Bahrain’s Minister of Oil, Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al-Khalifa said in a statement.

2018-04-01,"* Higher foreign ownership limits to lift Qatar stocks’ EM weights * Second day of modest profit-taking in Saudi after FTSE decision * Jabal Omar drops after swinging to big annual loss * Kingdom Holding rises after proposing unchanged dividend * Kuwait divides market into three segments By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, April 1 (Reuters) - Qatar’s stock market climbed on Sunday because of plans to raise foreign ownership limits for four more major companies, while the Saudi Arabian bourse fell for a second straight day after FTSE Russell’s decision to upgrade it to emerging market status. The Qatari index rose 1.1 percent after Qatar Petroleum said foreign investors would be able to hold up to 49 percent of its affiliates Qatar Fuel, Gulf International Services, Mesaieed Petrochemical and Qatar Electricity and Water Co. Mesaieed jumped 9.9 percent, Qatar Fuel gained 7.1 percent, Gulf International Services was up 6.3 percent and Qatar Electricity and Water was up 1.2 percent. Actual foreign ownership levels in those companies aren’t close to the current ceilings, but higher ceilings would likely boost the stocks’ weightings in emerging market indexes. The Saudi index shed 0.9 percent because of moderate profit-taking, after surging in the run-up to FTSE’s decision. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) slipped 0.2 percent and Al Rajhi Bank fell 1.2 percent. Dubai’s Al Mal Capital said of investors’ response to the FTSE decision: “The muted market reaction suggests that retail investors were positioned for it and were in no rush to add exposure. “At 17.5 times trailing twelve-month earnings, the overall market valuation is not cheap and at a small premium to its historical average,” Al Mal said, adding that it was hard to justify some current Saudi valuations, such as SABIC trading at 19 times earnings. However, Al Mal and other fund managers noted that the FTSE decision was long-term positive for Saudi Arabia, and with the planned listing of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, could give it roughly as much weight in global portfolios as mainstream emerging markets such as India and Brazil. Exchange data released after the close showed all types of foreign investors bought a net $301 million of Saudi stocks last week, the third highest total on record. Real estate developer Jabal Omar dropped 2.9 percent after reporting it swung to an annual net loss of 601 million riyals ($160.2 million); it cited weak revenue from sales of residential units due to delays in obtaining marketing permits, and higher administrative and general expenses. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s investment firm Kingdom Holding gained 2.6 percent after the company proposed a cash dividend of 0.50 riyal per share for 2017, the same as in previous years, a fresh sign that the company’s operations have not so far been seriously impacted by his detention in Saudi Arabia’s corruption probe. Prince Alwaleed was freed in January and has insisted he is innocent of any wrongdoing, though Saudi officials said he signed an undisclosed settlement. The Dubai index closed up 0.9 percent, rebounding from losses in recent weeks as funds flowed to Saudi Arabia in anticipation of its upgrade. Deyaar Development was the most heavily traded stock, rising 1.7 percent as it continued to rebound after hitting a 10-month low last week. In Kuwait, the market was divided into three segments on Sunday as part of reforms designed by the exchange to boost liquidity and attract more foreign money: the premier market, the main market and the auction market. The index of the premier market, home to the largest and most liquid companies, fell 1.1 percent. * The index fell 0.9 percent down to 7,801 points. * The index gained 0.9 percent to 3,136 points. * The index shed 0.04 percent to 4,584 points. * The index rose 1.1 percent to 8,669 points. * The index gained 0.8 percent to 17,596 points. * The index fell 1.1 percent to 4,946 points. * The index lost 1.2 percent to 1,303 points. * The index shed 0.8 percent to 4,737 points.

2018-04-01,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to issue tenders to consolidate consultancy services for government infrastructure projects in the coming months in a bid to improve efficiency and bring fresh momentum to stalled developments, government sources said. The kingdom plans to hire a consultancy at each ministry or state entity to supervise its pipeline of projects worth billions of dollars, according to one draft request for proposal (RFP) seen by Reuters. Currently some entities and ministries like housing, health, power and municipalities use multiple consultants per project. Local and international consultants do project design and execution, while government entities and ministries monitor.     The new plan aims to outsource these services for five years during which the winning bidders will train Saudis so government bodies ultimately have the capability to manage such work themselves. It also aims to trim waste in state spending, combat corruption and help revive a slump in the construction industry at a critical time for the economy as Saudi Arabia embarks on an ambitious economic transformation plan that includes development of major projects such as the $500 billion NEOM business zone in the northwest of the country.

2018-04-01,"(Adds context) BAGHDAD, April 1 (Reuters) - Iraq plans to award oil and gas exploration and development contracts in 11 new blocks on April 15, oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said on Sunday. Iraq had initially set June 21 as the date to open the bids for the new blocks, located in border areas with Iran and Kuwait, and in offshore Gulf waters. Bidding documents will be made available to oil companies planning to make offers on April 13, Jihad told Reuters. The offers will have to be submitted on April 15 and the winners will be announced the same day, he added. The oil ministry announced on Thursday measures to reduce the fees received by the oil companies from the government in the new contracts. The new contracts will exclude oil by-products from the companies’ revenues, establish a linkage between prevailing oil prices and their remuneration, and introduce a royalty element. Oil producers in Iraq currently receive a fee from the government linked to production increases, which include crude and oil by-products such as liquefied petroleum gas and dry gas. OPEC’s second largest producer, after Saudi Arabia, Iraq decided to change the contracts after a glut caused oil prices to crash in 2014, reducing Baghdad’s ability to pay the fees. Companies including BP, Exxon Mobil, Eni , Total and Royal Dutch Shell helped Iraq grow its production in the past decade by over 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to about 4.7 million bpd. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government produces oil and gas from fields under its control in northern Iraq under a production sharing model more profitable to companies. The new contracts offered by Baghdad will also set a time limit for companies to end gas flaring from oil fields they develop on territory under its control. Iraq continues to flare some of the gas extracted alongside crude oil at its fields because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel for local consumption or exports. Iraq hopes to end gas flaring by 2021, which costs nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue for the government and would be sufficient to meet most of its unmet needs for gas‐based power generation, according to the World Bank.
