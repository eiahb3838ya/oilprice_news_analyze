2018-09-09,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has completed a facility to build advanced centrifuges, Iran’s nuclear chief was quoted on Sunday as saying, as Tehran prepares to increase its uranium-enrichment capacity if the nuclear deal collapses after the United States exits.  In June, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said the facility at the Natanz nuclear plant would be completed within a month. Salehi’s statement in June came days after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he had ordered preparations to increase the country’s uranium enrichment capacity if the nuclear agreement with world powers collapsed. On Sunday, the official news agency IRNA quoted Salehi as saying: “(Ayatollah Khamenei) had ordered us to set up and complete a very advanced hall for the construction of modern centrifuges, and this hall has now been fully equipped and set up.”  Salehi said Iran’s announced plans to build nuclear reactors for ships, while staying within the limits set by its atomic deal with major powers, was “advancing well but would take 10 to 15 years to complete”, IRNA said. “A third step (in reaction to the U.S. withdrawal) might be to suspend some of the limitations within the nuclear agreement, for example on the volume and level of enrichment,” Salehi said, according to IRNA. “And the final scenario can be a complete exit from the nuclear accord, which I hope will never happen, with the help of (remaining signatories), because everyone would suffer,” Salehi added. Iranian officials have said they would decide whether to quit the 2015 nuclear deal after studying a planned European package of economic measures that could help offset U.S. sanctions.

2018-09-09,"* Local institutions shore up prices in Saudi market * Blue-chip SABIC up 1.7 percent * Dubai gains 0.6 percent * TAQA soars in Abu Dhabi By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Gulf stock markets closed on a positive note on Sunday, reversing some of their losses earlier in the day. The Saudi index in particular ended up gaining 0.6 percent, after having plunged last week on foreign investors’ concerns over emerging markets volatility. The country’s main stock index fell below major technical support for the first time this year last week. Sunday’s pick up was mostly due to local institutions, rather than local retail investors or foreign buyers, said Talal Samhouri, head of asset management at investment company Amwal. “Local institutions are trying to shore up prices given last week’s decline,” he said. Gains were across the board, with Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Co registering the highest trading volume and gaining 0.3 percent, followed by Alina Bank, up 0.6 percent. Blue-chip Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) climbed 1.7 percent, following a steadying in oil prices at the end of last week, when Brent crude futures settled up 33 cents at $76.83 a barrel. Shares in Saudi Arabia’s Nada Chemicals dropped 0.5 percent after the company said it would halt production at some of its units for periods of about seven or 15 days for scheduled maintenance. Most other markets closed in positive territory. The Dubai index gained 0.6 percent, with Islamic Arab Insurance Co among the best performing stocks, up 4.4 percent. The company surged 10 percent last week after direct deals or block trades were executed on the stock on 370.7 million worth of shares at 0.42 dirhams. In Abu Dhabi, the recent announcement of a potential three-way merger between Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Union National Bank and the unlisted Al Hilal Bank continued to act as a catalyst for investors. The exchange, which closed flat on Sunday, saw Abu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA) jump 6.2 percent, followed by another blue-chip, Aldar Properties, which gained 2.6 percent. * The index closed up 0.5 percent to 7,729 points. * The index rose 0.6 percent to 2,843 points. * The index was flat at 4,918 points. * The index shed 0.6 percent to 9,770 points. * The index gained 0.4 percent to 5,325 points. * The index climbed 0.3 percent to 1,344 points. * The index increased 0.5 percent to 4,454 points. * The index shed 0.4 percent to 15,750 points.

2018-09-09,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A United Nations climate change meeting in Bangkok made good progress on drafting a ‘rule book’ for the implementation of the 2015 Paris accord before a summit in Poland this December, a top U.N. official said on Sunday, the last day of the talks. The Paris agreement, which was adopted by almost 200 nations and is due to come into force in 2020, set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century. “We made good progress, but we cannot sit back, we need to continue to speed up and deepen the conversation,” Patricia Espinosa, who leads the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which steers the talks, told a news conference in the Thai capital. The negotiated text lays down the groundwork for a summit in Katowice from Dec. 2-14 at which governments will meet to agree rules on implementing the accord. The UNFCCC earlier this week agreed to add an extra day to the December talks to allow more work to be done.   “We need a streamlined draft that will assist us in Poland,” Philip S. Weech, a delegate from the Group of 77 and China, told fellow negotiators earlier in the day. Espinosa would discuss some fundamental issues with G7 environment ministers next week, she said.  Negotiations, however still needed to “achieve full clarity in climate finance,” Espinosa said, referring to a $100 billion fund to help developing countries tackle climate change, describing funding as a “politically sensitive” issue. Critics say that developed countries remained uncommitted over finance.   “The U.S. is a major culprit in taking finance off the table,” Lidy Nacpil, coordinator at non-governmental organization the Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development, told reporters. U.S. President Donald Trump, who in the past has described climate change as a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favored other countries and was disadvantageous to the United States.
