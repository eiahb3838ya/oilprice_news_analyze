2018-11-06,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Four out of six endangered black rhinos that were relocated to Chad from South Africa have died, possibly of starvation, the two countries and an NGO said. The six rhinos were transferred from South Africa in May, re-introducing the species into Chad for the first time since it died out in 1972, mostly owing to rampant poaching. Chad reported that two of them had died last month.  “Low fat reserves suggest that maladaptation by the rhinos to their new environment is the likely underlying cause,” said the two nations and conservation group African Parks, which oversaw moving the rhinos to Chad’s Zakouma National Park.  “The remaining two animals are being recaptured and placed in holding facilities in order to facilitate closer management.”  Two decades ago, poaching had driven black rhinos to near extinction across their vast habitat in southern, eastern and central Africa. Their numbers fell by 98 percent between 1960 and 1998, but they have doubled since then to about 5,400 as conservation efforts grew. None of the four that died in Zakouma had been poached. Tests were being run to establish the exact cause of death. The relocation of the rhinos from South Africa was intended to help safeguard the long-term future of the species by spreading it out into more places. However, a similar attempt to move black rhinos in Kenya also ended with animals dying. Eleven rhinos were moved into Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park from other parks in June, but 10 of them died, apparently from drinking salty water. The 11th was attacked by a lion and died from his wounds.

2018-11-06,"(Adds CEO comments from interview, share activity) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Nutrien Ltd, the world’s biggest crop nutrient producer by capacity, is looking at expanding several nitrogen fertilizer plants in North America due to rising prices, Chief Executive Chuck Magro said on Tuesday. Nitrogen prices have climbed as China’s shutdown of coal-fired plants and rising European costs of natural gas, a key ingredient in fertilizer production, have curbed capacity outside North America. “Nutrien is looking at several brownfields in our network, primarily in North America, but it’s too early to talk specifically about that,” Magro said on a quarterly conference call, using the industry term for expanding existing plants. Magro said prices are not high enough to justify building new plants and that high North American labor costs add risk. In an interview, Magro added that some plant expansions may be “very minor,” and serve to adjust the mix of nitrogen products produced. He said opportunities to acquire nitrogen plants from other companies are “fully priced,” and don’t represent ways to create value. Nitrogen is the most widely used fertilizer to accelerate growth of crops such as corn. Prices look to remain high around $300 per tonne at the Port of New Orleans through early 2019, RBC analyst Andrew Wong said in a note on Monday. Prices are also likely to increase in 2019 for certain crop protection products that are imported from China, due to a 10 percent U.S. tariff applied to Chinese products, said Mike Frank, president of Nutrien’s retail business. Nutrien reported late on Monday a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast, driven by strong demand for its potash fertilizer. Shares jumped on Tuesday by nearly 5 percent in Toronto to C$74.84. The company said it would permanently close its idled potash mine in the Canadian province of New Brunswick and take a $1.8 billion impairment charge. Magro said Nutrien expects to close the sale of its stake in Chilean lithium producer SQM by year-end, and use some of the $5 billion in total proceeds from selling shares in several companies to expand farm retail networks in the United States and Brazil.

2018-11-06,"* India’s oil imports from Iran surge 34 pct in April-Oct * Most refiners front-loading purchases before new US sanctions * India’s waiver against US sanctions still carries restrictions * Already signs that Indian demand is dropping off By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Nov 6 (Reuters) - India’s oil imports from Iran in 2018-19 could be higher than the previous year despite the imposition of U.S. sanctions, a Reuters analysis of industry data shows, forcing the government to rein in purchases in coming months. India’s oil imports from Iran jumped by about 34 percent in April-October from a year earlier, totalling 603,000 bpd or 17.7 million tonnes, tanker arrival data showed. The sharp increase was due to front-loading of purchases by Indian refiners ahead of renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which came into effect on Monday. By choking Iran’s oil and shipping industries, Washington aims to try to force Tehran to quash its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile programme as well as its support for militant proxies in the Middle East. The United States granted exemptions to India, China and six other countries, allowing them to temporarily continue buying Iranian oil, but those waiver carry conditions. For India, Iran’s No. 2 oil customer, the 180-day waiver allows refiners to buy only up to 1.25 million tonnes a month, or about 300,000 bpd. That means India will have to slash its monthly purchases from Iran by about half to comply with the waiver. Analysts still expect that India’s purchases of Iranian crude in the full fiscal year ending in March 2019 will exceed the 452,000 bpd, or 22.6 million tonnes, that it imported in the previous year, according to government data. But there have been some signs of a drop-off in demand. In October, India imported about 466,000 bpd of Iranian oil, according to preliminary tanker arrival data obtained from sources, a decline of 11.6 percent from September and marginally down from October last year. Most India refiners boosted purchases from Iran ahead of the U.S. sanctions as Iran was offering almost free shipping and extended credit periods, according to oil analysts. Refiners also wanted to offset the impact of rising global oil prices and a weak Indian rupee. “Indian refiners imported a lot from Iran in the first half of the fiscal year mainly due to the discount offered by Iran,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil for consultants FGE in Singapore. She said New Delhi could even ask refiners to cut imports below the waiver level to curry favour with Washington. Last year India’s imports fell as refiners had curtailed Iranian oil purchases due to a dispute with Tehran over development rights to a giant gas field. State-run Indian refiners that control about 60 percent of the country’s capacity had contracted to buy 396,000 bpd of Iranian oil in the current fiscal year. But with new U.S. sanctions in place, they will now have to tell Iran that they cannot fulfil those agreements.

2018-11-06,"Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S. energy regulators gave Williams Cos Inc two more years until December 2020 to get the approvals needed to build its long-delayed Constitution natural gas pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York, according to a federal filing made available on Tuesday. Before it can start building the project, Williams still needs water quality certification. New York state denied the permit in 2016, saying the company failed to provide sufficient information to determine whether the project would comply with state water standards. Williams sued in federal court, arguing that New York waived its authority to decide on the certification by failing to act within a reasonable period of time. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to review the appeals court judgment that upheld the state’s decision. The company has filed a new federal lawsuit. This is the second two-year extension for the pipeline, which has been bogged down in regulatory and legal battles since FERC approved construction in December 2014. The company and the utilities that sell gas to fuel power plants and heat homes favor the line, which is opposed by environmental groups, local landowners and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who argue that the state should rely more on energy efficiency and renewables. If built, the 125-mile (201-km) pipeline would transport 0.65 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of shale gas. When Williams proposed Constitution in 2013, it estimated the project would cost about $683 million and enter service in 2016. Delays, however, have boosted that estimate to as high as $875 million, according to upstate New York newspapers. Williams has said it would take about 10 to 12 months to build the pipeline after it receives the necessary approvals. Constitution is owned by subsidiaries of Williams, Cabot Oil & Gas, Duke Energy and AltaGas Ltd. In addition to Williams’ court appeal, there is another possible path to get Constitution built. Some federal officials, including U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have said the federal government could overturn state decisions that block pipelines for national security reasons. U.S. President Donald Trump “is unlikely to see much progress on his policy goals from a divided Congress. We expect his administration will re-focus on regulatory issues, like Constitution, to eke out wins ahead of his 2020 re-election campaign,” analysts at Height Capital Markets said in a note.

2018-11-06,"GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday it had so far been able to sell as much oil as it needs despite U.S. pressure, but it urged European countries opposed to U.S. sanctions to do more to shield Iran, as Russia and Turkey also voiced their objections. The United States on Monday restored sanctions targeting Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors and threatened more action to stop what Washington called its “outlaw” policies - steps that Tehran called economic warfare and vowed to defy. The measures are part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to curb Tehran’s missile and nuclear programmes and diminish the Islamic Republic’s influence in the Middle East, notably its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Trump is targeting Iran’s main source of revenue - its oil exports - as well as its financial sector, essentially making 50 Iranian banks and their subsidiaries off-limits to foreign banks, on pain of losing access to the U.S. financial system. “The Americans constantly said they would reduce the sale of Iran’s oil to zero but I have to say that, so far, we have been able to sell our required amounts of oil,” Tasnim news agency quoted Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri as saying. “The Americans, with the help of propaganda, don’t see the realities.” Industry estimates suggest Iran’s oil exports have in fact fallen by 40-60 percent since Trump said in May that he would reimpose sanctions, but 180-day exemptions for Iran’s biggest oil clients could mean they rise again after November. President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Turkey, one of those countries, would not abide by the sanctions, which he said were “aimed at unbalancing the world”. Jahangiri said he had spoken to a handful of managers from companies on the U.S. sanctions list, and that some had already formulated plans on how to deal with the measures. However, Iran’s oil minister wrote to OPEC’s secretary general calling for two committees that monitor an output deal with non-OPEC countries to be scrapped, accusing them of siding with the United States.  The head of Iran’s central bank, Abdolnasser Hemmati, said Iranian banks should use their previous experience dealing with sanctions to support the foreign trade process and financial transfers”, according to the state news agency, IRNA. The European Union, France, Germany, Britain and Russia, participants with the United States in the 2015 deal that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, have all objected to the reimposition of sanctions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Madrid that Washington had used “unacceptable methods” to force the SWIFT global financial network to cut off Iranian banks, and that there would be still ways to cooperate economically with Iran. The EU is seeking to launch a “special purpose vehicle” (SPV) to sidestep the U.S. financial system by using an EU intermediary to handle trade with Iran. Major European firms including France’s Total, Germany’s Allianz and Siemens, Denmark’s shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk and France’s PSA Group have already halted or wound down their activities in Iran to avoid U.S. sanctions.  Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Kazem Sajjadpour said in a speech at the Chatham House think tank in London that the SPV was “an interesting procedure, but what is lacking is speed and efficiency”. He said European small and medium-sized businesses were still active in Iran “without making any noise”, and that European governments were trying to help them to keep operating. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that Trump would eventually come to respect Iran: “President Trump’s predecessors also began crafting their Iran policy with similar bravado; but came around to accepting and respecting the reality of Iran as they became more experienced in office.” Graphics: History of Iranian oil tmsnrt.rs/2CUMBnT Iranian crude exports since 1980 tmsnrt.rs/2CRTM0h Iranian oil exports since 2016 tmsnrt.rs/2PMqQgS Imports of countries with waivers tmsnrt.rs/2RBDfS5 Reporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh, Bozorgmehr Sharafedin and Polina Devitt; Editing by Dale Hudson and Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-iran-sanctions/update-3-iran-says-it-is-selling-the-oil-it-needs-to-despite-u-s-pressure-idUKL8N1XH2HW,06 Nov 2018,"* U.S. restored sanctions on Iranian oil and finance on

2018-11-06,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq plans to increase its oil output and export capacity in 2019, with a focus on its southern oilfields, and is close to reaching a deal with international companies, Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said on Tuesday. The new minister also said the shortfall in oil supply caused by new U.S. sanctions on Iran had yet to be gauged before Iraq and other OPEC members could decide what action to take ahead of their policy meeting next month. Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, is targeting production capacity of 5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, with average exports expected to reach around 3.8 million bpd.  Iraq currently pumps around 4.6 million bpd, second only to Saudi Arabia in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The bulk of Iraq’s oil is exported via its southern terminals, which account for more than 95 percent of state revenue. Upgrading capacity, especially in the south, “is a top priority,” Ghadhban told Reuters in his first interview since taking over at the ministry last month. “We have had talks with international companies which lasted for a while, but now we are about to reach a deal and will settle this issue soon,” he said. In the coming years, Iraq plans to boost export capacity to 8.5 million bpd after upgrading its infrastructure, Ghadhban said.  This would include 6.5 million bpd from southern oilfields, with 1 million bpd to become available after a new pipeline from the northern city of Kirkuk to Turkey’s Ceyhan port on the Mediterranean is built. The country is trying to recover from years of violence, including a war with Islamic State militants, that wrecked infrastructure. Baghdad is also seeking to reduce corruption and manage rivalries with the Kurdish authorities who run oil-rich areas in the north. Ghadhban, who replaced Jabar al-Luaibi as minister, is also looking to diversify Iraq’s export outlets through new pipelines. One of Iraq’s immediate challenges will be to gauge the shortfall in global oil supply caused by sanctions Washington reimposed on Iran’s oil sector on Monday. Ghadhban said Iraq wanted to see the “actual decrease” before Baghdad and other OPEC members decide how to deal with a reduction in Iranian shipments. “What will be the physical increase in demand on Iraqi oil ... if there’s no demand, how can I say we’ll compensate?” Ghadhban did not specify what oil price he expected for 2019. He said a price above $70 per barrel was “fair” and that the higher the price, the better it was for Iraq. “I compare it with previous prices ... when we talk about prices above 70 ... I say it’s a fair price, it’s not 30 or 50 and it’s not 100. “In principle, the higher the price, the better for Iraq. But we’re not working alone .. we’re a member of OPEC. We see the interests of consumers and we want to be a viable producer and exporter,” Ghadhban said. Washington’s sanctions target Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors and it has threatened more action to stop what it calls “outlaw” policies - steps that Tehran called economic warfare and vowed to defy. A U.S. official confirmed Iraq had been granted a waiver to import some Iranian products. Iraqi officials said last week Baghdad would still be allowed to import crucial gas and energy supplies for its power stations as well as food items. In a tumultuous region, Iraq hopes to have more avenues for export. The Oil Ministry received bids from three foreign contractors to build a giant water treatment facility vital for the OPEC member to grow its oil production capacity, Ghadhban said. He said he expected work to begin in early 2019 and that the cost of the project was several billion dollars. An additional 1 million bpd of export capacity would be added from a pipeline that eventually connects the southern city of Basra with Jordan’s Red Sea port of Aqaba, he said, adding that building new pipelines aims to “diversify our export outlets”. A final deal is expected to be reached with energy company BP to boost output from oilfields around Kirkuk, Ghadhban said. “I have met their representative (BP) yesterday and I hope very soon we reach an arrangement ... it’s one of the priorities,” he said.

2018-11-06,"* NNPC spent at least $5.8 bln curbing fuel shortage * Senate says taking funds was unauthorised * Probe could delay decision on LNG expansion plan (Adds NLNG expansion plans) By Camillus Eboh ABUJA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Senate voted on Tuesday to investigate the alleged withdrawal of $1.05 billion by Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) from Nigeria LNG (NLNG), a venture owned by the state oil firm and foreign energy companies. Nigeria’s Premium Times newspaper reported on Monday that NNPC had used the portion of NLNG earnings that should have been passed to local and federal state authorities to fund the state oil firm’s fuel purchases and subsidies during a shortage in late 2017 and early 2018. NLNG, which produces liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export, is owned by NNPC and foreign energy firms Royal Dutch Shell , Total and ENI. A Shell spokeswoman declined to comment. Officials from NNPC, NLNG, ENI and Total were not immediately available to comment. The probe could undermine plans by the partners in NLNG to decide by the end of December on a major expansion. New LNG production facilities are expected to benefit from a tightening global market. The Premium Times report said NNPC was not authorised to withdraw the $1.05 billion from NLNG that was meant to be shared between federal, state and local governments. The Senate held a debate on Tuesday and voted to investigate the allegations, saying the money was not allocated to NNPC in the 2018 budget and so any spending by the state company of the cash was unauthorised. Senator Bassey Akpan, who brought the motion to investigate, said he was “bringing the attention of the senate to various emails and complaints from the general public on the unauthorised withdrawal of $1.05 billion by NNPC from the NLNG account.” The fuel shortage at the end of last year and early this year left people queuing for hours at filling stations and saw NNPC spend at least $5.8 billion on fuel imports. NLNG operates six LNG processing units, known as trains, on Bonny Island that produced 20 million tonnes of LNG last year. NLNG’s partners have promised a final investment decision on a seventh train by the end of this year, which could now be in doubt, although a front-end-engineering design (FEED) was awarded to Italy’s Saipem, Japan’s Chiyoda Corp and Korea’s Daewoo E&C in July.

2018-11-06,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) almost tripled third-quarter net profit to 142 billion roubles (1.6 billion pounds), as higher crude output and prices outweighed impairments on downstream operations. The state-controlled company took a 133 billion rouble charge on refining and distribution operations. Russian fuel prices have lagged a surge in crude oil prices, and companies have also been forced by the government to cap politically sensitive retail fuel prices. Despite the big profit jump from the same period last year, Rosneft fell just short of analysts’ expectations. Their average forecast in a Reuters poll was 147 billion roubles. Rosneft, which includes BP (BP.L) and Qatar among its shareholders, accounts for about 40 percent of Russia’s oil output and is key to Moscow’s efforts to forge closer ties with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The company increased daily oil production in the third quarter by 3.4 percent year on year. A company official told a conference call that Rosneft planned to raise its liquid hydrocarbon production further next year, to 241 million tonnes, or 4.8-4.9 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 4.73 million bpd in the third quarter. The company also said it expected capital expenditure to rise by 20-25 percent in 2019 from around 900 billion roubles seen this year, due to the development of new upstream projects. Rosneft’s shares were 5 percent higher in afternoon trade.  Headed by Igor Sechin, a long-standing ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Rosneft has been pursuing acquisitions at home and abroad, amassing huge debts.  In May, it announced a plan to cut debt and trading liabilities by a minimum of 500 billion roubles this year, partly by selling non-core assets. The company did not disclose its latest net debt figure, but analysts at Moscow brokerage BCS put it at $71.7 billion, down about 8 percent from the previous quarter. After the introduction of sanctions that shut the company out of Western capital markets, Rosneft switched to prepayment deals with international traders such as Trafigura. The company said it was owed $3.1 billion by Venezuela as of Sept. 30, down from $3.6 billion on June 30. It also said it owed $26.8 billion to traders under prepayment deals for its oil as of Sept. 30, down from $29.3 billion at June 30.

2018-11-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas prices have jumped to their highest in nine months as forecast cold weather across much of the country has reminded traders of the risks posed by low gas inventories going into winter. Gas stocks have fallen well below the five-year range since the summer and are now at the lowest level for the time of year since 2003, according to data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Until the past few days, traders appeared unconcerned about low inventories because output is growing rapidly and the development of El Nino over the Pacific should lead to a warm winter over the northern part of the country. But the much colder than normal temperatures forecast across much of the United States in the next fortnight are a reminder that El Niño is not the only influence on weather and heating demand. Even if the coming winter proves warmer than average, there is still scope for extensive and extended cold periods that could put further pressure on gas stocks. Natural gas futures prices for gas delivered in December have jumped to almost $3.57 per million British thermal units from just $3.19 on Oct. 30 and just $3.00 on Sept. 28. Higher gas prices will encourage owners of gas-fired power generators to run them for fewer hours in the next few weeks to conserve scarce gas stocks, while coal-fired power plants are likely to run more. Working gas stocks in underground storage were reported at 3,143 billion cubic feet on Oct. 26, some 17 percent lower than the 3,766 bcf at the same point last year (“Weekly natural gas storage report”, EIA, Nov. 1). Heating demand has been running close to or slightly below the long-term seasonal average so far during the current heating season which started on July 1. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2D6UVBd) But the forecasts for much colder than normal weather over the next two weeks will push cumulative heating demand far above the seasonal norm. Almost the entire United States, except California and southern Florida, as well as Alaska and Hawaii, will experience colder than normal temperatures in the middle of November. Colder than normal temperatures are expected to persist over much of the country through at least the next two weeks, according to the U.S. government’s Climate Prediction Center. The sudden cold contrasts with a warmer than normal outlook for much of the country especially across the northern states and Midwest over a one-month and three-month horizon. The seasonal outlook is dominated by the background El Niño conditions, but does not mean there cannot be intense cold spells which will stretch gas inventories. Many hedge fund managers have been buying futures and options linked to natural gas prices on the assumption that cold spells would force prices at least temporarily higher. Hedge funds and other money managers were net buyers of derivatives equivalent to almost 1,500 bcf of natural gas in three weeks over late September and early October. By Oct. 16, fund managers held more than five bullish long positions for every bearish short one, the most lopsided positioning for more than eight years. The last three weeks have seen some small long liquidation and even smaller-scale short selling, according to regulatory data, but the hedge fund community is still very bullish. Natural gas futures for December compared with April delivery, which were already in a small backwardation of around 26 cents per million British thermal units in late September, have surged to a premium of 84 cents. The remainder of the heating season is likely to see more such spikes as spot prices and calendar spreads rise to limit power burn during cold snaps and eke out the relatively low level of inventories.

2018-11-06,"(Adds context, details) MOSCOW, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions on Iran were not legitimate, in Moscow’s first official comment since Washington restored sanctions on Tehran. Lavrov said Moscow, itself a target of separate U.S. sanctions, expected there would be ways to pursue economic cooperation with Iran despite the reimposition of sanctions on Monday on the country’s oil, banking and transport sectors. Speaking in Madrid, Lavrov said Washington had used “unacceptable methods” to pressure operators of the SWIFT global financial network into cutting off Iranian banks. Russia and its European partners were looking for ways to maintain economic ties with Tehran, he said after meeting his Spanish counterpart Josep Borrell, but provided no details.

2018-11-06,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rosneft wants its Western oil buyers to accept new terms and pay penalties from 2019 if they fail to pay for supplies in the event that new U.S. sanctions on the Russian energy major disrupt its oil sales, according to trading sources and Rosneft’s draft contracts. The buyers - including some of the world’s biggest oil companies and traders such as BP (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Total (TOTF.PA), Vitol and Gunvor - are fiercely opposing the move, according to trading sources. The stand-off is likely to force Rosneft to soften its demands, the sources said, adding that the development shows the extent to which the state-owned oil giant is concerned about widening U.S. sanctions on Russia. “It is all very uncertain with the sanctions and Rosneft is clearly worried and is trying to minimize possible risks,” said a trading source with a European major. “We said no, we couldn’t accept this,” he added. Rosneft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request comment. BP and Gunvor declined Reuters requests for comment. Shell, Total, Vitol did not respond to Reuters inquiries. Russia has been under U.S. and EU sanctions since 2014 when it invaded Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. The sanctions have been repeatedly widened to include new companies and sectors, making it tough for Russian oil firms to borrow money abroad, raise new capital or develop Arctic and unconventional deposits. President Vladimir Putin’s administration has been hoping for a thaw in relations with the United States since President Donald Trump came to power but Washington has imposed new sanctions instead, including on some of Russia’s richest people. Russian businesses are preparing for a new wave of sanctions expected in the coming days and months. The firms are trying to diversify away from dollar payments and tapping Asia for more of their financing and technology needs. Rosneft is run by a close ally of Putin, Igor Sechin.  He and his company have been under sectoral sanctions since 2014. Rosneft has so far avoided being put on the Special Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which would make it impossible for major Western companies to have dealings with it. When Washington put Russia’s aluminum giant Rusal on the SDN list earlier this year, the move brought its metals exports to a near standstill and disrupted its access to raw materials from suppliers around the world. A Rosneft tender document seen by Reuters showed the company had asked its oil buyers to accept a new clause in its 2019 annual tender to sell oil products. “No sanctions ... shall terminate or amend any obligations of the parties stated by the contract,” the document said. It also said that if a buyer walks away from the contract because of sanctions, it must compensate Rosneft with a payment that could either be a fixed amount or a sum calculated on the basis of the contract terms. Currently Rosneft has relatively mild sanction clauses,  which say that none of the parties has an obligation to abide by the contract if sanctions are imposed and no penalty is levied. Rosneft is the world’s largest listed oil firm with oil and gas output at around 5 million barrels per day. It produces over 4 percent of global oil - on par with Iran - and counts all the global oil majors among its buyers. The buyers have insisted on sticking with the old clauses, according to five trading sources. Rosneft has so far said that it could not guarantee to consider buyers’ bids at tenders as valid unless they accept the new terms. Rosneft will award its annual oil products supply tenders on Dec. 5, according to the tender documents, giving the companies more time to negotiate.

2018-11-06,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq is in talks with international companies to help upgrade its oil production and export capacities and an agreement is to be reached soon, Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said on Tuesday. “This is a top priority. We have talks with international companies which lasted for a while but now we are about to reach a deal and we will settle this issue soon,” Ghadhban told Reuters. He said Iraq was targeting a production capacity of 5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 and its export average was expected to reach around 3.8 million bpd. Iraq also plans to boost export capacity, after upgrading its energy infrastructures, to 8.5 million bpd in the “coming years”, Ghadhban said. This upgraded export capacity would include 6.5 million bpd from the southern oilfields, with 1 million bpd to be available after completing construction of a new Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline. Iraq’s Oil Ministry received bids from three foreign contractors to build a giant water treatment facility vital for the OPEC member to grow its oil production capacity, Ghadhban said. He said he expected work to begin in early 2019 and that the cost of the project was several billion dollars.  An additional 1 million bpd of export capacity would be added from a pipeline that eventually will connect the southern city of Basra with Jordan’s Red Sea port of Aqaba, he said, and that building new pipelines aims to “diversify our export outlets”. A final deal is expected to be reached with BP (BP.L) to boost output from oilfields around the northern city of Kirkuk, Ghadhban said. “I have met their representative (BP) yesterday and I hope very soon we reach an arrangement ... it’s one of the priorities,” he said.

2018-11-06,"(Adds details, background) By Ahmed Rasheed and John Davison BAGHDAD, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Iraq’s Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said on Tuesday that the shortfall in oil supply caused by new U.S. sanctions on Iran had yet to be gauged ahead of an OPEC meeting next month. Ghadhban said Iraq wanted to see the “actual decrease” before Baghdad and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decide how to deal with a reduction in Iranian shipments. “I want to wait and see how much is the actual physical decrease in Iranian exports, and whether this would be compensated by not only OPEC producers but by other countries,” he told Reuters in his first interview since taking over the oil portfolio last month. “What will be the physical increase in demand on Iraqi oil ... if there’s no demand, how can I say we’ll compensate?” Ghadhban did not specify what oil price he expected for 2019. He said a price above $70 per barrel was “fair” and that the higher the price, the better it was for Iraq. “I compare it with previous prices ... when we talk about prices above 70 ... I say it’s a fair price, it’s not 30 or 50 and it’s not 100. “In principle, the higher the price, the better for Iraq. But we’re not working alone .. we’re a member of OPEC. We see the interests of consumers and we want to be a viable producer and exporter,” Ghadhban said. The United States on Monday restored sanctions targeting Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors and threatened more action to stop what Washington called its “outlaw” policies - steps that Tehran called economic warfare and vowed to defy. A U.S. official confirmed Iraq had been granted a waiver to import some Iranian products. Iraqi officials said last week Baghdad would still be allowed to import crucial gas and energy supplies for its power stations as well as food items.

2018-11-06,"NEW DELHI, Nov 6 (Reuters) - India aims to sign an initial agreement with Iran this month to settle all their oil trade in rupees through India’s UCO Bank, two Indian government sources said. “We have to do some paper work. It should be signed as early as possible. We are aiming for this month,” one of the sources said. India, which got a waiver from the latest tougher U.S. sanctions against Tehran on Monday, used a similar mechanism in the previous round of sanctions but settled only 45 percent of the payments in rupees. Iran used the funds to import goods from India, a move that had helped boost India’s exports to Tehran. Paying for Iranian oil in rupees will also strengthen the Indian currency against the U.S. dollar. Indian refiners will make payments in rupees for purchases of Iranian oil made since September, one of the sources said. Iran grants a 60 day credit period to Indian refiners. The sources also said the U.S. wants India to restrict its monthly purchases of Iranian oil to 1.25 million tonnes, or 9 million barrels, during the waiver period from November. The United States re-imposed sanctions on Monday to choke Iran’s oil and shipping industries, while temporarily allowing top customers such as China and India to keep buying crude from the Islamic Republic. India’s oil ministry was not immediately available to comment. Indian Oil Corp, India’s top refiner, and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd placed an order on Tuesday with National Iranian Oil Co to buy a total of 9 million barrels of oil in December, industry sources said. IOC would buy 6 million barrels of Iranian oil, while MRPL would import 3 million barrels, the sources added. Spokesmen for MRPL and IOC declined to comment.

2018-11-06,"* Asian shares mixed; China and techs weaker, Nikkei rises * European shares dip as investors pounce on poor earnings * Wall St futures subdued after modest gain on Monday * Apple concerns drags down tech sector * Investors expect a split Congress, Democrats to take House * Dollar barely budges * Oil drops on Iran sanction exemptions; WTI near 7-month low By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - European shares sagged and the dollar and bond markets barely budged on Tuesday, as traders braced for midterm elections in the United States and potentially lively sessions ahead. Japan and Hong Kong had helped Asia overcome another Chinese wobble, but Europe was in the 0.4 percent red as investors pounced on corporate earnings misses and pre-market caution dragged down Wall Street futures. The elections mark the first major test of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax cuts and hostile trade policies. Polls point to his Republican party losing control of the House of Representatives which could curb some of his policymaking power. With so much at stake, currency market moves were extremely tight. The dollar hardly moved against the euro, lost ground to Brexit-bound sterling but made some back against the yen as dealers kept their options open. “It is definitely not the time to buy the dip,” said London & Capital’s Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner, referring to U.S. and globally-focused stock markets and risk assets. “Everything that could go well for U.S. consumers in the last couple of years has gone well, but now the tide is turning... At the moment you are running out of drivers of growth in the U.S.” There was plenty for investors to digest from Europe too. Italian and Spanish stocks and bonds weakened as updated PMI figures confirmed euro zone business growth had fallen to a two-year low last month against the backdrop of trade tensions. The future output index caused even more concern as it fell to a near four-year low. “Euro zone companies reported a disappointing start to the fourth quarter,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the data. Italian politics also played on the nerves too after euro zone finance ministers had called on Rome to change its budget at a meeting late on Monday. With Italy unlikely to bow to the demands any time soon, it pointed to a further escalation in the damaging feud and pushed Italian borrowing costs up 5-7 basis points on the day. “Twenty-five countries have entered into the excessive deficit procedure and no-one has ever got a fine, so my gut feeling is that they (Italy) won’t get one, just a slap on the wrist,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, strategist at Rabobank. The uncertainty over the U.S. midterms for U.S. stocks futures was understandable. The S&P 500 has risen 28 percent since Trump’s election in November, 2016, which is more than under any other president in the past 64 years. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan had edged up 0.4 percent overnight following a positive finish for Wall Street on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei also climbed 1.1 percent, although weaker Chinese markets and regional technology shares capped the region. Apple suppliers such as Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry were hit by a report that Apple had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR. The report had also driven Apple shares 2.8 percent lower in U.S. trade. While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump’s pro-business agenda and raise concerns about U.S. political instability, some analysts say this may have already been priced in by investors. The Cboe Skew index, also known as the “black swan” index, hovered not far from its 2-1/2-year low hit on Friday, indicating demand for options that provide protection remains tepid. A higher skew typically indicates investors are buying more protection on heightened anxiety. “Unlike the U.S. Presidential election or the U.K.’s Brexit referendum, the upcoming U.S. (midterm) elections are not a binary event,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. “So it’s unlikely to send stocks significantly in one direction, apart from initial quick reactions.” Safe-haven gold was little changed but in oil markets crude prices were down near multi-month lows after the United States allowed eight countries to continue buying oil from Iran temporarily, easing the likelihood of a sharp supply drop. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 0.5 percent to $62.80 a barrel, after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday. Brent crude futures dropped 0.6 percent to $72.74 a barrel, near Friday’s 2-1/2-month low of $72.16. Both oil benchmarks have slid more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October.

2018-11-06,"* Tullow sees Kenya crude shipments next year * Company’s Guyana drilling plans fast-forwarded to mid 2019 By Ed Stoddard CAPE TOWN, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Africa-focused Tullow Oil expects the first crude shipments from its Kenyan oilfields in the first half of 2019 and is pricing the product for the market, the company’s chief executive said on Tuesday. Paul McDade also told Reuters that Tullow, which has expanded beyond Africa to the coast of Guyana, was bringing forward its drilling plans for the South American country and was looking to drill at least two wells there in the middle of 2019. In Kenya, one of Africa’s newest oil plays where Tullow is already trucking crude, the next phase is getting ready to roll. “We will have a shipment of Kenyan crude ready to go probably in the first or second quarter of next year. We will market that and it allows the refiners to see the crude and try the crude so that helps the marketing process,” McDade told Reuters on the sidelines of the Africa Oil Week conference. The price for crude from Kenya and neighbouring Uganda has not yet been fixed. The product is light crude but is waxy, a drawback as it needs to be heated for transport to stay liquid. But its extremely low sulphur content is a plus. A 0.5 percent sulphur limit will be imposed on marine fuels from 2020 by the International Maritime Organization, down from 3.5 percent, to help protect the ocean environment. “It is as close as you can get to zero sulphur which is quite unusual. That will give it a premium,” McDade said. He would not be drawn on what he thought its price ultimately would be in relation to the Brent benchmark. Tullow also has a planned pipeline project in Kenya and its CEO said tenders would go out for that probably in the first half of next year. Some of the contractors Tullow has spoken to have said they can get their own financing. “That is a novelty, it’s not the conventional way to go,” McDade said. Meanwhile, in Guyana, Tullow has accelerated drilling plans in its concessions. “We had originally thought we would drill some of those wells late next year but we have now accelerated and will probably drill at least two wells in our block around the middle of the year,” McDade said.

2018-11-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, with U.S. crude futures hitting an eight-month low, a day after Washington granted sanction waivers to top buyers of Iranian oil and as Iran said it has so far been able to sell as much oil as it needs to. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $1.04 to settle at $72.13 a barrel, down 1.42 percent. The global benchmark hit a session low of $71.18 a barrel, the lowest price since Aug. 16. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 89 cents, or 1.41 percent, to settle at $62.21 a barrel. The session low was $61.31 a barrel, the weakest price since March 16. Iran said it has so far been able to sell as much oil as it needs and urged European countries opposed to U.S. sanctions to do more to shield Iran. The United States on Monday restored sanctions targeting Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors and threatened more action. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Washington aimed to bring Iranian oil exports to zero, but 180-day exemptions were granted to eight importers: China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey. This group takes as much as three-quarters of Iran’s seaborne oil exports, trade data shows, meaning the Islamic Republic will still be allowed to export some oil for now. Industry estimates suggest Iran’s oil exports have fallen 40 to 60 percent since Trump said in May he would reimpose sanctions. However, exemptions could allow exports to rise again after November. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the country, a top importer of Iranian oil, would not abide by the sanctions, which he said were aimed at “unbalancing the world.” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates said that the sanctions alone will not drive up oil prices. “While the Iranian sanctions should still be viewed as a latent bullish consideration capable of limiting much additional price slippage, it would appear that the Iranian factor alone will not be capable of spurring higher prices without major assistance from a renewed strengthening in the equities, sustainable weakening in the U.S. dollar or a significant cut back in OPEC production,” Ritterbusch said in a note. Concerns about oil demand weighed on prices. The trade dispute between the United States and China threatens growth in the world’s two biggest economies, and currency weakness is pressuring economies in Asia. On the supply side, U.S. crude oil production is expected to average 12.06 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, passing the 12 million bpd milestone sooner than expected on surging domestic shale output, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday. U.S. crude stocks rose by 7.8 million barrels in the week ending Nov. 2 to 432 million, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday. Analysts had expected an increase of 2.4 million barrels. Output is rising from the world’s top three producers. Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia combined produced more than 33 million bpd for the first time in October, enough to meet more than a third of the world’s consumption of almost 100 million bpd. Top crude exporter Saudi Arabia has cut the December price for its Arab Light grade for Asian customers. Hedge fund managers were net sellers of petroleum-linked futures and options last week.  Morgan Stanley on Tuesday lowered its price forecast for Brent, saying the global benchmark will stay at $77.5 per barrel to mid-2019.

2018-11-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shares rose on Tuesday while the dollar held steady as Americans went to the polls in elections that could shift the balance of power in Congress. Treasury yields rose modestly as more supply came to market and spurred selling. Traders also awaited clues about the Federal Reserve’s potential interest rate increases when policymakers meet on Wednesday and Thursday.  Treasury supply has been growing to fund a widening federal budget deficit, the result of the massive tax cut enacted in December and a spending agreement reached in February. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.12 percent. The congressional elections mark the first major test of President Donald Trump’s polarizing personality and hardline policies on taxes, trade and immigration.

Politics weighed on Italian stocks, and oil prices fell as investors digested exemptions to the newly restored U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil.[.N] The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.26 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 173.31 points, or 0.68 percent, to 25,635.01, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 17.14 points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,755.45 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 47.11 points, or 0.64 percent, to 7,375.96. “With the Democrats favourites to take control of the House and the Republicans the Senate, the next couple of years may be far more difficult for Trump,” said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at Oanda in London. “When you consider how markets have done since his election victory – granted, primarily on the back of tax reforms – it’s easy to see why this may not be the most investor-friendly result.” The benchmark S&P 500 index has climbed 28 percent since Trump’s election in November 2016, more than under any other president in comparable periods in the past 64 years. With so much at stake, currency market moves were tight. The dollar hardly moved against the euro EUR= and gained some ground against the Japanese yen JPY=. Sterling GBP=D3 reversed earlier losses in volatile trading on growing hopes of a Brexit deal breakthrough after a British Cabinet meeting. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was flat, with the euro EUR= up 0.09 percent to $1.1416. The yen weakened 0.23 percent versus the greenback at 113.47 per dollar. Italian shares .FTMIB were essentially flat, despite frayed nerves in Italy after euro zone finance ministers called on Rome to change its budget to conform with European Union rules at a meeting late on Monday. Oil prices sank, with U.S. crude futures sliding to an eight-month low, as Iran said it had so far been able to sell as much oil as it needed to after Washington granted sanction waivers to top buyers of Iranian oil. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 1.46 percent to $62.18 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $72.07, down 1.5 percent on the day. “The details on the Iran sanctions waivers are trickling out, and it appears much more Iranian oil will remain on the market in the near-term than previously thought,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.

2018-11-06,"(Reuters) - Devon Energy Corp’s (DVN.N) quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates on Tuesday, as the oil producer benefited from higher crude prices and produced more crude in the United States. U.S. production averaged 418,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day (boe/d) in the quarter, exceeding the company’s third-quarter outlook of 398,000 to 417,000 boe/d. Devon leads a pack of oil producers, who have been investing heavily, in Oklahoma-based shale producing areas of SCOOP and STACK to boost production. However, overall the company produced 522,000 boe/d in the quarter compared with 527,000 boe/d a year ago.  The company’s net income attributable to shareholders rose to $2.54 billion, or $5.14 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $193 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier, as the oil producer gained from the sale of its stakes in pipeline operator EnLink Midstream.  In June, Devon Energy said it would sell its stakes in EnLink Midstream for $3.13 billion to pare debt and focus on its core shale business. Total revenue rose to $2.58 billion from $1.93 billion.

2018-11-06,"* European shares dip as investors pounce on poor earnings * Caution on U.S. election holds dollar, yields steady * Investors expect a split Congress, Democrats to take House * Oil drops on Iran sanction exemptions (Adds settled oil prices; updates throughout) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Stock markets edged up on Tuesday, with trading thin in the United States, while the dollar and Treasury yields held steady as Americans went to the polls in pivotal midterm elections that could shift the balance of power in Congress. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.12 percent. The elections mark the first major test of President Donald Trump’s polarizing personality and hardline policies on taxes, trade and immigration. If his Republican party loses control of the House of Representatives or the Senate, Democrats would be able to put the brakes on his agenda. Opinion polls show Democrats have a good chance of winning a majority in the House. “Unlike the U.S. presidential election or the UK’s Brexit referendum, the upcoming U.S. elections are not a binary event,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. “So it’s unlikely to send stocks significantly in one direction, apart from initial quick reactions.” European shares slipped on disappointing corporate earnings and caution ahead of the U.S. election results. Politics weighed on Italian stocks, and oil prices fell as investors digested exemptions to the newly restored U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.26 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 84.43 points, or 0.33 percent, to 25,546.13, the S&P 500 gained 4 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,742.31, and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.44 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,334.30. “With the Democrats favorites to take control of the House and the Republicans the Senate, the next couple of years may be far more difficult for Trump,” said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at Oanda in London. “When you consider how markets have done since his election victory – granted, primarily on the back of tax reforms – it’s easy to see why this may not be the most investor-friendly result.” The benchmark S&P 500 index has climbed 28 percent since Trump’s election in November 2016, more than under any other president in comparable periods in the past 64 years. With so much at stake, currency market moves were tight. The dollar hardly moved against the euro and gained some ground against the yen. Sterling erased earlier losses in volatile trading on growing hopes of a Brexit deal breakthrough after a British Cabinet meeting. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.02 percent, with the euro up 0.05 percent to $1.1412. The Japanese yen weakened 0.19 percent versus the greenback at 113.42 per dollar. Italian shares were essentially flat, despite frayed nerves in Italy after euro zone finance ministers called on Rome to change its budget to conform with European Union rules at a meeting late on Monday. Oil prices sank, with U.S. crude futures sliding to a seven-month low, as Iran said it has so far been able to sell as much oil as it needs to after Washington granted sanction waivers to top buyers of Iranian oil. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $62.21 per barrel, down 89 cents, or 1.41 percent. Brent crude futures settled at $72.13, down $1.04 or 1.42 percent. “The details on the Iran sanctions waivers are trickling out, and it appears much more Iranian oil will remain on the market in the near-term than previously thought,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Both oil benchmarks have slid more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October. Reporting by Hilary Russ in Nw York

2018-11-06,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI) played down talk it was interested in buying Colombian distributor Electricaribe after citing acquisitions as one of the reasons for raising its 2018 debt guidance on Tuesday. Enel CFO Alberto De Paoli told analysts the utility had paid a fee to look at the books of Electricaribe but said this made sense for a power company operating in the area. “A lot of things have to happen before we have a clear interest in it,” he said, adding that many regulatory and legal changes would first need to take place. Recent press reports have said that Enel could be interested in buying Electricaribe. Europe’s biggest utility is one of the leading players in Latin America, where it makes more than a quarter of its core earnings. It agreed in June to spend almost $1.5 billion (£1.1 billion) to buy a majority stake in Brazilian power company Eletropaulo (ELPL3.SA) and also said it could spend more than $2.3 billion to buy a Latin American fibre company. On Thursday it said its acquisition of Eletropaulo and restructuring costs in Chile had helped to bump up its debt pile at the end of September to about 43 billion euros (£37.4 billion). It said it now expected net debt this year to be between 41 billion and 42 billion euros, about 1 billion to 2 billion euros higher its previous forecast. But the group, one of the world’s biggest listed green energy companies, said it expects higher cash flow this year and reiterated core earnings guidance of 16.2 billion euros. De Paoli said the group was working on another deal to sell assets but was not sure if it could be closed before year end.  Enel, which also controls Spanish utility Endesa (ELE.MC), said core earnings (EBITDA) in the first nine months of the year rose 6.2 percent to 12 billion euros, boosted by its green energy business and better margins in Brazil after the Eletropaulo acquisition. “Renewables were once again the basis for the group’s positive performance while geographic diversification was important to cope with the negative trend in certain currencies,” CEO Francesco Starace said.

2018-11-06,"(Adds Turkish presidential spokesman, paragraphs 6-7) By Gulsen Solaker ANKARA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday Turkey would not abide by the renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil and shipping industries as they were aimed at “unbalancing the world”. Washington reimposed the sanctions on Monday, ditching a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme. The U.S. measures temporarily allow some major customers, including Turkey, to continue buying Iranian crude. But Erdogan condemned the sanctions. “These are steps aimed at unbalancing the world. We don’t want to live in an imperialist world. These issues will be put on the table at the summit (this weekend) in Paris,” he told reporters. “We will absolutely not abide by such sanctions. We buy 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas. We cannot freeze our people in the cold.” NATO member Turkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighbouring Iran has been one of its main suppliers of oil because of its proximity, the quality of its crude and favourable price differentials. In an interview, Erdogan’s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, mentioned a temporary waiver period of six months and said Turkey would evaluate developments during this time when holding talks following the end of their exemption. “We are not going to abandon our interests because the United States is imposing sanctions on this or that country for whatever reason,” Kalin said. “We will evaluate the six-month period, but we will not compromise our principles at the table,” he told broadcaster Haberturk late on Tuesday. Speaking in Japan earlier on Tuesday, Turkey’s foreign minister said it would be dangerous to isolate Iran and it was not easy for countries like Turkey and Japan to diversify energy supplies. “We do not believe any result can be reached with sanctions. I think meaningful dialogue and talks are more useful than sanctions,” Mevlut Cavusoglu said. U.S. President Donald Trump aims to hit Iran’s economy and force it to abandon not only its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile programme but also its support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. Erdogan will attend a summit to commemorate the end of World War One in Paris over the weekend, where he is expected to have talks with Trump over issues including the renewed sanctions and policy in Syria.

2018-11-06,"(Adds quotes) By Eric Knecht DOHA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Qatar’s ruler said on Tuesday that a political and economic boycott of his country by larger neighbours had weakened a Gulf Arab bloc at a time of regional instability, but he voiced hope the crisis would pass. Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani outlined Qatar’s economic achievements over the past year despite sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia and four Arab states since June 2017, saying the tiny but wealthy country would preserve its status as the world’s top liquefied natural gas exporter. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut transport and trade ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their foe Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty. “History teaches us that crises pass, but if they are handled badly then this may leave traces which last for a long time,” Sheikh Tamim said in a speech to the country’s consultative Shoura council. “It is very regrettable that the continuation of the Gulf crisis exposed the failure of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)...which has weakened its ability to face challenges and threats and marginalised its role in the region,” he said. The United States, an ally of the six-nation GCC, has tried to mediate in the dispute which it sees as a risk to efforts to contain Iran. Qatar is home to a U.S. air base.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.4 percent on a positive lead from Wall Street, but the gains were capped by falls in Chinese markets and regional technology shares. Japan’s Nikkei average climbed 1.1 percent. The Shanghai Composite and blue-chip CSI 300 eased 0.2 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. Both mainland benchmarks were able to claw back some of their earlier losses, however, on news that China’s leadership was open to dialogue with the United States to resolve trade disputes.. Shares in Asia-Pacific suppliers of Apple Inc, such as Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, fell after a report in the Nikkei newspaper that Apple had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR. The report drove Apple shares 2.8 percent lower in U.S. trade. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.56 percent, with financials such as Berkshire Hathaway supported by strong earnings. Taking the lead from U.S. and Asian peers, European futures pointed to a higher openings, with financial spreadbetters showing London’s FTSE, Frankfurt’s DAX, and Paris’s CAC expected to rise between 0.2 and 0.4 percent. Ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. midterm elections, investors generally expect opposition Democrats to take over the House of Representatives while Trump’s Republican Party is tipped to retain the Senate. While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump’s pro-business agenda and raise concerns about political instability, some analysts say such an outcome may have already been priced in by investors. The Cboe Skew index, also known as the “black swan” index, hovered not far from its 2-1/2-year low hit Friday, indicating demand for options that provide protection remains tepid. A higher skew typically indicates investors are buying more protection on heightened anxiety. “Unlike the U.S. Presidential election or the U.K.’s Brexit referendum, the upcoming U.S. (midterm) elections are not a binary event. So it’s unlikely to send stocks significantly in one direction, apart from initial quick reactions,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. “So with this one, I don’t think there is much need to hedge against the black swan risk.” If the Republicans retain their House majority, global stocks are likely to rally on hopes of more tax cuts. Trump said last month his administration planned to produce a resolution calling for a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income households. “Everyone still remembers strong equity rallies after Trump was elected two years ago. So initially stock markets will gain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “But further tax cuts would boost already large fiscal deficits and push the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield above its October high almost instantly. Given rises in U.S. bond yields triggered a correction in equities last month, any rally in stocks is unlikely to last long,” he added. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 3.201 percent , maintaining most of its gains following Friday’s strong U.S. jobs and wage data and staying not far from its 7 1/2-year peak of 3.261 percent hit on Oct. 9. “Global equities have recovered after their fall in February, which was triggered by a rise in U.S. yields. But this time a recovery will likely be capped because now markets do not have the support they had back in February from tame inflation and the economic boost from Trump’s tax cuts,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro-economic strategy at HSBC in Tokyo. Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on trade, regardless of the outcome of the elections. “The impact of trade war will start to appear in U.S. economic data in coming months,” Shirota added. In oil markets, crude prices wobbled near multi-month lows after the United States allowed eight countries to temporarily continue buying oil from Iran, addressing supply concerns as Washington formally imposed punitive sanctions on the Islamic republic. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.89 a barrel, after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday. Brent crude futures dropped 0.6 percent to $72.74 a barrel, near Friday’s 2-1/2-month low of $72.16. Both oil benchmarks have slid more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October. Moves in major currencies were modest ahead of the U.S. election. The dollar rose 0.2 percent against the yen to 113.44 yen, its highest level in four weeks.

The regulator was tasked by parliament with setting a cap after a committee of lawmakers called Britain’s energy market “broken”. Prime Minister Theresa May said the energy tariffs were a “rip-off”. The cap, set at 1,137 pounds ($1,487) per year for a dual fuel bill, is in line with an indicative level announced in September. It will give 11 million customers cheaper prices and save British households a total of around 1 billion pounds a year, Ofgem said. A typical customer on the most expensive tariff could save up to 120 pounds a year, Ofgem said. The level of the cap will be updated in April and October each year to reflect the latest costs for suppliers such as wholesale energy prices and policy costs.

2018-11-06,"* Major importers scaled back Iran orders pre-sanctions * Washington grants Iran’s biggest buyers sanction waivers * Japan says will start ordering Iran oil again * Exemptions to last for 180 days * Iran oil exports: tmsnrt.rs/2PMqQgS By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Iran’s oil exports have fallen sharply since U.S. President Donald Trump said at mid-year he would re-impose sanctions on Tehran, but with waivers in hand, the Middle Eastern nation’s major buyers could scale up orders as soon as next month. The original aim of the sanctions was to cut Iran’s oil exports as much as possible, to quash its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and curb its support for militant proxies, particularly in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. But the exemptions granted to Iran’s biggest oil clients - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - which allow them to import at least some oil for another 180 days, could mean the exports start to rise after November. This group of eight buyers takes as much as three-quarters of Iran’s seaborne oil exports, trade data shows. “The decision by the U.S. (to grant waivers) represents a departure, for now, from the stated aim of reducing Iran’s oil exports to zero,” said Pat Thaker, regional director for the Middle East and Africa at The Economist Intelligence Unit. As a result of pre-sanctions pressure by Washington, Iran’s oil exports in November may not exceed 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), according to industry estimates, making them as little as a third of a mid-2018 peak. “U.S. sanctions are expected to bring Iranian crude exports down to 1.1 million bpd in November,” according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. Japan’s trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, though, has already said on Tuesday that Japanese buyers of Iranian oil are expected to resume imports from the Islamic republic after the country was granted a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Japan and South Korea, both close U.S. allies, had toed the Washington sanctions line and stopped buying crude from Iran. India, Iran’s second-biggest oil customer, also cut orders ahead of the sanctions, hoping its effort to reduce reliance on Tehran would pay off in Washington and win it a waiver once the sanctions re-started. Even China, locked in a bitter trade war with the United States, bowed to pressure from Washington and dialled back imports. Trading sources said several Asian oil importers are already looking to increase their orders for Iranian oil soon. “Enquiries for cargoes from Iran are ... coming in from several Asian buyers,” said one merchant trader, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk about his firm’s commercial activity. The wide-ranging exemptions have cut fears of a supply shortage, taking pressure off companies, governments and economies around the world that have struggled with the surging cost for fuel. U.S. President Trump, facing crucial midterm elections that may cost Republicans control of the U.S. Congress, said on Monday he wants to impose sanctions on Iran’s oil gradually, citing concerns about shocking markets and causing global price spikes. That has helped to take the sting out of the sanctions threat, which helped to lift international benchmark Brent crude futures to four-year highs of almost $87 a barrel in early October. Brent prices are now about 15 percent lower than that peak and have barely budged over the last two sessions. Now it will be key to watch “what happens after the exemptions expire in 180 days,” the merchant trader said. Iran’s oil exports rose sharply after the previous round of sanctions were lifted in early 2016. Including condensate, an ultra-light form of crude, shipments peaked around 3 million bpd in mid-2018, according to trade data in Refinitiv Eikon.

2018-11-06,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and natural gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp on Monday beat third-quarter profit estimates on the back of a surge in production from the Permian Basin and higher oil prices. U.S. shale oil production from the Permian has nearly doubled in the last three years, while Brent crude touched a four-year high in September. Occidental said average worldwide realized crude oil prices rose 36 percent to $62.67 per barrel in the third quarter. The company, which has been investing heavily to boost production in the Permian, said output from its Permian Resources unit surged about 62 percent to 225,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Occidental’s average production rose about 13.5 percent to 681,000 boe/d. However, the company lowered the top end of its full-year forecast for total output to between 655,000 boe/d and 659,000 boe/d, from 650,000 boe/d and 664,000 boe/d. Sales in Occidental’s chemical division rose 10.6 percent to $1.19 billion, helped by demand for caustic soda. The division, the company’s second biggest, makes plastics used in pipes and siding. The Houston-based company's net income surged to $1.87 billion, or $2.44 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $190 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2qutMkh) In the latest quarter, the company had an after-tax gain on the sale of midstream assets of about $700 million. Excluding one-time items, Occidental earned $1.77 per share topping analysts’ estimates of $1.54 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares of the company rose about 1 percent in after-hours trading. The company will hold a conference call with investors to discuss the results on Tuesday.

The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2P8LQ1S By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers were net sellers of petroleum-linked futures and options for a fifth week running last week as concerns about sanctions on Iran evaporated and investors refocused on economic worries. The net long position in the six most important petroleum-linked futures and options contracts was cut by a further 73 million barrels in the week to Oct. 30. Portfolio managers have been net sellers of 371 million barrels since the end of September, taking their net long position to the lowest level for 15 months, according to records published by regulators and exchanges. The sharpest sell-offs last week were in Brent (-54 million barrels) and U.S. gasoline (-11 million) with smaller reductions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-2 million), U.S. heating oil (-4 million) and European gasoil (-2 million). Position changes are no longer confined to long liquidation. Fund managers have started to establish short positions betting on further price falls (tmsnrt.rs/2P8LQ1S). Short positions across all six contracts have doubled over the past five weeks to 192 million barrels, the highest level for more than 10 months. Fund managers still favour bullish long positions over bearish short ones by a ratio of almost 5:1, but the ratio has sunk from more than 12:1 only five weeks ago. The hedge fund community’s bullish bias is the lowest for a year and positioning now looks far less stretched than it did a month ago. With hedge fund positions concentrated in near-dated futures and options contracts, the sell-off has hit the front-end of the curve especially hard and accelerated the shift from backwardation to level or contango. Fears about oil supplies after the return of U.S. sanctions against Iran have been replaced by concerns about slower oil demand growth in 2019. Strong output growth from U.S. shale producers as well as Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait should be enough to compensate for the loss of Iranian exports. The U.S. government has also taken a more flexible approach to sanctions, backing away from earlier threats to cut Iranian exports to zero and granting waivers to many of Iran’s customers in exchange for phased reductions. At the same time, there are growing fears about a possible deceleration in consumption growth, with oil prices falling in tandem with equity markets against the backdrop of a darkening economic outlook.

2018-11-06,"* Asia shares rebound after Monday’s fall * Wall Street shares mostly gain, Apple drags down techs * Investors expect a split Congress, Democrats to take over House * U.S. oil prices near 7-month low By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares ticked up in early Tuesday trade, supported by Wall Street gains although sentiment was tempered ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the first major electoral test of President Donald Trump’s big tax cuts and hostile trade policies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.15 percent while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.5 percent, a day after both fell more than one percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.56 percent, with financials such as Berkshire Hathaway supported by strong earnings. In oil markets, crude prices wobbled near multi-month lows after the United States granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran as Washington formally imposed punitive sanctions on the Islamic republic. Bucking broader gains, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.38 percent as Apple Inc lost 2.8 percent following a Nikkei report that said the company had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR. Ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. elections, investors generally expect opposition Democrats to take over the House of Representatives while Trump’s Republican Party is tipped to retain the Senate. While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump’s pro-business agenda and raise political instability, including hearings centring on the administration, some analysts say such an outcome may have already been priced in by investors. If the Republicans retain their House majority, global stocks are likely to rally on hopes of more tax cuts. Trump said last month his administration planned to produce a resolution calling for a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income households. “Everyone still remembers strong equity rallies after Trump was elected two years ago. So initially stock markets will gain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “But further tax cuts would boost already large fiscal deficits and push the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield above its October high almost instantly. Given rises in U.S. bond yields triggered a correction in equities last month, any rally in stocks is unlikely to last long,” he added. Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on trade, regardless of the outcome of the elections. In oil markets, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.86 a barrel after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday. Major currencies, moves were modest. The euro traded at $1.1410, about one cent above this year’s low of $1.1301 touched on Aug. 15. The yen changed hands at 113.22 per dollar, near its three-week low of 113.385 marked last Wednesday.

2018-11-06,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The province of British Columbia introduced on Monday new environmental assessment rules that it said will increase clarity and certainty for the companies behind projects, mirroring efforts by the Canadian government to update major project reviews. The proposed changes will enhance early consultation with indigenous groups and allow “good projects” to be approved more quickly, British Columbia’s environment minister George Heyman said in a statement. “We want to reduce the potential for the types of legal challenges we’ve too frequently seen in B.C.,” Heyman said. Most major projects in British Columbia must undergo an environmental assessment, often done in partnership with a federal review. Canada’s ruling Liberals introduced draft legislation earlier this year that would change how pipelines, mines and other major projects are assessed, seeking to address unhappiness over the potential environmental impact of those developments. The federal move has been criticized by political opponents and some in industry over concerns it will add more hurdles without resulting in increased public support for contentious projects like crude oil pipelines. British Columbia said the changes to its process will give the province the ability to more fully assess environmental impacts of developments, including upstream emissions and social, cultural and health effects. It will also include stronger enforcement, including audits, to ensure conditions of approval are being followed as intended. The new rules will need to be approved by the province’s legislative assembly.

2018-11-06,"* U.S. sanctions against Iran’s fuel exports started Monday * Washington grants temporary waivers to Iran’s top buyers * Russia, U.S., Saudi crude production: tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8 * Global oil supply is rising amid concerns of economic slowdown By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Tuesday as concerns that an economic slowdown may curb fuel demand growth overshadowed the reintroduction of sanctions on Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.93 a barrel at 0021 GMT, down 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement. Brent had yet to trade, with liquidity of the international benchmark expected to be low on Tuesday due to a holiday in Asia’s oil trading hub of Singapore. Analysts said expectations of an economic slowdown in coming months was outweighing supply-side risks to crude markets from the reintroduced U.S. sanctions against Iran, which started on Monday. Jameel Ahmad, head of market research at futures brokerage FXTM said the “sanctions on Iran have been... priced into the oil markets a long time ago”, and that he would “instead focus more heavily on the global demand outlook because of the ongoing external uncertainties weighing down on economic prospects.” Ahmad added that he saw a slowdown in economic and fuel demand growth as “more of a risk for oil over the coming months.” Currency weakness is putting pressure on key growth economies in Asia, including India and Indonesia. At the same time, the trade dispute between the United States and China is threatening growth in the world’s two biggest economies. On the supply-side, oil is in ample availability despite the sanctions against Iran. Washington has granted 180-day exemptions to eight importers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey. These are also Iran’s biggest buyers, meaning Iran will be allowed to still export some oil for now. At the same time, output from the world’s top-three producers, Russia the United States and Saudi Arabia, is rising. Output from these three countries in October exceeded 33 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time, meaning they alone meet more than a third of the world’s almost 100 million bpd of crude oil consumption.

2018-11-06,"* Tullow sees Kenya crude shipments next year * Company’s Guyana drilling plans fast-forwarded to mid 2019 By Ed Stoddard CAPE TOWN, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Africa-focused Tullow Oil expects the first crude shipments from its Kenyan oilfields in the first half of 2019 and is pricing the product for the market, the company’s chief executive said on Tuesday. Paul McDade also told Reuters that Tullow, which has expanded beyond Africa to the coast of Guyana, was bringing forward its drilling plans for the South American country and was looking to drill at least two wells there in the middle of 2019. In Kenya, one of Africa’s newest oil plays where Tullow is already trucking crude, the next phase is getting ready to roll. “We will have a shipment of Kenyan crude ready to go probably in the first or second quarter of next year. We will market that and it allows the refiners to see the crude and try the crude so that helps the marketing process,” McDade told Reuters on the sidelines of the Africa Oil Week conference. The price for crude from Kenya and neighbouring Uganda has not yet been fixed. The product is light crude but is waxy, a drawback as it needs to be heated for transport to stay liquid. But its extremely low sulphur content is a plus. A 0.5 percent sulphur limit will be imposed on marine fuels from 2020 by the International Maritime Organization, down from 3.5 percent, to help protect the ocean environment. “It is as close as you can get to zero sulphur which is quite unusual. That will give it a premium,” McDade said. He would not be drawn on what he thought its price ultimately would be in relation to the Brent benchmark. Tullow also has a planned pipeline project in Kenya and its CEO said tenders would go out for that probably in the first half of next year. Some of the contractors Tullow has spoken to have said they can get their own financing. “That is a novelty, it’s not the conventional way to go,” McDade said. Meanwhile, in Guyana, Tullow has accelerated drilling plans in its concessions. “We had originally thought we would drill some of those wells late next year but we have now accelerated and will probably drill at least two wells in our block around the middle of the year,” McDade said.

2018-11-06,"MADRID/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Siemens Gamesa (SGREN.MC) sold more turbines in the fourth quarter and said sales would rise by at least 10 percent next year, setting a high bar for main rival Vestas (VWS.CO) who is due to report quarterly results on Wednesday. Strong demand in the United States, the world’s second-largest wind market after China, and a recovery in the volatile Indian market lifted sales in the period by 12 percent to 2.62 billion euros (2.29 billion pounds). Shares in Siemens Gamesa, formed by the merger of Spain’s Gamesa with the wind power business of Siemens (SIEGn.DE), rose as much as 13 percent to their highest level since Sept. 25, out-shining Vestas which was up 5 percent. Siemens shares were flat. Brokerage Renta4banco pointed to Siemens Gamesa’s strong order intake, which was up 9 percent in 2018 at 11.87 billion euros, adding this already secured 80 percent of 2019 sales. Chief Executive Markus Tacke told Reuters that while the group had done its fair share of consolidation activity, it was still on the lookout for bolt-on acquisitions in the technology space. The wind industry faces pressure on margins as markets around the world phase out subsidies and governments opt for more competitive contract tenders, favouring project developers that submit the lowest bids. Siemens Gamesa, which counts Iberdrola (IBE.MC) among its shareholders, said average selling prices had fallen by 9 percent year-on-year. Further pressure has been piled on the price of steel, the main raw material for wind turbine parts, as the United States and China imposed tariffs on each other’s imports worth tens of billions of dollars. But healthy demand pushed Siemens Gamesa’s fourth-quarter margin on earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to 8.2 percent, exceeding its 2018 target. It expects sales of 10-11 billion euros in 2019, up from 9.1 billion this year. Order intake in the quarter was up by a fifth, led by the United States and India, where favourable legislative conditions drove demand for wind turbines, a technology that still depends on government support in many parts of the world. Denmark’s Vestas (VWS.CO), which is due to report results on Wednesday, fights with the German-Spanish group for dominance of the global $50 billion wind turbine industry. Refinitiv estimates put Vestas third-quarter revenue growth at 2 percent. In a sign of ongoing cost pressure, Siemens Gamesa said its EBIT margin in 2019 would come in between 7-8.5 percent, compared with 7.6 percent in the previous year.

2018-11-06,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Iran are unlikely to impact the oil market due to a glut in supplies globally, but Iran’s production capacity could be hit due to a possible squeeze in investments, the head of research at Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) said. Big producers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and others have enough capacity to ensure global supply, analysts at ADIA and Citigroup said.  “You can’t exclude spikes but basically there’s too much oil in the world and that will prevail in the long-term,” Christof Ruhl, head of global research at ADIA said on the sidelines of a financial conference in Abu Dhabi. “The system has already shown that there’s ample surplus capacity in the world to more than meet the amount of oil taken out of Iran for the time being,” said Ed Morse, managing director & global head of commodities research at Citi. There is significant production coming out of the United States, Canada, Brazil and Middle Eastern countries, he said. Citi’s outlook for prices is strong prices of $80 a barrel through the winter and then with coming production Brent will end 2019 at $64-$65. The United States on Monday restored sanctions targeting Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors and threatened more action to stop what Washington called its “outlaw” policies, steps Tehran called economic warfare and vowed to defy. Washington, however, gave 180-day exemptions to eight importers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey.  This group takes as much as three-quarters of Iran’s seaborne oil exports, trade data shows, meaning Iran will still be allowed to export some oil for now. Iran’s crude exports could fall to little more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, roughly a third of their mid-2018 peak. But traders and analysts say that figure could rise from December as importers use their waivers.  When production declines, it damages fields and capacity and that is more important in the medium to long term, said Ruhl. “It is not going to help the sector, it means pulling out investments, it means financial isolation, declining exports and revenues and potentially declining production,” he said, adding that it depends on how stringently the sanctions are executed. Iran’s ability to store crude oil is crucial to keep production up rather than its ability to sell in the short term, said Ruhl.

2018-11-06,"(Adds details) LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Iran’s oil minister wrote to OPEC’s secretary general calling for two committees tasked with monitoring a deal between OPEC and other countries led by Russia to be scrapped, Iran’s Shana news agency said on Tuesday. “Some OPEC members of these two committees have clearly taken sides with the (United States) in imposing its unilateral and unlawful sanctions against... Iran,” Shana quoted Bijan Zanganeh as saying. “They (the committees) should immediately stop their work.” The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and Joint Technical Committee (JTC) were set up as part of a deal between OPEC and other producers led by Russia in late 2016 to curb oil supplies by some 1.8 million barrels per day. The JTC prepares regular reports on the oil market which inform the group’s decisions. At their meeting in June, OPEC and non-OPEC agreed to boost output by returning to 100 percent compliance with supply cuts that took effect in January 2017, after months of underproduction by some member countries including Venezuela and Angola. Saudi Arabia said the move would translate into an output rise of around 1 million bpd. The JMMC will meet in Abu Dhabi on Nov. 11. Reporting by Shadia Nasralla, Ahmad Ghaddar; editing by Louise

2018-11-06,"SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s oil exports have fallen sharply since U.S. President Donald Trump said at mid-year he would reimpose sanctions on Tehran, but with waivers in hand the Islamic Republic’s major buyers are already planning to scale up orders again.  The original aim of the sanctions was to cut Iran’s oil exports as much as possible, to quash its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and curb its support for militant proxies, particularly in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.  But the exemptions granted to Iran’s biggest oil clients - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - allow them to import at least some oil for another 180 days and could mean exports start to rise after November.  This group of eight buyers imported over 80 percent of Iran’s roughly 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil exports last year, Refiniv Eikon data shows. “The decision by the U.S. (to grant waivers) represents a departure, for now, from the stated aim of reducing Iran’s oil exports to zero,” said Pat Thaker, regional director for the Middle East and Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit.      Iran’s crude exports have fallen significantly from at least 2.5 million bpd in April, before Trump in May withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions, although estimates vary. As a result of pre-sanctions pressure by Washington, Iran’s oil exports in November may not exceed 1 million to 1.5 million bpd, according to industry estimates. Companies that monitor Iran’s shipments are already seeing a drop in tanker activity this month. “We’ve only seen 10 tankers loading at, or signalling for Iranian terminals in November so far, which is significantly lower than what we usually see at the beginning of the month,” said Kpler, a data intelligence company. According to Refinitiv Eikon data, Iranian crude exports have fallen to 1 million bpd so far in November.  An industry source who also monitors such shipments said the figure was likely to be on the low side. Iran expects to maintain crude exports of at least 1.1 million bpd after the reimposition of sanctions, a source familiar with Iranian thinking said, as the global market is too tight to allow a full stoppage. In October, Iran’s crude exports were estimated at 1.82 million bpd by Kpler and 1.5 million bpd by another firm that monitors Iranian shipments. Japan’s trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, said on Tuesday that Japanese buyers of Iranian oil were expected to resume imports from the Islamic Republic after the country received a waiver from U.S. sanctions. S&P Global Platts reported on Tuesday that South Korea would be able to take around 4 million barrels a month (130,000 bpd) of Iranian crude and condensate under a U.S. sanctions waiver. Japan and South Korea, close U.S. allies, had toed the Washington sanctions line and stopped buying crude from Iran.  India, Iran’s second-biggest oil customer, also cut orders ahead of the sanctions, hoping its effort to reduce reliance on Tehran would pay off in Washington and win it a waiver once the sanctions restarted. Even China, locked in a bitter trade war with the United States, bowed to pressure from Washington and dialled back imports.  Trading sources said several Asian oil importers were looking to increase their orders for Iranian oil soon. Two Chinese sources familiar with the matter said the country would be allowed to buy 360,000 bpd of Iranian crude during the exemption period.  That would be about half the daily average China has been importing from Iran since January 2016, trade data showed.  One of the sources said the United States had attached some strings to the import allowance, including counterparty disclosures and laying open settlement methods, which were being evaluated before placing new orders with Iran. Both sources were not permitted to talk to the media about Iran sanctions and declined to be identified.  A merchant trader, who also declined to be named, said “enquiries for cargoes from Iran are ... coming in from several Asian buyers”. The wide-ranging exemptions have reduced fears of a supply shortage, taking pressure off companies, governments and economies around the world that have struggled with the surging cost of fuel. Trump, facing crucial midterm elections that may cost Republicans control of the U.S. Congress, said on Monday he wants to impose sanctions on Iran’s oil gradually, citing concerns about shocking markets and causing global price spikes.  That has helped to take the sting out of the sanctions threat, which helped to lift international benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 to four-year highs of almost $87 a barrel in early October.  Brent prices are now about 15 percent lower than that peak and have barely budged over the last two sessions.

2018-11-06,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar’s ruler voiced hope on Tuesday the country’s bitter dispute with Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies would pass, saying it had harmed regional security by weakening a Gulf Arab bloc. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut transport and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their foe Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to undermine its sovereignty. “History teaches us that crises pass, but if they are handled badly then this may leave traces which last for a long time,” Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said in a speech to the country’s consultative Shoura council. “It is very regrettable that the continuation of the Gulf crisis exposed the failure of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) ... which has weakened its ability to face challenges and threats and marginalized its role in the region,” he said, urging the bloc to adopt dispute resolution mechanisms. The United States, an ally of the six-nation Sunni Muslim GCC, sees the rift as a threat to efforts to contain Shi’ite Iran and has pushed for a united Gulf front. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have repeatedly said the dispute is not a top priority and assured Washington it will not affect defense cooperation. Riyadh recently appeared to soften its tone on Qatar as the kingdom faces its worst political crisis in decades, over the murder of journalist Jamal Kashoggi at its consulate in Istanbul, which has strained Saudi ties with the West. The emir said Qatar’s economy had emerged stronger from the sanctions and that the state continued to support vital projects, including preparations to host the World Cup in 2022 and to develop oil and gas industries to maintain its position as the world’s largest liquefied natural gas exporter. Doha has moved to attract investors and new trade partners as it builds an economy less reliant on its neighbors, easing restrictions on foreign ownership of stocks and property.  Qatar grew its exports by 18 percent last year and slashed spending by 20 percent under a conservative fiscal policy, while preserving the value of its currency, the emir said, forecasting the budgetary surplus would increase in coming years. He told the Shoura Council that Doha would push ahead with economic diversification plans to ensure food and water security but continue to build on its already powerful energy sector. “Qatar’s objectives in diversifying the economy and reducing its dependence on oil and gas does not ever mean neglecting the oil and gas sector as a fundamental source of wealth,” he said.

2018-11-06,"* New plan to cut excess capacity in polluting industries * Will merge small refineries, cut crude processing capacity * Aims to build mega energy complexes, move downstream * To cut 70 pct of steel mills in key pollution-control cities BEIJING, Nov 6 (Reuters) - China’s Shandong province, home to a fifth of China’s oil refining capacity, is planning to consolidate dozens of small refineries and build mega-petrochemical complexes, as part of a new plan to overhaul energy intensive industries. The plan, published on Monday, is aimed at improving the efficiency and competitiveness in seven energy-intensive sectors, including steel, fertilizer, aluminium, coking coal and oil refining. It comes amid an ongoing push by Beijing to tackle excess capacity in heavy industry and shift its economy to higher value-added sectors, and improve its dirty air. “We will cap capacity of steel, petrochemicals, coking coal and aluminium and achieve a drop in energy intensity as well as total emissions from these sectors,” the Shandong government said in the document published on its website. The province, home to 90 percent of China’s private refiners, wants to reduce total crude processing capacity from 130 million tonnes per year, or 2.6 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), to 90 million tonnes. It will merge refiners with less than 3 million tonnes annual capacity by 2022, and later target those with up to 5 million tonnes, or about 100,000 bpd, before 2025. It also wants to significantly reduce the output of diesel and gasoline by 2025. The move is seen as positive for China’s independent refining industry, currently facing fierce competition in local fuel markets and subject to frequent shutdowns due to environmental scrutiny. The small private refiners known as “teapots” have a small share in domestic petrochemical markets, which are dominated by state companies such as Sinopec and foreign majors like Exxon Mobil. “Shandong is being forced to reshuffle its oil industry under pressure from state-owned companies and foreign oil majors,” said Zhong Jian, chief analyst with consultancy JLC. Shandong said it will lobby for policy support from Beijing, including seeking approvals for new mega refining complexes and getting crude oil import quotas for new refineries. In the future, the province wants to build huge refining complexes with 30 million tonnes of yearly processing capacity and shift production to chemicals products. The document also outlined plans for other sectors, such as capping annual fertilizer output at 8 million tonnes and reducing the number of coking coal producers from 56 to 40 in two years. It also said 70 percent of steel mills built in polluted cities such as Jinan, Zibo and Binzhou will be forced to relocate to coastal areas. The province said it would give incentives such as tax breaks and credit lines to help companies relocate and compensate workers made redundant during the relocation process.

Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Africa Oil Week conference in Cape Town, Birol also said that he hoped oil prices would not rise above current levels this year because it would be bad for the “fragile” global economy. “Venezuela production is in a free-fall and we expect that soon it may go to even below 1 million barrels per day,” he said. OPEC member Venezuela last year produced more than 2 million bpd, but a deep economic and social crisis has seen output plummet as millions flee the South American country. Asked whether the current oil price of around $73 per barrel was sustainable, Birol said he hoped there would be no further increases this year. “I hope that prices do not rise again because this will not really be good news for the global economy which is very fragile,” he said, as U.S. sanctions against Iran and Washington’s trade spat with China add to price volatility.

2018-11-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British price cap on the most widely used domestic energy tariffs will come into force on Jan. 1, 2019, saving households a total of around 1 billion pounds a year, energy regulator Ofgem said on Tuesday. The regulator was tasked by parliament with setting a cap after a committee of lawmakers called Britain’s energy market “broken”. Prime Minister Theresa May said the energy tariffs were a “rip-off”. The cap, set at 1,137 pounds per year for a dual fuel bill - gas and electricity - is in line with an indicative level announced in September. It will give 11 million customers cheaper prices and save a typical customer on the most expensive tariff up to 120 pounds a year, with the average saving expected to be 76 pounds a year, Ofgem said. The level of the temporary cap will be updated in April and October each year to reflect the latest costs for suppliers such as wholesale energy prices and policy costs, and is expected to run until 2023. Britain’s big six energy suppliers are Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, SSE SSE, Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power, Innogy’s npower (IGY.DE), E.ON (EONGn.DE) and EDF Energy (EDF.PA). Average fuel bills fell for UK households last year, but the government is still concerned by the large disparity in prices. Ofgem said the fall was due to factors such as lower wholesale energy prices and lower margins for the suppliers. The difference between the average standard variable price and the cheapest tariff offered by Britain’s big six energy suppliers was 320 pounds between June 2017 and June 2018, an Ofgem report in October showed. All of the big six suppliers have increased their prices this year, and since a law to cap prices was introduced to parliament in February. “In the past few months loyal energy customers have continued to be hit by unjustified price rises on their already rip-off tariffs,” Britain’s energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said in a statement. “Today’s final cap level brings greater fairness to energy prices,” she said. Some energy suppliers have warned the price cap could hamper competition in Britain’s energy market, which has around 70 suppliers. “It is crucial that the cap doesn’t halt this growth of competition and choice and still enables energy companies to both invest and attract investment,” Lawrence Slade, chief executive of industry group Energy UK said in a statement. Analysts have also warned rising wholesale prices mean Ofgem is expected to raise the cap next April.

2018-11-06,"GENEVA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Iran has been able to sell as much oil as it needs despite U.S. pressure, Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri was quoted as saying on Tuesday. The United States on Monday restored sanctions targeting Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors and threatened more action to stop what Washington called its “outlaw” policies, steps Tehran called economic warfare and vowed to defy. The measures are part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to curb Tehran’s missile and nuclear programmes and diminish the Islamic Republic’s influence in the Middle East, notably its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Trump’s moves target Iran’s main source of revenue - its oil exports - as well as its financial sector, essentially making 50 Iranian banks and their subsidiaries off limits to foreign banks on pain of losing access to the U.S. financial system. “The Americans constantly said they would reduce the sale of Iran’s oil to zero but I have to say that so far, we have been able to sell our required amounts of oil,” the Tasnim news agency quoted Jahangiri as saying. “The Americans, with the help of propaganda, don’t see the realities.” Jahangiri said he had spoken to a handful of managers from companies on the U.S. sanctions list and that some had already formulated plans on how to deal with the measures. Jahangiri also said officials should be open with the Iranian public about the difficulties that may lie ahead, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). “It is our duty to keep some of the worries to ourselves,” IRNA quoted Jahangiri as saying. “But there shouldn’t be an issue that is hidden from the people.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.4 percent on a positive lead from Wall Street, but the gains were capped by falls in Chinese markets and regional technology shares. Japan’s Nikkei average climbed 1.1 percent. The Shanghai Composite and blue-chip CSI 300 eased 0.2 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. Both mainland benchmarks were able to claw back some of their earlier losses, however, on news that China’s leadership was open to dialogue with the United States to resolve trade disputes.. Shares in Asia-Pacific suppliers of Apple Inc, such as Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, fell after a report in the Nikkei newspaper that Apple had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR. The report drove Apple shares 2.8 percent lower in U.S. trade. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.56 percent, with financials such as Berkshire Hathaway supported by strong earnings. Taking the lead from U.S. and Asian peers, European futures pointed to a higher openings, with financial spreadbetters showing London’s FTSE, Frankfurt’s DAX, and Paris’s CAC expected to rise between 0.2 and 0.4 percent. Ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. midterm elections, investors generally expect opposition Democrats to take over the House of Representatives while Trump’s Republican Party is tipped to retain the Senate. While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump’s pro-business agenda and raise concerns about political instability, some analysts say such an outcome may have already been priced in by investors. The Cboe Skew index, also known as the “black swan” index, hovered not far from its 2-1/2-year low hit Friday, indicating demand for options that provide protection remains tepid. A higher skew typically indicates investors are buying more protection on heightened anxiety. “Unlike the U.S. Presidential election or the U.K.’s Brexit referendum, the upcoming U.S. (midterm) elections are not a binary event. So it’s unlikely to send stocks significantly in one direction, apart from initial quick reactions,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. “So with this one, I don’t think there is much need to hedge against the black swan risk.” If the Republicans retain their House majority, global stocks are likely to rally on hopes of more tax cuts. Trump said last month his administration planned to produce a resolution calling for a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income households. “Everyone still remembers strong equity rallies after Trump was elected two years ago. So initially stock markets will gain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “But further tax cuts would boost already large fiscal deficits and push the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield above its October high almost instantly. Given rises in U.S. bond yields triggered a correction in equities last month, any rally in stocks is unlikely to last long,” he added. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 3.201 percent , maintaining most of its gains following Friday’s strong U.S. jobs and wage data and staying not far from its 7 1/2-year peak of 3.261 percent hit on Oct. 9. “Global equities have recovered after their fall in February, which was triggered by a rise in U.S. yields. But this time a recovery will likely be capped because now markets do not have the support they had back in February from tame inflation and the economic boost from Trump’s tax cuts,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro-economic strategy at HSBC in Tokyo. Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on trade, regardless of the outcome of the elections. “The impact of trade war will start to appear in U.S. economic data in coming months,” Shirota added. In oil markets, crude prices wobbled near multi-month lows after the United States allowed eight countries to temporarily continue buying oil from Iran, addressing supply concerns as Washington formally imposed punitive sanctions on the Islamic republic. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.89 a barrel, after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday. Brent crude futures dropped 0.6 percent to $72.74 a barrel, near Friday’s 2-1/2-month low of $72.16. Both oil benchmarks have slid more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October.

2018-11-06,"* Major importers scaled back Iran orders pre-sanctions * Washington grants Iran’s biggest buyers sanction waivers * Japan says will start ordering Iran oil again * Exemptions to last for 180 days * Iran oil exports: tmsnrt.rs/2PMqQgS By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Iran’s oil exports have fallen sharply since U.S. President Donald Trump said at mid-year he would re-impose sanctions on Tehran, but with waivers in hand, the Middle Eastern nation’s major buyers could scale up orders as soon as next month. The original aim of the sanctions was to cut Iran’s oil exports as much as possible, to quash its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and curb its support for militant proxies, particularly in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. But the exemptions granted to Iran’s biggest oil clients - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - which allow them to import at least some oil for another 180 days, could mean the exports start to rise after November. This group of eight buyers takes as much as three-quarters of Iran’s seaborne oil exports, trade data shows. “The decision by the U.S. (to grant waivers) represents a departure, for now, from the stated aim of reducing Iran’s oil exports to zero,” said Pat Thaker, regional director for the Middle East and Africa at The Economist Intelligence Unit. As a result of pre-sanctions pressure by Washington, Iran’s oil exports in November may not exceed 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), according to industry estimates, making them as little as a third of a mid-2018 peak. “U.S. sanctions are expected to bring Iranian crude exports down to 1.1 million bpd in November,” according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. Japan’s trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, though, has already said on Tuesday that Japanese buyers of Iranian oil are expected to resume imports from the Islamic republic after the country was granted a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Japan and South Korea, both close U.S. allies, had toed the Washington sanctions line and stopped buying crude from Iran. India, Iran’s second-biggest oil customer, also cut orders ahead of the sanctions, hoping its effort to reduce reliance on Tehran would pay off in Washington and win it a waiver once the sanctions re-started. Even China, locked in a bitter trade war with the United States, bowed to pressure from Washington and dialled back imports. Trading sources said several Asian oil importers are already looking to increase their orders for Iranian oil soon. “Enquiries for cargoes from Iran are ... coming in from several Asian buyers,” said one merchant trader, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk about his firm’s commercial activity. The wide-ranging exemptions have cut fears of a supply shortage, taking pressure off companies, governments and economies around the world that have struggled with the surging cost for fuel. U.S. President Trump, facing crucial midterm elections that may cost Republicans control of the U.S. Congress, said on Monday he wants to impose sanctions on Iran’s oil gradually, citing concerns about shocking markets and causing global price spikes. That has helped to take the sting out of the sanctions threat, which helped to lift international benchmark Brent crude futures to four-year highs of almost $87 a barrel in early October. Brent prices are now about 15 percent lower than that peak and have barely budged over the last two sessions. Now it will be key to watch “what happens after the exemptions expire in 180 days,” the merchant trader said. Iran’s oil exports rose sharply after the previous round of sanctions were lifted in early 2016. Including condensate, an ultra-light form of crude, shipments peaked around 3 million bpd in mid-2018, according to trade data in Refinitiv Eikon.

2018-11-06,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and natural gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp on Monday beat third-quarter profit estimates on the back of a surge in production from the Permian Basin and higher oil prices. U.S. shale oil production from the Permian has nearly doubled in the last three years, while Brent crude touched a four-year high in September. Occidental said average worldwide realized crude oil prices rose 36 percent to $62.67 per barrel in the third quarter. The company, which has been investing heavily to boost production in the Permian, said output from its Permian Resources unit surged about 62 percent to 225,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Occidental’s average production rose about 13.5 percent to 681,000 boe/d. However, the company lowered the top end of its full-year forecast for total output to between 655,000 boe/d and 659,000 boe/d, from 650,000 boe/d and 664,000 boe/d. Sales in Occidental’s chemical division rose 10.6 percent to $1.19 billion, helped by demand for caustic soda. The division, the company’s second biggest, makes plastics used in pipes and siding. The Houston-based company's net income surged to $1.87 billion, or $2.44 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $190 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2qutMkh) In the latest quarter, the company had an after-tax gain on the sale of midstream assets of about $700 million. Excluding one-time items, Occidental earned $1.77 per share topping analysts’ estimates of $1.54 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares of the company rose about 1 percent in after-hours trading. The company will hold a conference call with investors to discuss the results on Tuesday.

2018-11-06,"(Repeats Nov 5 column without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2P8LQ1S By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers were net sellers of petroleum-linked futures and options for a fifth week running last week as concerns about sanctions on Iran evaporated and investors refocused on economic worries. The net long position in the six most important petroleum-linked futures and options contracts was cut by a further 73 million barrels in the week to Oct. 30. Portfolio managers have been net sellers of 371 million barrels since the end of September, taking their net long position to the lowest level for 15 months, according to records published by regulators and exchanges. The sharpest sell-offs last week were in Brent (-54 million barrels) and U.S. gasoline (-11 million) with smaller reductions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-2 million), U.S. heating oil (-4 million) and European gasoil (-2 million). Position changes are no longer confined to long liquidation. Fund managers have started to establish short positions betting on further price falls (tmsnrt.rs/2P8LQ1S). Short positions across all six contracts have doubled over the past five weeks to 192 million barrels, the highest level for more than 10 months. Fund managers still favour bullish long positions over bearish short ones by a ratio of almost 5:1, but the ratio has sunk from more than 12:1 only five weeks ago. The hedge fund community’s bullish bias is the lowest for a year and positioning now looks far less stretched than it did a month ago. With hedge fund positions concentrated in near-dated futures and options contracts, the sell-off has hit the front-end of the curve especially hard and accelerated the shift from backwardation to level or contango. Fears about oil supplies after the return of U.S. sanctions against Iran have been replaced by concerns about slower oil demand growth in 2019. Strong output growth from U.S. shale producers as well as Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait should be enough to compensate for the loss of Iranian exports. The U.S. government has also taken a more flexible approach to sanctions, backing away from earlier threats to cut Iranian exports to zero and granting waivers to many of Iran’s customers in exchange for phased reductions. At the same time, there are growing fears about a possible deceleration in consumption growth, with oil prices falling in tandem with equity markets against the backdrop of a darkening economic outlook.

2018-11-06,"* Asia shares rebound after Monday’s fall * Wall Street shares mostly gain, Apple drags down techs * Investors expect a split Congress, Democrats to take over House * U.S. oil prices near 7-month low By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares ticked up in early Tuesday trade, supported by Wall Street gains although sentiment was tempered ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the first major electoral test of President Donald Trump’s big tax cuts and hostile trade policies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.15 percent while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.5 percent, a day after both fell more than one percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.56 percent, with financials such as Berkshire Hathaway supported by strong earnings. In oil markets, crude prices wobbled near multi-month lows after the United States granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran as Washington formally imposed punitive sanctions on the Islamic republic. Bucking broader gains, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.38 percent as Apple Inc lost 2.8 percent following a Nikkei report that said the company had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR. Ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. elections, investors generally expect opposition Democrats to take over the House of Representatives while Trump’s Republican Party is tipped to retain the Senate. While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump’s pro-business agenda and raise political instability, including hearings centring on the administration, some analysts say such an outcome may have already been priced in by investors. If the Republicans retain their House majority, global stocks are likely to rally on hopes of more tax cuts. Trump said last month his administration planned to produce a resolution calling for a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income households. “Everyone still remembers strong equity rallies after Trump was elected two years ago. So initially stock markets will gain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “But further tax cuts would boost already large fiscal deficits and push the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield above its October high almost instantly. Given rises in U.S. bond yields triggered a correction in equities last month, any rally in stocks is unlikely to last long,” he added. Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on trade, regardless of the outcome of the elections. In oil markets, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.86 a barrel after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday. Major currencies, moves were modest. The euro traded at $1.1410, about one cent above this year’s low of $1.1301 touched on Aug. 15. The yen changed hands at 113.22 per dollar, near its three-week low of 113.385 marked last Wednesday.

2018-11-06,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The province of British Columbia introduced on Monday new environmental assessment rules that it said will increase clarity and certainty for the companies behind projects, mirroring efforts by the Canadian government to update major project reviews. The proposed changes will enhance early consultation with indigenous groups and allow “good projects” to be approved more quickly, British Columbia’s environment minister George Heyman said in a statement. “We want to reduce the potential for the types of legal challenges we’ve too frequently seen in B.C.,” Heyman said. Most major projects in British Columbia must undergo an environmental assessment, often done in partnership with a federal review. Canada’s ruling Liberals introduced draft legislation earlier this year that would change how pipelines, mines and other major projects are assessed, seeking to address unhappiness over the potential environmental impact of those developments. The federal move has been criticized by political opponents and some in industry over concerns it will add more hurdles without resulting in increased public support for contentious projects like crude oil pipelines. British Columbia said the changes to its process will give the province the ability to more fully assess environmental impacts of developments, including upstream emissions and social, cultural and health effects. It will also include stronger enforcement, including audits, to ensure conditions of approval are being followed as intended. The new rules will need to be approved by the province’s legislative assembly.

2018-11-06,"* U.S. sanctions against Iran’s fuel exports started Monday * Washington grants temporary waivers to Iran’s top buyers * Russia, U.S., Saudi crude production: tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8 * Global oil supply is rising amid concerns of economic slowdown By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Tuesday as concerns that an economic slowdown may curb fuel demand growth overshadowed the reintroduction of sanctions on Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.93 a barrel at 0021 GMT, down 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement. Brent had yet to trade, with liquidity of the international benchmark expected to be low on Tuesday due to a holiday in Asia’s oil trading hub of Singapore. Analysts said expectations of an economic slowdown in coming months was outweighing supply-side risks to crude markets from the reintroduced U.S. sanctions against Iran, which started on Monday. Jameel Ahmad, head of market research at futures brokerage FXTM said the “sanctions on Iran have been... priced into the oil markets a long time ago”, and that he would “instead focus more heavily on the global demand outlook because of the ongoing external uncertainties weighing down on economic prospects.” Ahmad added that he saw a slowdown in economic and fuel demand growth as “more of a risk for oil over the coming months.” Currency weakness is putting pressure on key growth economies in Asia, including India and Indonesia. At the same time, the trade dispute between the United States and China is threatening growth in the world’s two biggest economies. On the supply-side, oil is in ample availability despite the sanctions against Iran. Washington has granted 180-day exemptions to eight importers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey. These are also Iran’s biggest buyers, meaning Iran will be allowed to still export some oil for now. At the same time, output from the world’s top-three producers, Russia the United States and Saudi Arabia, is rising. Output from these three countries in October exceeded 33 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time, meaning they alone meet more than a third of the world’s almost 100 million bpd of crude oil consumption.
