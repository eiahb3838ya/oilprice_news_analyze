2018-11-11,"(Corrects final paragraph to say Campo largo complex has 327 MW capacity (not 160 MW); adding all its capacity has been contracted, instead of half) By Luciano Costa SAO PAULO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The Brazilian unit of French gas and power group Engie SA is in negotiations to set up contracts forward-selling wind power that would allow it to build wind farms with  300 megawatts of capacity, its chief financial officer said on Friday. Engie Brasil Energia is negotiating the contracts on the so-called free market that would allow it to build new wind farms without going through Brazilian government auctions, its CFO Carlos Freitas told Reuters in an interview. “We are already closing contracts and aim to reach a critical mass that will make the investment viable,” Freitas said. “We hope to make an announcement soon.” Fierce competition in Brazil’s regulated energy market depressed wind power contracts last year to record lows of 67.60 reais per MWh. But on the free market, medium-term contracts can be signed for 170 reais per MWh, according to the BBCE electronic trading platform. “The prices from the auctions on the regulated market are not attractive for us, so we prefer to focus on the free market where we are have the advantage of being the biggest player in Brazil,” Freitas said. Large wind farms that Engie is building already allow economies of scale that bring down costs but require heavy investments, he said. The 360 MW Umburanas wind farm complex in the Brazilian state of Bahia, which has 70 percent of its future energy output already sold on the free market, involves investment budgeted at 1.8 billion reais. Phase 1 of the Campo largo complex, also in Bahia, will cost 1.7 billion reais to build, with a 327 MW capacity, all of which has already been contracted, he said.

2018-11-11,"KUWAIT (Reuters) - Iraq’s president on Sunday urged the United States to consider Baghdad’s political and economic position as the countries negotiate on relief for Iraq from Washington’s reimposed sanctions against Iran. The United States said on Friday Iraq can continue to import natural gas and energy supplies from Iran for a period of 45 days, so long as Iraq does not pay Iran for imports in U.S. dollars. Sanctions on Tehran’s oil sector took effect on Nov 5.  “We do not want Iraq to be burdened with the U.S. sanctions on Iran,” Barham Salih, the newly elected President, told reporters during a visit to the Gulf Arab state of Kuwait. Iraq wanted to maintain “balanced” relations with all its neighbours and the international community, he said. “Iran is a neighbouring country and our interest lies in having good and stable relations with Iran,” he said, adding the Iraqi people also wanted to deepen Arab and Gulf ties. Iraq needs to rebuild its economy and infrastructure as it emerges from a ruinous conflict with Islamic State. Iraq central bank officials said in August that the country’s economy is closely linked to non-Arab Iran, which is locked in several proxy wars with Saudi Arabia in the region.

2018-11-11,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to reduce oil supply to world markets by 0.5 million barrels per day in December, its energy minister said on Sunday, as the OPEC power faces uncertain prospects in its attempts to persuade other producers to agree a coordinated output cut. Khalid al-Falih told reporters that Saudi Aramco’s customer crude oil nominations would fall by 500,000 bpd in December versus November due to seasonal lower demand. The cut represents a reduction in global oil supply of about 0.5 percent.  Saudi Arabia has increased output by just about 1 million bpd this year under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump and other consuming countries to help balance the market to compensate for lower supplies from Iran due to U.S. sanctions. But since Iran’s customers were given generous waivers to continue buying crude, concerns grew about market oversupply and oil prices fell to below $70 per barrel on Friday from $85 a barrel in October. “We have been increasing production in response to demand,” Falih told reporters in Abu Dhabi ahead of a joint OPEC, non-OPEC market monitoring committee meeting. “I’ll tell you a piece of news which is (that) December nominations are 500,000 barrels less than November. So we are seeing a tapering off part of it is year end, part of it is maintenance.... so we will be shipping less in December than we are in November.” Saudi Arabia is discussing a proposal that could see OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers cut output by up to 1 million bpd, two sources told Reuters earlier on Sunday, as the world’s top oil exporter grapples with a drop in crude prices. The sources said any such deal would depend on factors including the level of Iranian exports after the United States imposed sanctions on Tehran but granted Iran’s top oil buyers waivers to continue buying oil. Russian participation was key to helping OPEC rebalance the market during 2017-18. But Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Sunday he wasn’t certain the market would be oversupplied next year. He said the oversupply for the next few months would be seasonally driven while by mid 2019 the market could be balanced again and demand could even exceed supply. Riyadh was surprised by the waivers granted by Washington to Iran’s main customers such as China and India, a move which hit oil prices, at least three industry and OPEC sources told Reuters. Now Saudi Arabia wants to act to prevent a further slide in prices and is leading discussions on cutting oil output next year, the sources said.  Under a deal set to expire at the end of the year, OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed to curb output by around 1.8 million bpd.  But producers ended up cutting more and so agreed in June to limit their reductions by more than their output targets, meaning restoring about 1 million bpd in output. OPEC and its allies will meet in Vienna on Dec. 6-7 to decide on output policy for 2019.  “There is a general discussion about this (cut). But the question is how much is needed to be reduced by the market,” one of the sources said in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. “No one expected the waivers. Saudi Arabia wants to at least put a floor under oil prices. No one wants a free fall in prices,” the source added.  Kazakh deputy energy minister Magzum Mirzagaliyev told reporters in Abu Dhabi that he understood Saudi Arabia was suggesting using August-October output levels as a baseline for determining cuts. Falih did not rule out the possibility of a cut next year, but also said he would like to “move into 2019 with minimum interventions.” “I think ideally we don’t like to cut. Ideally we like to keep the market ... liberally supplied and comfortable. We will only cut if we see a persistent glut emerging and quite frankly we are seeing some signs of this coming out of the US, we have not seen the signs globally,” he told reporters. Brent LCOc1 crude on Friday fell 47 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $70.18 a barrel. It lost about 3.6 percent on the week and has shed more than 15 percent this quarter. [O/R] Washington gave 180-day waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey. This group takes as much as three-quarters of Iran’s seaborne oil exports, trade data shows.  The U.S. administration has vowed to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero and Trump has put pressure on Saudi Arabia to raise output to cool the market. Iran’s crude exports could fall to little more than 1 million bpd in November, roughly a third of their mid-2018 peak. But traders and analysts say that figure could rise from December as importers use their waivers. Falih said last month the kingdom would pump 11 million bpd in November, up from 10.7 million bpd in October. He also said there could be a need for intervention to reduce oil stockpiles after increases in recent months.

2018-11-11,", (Reuters) - The health of Gabon’s President Ali Ben Bongo has greatly improved and he is recovering his physical abilities, his office said on Sunday, after sources said last month he suffered a stroke. Bongo was admitted to hospital on Oct. 24 in Saudi Arabia after the stroke, the sources said, though Gabonese authorities said he was merely suffering from fatigue. One TV station in Gabon has been banned for reporting he had died. The Bongo family has ruled for nearly half a century in Gabon, a country in central Africa that produces oil and was a French colony before independence. Bongo has been president since succeeding his father, Omar, who died in 2009. Opposition leader Jean Ping last weekend re-opened a row over the violently disputed 2016 election, which Bongo narrowly won on a 95 percent result in the Bongo family stronghold, which recorded a turnout of more than 99 percent. Riots erupted after the results were announced. “The state of health of His Excellency Mr Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the Republic and head of state, has greatly improved,” the presidency statement read out on state TV by his spokesman Ike Ngouoni said. “This positive development has accelerated significantly in recent days. Today the President of the Republic is in the process of recovering all of his physical abilities.” The statement said nothing about a stroke but said for the first time he had had “bleeding which required medical care.” “Ali Bongo Ondimba ... continues to carry out his duties. The institutions of our Republic therefore function today perfectly in the strict respect of the constitution,” it said.

2018-11-11,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest railroad says it is attracting interest from oil producers in its effort to move crude in solid, puck-like form, as clogged pipelines divert more oil to riskier rail transport. Congested pipelines have stranded much of Canada’s crude in Alberta, driving discounts to record-high levels. Canadian heavy crude traded on Friday for less than one-third of the U.S. benchmark light oil price. The latest blow to the sector landed on Thursday, when a U.S. court ruled construction must stop on TransCanada Corp’s (TRP.TO) Keystone XL pipeline. Pipeline pressure has pushed more crude onto trains owned by Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO) and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP.TO). But crude movement by rail is costly and prone to spills and sometimes disastrous accidents, such as the 2013 derailment at Lac Megantic, Quebec that killed dozens of people. Enter CN’s patented Canapux product, which is solidified crude encased in plastic, named to evoke the country’s most popular sport, hockey. The railroad argues that solid crude, never before commercially shipped in the world, can be transported more cheaply, efficiently and with less environmental risk than liquid crude in tank cars. Since it floats, Canapux is easier to recover from a spill into a water body. Interest from crude producers, buyers and transport companies picked up after a Canadian court in August overturned Ottawa’s approval for the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion, said James Cairns, CN’s vice-president of petroleum and chemicals. “There have been a lot more discussions about, ‘How do we get this done?’” Cairns said. “Conversations are much more advanced than they were.”  CN is seeking commercial partners to build a pilot plant that will process 10,000 barrels per day of undiluted heavy crude into Canapux. The plant, to be built either at the Alberta crude storage hub around Edmonton or on an oil producer’s site, is estimated to cost less than C$50 million ($37.8 million). It could be running as soon as 2020, Cairns said.  CN’s oil pucks would move in gondola cars, which weigh less than tank cars, allowing the railroad to load them with more crude. They also do not require diluent, an ultra-light oil that is mixed with crude when it is shipped in liquid form by rail or pipeline. As a result, Canapux’ shipping costs would knock off nearly half the expense of rail transportation in liquid form, according to CN.  Other entrepreneurs have pursued similar ideas for several years, from semi-solid blobs to pellets. Alberta inventor Cal Broder said two refineries in China are interested in his BitCrude product, which he intends to produce from bitumen. He plans a test shipment of several containers of his butter-like crude to Asia before year-end. Both BitCrude and Canapux still require government regulatory approvals. Success of either product also hinges on convincing oil refineries to make changes needed to convert solid crude back to liquid for processing.     But the idea of shipping crude in solid form is compelling, said Alex Pourbaix, chief executive of Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO), a major Canadian shipper of crude by rail. “I am quite intrigued by those technologies,” he said in an interview. “We’re going to make sure we take a hard look at them all.” ($1 = 1.3222 Canadian dollars) Reporting by Rod Nickel in Calgary, Alberta; Editing by Dan Grebler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-crude-solids/oil-pucks-and-pellets-canada-eyes-new-ways-to-move-stranded-crude-idUKL2N1WD16H,11 Nov 2018,"Canada's biggest

2018-11-11,"BAGHDAD/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Iraq’s oilfields in the disputed Kirkuk region have taken on new significance after the United States restored oil sanctions against neighboring Iran. Washington is pressuring Baghdad to resume exports that stopped last year. Iraq aims to raise its export capacity to 8.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the coming years from less than 5 million bpd currently, 1 million of which could come via Kirkuk. But that resumption is not just a question of turning the tap back on.  Volume and revenue. The halting of exports from Kirkuk stopped nearly 300,000 bpd flowing out of Iraq towards Turkey and international markets - causing a net revenue loss of some $8 billion since the stoppage last year. Most of Iraq’s exports come from southern fields, but Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil. The United States also sees Kirkuk as an option to help offset global shortfall in oil supply caused by its sanctions on Iran, which forbid purchasing Iranian oil. Washington has pressured Baghdad to suspend all shipments of oil to Iran and resume flows from Kirkuk to Turkey, industry sources say. Exports have been on hold since October 2017 when Iraqi government forces took control of Kirkuk from the semi-autonomous Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq, in response to a referendum calling for Kurdish independence. The Kurds had controlled Kirkuk and its oilfields after Islamic State militants drove the Iraqi army out in 2014, and Kurdish forces in turn ejected the militants. Resumption of exports from Kirkuk depends on negotiations between Baghdad and the Kurds. The pipeline Baghdad once used for exports via Turkey was wrecked by Islamic State - leaving only one working pipeline, built and controlled by the Kurds. Iraq’s government must use that, or build a new pipeline. It is considering both options. On paper, Baghdad. But if Iraq decides to use the Kurdish pipeline to export oil, it needs to negotiate. The Kurds will likely seek a greater share of Iraqi state oil revenue in return. Baghdad might also have to contend with Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM), which bought the Kurdish section of the pipeline last year. As soon as Baghdad and the Kurds reach an agreement - hence U.S. pressure to do so. If no deal is reached, Iraq will have to build the new pipeline, which could take around two years. The Rosneft pipeline has been upgraded to a capacity of 1 million bpd, which could accommodate a current 400,000 bpd coming from other oilfields in Kurdistan, plus the 300,000 bpd that would come from Kirkuk, Kurdish authorities say. Iraqi authorities say they still need to feed local refineries - where Kirkuk’s current output is being diverted - so even if exports from Kirkuk resume, they won’t exceed 100,000 bpd at first, meaning total exports via Kurdistan would be only 500,000 bpd. That would be smaller than peak Kurdish exports of 700,000 bpd before the failed referendum and not enough to help Turkey cut its reliance on Iranian oil.   Iraq and Iran were exchanging only small volumes of oil before the new sanctions - around 30,000 bpd in each direction, including from Kirkuk - but Iraq’s economy as a whole is highly dependent on trade with Iran. Iranian gas supplies feed Iraqi power stations, for example.  Washington has given Iraq a waiver for Iranian gas as well as food items, but says this is only temporary, causing uncertainty in Baghdad.

2018-11-11,"BOGOTA, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol said on Saturday it was mounting another cleanup operation after a bomb attack on the Cano Limon pipeline. The attack is the 78th this year on the 485-mile (780-km) pipeline, which has been out of service for much of 2018 because of bombings and illegal taps. The pipeline, which can transport up to 210,000 barrels per day, was not functioning at the time of the attack. It was also bombed on Thursday. The latest bombing took place in Toledo municipality in Norte de Santander province, Ecopetrol said on Twitter. The company did not say who it held responsible, but military sources have blamed previous attacks on the pipeline on fighters from the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group. The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, has about 1,500 combatants and opposes multinational companies that its leaders accuse of seizing natural resources without benefiting Colombians.
