2018-09-06,"DOR BEACH, Israel (Reuters) - Underwater archaeologists have been scouring the seabed where a gas pipeline is being built off Israel’s coast in a bid to preserve relics near a 5,000-year-old port which once was a key trade hub for the Mediterranean’s ancient civilisations.      The pipeline from the deep-sea Leviathan gas field that is due to begin production late next year comes ashore near Dor Beach in northern Israel, a popular spot among Israeli sunbathers. It is also the site of the ancient port of Dor, where hidden in the seabed lie the vestiges of marine traders throughout the ages - from the Phoenicians to the Romans.   To minimise damage to such relics, the Israel Antiquities Authority has been working over the past year with the Leviathan field’s operator, Texas-based Noble Energy (NBL.N). A team spent weeks scuba diving in the warm crystal clear water off the beach, dispersing silt to uncover ancient artefacts. A remote-operated robot was used for searches in deeper water.  They found earthenware jugs, anchors and the remains of wrecked ships, setting new guidelines for similar future projects. “There has been unprecedented cooperation to protect the antiquities and the cultural assets,” Yaakov Sharvit, director of the Marine Archaeology Unit of the Israel Antiquities Authority, told Reuters TV.  Sharvit said Noble financed most of the archaeological surveys and a large research ship to help extract ancient objects along the pipeline’s route. The pipeline is being buried 15-20 meters below the seabed to minimise any impact on the surroundings. Leviathan was discovered in 2010 about 120 km (75 miles) off Israel’s coast. Its development will be the largest energy project in Israel’s history. “What is unique here in Israel is the ancient place that we’re operating,” said Binyamin Zomer, vice president for regional affairs for Noble Energy. “We work very closely with the Antiquities Authority here in Israel to make sure that should we discover such finds, we first of all avoid causing harm to those areas and secondly, to make sure that they are aware of the resources and potential finds that they have.” His company says the project will not harm the environment and will replace less healthy fossil fuels. But some local environmentalists and residents oppose the plan, which along with the pipeline includes a towering production platform to be built just 10 km from shore. Local resident and marine archaeologist Kurt Raveh, who has been excavating at Dor for decades and founded its diving club, thinks the survey being done is insufficient. He worries the area is at risk from potential pipeline leaks. “We have so many treasures and old shipwrecks and things like that, we should get them out of the water before we can’t enter the water anymore,” he said.

2018-09-06,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday the United States was not seeking to punish India for its proposed purchase of a missile defence system from Russia. India faces the risk of secondary U.S. sanctions for its planned acquisition of the S-400 system from Russia, which it says it needs as a deterrent to China. “Our effort here is not to penalise a great strategic partner like India,” Pompeo told reporters after top level talks with Indian leaders to advance political and security ties between the two democracies. He said Washington was also working with New Delhi to tackle the issue of India’s oil imports from Iran, which face U.S. sanctions. The United States is pushing all countries to halt oil imports from Iran after President Donald Trump in May withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers and ordered a re-imposition of sanctions on it. Some sanctions came in effect on Aug. 6 and the rest, notably in the petroleum sector, on Nov. 4. Trump has warned that anyone trading with Iran would not do business with the United States.

2018-09-06,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Depression Gordon moved north on Thursday, threatening central U.S. states with heavy rain, while Hurricane Florence churned toward Bermuda, packing maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour (185 kph), forecasters said.  Some parts of northwest Mississippi and much of Arkansas could receive up to seven inches (18 cm) of rain, totals that could reach up to 10 inches through Saturday in some areas, raising the risk of flash flooding, the National Hurricane Center said.  The storm, which left flooded streets in Alabama,  Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, has caused minimal property damage since it made landfall late on Tuesday. A two-year-old girl was killed, however, when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, authorities said. Hillarie Jones, manager at Bob’s Downtown Diner in Mobile, Alabama, said she shut down the restaurant on Wednesday but that luckily the storm did no damage to the business. “The reason why we closed yesterday was so our employees wouldn’t have to travel to work during the storm,” Jones said. As of Thursday morning, fewer than 1,000 homes and businesses remained without power, according to PowerOutages.us, as utility companies restored service for tens of thousands of customers across the region.    Energy companies and port operators along the Gulf Coast worked to resume normal operations after Gordon shut 9 percent of the region’s oil and natural gas production. Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday, after fears about the storm eased. In the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Florence, a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale, headed for Bermuda, forecast to affect the island’s surf by Friday. It was too early to say whether the storm would hit land, the NHC said.  “Swells generated by Florence will begin to affect Bermuda on Friday and will reach portions of the U.S. East Coast over the weekend,” the NHC said. “These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.” Florence, the first major hurricane of the Atlantic season, was 1,170 miles (1,885 km) east-southeast of Bermuda on Thursday morning.  Florence is expected to weaken but remain a strong hurricane for the next several days, the NHC said.

2018-09-06,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda said on Thursday its national oil firm and Chinese offshore oil and gas company CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK) had signed an agreement to jointly conduct exploration in a new block in the East African country. The deal was signed in Beijing on the margins of the ongoing China-Africa forum on cooperation, which is being attended by Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni. A statement issued by his office said CNOOC and Uganda National Oil Company signed a memorandum of understanding “to jointly explore a new oil and gas block in the Albertine Graben, on the southern part of Lake Albert.”  “The exploration aims to increase the amount of crude oil produced in Uganda to support the operations of the refinery as well as the oil pipeline,” it said.  Uganda is expected to start crude production in 2021 in the Albertine rift basin near the border with Democratic Republic of Congo, where reserves estimated at 6.5 billion barrels were discovered more than a decade ago. CNOOC already operates in Uganda, jointly owning fields with France’s Total (TOTF.PA) and London-listed Tullow Oil (TLW.L). The statement did not say which block would be jointly explored but authorities are keen to increase exploration activity in the wider, lower part of the Albertine rift after successful discoveries in the northern part. Landlocked Uganda aims to both export crude via a pipeline  through neighbouring Tanzania and also domestically process a portion of the output at a refinery planned for development near the oil fields.

2018-09-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s top military official said on Thursday his forces were prepared to carry out strikes on Syrian targets if chemical weapons were used in an expected government offensive to retake the northern province of Idlib.  Russia, an ally of President Bashar al-Assad, resumed air strikes against insurgents in Idlib on Tuesday after weeks of bombardment and shelling by pro-government Syrian forces in an apparent prelude to a full-scale offensive against the last major enclave held be rebels. “We are ready to strike if chemical weapons were used again,” Armed Forces Chief Francois Lecointre told a small group of reporters. “They can be carried out at national level but it’s in our interest to do it with as many partners as possible.” In April, France, the United States and Britain launched more than 100 missiles at pro-government targets in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack.  The prospect of an offensive on Idlib alarms aid agencies. The United Nations has said about half of the 3 million people living in rebel-held areas of the northwest have already been displaced. It estimates some 10,000 jihadists are in the area.  Lecointre said he expected the final pockets of Islamic State resistance in Syria and Iraq to be defeated by the end of November.     Idlib’s fate now appears likely to rest on a summit on Friday in Tehran between the leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran - a meeting that Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said would make the situation “clearer”. While the United States and its allies have warned of a blood bath, they have made clear they would only intervene should they deem that chemical weapons have been used. A French military source said the indications were that Russia and its allies wanted to wrap up the Idlib offensive by the end of the year. The source said Paris believed the United States would maintain its military presence in Kurdish-controlled northwestern regions of Syria given that Washington wanted to limit Iran’s influence in Syria.

2018-09-06,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake paralyzed Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido on Thursday, killing at least seven people, triggering landslides and knocking out power to its 5.3 million residents. The death toll from the 6.7-magnitude, pre-dawn quake was likely to rise as rescuers searched houses buried by landslides.  About 33 people were missing and 300 were injured, public broadcaster NHK said. Four people were in cardiopulmonary arrest, a term used before death is officially confirmed. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2oJz6zd)     The quake was the latest in a string of natural disasters to batter Japan after typhoons, flooding and a record-breaking heat wave within the past two months. Aerial footage showed dozens of landslides exposing barren hillsides near the town of Atsuma in southern Hokkaido, with mounds of red earth and toppled trees piled at the edge of green fields.  The collapsed remains of what appeared to be houses or barns were strewn about. “It came in four big jerks - boom! boom! boom! boom!” one unidentified woman told NHK. “Before we knew it our house was bent and we couldn’t open the door.” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said 25,000 Self-Defense Force troops would be deployed for rescue operations. The island, a tourist destination about the size of Austria known for its mountains, lakes and seafood, lost its power when Hokkaido Electric Power Co (9509.T) shut down of all its fossil fuel-fired power plants after the quake as a precaution.  It was the first time since the utility was established in 1951 that had happened. Almost 12 hours later, power was restored to parts of Sapporo, Hokkaido’s capital, and Asahikawa, its second-biggest city.  The government said there was damage to Hokkaido Electric’s Tomato-Atsuma plant, which supplies half the island’s 2.95 million households. It could take a week to restore power fully to all residents, Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko said.        All trains across the island were halted. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party begins a leadership contest on Friday but said there would be no campaigning through to Sunday. Abe and rival Shigeru Ishiba both canceled campaign media appearances slated for Friday. Television footage from Sapporo showed crumbled roads and mud covering a main street. Police directed traffic because signal lights were out while drink-vending machines, ubiquitous in Japan, and most ATMs were not working. “Without electricity, there’s nothing I can do except to write prescriptions,” a doctor in Abira, the town next to Atsuma, told NHK. Media reported a baby girl at a Sapporo hospital was in critical condition after the power was cut to her respirator. It wasn’t clear if the hospital had a generator. The quake hit at 3:08 a.m. (1808 GMT Wednesday) at a depth of 40 km (25 miles), with its epicenter about 65 km (40 miles) southeast of Sapporo, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. In Atsuma, it registered a 7 on Japan’s 7-point quake intensity scale, the agency said, revising an earlier measurement. Hokkaido’s main airport was closed, at least for the day. Debris and water could be seen on the terminal floors. Kyodo news agency said more than 200 flights and 40,000 passengers would be affected on Thursday alone. The closure comes just days after Kansai Airport, another major regional hub, in western Japan, was shut by Typhoon Jebi, which killed 11 people and injured hundreds.  The storm, the most powerful to hit Japan in 25 years, stranded thousands of passengers and workers at the airport, whose operator said it would resume some domestic flights on Friday. In July, torrential rain in west Japan caused flooding that killed more than 200 people and widespread destruction. That was followed by a heat wave that reached a record 41.1 Celsius and led to the deaths of at least 80 people. Farming, tourism and other services are big economic drivers on Hokkaido, which accounts for just 3.6 percent of Japan’s gross domestic product, but there is some industry. Kirin Brewery and Sapporo Breweries both said factories were shut by the power outage. A series of smaller shocks followed the initial quake, the JMA said. Residents were warned to take precautions. By the afternoon, backhoes and other earth-moving equipment in Atsuma had begun clearing debris. Japan is situated on the “Ring of Fire” arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Basin. Northeast Japan was hit by a 9 magnitude earthquake on March 11, 2011, that triggered a tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people and led to meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Hokkaido’s Tomari nuclear power station, which has been shut since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, suffered a power outage but officials said it was cooling its spent nuclear fuel safely. Saturday marked the 95th anniversary of the Great Kanto earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.9 and killed more than 140,000 people in the Tokyo area. Seismologists have said another such quake could strike the capital at any time.

Triggering a blackout just after 3 a.m. local time, the magnitude 6.7 quake left at least seven people dead, more than 100 injured and dozens missing on Hokkaido, an island of about 5.3 million people whose capital is Sapporo. A major coal-fired power station was also damaged in the temblor that shut down the grid. The situation at utility Hokkaido Electric Power’s three-reactor Tomari nuclear plant provided an uncomfortable, if comparatively brief, echo of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. Reactors there melted down after a massive tsunami knocked out back-up generators, designed to maintain power to cool reactors in emergencies. Though Tomari was shut down after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, it needs electricity to keep fuel rods cool, and had to rely on back-up diesel generators that kicked in after the quake until power was restored to all three reactors by 1 p.m. local time. Hokkaido Electric is now scrambling to get power restored to households, factories and other customers, even as rescuers bring in heavy machinery and digging equipment to search for survivors that may be trapped in stricken buildings. In another echo of the 2011 disaster, Hokkaido’s situation was compounded by difficulties in receiving supplies from neighbouring regions that remain dominated by separate utilities with their own grids. A Hokkaido Electric spokesman said the utility was not receiving any supplies from the island of Honshu to the south - home to Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya - despite there being a 600 megawatt connection for transferring power from the coast of Japan’s main island. “Nationwide, they have been trying to bolster power systems by linking these fairly Balkanized domains, but it’s not as easy as it sounds,” said Andrew DeWit, professor of energy policy at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. “It requires equipment like transformers that is quite expensive and tailor-made.” Damage to transmission lines, transformers and other equipment from the quake is likely also delaying the restoration of power, DeWit said. By early afternoon, Hokkaido Electric had restarted one 125 megawatt coal-fired unit at its Sunagawa station. Its Tomato-Atsuma coal station, which normally supplies about half the island’s electricity, remained shut after sustaining damage in the quake. The abrupt halt in supplies from Tomato-Atsuma caused such a huge imbalance in supply and demand that other power plants on Hokkaido had to be shut own, industry minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters in Tokyo. it may take a week to restore power fully to Hokkaido, he said. Thursday’s blackout prompted the shutdown of Hokkaido’s New Chitose Airport, a popular gateway to the most northern of Japan’s main islands, the second major airport to be knocked out in the country in two days after a typhoon swamped the nation’s third-biggest. A number of industrial plants and factories were also affected. A fire that broke out at a steel production facility at Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing’s joint venture with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp in Muroran, Hokkaido, was extinguished with little damage to the facilities, a company official said. The plant will work towards resuming special steel production after power supply from Hokkaido Electric is restored, the official said. It usually takes about eight hours to resume production after the power supply has been secured, he said. Meanwhile Idemitsu Kosan, Japan’s second-biggest refiner by sales, stopped all refining and product shipments at its 150,000 barrels per day Hokkaido refinery, the only one on the island, an official told Reuters. Kirin Beer, part of giant drinks maker Kirin Holdings Co , said it closed its Chitose plant, which accounts for about 5 percent of its beer output, because of the power outage. There was no structural damage to the factory, it said. Sapporo Holdings Ltd said it closed down its Hokkaido brewery because of the lack of power.

2018-09-06,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - World shares fell for a fifth straight day on Thursday as investors braced for another escalation in a trade war between the United States and China, while emerging-market currencies paused near 15-month lows. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent. Stocks in Europe opened lower, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index as much as 0.4 percent down. The main worry for investors was the end of a public consultation period on Thursday for U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods. Trump said on Wednesday trade talks with China would continue but the United States was not yet ready to come to an agreement. “Unlike the last few days, where there has at least been a wave of PMI (purchasing manager indexes) to deal with, Thursday has little in the way of distraction for the European markets, meaning investors are just going to have to sit and stew in this particularly unpleasant trading broth,” said Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex. Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped more than 1 percent to a one-year trough of 515.24 points. It was last down 0.8 percent. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.4 percent and Australian shares dropped 1.1 percent. China’s blue-chip index fell 1.1 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index 1 percent. Further weighing on sentiment, data out earlier showed German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in July, another sign that factories in Europe’s largest economy are feeling the bite of protectionist trade politics. Investors are also watching for developments as the United States and Canada resume talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada insisted there was room to salvage the pact despite few signs a deal was imminent . The dollar, considered a safe haven at times of turmoil because of its status as the world’s reserve currency, has generally benefited from the trade conflicts. It has gained 8 percent since the end of March, with currencies in emerging markets taking a hammering. But measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar retreated from the two-week highs it reached earlier this week to stand 0.1 percent lower at 95.07. The euro was a tad stronger at $1.1636. Sterling held on to gains made on Wednesday as investors positioned for a favourable Brexit outcome. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.2910. Emerging markets have been hit by the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey. In Indonesia’s central bank has had to intervene several times in recent weeks to stem the rupiah’s slide. Indonesia’s benchmark stock index was last up nearly 1 percent while the rupiah also gained a tad. MSCI’s index of emerging market currencies, which had earlier paused near 15-month lows, was up 0.1 percent on the day after two straight days of heavy declines. But analysts warned about further losses because investors were no longer looking at Argentina, Turkey and South Africa as isolated cases. They were fretting over the impact of rising U.S. inflation and interest rates on heavily indebted economies. “As global monetary conditions slowly tighten, the global economic cycle rolls over and the U.S. President disturbs the global trade cycle, there’s definitely more to the EM sell-off than a few unrelated spots of weakness,” wrote strategists at Societe Generale in a note to clients. The emerging market equity index has been crunched in the past month or so, falling for six consecutive sessions and down more than 3 percent this week. A range of factors have hit the stocks: policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the crises in Turkey and Argentina, the Sino-U.S. trade war and broader concerns about China’s economy. “We doubt that the main factors which have caused equities across much of the emerging world to weaken together recently will go away just yet,” Capital Economics said in a note. In commodities, oil prices fell as emerging market woes weighed on sentiment. U.S. crude eased 0.1 percent to $68.65 a barrel. Brent was last down 0.1 percent at $68.64. Gold was stronger with spot gold up half a percent at $1,202.15 an ounce. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Danilo

2018-09-06,"SYDNEY, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Pacific island nations declared climate change to be their “single greatest threat”, urging Washington to return to the Paris Agreement on climate, just as Western powers seek to check China’s rising influence in the region. Australia, which has backed away from its own commitment to Paris without exiting the pact, was among the 18 nations of the Pacific Islands Forum that made the call at a meeting of leaders on the tiny island state of Nauru. “Climate change presents the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and well-being of Pacific people,” the leaders said in a communique, asking the United States to return to the climate pact. “The aspiration is for the U.S. to be in the Paris Agreement again, because we cannot have comprehensive robust emission reduction unless the biggest emitter of greenhouse gas is there in the process, we cannot leave the U.S. out,” Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu, told a news conference. However, participants said one country would not agree to even stronger language in the communique, and Sopoaga made clear which it was, although he stopped short of naming it. “The name of the qualifier (started with) alphabetical A, capital A,” Sopoaga told Wednesday’s news conference, held after the leaders’ meeting. No forum member’s name, apart from Australia’s, begins with the letter ‘A’. A spokesman for Australia’s foreign minister had no immediate response. The demand for action over the low-lying islands of the Pacific, seen as the front line of global climate change, comes as rising sea levels and other climate-related crises force residents to move to higher ground. Against this backdrop, China’s vocal support for tackling global warming aids its drive to win allies and influence in the strategically significant and resource-rich area. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favoured other countries and put the United States at a disadvantage. Climate change is domestic political dynamite in Australia, one of the world’s largest coal exporters, which has also sought to push back against China’s influence in the Pacific. Wednesday’s communique endorsed “with qualification” a separate, stronger statement, from seven small Pacific Island states seeking “urgent resolution” of Paris rules to cap the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius. “If that cap is not reached, there are going to be serious problems on islands like Tuvalu,” Sopoaga said, citing an estimate of island submergence by 2030 from the U.S. Geological Survey. “2030 is not far away, our grandchildren would still be growing up and the islands of Tuvalu and Kiribati and, maybe, part of Nauru would be submerged.” (Reporting by Tom Westbrook and Colin Packham; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/pacific-forum-climatechange/pacific-leaders-want-u-s-back-in-paris-climate-pact-idUKL3N1VS3EB,06 Sep 2018,"Pacific island nations declared

2018-09-06,"(Repeats story first published on Wednesday, no changes to text) * About a quarter of Frankfurt-registered cars affected * Merkel under pressure to order automakers to retrofit cars * Retrofits could cost industry billions of euros By Ilona Wissenbach WIESBADEN, Germany, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Frankfurt, Germany’s financial centre, must ban highly-polluting, older diesel vehicles from the city centre from next February as part of a plan to improve air quality, the country’s  administrative court ruled on Wednesday. The decision by the court in Wiesbaden on a case brought by environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) came after a landmark ruling by Germany’ top administrative court in February opened the door to inner-city bans. The ban would affect about a quarter of cars registered in Frankfurt and numerous commuters who live around the city. DUH leader Juergen Resch said the decision would help accelerate the shift to electric cars and called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to force carmakers to pay to retrofit diesel vehicles with exhaust-cleaning systems to avoid a ban. The regional government of Hessen also called for a speedy reaction from Berlin on retrofits, which the car industry has lobbied against because it could cost billions of euros. “We want a fundamental solution to this problem, rather than driving bans,” state premier Volker Bouffier and Environment Minister Priska Hinz said in a joint statement. Merkel has said she will do everything possible to avoid driving bans but disagreements over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions have strained her coalition with the Social Democrats. The ruling comes a day after Mercedes-Benz unveiled its much-anticipated electric SUV, marking the start of a German onslaught against Tesla’s dominance of the fast-growing market for premium battery cars. The court ruled that Frankfurt must ban from next February diesel cars that meet Euro-4 and older emission standards, and petrol cars that meet Euro-1 and 2 standards, while Euro-5 diesels must be banned from next September. “The driving ban is necessary because all other measures considered by the state will not lead to a significant reduction of nitrogen dioxide emissions in an appropriate time,” said presiding judge Rolf Hartmann. The court also ordered other measures to cut pollution in Frankfurt such as more electric buses, higher parking fees and more park-and-ride places on the outskirts of the city. DUH has argued that banning diesels is the only way for Frankfurt to meet European Union clean air rules which stipulate that nitrogen dioxide pollution should not exceed 40 micrograms per cubic meter of air on average. “We need to understand that this is about a threat to our health,” Hartmann said in his opening remarks, adding that this was not merely a niche matter for environmentalists. Pollution levels have regularly exceeded the limit since 2010, the court heard. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked diesel models that fail to meet the latest Euro-6 emissions standards from using selected trunk roads. Other cities including Aachen, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart, home to Daimler and Porsche, are also considering bans. The threat of bans on diesel vehicles has already led to higher sales of petrol engine cars in Germany, which are less fuel efficient and cause more carbon dioxide pollution. This in turn makes it harder for carmakers to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, increasing pressure on them to push electric or hybrid vehicles.

2018-09-06,"* New rules on cleaner shipping fuels kick in from 2020 * Goldman says more ships have been adding cleaning systems * Says will help marine fuel markets find balance (Recasts, adds detail) SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - New oil refining capacity and an increase in the number of ships adding cleaning systems to their smokestacks will help marine fuel markets find balance once new sulphur regulations kick in, Goldman Sachs said. To combat air pollution, the United Nations’ shipping agency has set global regulations to cap sulphur content in marine fuel at 0.5 percent from 2020, down from 3.5 percent now. Ships without sulphur-stripping technologies, or scrubbers, would have to burn costlier low-sulphur fuels such as marine gasoil or low-sulphur fuel oil to comply with the clean air rules. “We expect scrubber installations to rise quickly, with scrubbed ships keeping a third of current high-sulphur fuel in compliant use,” Goldman said in a note on Thursday. “Ongoing refinery capacity additions and the redirection of fuel oil and crude flows should go a long way to balancing the global fuel markets, with more onerous utilization and yield shifts making up the difference,” the bank said. Shippers and refiners were initially slow to make investment decisions to comply with the upcoming sulphur cap due to uncertainty around the enforcement of the rules and costs of compliance. Goldman forecasts scrubber installations at 3,125 in 2020 and 4,450 in 2022. It expects scrubbed high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) consumption at a total of 1 million barrels per day (mbpd) by 2020 and 1.4 mpbd by 2025. The global shipping industry burned a total of 3.3 million barrels per day (mbpd) of high-sulphur marine fuels in 2017, according to the bank. Goldman’s forecasts for higher than expected HSFO consumption mirrors similar outlook revisions from other energy researchers in August amid changing attitudes to scrubbers from shippers. “At an 80 percent compliance rate, we model that the market can reach equilibrium at a distillate-HSFO spread near current forwards, although at higher distillate cracks,” Goldman Sachs said. “We highlight, however, that this regulation’s costs may end up varying sharply with global growth and oil prices.” Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman and Vijaykumar Vedala in

U.S. sanctions against Iran, however, prevented prices from falling further as they are expected to tighten the market after being implemented from November, traders said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $68.59 per barrel at 0645 GMT, down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures fell by 4 cents, to $77.23 a barrel. Emerging market woes are weighing on global economic growth prospects, with Asian shares on Thursday heading for their sixth straight session of losses. Meanwhile, a public comment period on possible U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, with expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will impose the additional levies. “The prospects of increased supplies from OPEC and her allies, and weaker demand from China and other emerging markets could weigh further on oil prices going forward, or at least limit the upside potential,” said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at futures brokerage Forex. “This is because of the U.S. dollar’s strength, weighing heavily on emerging market currencies, including the yuan, which in turn has pushed up the costs of all dollar-denominated commodities,” he said. U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week as refineries boosted output amid strong consumption, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.17 million barrels to 404.5 million barrels in the week to Aug. 31, while refinery crude runs rose by 198,000 barrels per day (bpd), the data showed. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Wednesday it expected global oil demand to break through 100 million bpd for the first time this year. Meanwhile, there are concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran, which will target the OPEC-member’s oil industry from November, will tighten global supply. A further risk is seen in OPEC-member Venezuela, where a government and political crisis has halved oil production in the last two years to little more than 1 million bpd. David Maher, managing director for energy at commodity trading house RCMA Group, said Venezuela’s “declines will continue” as a “lack of cash and infrastructural collapse (are) not easy to fix”. U.S. investment bank Jefferies said “the Brent forward curve has inverted to backwardation, signalling a tightening market that already feels the effects of declining Iranian exports.” Backwardation describes a forward curve in which prices for immediate delivery are higher than those for dispatch later on. This signals tight market conditions as it gives traders an incentive to immediately sell oil instead of putting it into storage. Front-month Brent crude is currently more than $3 per barrel more expensive than for September 2019. RCMA’s Maher said he expected Brent prices to average $80 per barrel in 2019.

European shares were expected to be subdued too with futures for Eurostoxx 50, Germany’s DAX and London’s FTSE all starting lower. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped more than 1 percent to hit a one-year trough of 515.24 points. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.4 percent while Australian shares faltered 1.1 percent. China’s blue-chip index fell 1.2 while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 1.5 percent. Investors were on edge with a public consultation period on the Trump administration’s intent to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods ending on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States was not yet ready to come to an agreement over trade disputes with China but he said talks would continue. “An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war may be imminent, the timing is somewhat unclear and this justifies caution even given the (U.S. dollar) pullback,” JPMorgan analysts said. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar index retreated from two-week highs hit earlier this week to stand flat at 95.16. “Conviction and participation will likely remain light until an announcement,” they said. Further weighing on sentiment, data out earlier showed German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in July in another sign that factories in Europe’s largest economy are feeling the bite of protectionist trade politics. The euro was a tad softer at $1.1624. Investors are also watching for developments as the United States and Canada resume talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada insisted there was room to salvage the pact despite few signs a deal was imminent. The dollar, considered a safe haven at times of turmoil because of its status as the world’s reserve currency, has generally benefited from these trade uncertainties. It has gained 8 percent since end-March, with currencies in emerging markets taking a hammering. The financial crises in Argentina and Turkey have sent shivers through emerging markets while in Indonesia the central bank has had to intervene several times in recent weeks to stem the rupiah currency’s slide. Indonesia’s benchmark stock index was last up 0.1 percent while the rupiah also gained a tad. An index of emerging market currencies paused near 15-month lows after two straight days of heavy declines. But analysts warned about further losses as investors were no longer looking at Argentina, Turkey and South Africa as isolated cases. They are fretting over the impact of rising U.S. inflation and interest rates on heavily indebted Asian economies. “The upshot is that this pause should not be mistaken for a panacea to the ongoing emerging market crisis, which demands utmost policy vigilance; and perhaps coordination,” analysts at Mizuho said in a note. The emerging market equity index has been crunched in the past month or so, falling for six consecutive sessions and down more than 3 percent this week. Analysts at Capital Economics believe there is room for further declines. A range of factors have hit EM stocks recently, namely policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, crises in Turkey and Argentina, the Sino-U.S. trade war and broader concerns about China’s economy. “We doubt that the main factors which have caused equities across much of the emerging world to weaken together recently will go away just yet,” Capital Economics said in a note. Elsewhere, sterling held on to gains made on Wednesday as investors positioned for a favourable Brexit outcome. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.2910. In commodities, oil prices fell as emerging market woes weighed on sentiment. U.S. crude eased 14 cents to $68.58 a barrel while Brent was last down 7 cents at $77.21.

2018-09-06,"BEIJING (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Thursday it has signed a preliminary deal to build a petrochemical complex and invest in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in China, the latest major foreign investment in the world’s top chemicals market. The agreement worth billions of dollars with the southern Guangdong provincial government includes a 1.2 million-tonne-per-year (tpy) ethylene plant, two polyethylene production lines and two polypropylene lines in the coastal city of Huizhou, it said. Exxon also agreed to participate in a provincial project to build an LNG terminal in Huizhou and to supply LNG for it, it said. No details about the capacity of the project or timeline were given. China is allowing greater access by global majors and local independents to its massive chemicals market to feed plastics, coatings and adhesives to the fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors. Exxon would be one of only a few international oil majors to invest in LNG infrastructure in China as the country tries to shore up supplies amid a switch to gas-fired boilers by factories and households as part of the government’s battle against smog. The news comes after German chemical giant BASF (BASFn.DE) announced plans in July to invest $10 billion to build China’s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex, also in Guangdong. The project includes a steam cracker producing 1 million tonnes a year of ethylene. Details of the ownership structure of Exxon’s chemical plant and LNG investment were not released on Thursday. Still, the deal could be seen as a goodwill gesture by China amid a deepening trade war between the United States and China as the world’s top two economies have traded tit-for-tat punitive tariffs that target $50 billion of each other’s goods. Washington was holding hearings this week on another round of proposed duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that appear likely to take effect in late September or early October. The agreement comes a day before a planned meeting in Beijing between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Exxon chairman and chief executive Darren Woods.     The preliminary deal was signed with the local governments of Guangdong province and Huizhou as well as state power company, Guangdong Yuedian Group, according to the Guangzhou Daily.  While the petrochemical deal was largely expected following a joint study signed late last year, the push on LNG was a surprise and would mark a second investment in China’s gas infrastructure by an international oil company.   “It marks a salient step for Exxon in their pursuit of becoming an LNG portfolio player,” said Saul Kavonic, director for Asia Pacific markets and head of energy research at Credit Suisse in Australia. An investment in the import facility and downstream gas marketing will help it boost sales and margins compared with just selling the fuel at the import terminal gate, Kavonic added.  BP (BP.L) is so far the only global major with a stake in a gas receiving terminal in China, a joint venture with state-owned CNOOC which began operations 12 years ago.  Exxon said it is also looking at other chemicals manufacturing projects in Asia to help meet expected demand growth in the region. A decision to proceed with the petchem project will be based on a number of factors, including the receipt of permits and project competitiveness, it said. Startup is planned for 2023.     Exxon already owns a 25-percent stake in a refinery and petrochemical plant in Fujian in partnership with China’s top state refiner Sinopec.

2018-09-06,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - One of the standout commodity performers this year has been thermal coal, but not all coal is created equal and disparities in pricing may help explain why India’s imports have stayed strong despite the higher costs. The main benchmark for thermal coal in Asia is priced at Australia’s Newcastle Port, the world’s largest coal-export harbour. The price has gained 11.8 percent so far this year, to close at $114.66 a tonne in the week to Sept. 2, according to assessments by Argus Media. This isn’t far off the 6-1/2 year high of nearly $120 a tonne hit in July, with the price surge this year largely coming on the back of increased Chinese demand for coal to be burned in power stations. What has been somewhat surprising is that India, the world’s second-largest coal importer behind China, has defied its prior history of being a price-sensitive buyer and boosted its imports this year. But delving into the detail offers an explanation as to why this is the case, the price of the bulk of the coal India imports has been declining, especially in recent months. India imported 128.7 million tonnes of coal in the first eight months of the year, up 10.6 percent on the same period last year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters. Of this, 50.4 million tonnes came from Indonesia, making the Southeast Asian nation India’s top supplier. India tends to import lower quality coal from Indonesia, with a typical grade being fuel with an energy rating of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg). The price for this type of coal, as assessed by Argus Media, has been declining since late June, dropping to $37.72 a tonne in the week ended Aug. 31. It has fallen 22.5 percent since June 22 and is now down 19.4 percent so far this year. The gap between Newcastle coal with an energy content of 6,000 kcal/kg and Indonesian 4,200 kcal/kg is now at its widest since early 2011. This appears to have shored up Indian buying of Indonesian coal, with imports rising in August to 6.97 million tonnes, up from 5.5 million in July, according to the vessel-tracking data. Given the recent difficulties state-controlled Coal India has experienced in meeting domestic requirements, it’s little surprise that Indian buyers have ramped up purchases from Indonesia. It’s also worth noting that India hasn’t increased the amount of coal it buys from other top suppliers. Australia is India’s second-largest supplier, but it ships almost exclusively coking coal used in steelmaking, and is thus not a competitor with Indonesia. However, South Africa exports thermal coal, which is similar in quality and pricing to Australia’s Newcastle benchmark. India imported 3 million tonnes from South Africa in August, down from 3.2 million in July, perhaps indicating less of an appetite for the more expensive, but higher quality fuel. One question that remains to be answered is: why is the price of Indonesian low-grade coal falling while higher grades are still either rising or staying close to multi-year highs? While it’s too early to provide a definitive answer, it appears that China may be buying less Indonesian coal, with imports dropping to 9.42 million tonnes in August from 10.3 million tonnes in both July and June, according to vessel-tracking data. China has also struggled with domestic coal availability, mainly as a result of self-imposed output restrictions as part of efforts to combat air pollution. This has boosted demand for imports, but it seems Chinese buyers are preferring higher energy content Australian coal over Indonesian grades. Much of the coal China buys from Indonesia is used as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies, in a compromise that sees a drop in overall energy content but also a drop in sulphur and ash, given Indonesian coal is low in these pollutants.

2018-09-06,"NEW ORLEANS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Tropical Depression Gordon was expected on Thursday to dump more heavy rains that could cause flooding in central U.S. states as Hurricane Florence, a monster Category 3 storm, churned toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Downpours have flooded streets in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi as the storm headed north and threatened to bring heavy rains to the Mississippi Valley and the Midwest over the next few days, the NHC said. Some areas could get up to 5 inches (13 cm) of rain on Thursday and cause flash flooding, the center said. The storm, which made landfall late on Tuesday, has caused minimal property damage so far, the NHC said, but a 2-year-old girl died when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, authorities said. As of Wednesday night, more than 2,000 homes and businesses remained without power as utility companies restored service for tens of thousands of customers across the region. Energy companies and port operators along the Gulf Coast took steps to resume normal operations after Gordon shut 9 percent of the region’s oil and natural gas production. Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday, after fears about the storm eased. In the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Florence, a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale, barreled toward Bermuda on Wednesday, packing maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph). The first major hurricane of the Atlantic season will affect Bermuda’s surf by Friday, but it was too early to say whether it would hit land. “Swells from Florence could also reach the U.S. East Coast by early next week,” the NHC said. Florence was 1,235 miles (1,990 km) east-southeast of Bermuda on Wednesday night. Some weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, “but Florence is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through early next week,” the NHC said.

2018-09-06,"(Adds details) TOKYO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Restoring full power across Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido will take at least a week after a powerful earthquake struck early in the day, damaging its largest fossil fuel power plant, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko said on Thursday. The government is seeking to restore partial power to some areas as soon as possible once Hokkaido Electric Power Co restarts its Sunagawa coal-fired plant, Seko said. Hokkaido Electric had been aiming to first restart its Tomato-Atsuma plant, which supplies about half the island’s power, but repairs are projected to take at least a week after the breakout of a fire from the No.4 unit’s turbine and boiler damage at units No.1 and No.2, Seko said. Hokkaido Electric has restarted four hydropower units with a total capacity of 300 megawatts (MW) and will restart the 250-MW Sunagawa coal-fired plant on Thursday, he said. The company will also restart its 350-MW coal-fired Naie plant, oil-fired 700-MW Date plant and 700-MW oil-fired Shiriuchi plant from as early as Friday, Seko said. The restoration of 2.9 gigwatts (GW) of power is expected to be possible by the end of Friday, including 600-MW of power coming across from the mainland, he said. Peak power demand in Hokkaido, however, reaches 3.8 GW, so the restoration of all power across the island should take at least another week, Seko said. Hokkaido Electric said this is the first time since its establishment in 1951 that power has been lost across the entire island. Reporting by Kazuhiko Tamaki, Osamu Tsukimori and Ran Kim;

2018-09-06,"(Repeats with no changes in text) * Imports of Iran oil up 56 pct in August year on year * Indian refiners were attracted by Iranian discounts * Washington wants Iran oil trade to stop from November By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - India imported about 523,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran in August, down 32 percent on a month earlier, preliminary tanker arrival data showed, as the United States steps up pressure on buyers to halt Iranian energy imports from November. Some of the shipments were loaded in July and arrived in August, the data obtained by Reuters from trade sources showed. The August 2018 imports were still 56 percent higher than the same month last year, the data showed, as state refiners were attracted by discounts offered by Iran this year. Annual import plans by Indian state refiners for 2018/2019 were finalised before President Donald Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions. A senior Indian government official said India, Iran’s top oil client after China, would not completely halt Iranian imports and would finalise its strategy on crude purchases after a meeting U.S. officials on Thursday. In April-August, the first five months of the 2018/2019 fiscal year, India’s oil imports from Iran rose 43 percent to 646,200 bpd compared to the same period a year earlier, the data showed. State-run Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, imported about 4 million barrels in August, equivalent to about 134,000 bpd, or half the amount it imported in July. State refiners have faced delays in securing permission to use Iranian tankers and insurance, as federal policy requires them to favour Indian shippers and insurers, industry experts said. Western and Indian shippers are winding down their exposure to Iran before sanctions take effect. Bharat Petroleum Corp’s received about 131,000 bpd Iranian oil in August, a third less than July, the data showed. Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, and Hindustan Petroleum Corp NS> did not buy oil from Iran in August. Monthly imports by Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals’ and Nayara Energy, part owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft, were little changed at about 120,000 bpd and 138,000 bpd, respectively, the data showed.

2018-09-06,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A wave of contaminated fuel that has clogged and damaged engines on hundreds of oil tankers and container vessels in the past months has pushed shippers to demand stricter quality controls around the world. The calls are shining a light on the notoriously opaque shipping fuel sector, where any contamination can spread quickly and be difficult to trace back to its source. That is because large volumes of fuel oil are blended with so-called cutter stocks by suppliers and sold on through an extensive network of middlemen before finding their way into ships’ fuel tanks. This tide of dirty fuel comes when the shipping industry, the backbone of global commerce with over 90 percent of the world’s traded goods transported on the oceans, is bracing for an unprecedented shift to lower-sulphur fuel from 2020. “We strongly believe that the (marine) fuel industry should get a grip on the situation and take on the responsibility it has in these matters,” said Mads P. Zacho, chief executive officer at Danish shipping company J. Lauritzen. When approached for comment on the tainted fuel, the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) referred Reuters to a statement issued in late-July in which it said it was “not useful to seek to apportion fault when there is no agreement as to what the root cause is”.  The contamination first emerged at the U.S. Gulf coast as early as January this year, but the exact suppliers and sources of the contaminants remain unknown.  It then spread to places such as Singapore, the world’s largest hub for marine fuel, also known as bunker fuel, and onto other ports in Asia. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said in a statement emailed on Thursday that contaminants had been detected in a “small handful” of fuel samples from Singapore between April and July.     “All the affected bunker suppliers in Singapore had exercised due diligence in adhering to both international and local bunker fuel quality control requirements,” the MPA said, adding that it had “stepped up sampling checks and testing”.  The Port of Houston Authority did not respond to requests for comment. The tainted fuel can harm engines in ways such as clogging pipelines or overwhelming fuel filters, Singapore-based marine fuel surveyor and consulting firm Maritec Pte Ltd has said. Some damage can be repaired at sea, but other cases have required vessels to return to port. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said that at least two oil tankers operated by oil giant BP (BP.L) had been hit by cases of contaminated fuel that cost “big money and big delays”. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media, while BP did not respond to Reuters request for comment. “You have bunker ports where the contaminated fuel exists, then it gets sliced and diced over different suppliers and different bunker barges, then eventually it hits the ship operator,” said Douglas Raitt, regional consultancy manager at ship classifier Lloyd’s Register. He added that, while it was difficult to give an exact number, around 200 to 300 ships could have been affected globally, which would dwarf previous such problems. “This lack of investigation into such a serious breach of safety norms is totally inadequate and hugely disappointing,” Intertanko, an association of independent tanker owners and operators with a combined fleet of almost 4,000 ships, said in a statement in August. It did not specify which authorities it thought should investigate the issue. For a graphic on Singapore shipping, bunker volumes, click tmsnrt.rs/2wQyagj While regulations governing marine fuel standards have been established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations’ shipping agency, “in practice few countries appear to be properly discharging these obligations”, said John Bradshaw, technical director at the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80 percent of the world’s merchant fleet. “Most countries take a position that it is a commercial matter between fuel suppliers and purchasers and that they have no obligation in ensuring the quality of fuel oil supplied to ships in areas under their jurisdiction,” said Bradshaw.  Fuel standards in other mass transport sectors, including aviation, tend to be strictly enforced as problems there could lead to fatal accidents. The marine fuel industry has had its fair share of scandals, including large-scale fuel-theft and illegal under-selling of fuel through what the industry calls the ‘cappuccino effect’, where sticky fuel oil is frothed to inflate its apparent volume to buyers. The IBIA said that a common, but speculative, view was that the current wave of contagion likely came from “inappropriate cutter stocks used in the production of bunkers at one or more refineries and/or terminals”. The industry uses cutter stocks to help meet marine fuel grade specifications.  “In similar cases in the past, the source of the contaminant was never adequately identified, but ... the root cause was by and large a lack of control of the quality of cutter stock used in the marine pool,” the IBIA said. Meanwhile, the IMO will from 2020 force shippers to use fuels with 0.5 percent sulphur content by mass, down from 3.5 percent currently. “Problems with contaminated fuels might become an even bigger problem in 2020 because you have to think about the fact that 0.50 percent mass sulphur fuel requires a lot more blending than 3.50 percent mass sulphur fuel,” said Raitt at Lloyd’s Register. Intertanko said that if the fuel delivered to ships continued to lack quality controls, that could also undermine “a safe and smooth enforcement” of the 2020 rules.  “If those responsible for providing good, lasting quality fuels ... show the same lack of interest as shown so far in addressing and solving the root causes of current contamination problems, the 2020 landscape only looks more troublesome for ship owners,” said Dragos Rauta, technical director at Intertanko.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent to hit its lowest since mid-August. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent while Australian and New Zealand indices  fell more than 1 percent each. China’s blue-chip index slipped 0.2 percent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dipped 0.5 percent. Investors were focused on the Sino-U.S. trade war with a public consultation period on the Trump administration’s intent to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods ending on Thursday. “An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war may be imminent, the timing is somewhat unclear and this justifies caution even given the (U.S. dollar) pullback,” JPMorgan analysts said. “Conviction and participation will likely remain light until an announcement.” Trump said on Wednesday that the United States was not yet ready to come to an agreement over trade disputes with China but he said talks would continue. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar index retreated from two-week highs hit earlier this week to be last down 0.1 percent at 95.06. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.2 percent. The Dow was a rare bright spot, up 0.1 percent. Investors are also watching for developments as the United States and Canada resume talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada insisted there was room to salvage the pact despite few signs a deal was imminent. The dollar, considered a safe haven at times of turmoil because of its status as the world’s reserve currency, has generally benefited from these trade uncertainties. It has gained 8 percent since end-March, with currencies in emerging markets taking a hammering. The financial crises in Argentina and Turkey have sent shivers through emerging markets while in Indonesia the central bank has had to intervene several times in recent weeks to stem the rupiah currency’s slide. Indonesia’s benchmark stock index was last up 0.4 percent while the rupiah also rose a tad. An index of emerging market currencies paused near 15-month lows after two straight days of heavy declines. But analysts warned about further losses as investors were no longer looking at Argentina, Turkey and South Africa as isolated cases. They are also fretting over the impact of rising U.S. inflation and interest rates on heavily indebted Asian economies. “The upshot is that this pause should not be mistaken for a panacea to the ongoing emerging market crisis, which demands utmost policy vigilance; and perhaps coordination,” analysts at Mizuho said in a note. The emerging market equity index has been crunched in the past month or so, falling for six consecutive sessions and down more than 3 percent this week. Analysts at Capital Economics believe there was room for further declines. A range of factors have hit EM stocks recently, namely policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, crises in Turkey and Argentina, the Sino-U.S. trade war and broader concerns about China’s economy. “We doubt that the main factors which have caused equities across much of the emerging world to weaken together recently will go away just yet,” Capital Economics said in a note.

2018-09-06,"(Corrects paragraph 3 to show Brent was at $77.0 per barrel, not $770) By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as emerging market woes weighed on sentiment, while a deadline neared for a potential new round of U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $68.47 per barrel at 0031 GMT, down 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures fell 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $77.0 a barrel. Broad emerging market weakness is weighing on global economic growth prospects. Meanwhile, a public comment period on possible U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, with expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will impose the additional levies. Given that China and emerging markets more broadly are key demand growth areas for oil markets, analysts said crude prices had come under downward pressure. “The prospects of increased supplies from OPEC and her allies, and weaker demand from China and other emerging markets could weigh further on oil prices going forward, or at least limit the upside potential,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex. “In part, this is because of the U.S.-dollar’s strength, weighing heavily on emerging market currencies, including the yuan, which in turn has pushed up the costs of all dollar-denominated commodities,” he added. For now, however, oil demand remains strong, not least in the United States. U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week as refineries boosted output amid strong consumption, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.17 million barrels to 404.5 million barrels in the week to Aug. 31, while refinery crude runs rose by 198,000 barrels per day, the API data showed. The producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Wednesday that it expected global oil demand to break through 100 million barrels per day for the first time later this year. Meanwhile, there are concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran, which will target the OPEC-member’s oil industry from November, will tighten global supply.

2018-09-06,"DOR BEACH, Israel (Reuters) - Underwater archaeologists have been scouring the seabed where a gas pipeline is being built off Israel’s coast in a bid to preserve relics near a 5,000-year-old port which once was a key trade hub for the Mediterranean’s ancient civilisations.      The pipeline from the deep-sea Leviathan gas field that is due to begin production late next year comes ashore near Dor Beach in northern Israel, a popular spot among Israeli sunbathers. It is also the site of the ancient port of Dor, where hidden in the seabed lie the vestiges of marine traders throughout the ages - from the Phoenicians to the Romans.   To minimise damage to such relics, the Israel Antiquities Authority has been working over the past year with the Leviathan field’s operator, Texas-based Noble Energy (NBL.N). A team spent weeks scuba diving in the warm crystal clear water off the beach, dispersing silt to uncover ancient artefacts. A remote-operated robot was used for searches in deeper water.  They found earthenware jugs, anchors and the remains of wrecked ships, setting new guidelines for similar future projects. “There has been unprecedented cooperation to protect the antiquities and the cultural assets,” Yaakov Sharvit, director of the Marine Archaeology Unit of the Israel Antiquities Authority, told Reuters TV.  Sharvit said Noble financed most of the archaeological surveys and a large research ship to help extract ancient objects along the pipeline’s route. The pipeline is being buried 15-20 meters below the seabed to minimise any impact on the surroundings. Leviathan was discovered in 2010 about 120 km (75 miles) off Israel’s coast. Its development will be the largest energy project in Israel’s history. “What is unique here in Israel is the ancient place that we’re operating,” said Binyamin Zomer, vice president for regional affairs for Noble Energy. “We work very closely with the Antiquities Authority here in Israel to make sure that should we discover such finds, we first of all avoid causing harm to those areas and secondly, to make sure that they are aware of the resources and potential finds that they have.” His company says the project will not harm the environment and will replace less healthy fossil fuels. But some local environmentalists and residents oppose the plan, which along with the pipeline includes a towering production platform to be built just 10 km from shore. Local resident and marine archaeologist Kurt Raveh, who has been excavating at Dor for decades and founded its diving club, thinks the survey being done is insufficient. He worries the area is at risk from potential pipeline leaks. “We have so many treasures and old shipwrecks and things like that, we should get them out of the water before we can’t enter the water anymore,” he said.

2018-09-06,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Depression Gordon moved north on Thursday, threatening central U.S. states with heavy rain, while Hurricane Florence churned toward Bermuda, packing maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour (185 kph), forecasters said.  Some parts of northwest Mississippi and much of Arkansas could receive up to seven inches (18 cm) of rain, totals that could reach up to 10 inches through Saturday in some areas, raising the risk of flash flooding, the National Hurricane Center said.  The storm, which left flooded streets in Alabama,  Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, has caused minimal property damage since it made landfall late on Tuesday. A two-year-old girl was killed, however, when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, authorities said. Hillarie Jones, manager at Bob’s Downtown Diner in Mobile, Alabama, said she shut down the restaurant on Wednesday but that luckily the storm did no damage to the business. “The reason why we closed yesterday was so our employees wouldn’t have to travel to work during the storm,” Jones said. As of Thursday morning, fewer than 1,000 homes and businesses remained without power, according to PowerOutages.us, as utility companies restored service for tens of thousands of customers across the region.    Energy companies and port operators along the Gulf Coast worked to resume normal operations after Gordon shut 9 percent of the region’s oil and natural gas production. Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday, after fears about the storm eased. In the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Florence, a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale, headed for Bermuda, forecast to affect the island’s surf by Friday. It was too early to say whether the storm would hit land, the NHC said.  “Swells generated by Florence will begin to affect Bermuda on Friday and will reach portions of the U.S. East Coast over the weekend,” the NHC said. “These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.” Florence, the first major hurricane of the Atlantic season, was 1,170 miles (1,885 km) east-southeast of Bermuda on Thursday morning.  Florence is expected to weaken but remain a strong hurricane for the next several days, the NHC said.

2018-09-06,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda said on Thursday its national oil firm and Chinese offshore oil and gas company CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK) had signed an agreement to jointly conduct exploration in a new block in the East African country. The deal was signed in Beijing on the margins of the ongoing China-Africa forum on cooperation, which is being attended by Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni. A statement issued by his office said CNOOC and Uganda National Oil Company signed a memorandum of understanding “to jointly explore a new oil and gas block in the Albertine Graben, on the southern part of Lake Albert.”  “The exploration aims to increase the amount of crude oil produced in Uganda to support the operations of the refinery as well as the oil pipeline,” it said.  Uganda is expected to start crude production in 2021 in the Albertine rift basin near the border with Democratic Republic of Congo, where reserves estimated at 6.5 billion barrels were discovered more than a decade ago. CNOOC already operates in Uganda, jointly owning fields with France’s Total (TOTF.PA) and London-listed Tullow Oil (TLW.L). The statement did not say which block would be jointly explored but authorities are keen to increase exploration activity in the wider, lower part of the Albertine rift after successful discoveries in the northern part.

2018-09-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s top military official said on Thursday his forces were prepared to carry out strikes on Syrian targets if chemical weapons were used in an expected government offensive to retake the northern province of Idlib.  Russia, an ally of President Bashar al-Assad, resumed air strikes against insurgents in Idlib on Tuesday after weeks of bombardment and shelling by pro-government Syrian forces in an apparent prelude to a full-scale offensive against the last major enclave held be rebels. “We are ready to strike if chemical weapons were used again,” Armed Forces Chief Francois Lecointre told a small group of reporters. “They can be carried out at national level but it’s in our interest to do it with as many partners as possible.” In April, France, the United States and Britain launched more than 100 missiles at pro-government targets in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack.  The prospect of an offensive on Idlib alarms aid agencies. The United Nations has said about half of the 3 million people living in rebel-held areas of the northwest have already been displaced. It estimates some 10,000 jihadists are in the area.  Lecointre said he expected the final pockets of Islamic State resistance in Syria and Iraq to be defeated by the end of November.     Idlib’s fate now appears likely to rest on a summit on Friday in Tehran between the leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran - a meeting that Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said would make the situation “clearer”. While the United States and its allies have warned of a blood bath, they have made clear they would only intervene should they deem that chemical weapons have been used. A French military source said the indications were that Russia and its allies wanted to wrap up the Idlib offensive by the end of the year. The source said Paris believed the United States would maintain its military presence in Kurdish-controlled northwestern regions of Syria given that Washington wanted to limit Iran’s influence in Syria.

2018-09-06,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake paralyzed Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido on Thursday, killing at least seven people, triggering landslides and knocking out power to its 5.3 million residents. The death toll from the 6.7-magnitude, pre-dawn quake was likely to rise as rescuers searched houses buried by landslides.  About 33 people were missing and 300 were injured, public broadcaster NHK said. Four people were in cardiopulmonary arrest, a term used before death is officially confirmed. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2oJz6zd)     The quake was the latest in a string of natural disasters to batter Japan after typhoons, flooding and a record-breaking heat wave within the past two months. Aerial footage showed dozens of landslides exposing barren hillsides near the town of Atsuma in southern Hokkaido, with mounds of red earth and toppled trees piled at the edge of green fields.  The collapsed remains of what appeared to be houses or barns were strewn about. “It came in four big jerks - boom! boom! boom! boom!” one unidentified woman told NHK. “Before we knew it our house was bent and we couldn’t open the door.” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said 25,000 Self-Defense Force troops would be deployed for rescue operations. The island, a tourist destination about the size of Austria known for its mountains, lakes and seafood, lost its power when Hokkaido Electric Power Co (9509.T) shut down of all its fossil fuel-fired power plants after the quake as a precaution.  It was the first time since the utility was established in 1951 that had happened. Almost 12 hours later, power was restored to parts of Sapporo, Hokkaido’s capital, and Asahikawa, its second-biggest city.  The government said there was damage to Hokkaido Electric’s Tomato-Atsuma plant, which supplies half the island’s 2.95 million households. It could take a week to restore power fully to all residents, Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko said.        All trains across the island were halted. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party begins a leadership contest on Friday but said there would be no campaigning through to Sunday. Abe and rival Shigeru Ishiba both canceled campaign media appearances slated for Friday. Television footage from Sapporo showed crumbled roads and mud covering a main street. Police directed traffic because signal lights were out while drink-vending machines, ubiquitous in Japan, and most ATMs were not working. “Without electricity, there’s nothing I can do except to write prescriptions,” a doctor in Abira, the town next to Atsuma, told NHK. Media reported a baby girl at a Sapporo hospital was in critical condition after the power was cut to her respirator. It wasn’t clear if the hospital had a generator. The quake hit at 3:08 a.m. (1808 GMT Wednesday) at a depth of 40 km (25 miles), with its epicenter about 65 km (40 miles) southeast of Sapporo, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. In Atsuma, it registered a 7 on Japan’s 7-point quake intensity scale, the agency said, revising an earlier measurement. Hokkaido’s main airport was closed, at least for the day. Debris and water could be seen on the terminal floors. Kyodo news agency said more than 200 flights and 40,000 passengers would be affected on Thursday alone. The closure comes just days after Kansai Airport, another major regional hub, in western Japan, was shut by Typhoon Jebi, which killed 11 people and injured hundreds.  The storm, the most powerful to hit Japan in 25 years, stranded thousands of passengers and workers at the airport, whose operator said it would resume some domestic flights on Friday. In July, torrential rain in west Japan caused flooding that killed more than 200 people and widespread destruction. That was followed by a heat wave that reached a record 41.1 Celsius and led to the deaths of at least 80 people. Farming, tourism and other services are big economic drivers on Hokkaido, which accounts for just 3.6 percent of Japan’s gross domestic product, but there is some industry. Kirin Brewery and Sapporo Breweries both said factories were shut by the power outage. A series of smaller shocks followed the initial quake, the JMA said. Residents were warned to take precautions. By the afternoon, backhoes and other earth-moving equipment in Atsuma had begun clearing debris. Japan is situated on the “Ring of Fire” arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Basin. Northeast Japan was hit by a 9 magnitude earthquake on March 11, 2011, that triggered a tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people and led to meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Hokkaido’s Tomari nuclear power station, which has been shut since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, suffered a power outage but officials said it was cooling its spent nuclear fuel safely. Saturday marked the 95th anniversary of the Great Kanto earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.9 and killed more than 140,000 people in the Tokyo area. Seismologists have said another such quake could strike the capital at any time.

2018-09-06,"* Mag 6.7 quake hit northern Hokkaido island early on Thursday * Fuel rods cooled using back-up diesel generators * Fukushima disaster came after tsunami knocked out back-up power * Restoring full power to island may take a week - minister (Recasts throughout, adds comment) By Osamu Tsukimori and Aaron Sheldrick TOKYO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Power was restored to a nuclear energy plant in Hokkaido, northern Japan on Thursday after a strong earthquake left it relying on emergency generators for 10 nervous hours, but it may be a week before lights are back on all over the major island. Triggering a blackout just after 3 a.m. local time, the magnitude 6.7 quake left at least seven people dead, more than 100 injured and dozens missing on Hokkaido, an island of about 5.3 million people whose capital is Sapporo. A major coal-fired power station was also damaged in the temblor that shut down the grid. The situation at utility Hokkaido Electric Power’s three-reactor Tomari nuclear plant provided an uncomfortable, if comparatively brief, echo of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. Reactors there melted down after a massive tsunami knocked out back-up generators, designed to maintain power to cool reactors in emergencies. Though Tomari was shut down after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, it needs electricity to keep fuel rods cool, and had to rely on back-up diesel generators that kicked in after the quake until power was restored to all three reactors by 1 p.m. local time. Hokkaido Electric is now scrambling to get power restored to households, factories and other customers, even as rescuers bring in heavy machinery and digging equipment to search for survivors that may be trapped in stricken buildings. In another echo of the 2011 disaster, Hokkaido’s situation was compounded by difficulties in receiving supplies from neighbouring regions that remain dominated by separate utilities with their own grids. A Hokkaido Electric spokesman said the utility was not receiving any supplies from the island of Honshu to the south - home to Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya - despite there being a 600 megawatt connection for transferring power from the coast of Japan’s main island. “Nationwide, they have been trying to bolster power systems by linking these fairly Balkanized domains, but it’s not as easy as it sounds,” said Andrew DeWit, professor of energy policy at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. “It requires equipment like transformers that is quite expensive and tailor-made.” Damage to transmission lines, transformers and other equipment from the quake is likely also delaying the restoration of power, DeWit said. By early afternoon, Hokkaido Electric had restarted one 125 megawatt coal-fired unit at its Sunagawa station. Its Tomato-Atsuma coal station, which normally supplies about half the island’s electricity, remained shut after sustaining damage in the quake. The abrupt halt in supplies from Tomato-Atsuma caused such a huge imbalance in supply and demand that other power plants on Hokkaido had to be shut own, industry minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters in Tokyo. it may take a week to restore power fully to Hokkaido, he said. Thursday’s blackout prompted the shutdown of Hokkaido’s New Chitose Airport, a popular gateway to the most northern of Japan’s main islands, the second major airport to be knocked out in the country in two days after a typhoon swamped the nation’s third-biggest. A number of industrial plants and factories were also affected. A fire that broke out at a steel production facility at Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing’s joint venture with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp in Muroran, Hokkaido, was extinguished with little damage to the facilities, a company official said. The plant will work towards resuming special steel production after power supply from Hokkaido Electric is restored, the official said. It usually takes about eight hours to resume production after the power supply has been secured, he said. Meanwhile Idemitsu Kosan, Japan’s second-biggest refiner by sales, stopped all refining and product shipments at its 150,000 barrels per day Hokkaido refinery, the only one on the island, an official told Reuters. Kirin Beer, part of giant drinks maker Kirin Holdings Co , said it closed its Chitose plant, which accounts for about 5 percent of its beer output, because of the power outage. There was no structural damage to the factory, it said. Sapporo Holdings Ltd said it closed down its Hokkaido brewery because of the lack of power.

2018-09-06,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - World shares fell for a fifth straight day on Thursday as investors braced for another escalation in a trade war between the United States and China, while emerging-market currencies paused near 15-month lows. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent. Stocks in Europe opened lower, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index as much as 0.4 percent down. The main worry for investors was the end of a public consultation period on Thursday for U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods. Trump said on Wednesday trade talks with China would continue but the United States was not yet ready to come to an agreement. “Unlike the last few days, where there has at least been a wave of PMI (purchasing manager indexes) to deal with, Thursday has little in the way of distraction for the European markets, meaning investors are just going to have to sit and stew in this particularly unpleasant trading broth,” said Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex. Earlier in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped more than 1 percent to a one-year trough of 515.24 points. It was last down 0.8 percent. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.4 percent and Australian shares dropped 1.1 percent. China’s blue-chip index fell 1.1 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index 1 percent. Further weighing on sentiment, data out earlier showed German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in July, another sign that factories in Europe’s largest economy are feeling the bite of protectionist trade politics. Investors are also watching for developments as the United States and Canada resume talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada insisted there was room to salvage the pact despite few signs a deal was imminent . The dollar, considered a safe haven at times of turmoil because of its status as the world’s reserve currency, has generally benefited from the trade conflicts. It has gained 8 percent since the end of March, with currencies in emerging markets taking a hammering. But measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar retreated from the two-week highs it reached earlier this week to stand 0.1 percent lower at 95.07. The euro was a tad stronger at $1.1636. Sterling held on to gains made on Wednesday as investors positioned for a favourable Brexit outcome. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.2910. Emerging markets have been hit by the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey. In Indonesia’s central bank has had to intervene several times in recent weeks to stem the rupiah’s slide. Indonesia’s benchmark stock index was last up nearly 1 percent while the rupiah also gained a tad. MSCI’s index of emerging market currencies, which had earlier paused near 15-month lows, was up 0.1 percent on the day after two straight days of heavy declines. But analysts warned about further losses because investors were no longer looking at Argentina, Turkey and South Africa as isolated cases. They were fretting over the impact of rising U.S. inflation and interest rates on heavily indebted economies. “As global monetary conditions slowly tighten, the global economic cycle rolls over and the U.S. President disturbs the global trade cycle, there’s definitely more to the EM sell-off than a few unrelated spots of weakness,” wrote strategists at Societe Generale in a note to clients. The emerging market equity index has been crunched in the past month or so, falling for six consecutive sessions and down more than 3 percent this week. A range of factors have hit the stocks: policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the crises in Turkey and Argentina, the Sino-U.S. trade war and broader concerns about China’s economy. “We doubt that the main factors which have caused equities across much of the emerging world to weaken together recently will go away just yet,” Capital Economics said in a note. In commodities, oil prices fell as emerging market woes weighed on sentiment. U.S. crude eased 0.1 percent to $68.65 a barrel. Brent was last down 0.1 percent at $68.64. Gold was stronger with spot gold up half a percent at $1,202.15 an ounce. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Danilo

2018-09-06,"SYDNEY, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Pacific island nations declared climate change to be their “single greatest threat”, urging Washington to return to the Paris Agreement on climate, just as Western powers seek to check China’s rising influence in the region. Australia, which has backed away from its own commitment to Paris without exiting the pact, was among the 18 nations of the Pacific Islands Forum that made the call at a meeting of leaders on the tiny island state of Nauru. “Climate change presents the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and well-being of Pacific people,” the leaders said in a communique, asking the United States to return to the climate pact. “The aspiration is for the U.S. to be in the Paris Agreement again, because we cannot have comprehensive robust emission reduction unless the biggest emitter of greenhouse gas is there in the process, we cannot leave the U.S. out,” Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu, told a news conference. However, participants said one country would not agree to even stronger language in the communique, and Sopoaga made clear which it was, although he stopped short of naming it. “The name of the qualifier (started with) alphabetical A, capital A,” Sopoaga told Wednesday’s news conference, held after the leaders’ meeting. No forum member’s name, apart from Australia’s, begins with the letter ‘A’. A spokesman for Australia’s foreign minister had no immediate response. The demand for action over the low-lying islands of the Pacific, seen as the front line of global climate change, comes as rising sea levels and other climate-related crises force residents to move to higher ground. Against this backdrop, China’s vocal support for tackling global warming aids its drive to win allies and influence in the strategically significant and resource-rich area. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favoured other countries and put the United States at a disadvantage. Climate change is domestic political dynamite in Australia, one of the world’s largest coal exporters, which has also sought to push back against China’s influence in the Pacific. Wednesday’s communique endorsed “with qualification” a separate, stronger statement, from seven small Pacific Island states seeking “urgent resolution” of Paris rules to cap the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius. “If that cap is not reached, there are going to be serious problems on islands like Tuvalu,” Sopoaga said, citing an estimate of island submergence by 2030 from the U.S. Geological Survey. “2030 is not far away, our grandchildren would still be growing up and the islands of Tuvalu and Kiribati and, maybe, part of Nauru would be submerged.” (Reporting by Tom Westbrook and Colin Packham; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/pacific-forum-climatechange/pacific-leaders-want-u-s-back-in-paris-climate-pact-idUKL3N1VS3EB,06 Sep 2018,"Pacific island nations declared

2018-09-06,"(Repeats story first published on Wednesday, no changes to text) * About a quarter of Frankfurt-registered cars affected * Merkel under pressure to order automakers to retrofit cars * Retrofits could cost industry billions of euros By Ilona Wissenbach WIESBADEN, Germany, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Frankfurt, Germany’s financial centre, must ban highly-polluting, older diesel vehicles from the city centre from next February as part of a plan to improve air quality, the country’s  administrative court ruled on Wednesday. The decision by the court in Wiesbaden on a case brought by environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) came after a landmark ruling by Germany’ top administrative court in February opened the door to inner-city bans. The ban would affect about a quarter of cars registered in Frankfurt and numerous commuters who live around the city. DUH leader Juergen Resch said the decision would help accelerate the shift to electric cars and called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to force carmakers to pay to retrofit diesel vehicles with exhaust-cleaning systems to avoid a ban. The regional government of Hessen also called for a speedy reaction from Berlin on retrofits, which the car industry has lobbied against because it could cost billions of euros. “We want a fundamental solution to this problem, rather than driving bans,” state premier Volker Bouffier and Environment Minister Priska Hinz said in a joint statement. Merkel has said she will do everything possible to avoid driving bans but disagreements over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions have strained her coalition with the Social Democrats. The ruling comes a day after Mercedes-Benz unveiled its much-anticipated electric SUV, marking the start of a German onslaught against Tesla’s dominance of the fast-growing market for premium battery cars. The court ruled that Frankfurt must ban from next February diesel cars that meet Euro-4 and older emission standards, and petrol cars that meet Euro-1 and 2 standards, while Euro-5 diesels must be banned from next September. “The driving ban is necessary because all other measures considered by the state will not lead to a significant reduction of nitrogen dioxide emissions in an appropriate time,” said presiding judge Rolf Hartmann. The court also ordered other measures to cut pollution in Frankfurt such as more electric buses, higher parking fees and more park-and-ride places on the outskirts of the city. DUH has argued that banning diesels is the only way for Frankfurt to meet European Union clean air rules which stipulate that nitrogen dioxide pollution should not exceed 40 micrograms per cubic meter of air on average. “We need to understand that this is about a threat to our health,” Hartmann said in his opening remarks, adding that this was not merely a niche matter for environmentalists. Pollution levels have regularly exceeded the limit since 2010, the court heard. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked diesel models that fail to meet the latest Euro-6 emissions standards from using selected trunk roads. Other cities including Aachen, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart, home to Daimler and Porsche, are also considering bans. The threat of bans on diesel vehicles has already led to higher sales of petrol engine cars in Germany, which are less fuel efficient and cause more carbon dioxide pollution. This in turn makes it harder for carmakers to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, increasing pressure on them to push electric or hybrid vehicles.

2018-09-06,"* New rules on cleaner shipping fuels kick in from 2020 * Goldman says more ships have been adding cleaning systems * Says will help marine fuel markets find balance (Recasts, adds detail) SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - New oil refining capacity and an increase in the number of ships adding cleaning systems to their smokestacks will help marine fuel markets find balance once new sulphur regulations kick in, Goldman Sachs said. To combat air pollution, the United Nations’ shipping agency has set global regulations to cap sulphur content in marine fuel at 0.5 percent from 2020, down from 3.5 percent now. Ships without sulphur-stripping technologies, or scrubbers, would have to burn costlier low-sulphur fuels such as marine gasoil or low-sulphur fuel oil to comply with the clean air rules. “We expect scrubber installations to rise quickly, with scrubbed ships keeping a third of current high-sulphur fuel in compliant use,” Goldman said in a note on Thursday. “Ongoing refinery capacity additions and the redirection of fuel oil and crude flows should go a long way to balancing the global fuel markets, with more onerous utilization and yield shifts making up the difference,” the bank said. Shippers and refiners were initially slow to make investment decisions to comply with the upcoming sulphur cap due to uncertainty around the enforcement of the rules and costs of compliance. Goldman forecasts scrubber installations at 3,125 in 2020 and 4,450 in 2022. It expects scrubbed high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) consumption at a total of 1 million barrels per day (mbpd) by 2020 and 1.4 mpbd by 2025. The global shipping industry burned a total of 3.3 million barrels per day (mbpd) of high-sulphur marine fuels in 2017, according to the bank. Goldman’s forecasts for higher than expected HSFO consumption mirrors similar outlook revisions from other energy researchers in August amid changing attitudes to scrubbers from shippers. “At an 80 percent compliance rate, we model that the market can reach equilibrium at a distillate-HSFO spread near current forwards, although at higher distillate cracks,” Goldman Sachs said. “We highlight, however, that this regulation’s costs may end up varying sharply with global growth and oil prices.” Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman and Vijaykumar Vedala in

U.S. sanctions against Iran, however, prevented prices from falling further as they are expected to tighten the market after being implemented from November, traders said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $68.59 per barrel at 0645 GMT, down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures fell by 4 cents, to $77.23 a barrel. Emerging market woes are weighing on global economic growth prospects, with Asian shares on Thursday heading for their sixth straight session of losses. Meanwhile, a public comment period on possible U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, with expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will impose the additional levies. “The prospects of increased supplies from OPEC and her allies, and weaker demand from China and other emerging markets could weigh further on oil prices going forward, or at least limit the upside potential,” said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at futures brokerage Forex. “This is because of the U.S. dollar’s strength, weighing heavily on emerging market currencies, including the yuan, which in turn has pushed up the costs of all dollar-denominated commodities,” he said. U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week as refineries boosted output amid strong consumption, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.17 million barrels to 404.5 million barrels in the week to Aug. 31, while refinery crude runs rose by 198,000 barrels per day (bpd), the data showed. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Wednesday it expected global oil demand to break through 100 million bpd for the first time this year. Meanwhile, there are concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran, which will target the OPEC-member’s oil industry from November, will tighten global supply. A further risk is seen in OPEC-member Venezuela, where a government and political crisis has halved oil production in the last two years to little more than 1 million bpd. David Maher, managing director for energy at commodity trading house RCMA Group, said Venezuela’s “declines will continue” as a “lack of cash and infrastructural collapse (are) not easy to fix”. U.S. investment bank Jefferies said “the Brent forward curve has inverted to backwardation, signalling a tightening market that already feels the effects of declining Iranian exports.” Backwardation describes a forward curve in which prices for immediate delivery are higher than those for dispatch later on. This signals tight market conditions as it gives traders an incentive to immediately sell oil instead of putting it into storage.

European shares were expected to be subdued too with futures for Eurostoxx 50, Germany’s DAX and London’s FTSE all starting lower. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped more than 1 percent to hit a one-year trough of 515.24 points. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.4 percent while Australian shares faltered 1.1 percent. China’s blue-chip index fell 1.2 while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stumbled 1.5 percent. Investors were on edge with a public consultation period on the Trump administration’s intent to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods ending on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States was not yet ready to come to an agreement over trade disputes with China but he said talks would continue. “An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war may be imminent, the timing is somewhat unclear and this justifies caution even given the (U.S. dollar) pullback,” JPMorgan analysts said. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar index retreated from two-week highs hit earlier this week to stand flat at 95.16. “Conviction and participation will likely remain light until an announcement,” they said. Further weighing on sentiment, data out earlier showed German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in July in another sign that factories in Europe’s largest economy are feeling the bite of protectionist trade politics. The euro was a tad softer at $1.1624. Investors are also watching for developments as the United States and Canada resume talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada insisted there was room to salvage the pact despite few signs a deal was imminent. The dollar, considered a safe haven at times of turmoil because of its status as the world’s reserve currency, has generally benefited from these trade uncertainties. It has gained 8 percent since end-March, with currencies in emerging markets taking a hammering. The financial crises in Argentina and Turkey have sent shivers through emerging markets while in Indonesia the central bank has had to intervene several times in recent weeks to stem the rupiah currency’s slide. Indonesia’s benchmark stock index was last up 0.1 percent while the rupiah also gained a tad. An index of emerging market currencies paused near 15-month lows after two straight days of heavy declines. But analysts warned about further losses as investors were no longer looking at Argentina, Turkey and South Africa as isolated cases. They are fretting over the impact of rising U.S. inflation and interest rates on heavily indebted Asian economies. “The upshot is that this pause should not be mistaken for a panacea to the ongoing emerging market crisis, which demands utmost policy vigilance; and perhaps coordination,” analysts at Mizuho said in a note. The emerging market equity index has been crunched in the past month or so, falling for six consecutive sessions and down more than 3 percent this week. Analysts at Capital Economics believe there is room for further declines. A range of factors have hit EM stocks recently, namely policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, crises in Turkey and Argentina, the Sino-U.S. trade war and broader concerns about China’s economy. “We doubt that the main factors which have caused equities across much of the emerging world to weaken together recently will go away just yet,” Capital Economics said in a note. Elsewhere, sterling held on to gains made on Wednesday as investors positioned for a favourable Brexit outcome. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.2910. In commodities, oil prices fell as emerging market woes weighed on sentiment. U.S. crude eased 14 cents to $68.58 a barrel while Brent was last down 7 cents at $77.21.

2018-09-06,"BEIJING (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Thursday it has signed a preliminary deal to build a petrochemical complex and invest in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in China, the latest major foreign investment in the world’s top chemicals market. The agreement worth billions of dollars with the southern Guangdong provincial government includes a 1.2 million-tonne-per-year (tpy) ethylene plant, two polyethylene production lines and two polypropylene lines in the coastal city of Huizhou, it said. Exxon also agreed to participate in a provincial project to build an LNG terminal in Huizhou and to supply LNG for it, it said. No details about the capacity of the project or timeline were given. China is allowing greater access by global majors and local independents to its massive chemicals market to feed plastics, coatings and adhesives to the fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors. Exxon would be one of only a few international oil majors to invest in LNG infrastructure in China as the country tries to shore up supplies amid a switch to gas-fired boilers by factories and households as part of the government’s battle against smog. The news comes after German chemical giant BASF (BASFn.DE) announced plans in July to invest $10 billion to build China’s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex, also in Guangdong. The project includes a steam cracker producing 1 million tonnes a year of ethylene. Details of the ownership structure of Exxon’s chemical plant and LNG investment were not released on Thursday. Still, the deal could be seen as a goodwill gesture by China amid a deepening trade war between the United States and China as the world’s top two economies have traded tit-for-tat punitive tariffs that target $50 billion of each other’s goods. Washington was holding hearings this week on another round of proposed duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that appear likely to take effect in late September or early October. The agreement comes a day before a planned meeting in Beijing between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Exxon chairman and chief executive Darren Woods.     The preliminary deal was signed with the local governments of Guangdong province and Huizhou as well as state power company, Guangdong Yuedian Group, according to the Guangzhou Daily.  While the petrochemical deal was largely expected following a joint study signed late last year, the push on LNG was a surprise and would mark a second investment in China’s gas infrastructure by an international oil company.   “It marks a salient step for Exxon in their pursuit of becoming an LNG portfolio player,” said Saul Kavonic, director for Asia Pacific markets and head of energy research at Credit Suisse in Australia. An investment in the import facility and downstream gas marketing will help it boost sales and margins compared with just selling the fuel at the import terminal gate, Kavonic added.  BP (BP.L) is so far the only global major with a stake in a gas receiving terminal in China, a joint venture with state-owned CNOOC which began operations 12 years ago.  Exxon said it is also looking at other chemicals manufacturing projects in Asia to help meet expected demand growth in the region. A decision to proceed with the petchem project will be based on a number of factors, including the receipt of permits and project competitiveness, it said. Startup is planned for 2023.     Exxon already owns a 25-percent stake in a refinery and petrochemical plant in Fujian in partnership with China’s top state refiner Sinopec.

2018-09-06,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - One of the standout commodity performers this year has been thermal coal, but not all coal is created equal and disparities in pricing may help explain why India’s imports have stayed strong despite the higher costs. The main benchmark for thermal coal in Asia is priced at Australia’s Newcastle Port, the world’s largest coal-export harbour. The price has gained 11.8 percent so far this year, to close at $114.66 a tonne in the week to Sept. 2, according to assessments by Argus Media. This isn’t far off the 6-1/2 year high of nearly $120 a tonne hit in July, with the price surge this year largely coming on the back of increased Chinese demand for coal to be burned in power stations. What has been somewhat surprising is that India, the world’s second-largest coal importer behind China, has defied its prior history of being a price-sensitive buyer and boosted its imports this year. But delving into the detail offers an explanation as to why this is the case, the price of the bulk of the coal India imports has been declining, especially in recent months. India imported 128.7 million tonnes of coal in the first eight months of the year, up 10.6 percent on the same period last year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters. Of this, 50.4 million tonnes came from Indonesia, making the Southeast Asian nation India’s top supplier. India tends to import lower quality coal from Indonesia, with a typical grade being fuel with an energy rating of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg). The price for this type of coal, as assessed by Argus Media, has been declining since late June, dropping to $37.72 a tonne in the week ended Aug. 31. It has fallen 22.5 percent since June 22 and is now down 19.4 percent so far this year. The gap between Newcastle coal with an energy content of 6,000 kcal/kg and Indonesian 4,200 kcal/kg is now at its widest since early 2011. This appears to have shored up Indian buying of Indonesian coal, with imports rising in August to 6.97 million tonnes, up from 5.5 million in July, according to the vessel-tracking data. Given the recent difficulties state-controlled Coal India has experienced in meeting domestic requirements, it’s little surprise that Indian buyers have ramped up purchases from Indonesia. It’s also worth noting that India hasn’t increased the amount of coal it buys from other top suppliers. Australia is India’s second-largest supplier, but it ships almost exclusively coking coal used in steelmaking, and is thus not a competitor with Indonesia. However, South Africa exports thermal coal, which is similar in quality and pricing to Australia’s Newcastle benchmark. India imported 3 million tonnes from South Africa in August, down from 3.2 million in July, perhaps indicating less of an appetite for the more expensive, but higher quality fuel. One question that remains to be answered is: why is the price of Indonesian low-grade coal falling while higher grades are still either rising or staying close to multi-year highs? While it’s too early to provide a definitive answer, it appears that China may be buying less Indonesian coal, with imports dropping to 9.42 million tonnes in August from 10.3 million tonnes in both July and June, according to vessel-tracking data. China has also struggled with domestic coal availability, mainly as a result of self-imposed output restrictions as part of efforts to combat air pollution. This has boosted demand for imports, but it seems Chinese buyers are preferring higher energy content Australian coal over Indonesian grades. Much of the coal China buys from Indonesia is used as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies, in a compromise that sees a drop in overall energy content but also a drop in sulphur and ash, given Indonesian coal is low in these pollutants. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Joseph Radford",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-coal-india/column-india-boosts-purchases-of-indonesian-coal-as-prices-drop-russell-idUKL3N1VS2QH,06 Sep 2018,"One of the

2018-09-06,"NEW ORLEANS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Tropical Depression Gordon was expected on Thursday to dump more heavy rains that could cause flooding in central U.S. states as Hurricane Florence, a monster Category 3 storm, churned toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Downpours have flooded streets in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi as the storm headed north and threatened to bring heavy rains to the Mississippi Valley and the Midwest over the next few days, the NHC said. Some areas could get up to 5 inches (13 cm) of rain on Thursday and cause flash flooding, the center said. The storm, which made landfall late on Tuesday, has caused minimal property damage so far, the NHC said, but a 2-year-old girl died when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, authorities said. As of Wednesday night, more than 2,000 homes and businesses remained without power as utility companies restored service for tens of thousands of customers across the region. Energy companies and port operators along the Gulf Coast took steps to resume normal operations after Gordon shut 9 percent of the region’s oil and natural gas production. Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday, after fears about the storm eased. In the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Florence, a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale, barreled toward Bermuda on Wednesday, packing maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph). The first major hurricane of the Atlantic season will affect Bermuda’s surf by Friday, but it was too early to say whether it would hit land. “Swells from Florence could also reach the U.S. East Coast by early next week,” the NHC said. Florence was 1,235 miles (1,990 km) east-southeast of Bermuda on Wednesday night. Some weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, “but Florence is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through early next week,” the NHC said.

2018-09-06,"(Adds details) TOKYO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Restoring full power across Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido will take at least a week after a powerful earthquake struck early in the day, damaging its largest fossil fuel power plant, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko said on Thursday. The government is seeking to restore partial power to some areas as soon as possible once Hokkaido Electric Power Co restarts its Sunagawa coal-fired plant, Seko said. Hokkaido Electric had been aiming to first restart its Tomato-Atsuma plant, which supplies about half the island’s power, but repairs are projected to take at least a week after the breakout of a fire from the No.4 unit’s turbine and boiler damage at units No.1 and No.2, Seko said. Hokkaido Electric has restarted four hydropower units with a total capacity of 300 megawatts (MW) and will restart the 250-MW Sunagawa coal-fired plant on Thursday, he said. The company will also restart its 350-MW coal-fired Naie plant, oil-fired 700-MW Date plant and 700-MW oil-fired Shiriuchi plant from as early as Friday, Seko said. The restoration of 2.9 gigwatts (GW) of power is expected to be possible by the end of Friday, including 600-MW of power coming across from the mainland, he said. Peak power demand in Hokkaido, however, reaches 3.8 GW, so the restoration of all power across the island should take at least another week, Seko said. Hokkaido Electric said this is the first time since its establishment in 1951 that power has been lost across the entire island. Reporting by Kazuhiko Tamaki, Osamu Tsukimori and Ran Kim;

2018-09-06,"(Repeats with no changes in text) * Imports of Iran oil up 56 pct in August year on year * Indian refiners were attracted by Iranian discounts * Washington wants Iran oil trade to stop from November By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - India imported about 523,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran in August, down 32 percent on a month earlier, preliminary tanker arrival data showed, as the United States steps up pressure on buyers to halt Iranian energy imports from November. Some of the shipments were loaded in July and arrived in August, the data obtained by Reuters from trade sources showed. The August 2018 imports were still 56 percent higher than the same month last year, the data showed, as state refiners were attracted by discounts offered by Iran this year. Annual import plans by Indian state refiners for 2018/2019 were finalised before President Donald Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions. A senior Indian government official said India, Iran’s top oil client after China, would not completely halt Iranian imports and would finalise its strategy on crude purchases after a meeting U.S. officials on Thursday. In April-August, the first five months of the 2018/2019 fiscal year, India’s oil imports from Iran rose 43 percent to 646,200 bpd compared to the same period a year earlier, the data showed. State-run Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, imported about 4 million barrels in August, equivalent to about 134,000 bpd, or half the amount it imported in July. State refiners have faced delays in securing permission to use Iranian tankers and insurance, as federal policy requires them to favour Indian shippers and insurers, industry experts said. Western and Indian shippers are winding down their exposure to Iran before sanctions take effect. Bharat Petroleum Corp’s received about 131,000 bpd Iranian oil in August, a third less than July, the data showed. Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, and Hindustan Petroleum Corp NS> did not buy oil from Iran in August. Monthly imports by Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals’ and Nayara Energy, part owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft, were little changed at about 120,000 bpd and 138,000 bpd, respectively, the data showed. In January-August 2018, India’s oil imports from Iran were up 21 percent at 600,400 bpd compared with the same period a year ago, the data showed. Reporting by Nidhi Verma

2018-09-06,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A wave of contaminated fuel that has clogged and damaged engines on hundreds of oil tankers and container vessels in the past months has pushed shippers to demand stricter quality controls around the world. The calls are shining a light on the notoriously opaque shipping fuel sector, where any contamination can spread quickly and be difficult to trace back to its source. That is because large volumes of fuel oil are blended with so-called cutter stocks by suppliers and sold on through an extensive network of middlemen before finding their way into ships’ fuel tanks. This tide of dirty fuel comes when the shipping industry, the backbone of global commerce with over 90 percent of the world’s traded goods transported on the oceans, is bracing for an unprecedented shift to lower-sulphur fuel from 2020. “We strongly believe that the (marine) fuel industry should get a grip on the situation and take on the responsibility it has in these matters,” said Mads P. Zacho, chief executive officer at Danish shipping company J. Lauritzen. When approached for comment on the tainted fuel, the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) referred Reuters to a statement issued in late-July in which it said it was “not useful to seek to apportion fault when there is no agreement as to what the root cause is”.  The contamination first emerged at the U.S. Gulf coast as early as January this year, but the exact suppliers and sources of the contaminants remain unknown.  It then spread to places such as Singapore, the world’s largest hub for marine fuel, also known as bunker fuel, and onto other ports in Asia. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said in a statement emailed on Thursday that contaminants had been detected in a “small handful” of fuel samples from Singapore between April and July.     “All the affected bunker suppliers in Singapore had exercised due diligence in adhering to both international and local bunker fuel quality control requirements,” the MPA said, adding that it had “stepped up sampling checks and testing”.  The Port of Houston Authority did not respond to requests for comment. The tainted fuel can harm engines in ways such as clogging pipelines or overwhelming fuel filters, Singapore-based marine fuel surveyor and consulting firm Maritec Pte Ltd has said. Some damage can be repaired at sea, but other cases have required vessels to return to port. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said that at least two oil tankers operated by oil giant BP (BP.L) had been hit by cases of contaminated fuel that cost “big money and big delays”. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media, while BP did not respond to Reuters request for comment. “You have bunker ports where the contaminated fuel exists, then it gets sliced and diced over different suppliers and different bunker barges, then eventually it hits the ship operator,” said Douglas Raitt, regional consultancy manager at ship classifier Lloyd’s Register. He added that, while it was difficult to give an exact number, around 200 to 300 ships could have been affected globally, which would dwarf previous such problems. “This lack of investigation into such a serious breach of safety norms is totally inadequate and hugely disappointing,” Intertanko, an association of independent tanker owners and operators with a combined fleet of almost 4,000 ships, said in a statement in August. It did not specify which authorities it thought should investigate the issue. For a graphic on Singapore shipping, bunker volumes, click tmsnrt.rs/2wQyagj While regulations governing marine fuel standards have been established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations’ shipping agency, “in practice few countries appear to be properly discharging these obligations”, said John Bradshaw, technical director at the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80 percent of the world’s merchant fleet. “Most countries take a position that it is a commercial matter between fuel suppliers and purchasers and that they have no obligation in ensuring the quality of fuel oil supplied to ships in areas under their jurisdiction,” said Bradshaw.  Fuel standards in other mass transport sectors, including aviation, tend to be strictly enforced as problems there could lead to fatal accidents. The marine fuel industry has had its fair share of scandals, including large-scale fuel-theft and illegal under-selling of fuel through what the industry calls the ‘cappuccino effect’, where sticky fuel oil is frothed to inflate its apparent volume to buyers. The IBIA said that a common, but speculative, view was that the current wave of contagion likely came from “inappropriate cutter stocks used in the production of bunkers at one or more refineries and/or terminals”. The industry uses cutter stocks to help meet marine fuel grade specifications.  “In similar cases in the past, the source of the contaminant was never adequately identified, but ... the root cause was by and large a lack of control of the quality of cutter stock used in the marine pool,” the IBIA said. Meanwhile, the IMO will from 2020 force shippers to use fuels with 0.5 percent sulphur content by mass, down from 3.5 percent currently. “Problems with contaminated fuels might become an even bigger problem in 2020 because you have to think about the fact that 0.50 percent mass sulphur fuel requires a lot more blending than 3.50 percent mass sulphur fuel,” said Raitt at Lloyd’s Register. Intertanko said that if the fuel delivered to ships continued to lack quality controls, that could also undermine “a safe and smooth enforcement” of the 2020 rules.  “If those responsible for providing good, lasting quality fuels ... show the same lack of interest as shown so far in addressing and solving the root causes of current contamination problems, the 2020 landscape only looks more troublesome for ship owners,” said Dragos Rauta, technical director at Intertanko.

2018-09-06,"(Corrects paragraph 3 to show Brent was at $77.0 per barrel, not $770) By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as emerging market woes weighed on sentiment, while a deadline neared for a potential new round of U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $68.47 per barrel at 0031 GMT, down 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures fell 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $77.0 a barrel. Broad emerging market weakness is weighing on global economic growth prospects. Meanwhile, a public comment period on possible U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, with expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will impose the additional levies. Given that China and emerging markets more broadly are key demand growth areas for oil markets, analysts said crude prices had come under downward pressure. “The prospects of increased supplies from OPEC and her allies, and weaker demand from China and other emerging markets could weigh further on oil prices going forward, or at least limit the upside potential,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex. “In part, this is because of the U.S.-dollar’s strength, weighing heavily on emerging market currencies, including the yuan, which in turn has pushed up the costs of all dollar-denominated commodities,” he added. For now, however, oil demand remains strong, not least in the United States. U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week as refineries boosted output amid strong consumption, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.17 million barrels to 404.5 million barrels in the week to Aug. 31, while refinery crude runs rose by 198,000 barrels per day, the API data showed. The producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Wednesday that it expected global oil demand to break through 100 million barrels per day for the first time later this year. Meanwhile, there are concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran, which will target the OPEC-member’s oil industry from November, will tighten global supply.

2018-09-06,"* Fuel rods being cooled with power from diesel generators * Tomari plant has been in shutdown since Fukushima aftermath * No radiation irregularities at the plant -govt * Magnitude 6.7 quake hit in the early hours TOKYO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - A Japanese nuclear energy station is relying on emergency back up power after a powerful earthquake knocked out electricity on the northern island of Hokkaido on Thursday, a stark reminder of the Fukushima disaster more than seven years ago. The three-reactor Tomari nuclear plant, operated by Hokkaido Electric Power and in shutdown since the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, lost power after a magnitude 6.7 quake hit the island in the early hours, the government said. The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. More than 100 have been injured and 19 are missing following the quake, according to broadcaster NHK. On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake, the most powerful recorded in Japan, struck off the northern Honshu coast. The quake set off a massive tsunami that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and left nearly 20,000 dead. The quake knocked out power to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and the tsunami swamped diesel generators placed low in reactor buildings, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world’s worst nuclear disaster for 25 years. The crisis led to the shutdown of the country’s nuclear industry, once the world’s third-biggest. Seven reactors have come back online after a protracted relicensing process. The majority of Japanese people remain opposed to nuclear power after Fukushima highlighted failings in regulation and operational procedures in the industry. Hokkaido Electric has shut down all fossil fuel plants, cutting power to all its nearly 3 million customers, a spokesman told Reuters by phone. Japan’s industry minister, Hiroshige Seko, has instructed Hokkaido Electric to restart its biggest coal plant after the station was tripped by the earthquake. The blackout shut down Hokkaido’s New Chitose Airport, a popular gateway to the most northern of Japan’s main islands, the second major airport to be knocked out in the country in two days after a typhoon swamped the nation’s third-biggest. Japan is in the midst of a record tourism boom and will host the Olympics in 2020. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, arriving at his office before 6 a.m., told reporters saving lives was the priority as his government set up a command centre to coordinate relief and rescue. A fire broke out at a steel plant operated by Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing in the city of Muroran, but has largely been brought under control, a spokesman told Reuters. Idemitsu Kosan, Japan’s second biggest refiner by sales, stopped all refining and product shipments at its 150,000 barrels per day Hokkaido refinery, an official told Reuters.

2018-09-06,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Marine fuel sector is notoriously opaque * Tainted fuel can spread quickly, is hard to trace source * Shippers preparing for shift to lower-sulphur fuel in 2020 * Shipping network is backbone of global trade * Singapore shipping, bunker volumes: tmsnrt.rs/2wQyagj By Roslan Khasawneh SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A wave of contaminated fuel that has clogged and damaged engines on hundreds of oil tankers and container vessels in the past months has pushed shippers to demand stricter quality controls around the world. The calls are shining a light on the notoriously opaque shipping fuel sector, where any contamination can spread quickly and be difficult to trace back to its source. That is because large volumes of fuel oil are blended with so-called cutter stocks by suppliers and sold on through an extensive network of middlemen before finding their way into ships’ fuel tanks. This tide of dirty fuel comes when the shipping industry, the backbone of global commerce with over 90 percent of the world’s traded goods transported on the oceans, is bracing for an unprecedented shift to lower-sulphur fuel from 2020. “We strongly believe that the (marine) fuel industry should get a grip on the situation and take on the responsibility it has in these matters,” said Mads P. Zacho, chief executive officer at Danish shipping company J. Lauritzen. The contamination first emerged at the U.S. Gulf coast as early as January this year, but the exact suppliers and sources of the contaminants remain unknown. It then spread to places such as Singapore, the world’s largest hub for marine fuel, also known as bunker fuel, and onto other ports in Asia. When approached by Reuters for comment on the tainted fuel, the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) referred Reuters to statement issued in late-July in which it said it was “not useful to seek to apportion fault when there is no agreement as to what the root cause is”. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and the Port of Houston Authority did not immediately respond to requests for comment. More than 40,000 ships call at Singapore for refuelling each year, with port authorities typically licensing bunker supplier operations. “You have bunker ports where the contaminated fuel exists, then it gets sliced and diced over different suppliers and different bunker barges, then eventually it hits the ship operator,” said Douglas Raitt, regional consultancy manager at ship classifier Lloyd’s Register. He added that, while it was difficult to give an exact number, around 200 to 300 ships could have been affected globally, which would dwarf previous such problems. The tainted fuel can harm engines in ways such as clogging pipelines or overwhelming fuel filters, Singapore-based marine fuel surveyor and consulting firm Maritec Pte Ltd has said. Some damage can be repaired at sea, but other cases have required vessels to return to port. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said that at least two oil tankers operated by oil giant BP had been hit by cases of contaminated fuel that cost “big money and big delays”. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media, while BP did not respond to Reuters request for comment. “This lack of investigation into such a serious breach of safety norms is totally inadequate and hugely disappointing,” Intertanko, an association of independent tanker owners and operators with a combined fleet of almost 4,000 ships, said in a statement in August. It did not specify which authorities it thought should investigate the issue. While regulations governing marine fuel standards have been established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations’ shipping agency, “in practice few countries appear to be properly discharging these obligations”, said John Bradshaw, technical director at the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80 percent of the world’s merchant fleet. “Most countries take a position that it is a commercial matter between fuel suppliers and purchasers and that they have no obligation in ensuring the quality of fuel oil supplied to ships in areas under their jurisdiction,” said Bradshaw. Fuel standards in other mass transport sectors, including aviation, tend to be strictly enforced as problems there could lead to fatal accidents. The marine fuel industry has had its fair share of scandals, including large-scale fuel-theft and illegal under-selling of fuel through what the industry calls the ‘cappuccino effect’, where sticky fuel oil is frothed to inflate its apparent volume to buyers. The IBIA said that a common, but speculative, view was that the current wave of contagion likely came from “inappropriate cutter stocks used in the production of bunkers at one or more refineries and/or terminals”. The industry uses cutter stocks to help meet marine fuel grade specifications. “In similar cases in the past, the source of the contaminant was never adequately identified, but ... the root cause was by and large a lack of control of the quality of cutter stock used in the marine pool,” the IBIA said. Meanwhile, the IMO will from 2020 force shippers to use fuels with 0.5 percent sulphur content by mass, down from 3.5 percent currently. “Problems with contaminated fuels might become an even bigger problem in 2020 because you have to think about the fact that 0.50 percent mass sulphur fuel requires a lot more blending than 3.50 percent mass sulphur fuel,” said Raitt at Lloyd’s Register. Intertanko said that if the fuel delivered to ships continued to lack quality controls, that could also undermine “a safe and smooth enforcement” of the 2020 rules. “If those responsible for providing good, lasting quality fuels ... show the same lack of interest as shown so far in addressing and solving the root causes of current contamination problems, the 2020 landscape only looks more troublesome for ship owners,” said Dragos Rauta, technical director at Intertanko.

2018-09-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s largest offshore wind farm will open on Thursday off the northwest coast of England when Danish energy group Orsted (ORSTED.CO) unveils the Walney Extension project. The wind farm has a capacity of 659 megawatts (MW), enough to power almost 600,000 homes, and overtakes the London Array off England’s east coast which has a capacity of 630 MW. Walney Extension is made up of 87 turbines built by Siemens Gamesa (SGREN.MC) and MHI Vestas, and covers 145 square kilometers (55 square miles), which is equivalent to around 20,000 football pitches. The 40 eight-megawatt MHI Vestas turbines being used stand 195 meters (213 yards) tall and are the largest wind turbines in operation globally. (Graphic: World's largest wind turbine - reut.rs/2PAmS7w) Orsted said they have been optimized to generate as much as 8.25 MW each. Matthew Wright, Orsted UK managing director, told Reuters in an interview Britain’s offshore success was due to a combination of strong wind speeds and shallow waters in the North Sea and Irish Sea as well as continued support from the government. “For the last 10 years governments of all colors have supported renewable energy and offshore wind in the UK, leading to a thriving industry,” he said. Britain is the world’s largest offshore wind market, hosting 36 percent of globally installed offshore wind capacity, data from the Global Wind Energy Council showed. Walney Extension was among the first renewable projects to secure a so-called contract for difference (CFD) subsidy from the British government in 2014. The contract guarantees it a minimum price for electricity of 150 pounds ($195) per megawatt hour (MWh) for 15 years. Since this was awarded, the cost of offshore wind has fallen dramatically to a low of 57.50 pounds per MWh in the last auction held in 2017. Blades for both sets of turbines were made at British factories, in Hull and the Isle of Wight, and Wright said the company was keen to use local facilities. “Approximately 50 percent of the value of the project over its lifetime will have come from UK sources,” he said. Walney Extension is a shared-ownership project between Orsted (50 percent) and two Danish pension funds - PFA and PKA (25 percent each).
