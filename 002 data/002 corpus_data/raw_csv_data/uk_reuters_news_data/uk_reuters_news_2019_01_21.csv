2019-01-21,"KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More of the billions of tonnes of materials the world uses each year must be recycled and reused to keep climate change in check, researchers said on Tuesday. Only about a tenth of the nearly 93 billion tonnes of materials utilised annually - including minerals, metals, fossil fuels and biomass - are currently put back into service, said a report by Amsterdam-based social enterprise Circle Economy. CEO Harald Friedl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation more efficient use of those resources could help avoid overshooting the goals adopted in the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit the average rise in global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F), and ideally to 1.5C, above pre-industrial times. The Circle Economy report said 62 percent of heat-trapping emissions, excluding land use and forestry, are released during the extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods. To tackle climate change, government policy has so far focused on adopting renewable energies, boosting energy efficiency, and stopping deforestation, the report said. “It is like when you look in your closet on a morning and you only look for pants,” said Friedl by phone. “We need to change the whole system.” The amount of materials the world uses has tripled since 1970 and could double again by 2050 if no action is taken, the United Nations estimates. To reduce waste and emissions, economies should seek to become “circular” by reusing products, Friedl added. “To make things circular may be painful - from changing consumer and business habits to telling countries to put up the right regulations - but it is feasible,” he said. In Asia, fast-developing economies and urbanisation are driving huge investments in construction and infrastructure, offering chances to promote a circular economy, said Friedl. In Europe, the report urged countries to maximise the value of existing buildings by extending their lifespan, improving energy efficiency, and finding new uses for them. The report outlined three broad strategies to shift to a circular economy. The use of products should be maximised, such as through car-sharing or keeping vehicles for longer, it said. Recycling and reducing waste are also key, as is using natural, low-carbon materials in construction, like bamboo and wood instead of cement, it said. Governments should adopt taxation and spending plans that encourage a circular economy, raising levies on emissions and excessive waste production while cutting them for labour, innovation and investments, the report added. Financial incentives that promote the overuse of natural resources, such as fossil fuels, should be abolished, it said. ""It's a hands-on way to save the world,"" said Friedl.

2019-01-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - The majority of senior energy industry executives expect to maintain or increase spending this year to meet demand for oil and gas after years of austerity, a survey by DNV GL shows. DNV, a technical adviser to the energy industry, surveyed 791 senior professionals from firms with annual revenue ranging from $500 million or less to those earning $5 billion and more. BP (BP.L), Shell (RDSa.L) and many other companies cut capital spending and costs in 2016 after the price of benchmark Brent crude fell to a 12-year low of below $30 a barrel. Helped by output cuts by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, Brent climbed to an average price of $70 last year compared to $50 for the period 2015 to 2017. It was trading above $62 a barrel on Monday. DNV’s annual outlook of the global oil and gas industry showed 70 percent of respondents planned to maintain or increase capital spending in 2019, compared to 39 percent in 2017. Those expecting to sustain or increase operating expenditure also grew to 65 percent in 2019 from 41 percent in 2017. In addition, 67 percent believed more large, capital-intensive oil and gas projects would be approved this year. “Despite greater oil price volatility in recent months, our research shows that the sector appears confident in its ability to better cope with market instability and long-term lower oil and gas prices,” said Liv Hovem, who heads DNV’s oil and gas division. “For the most part, industry leaders now appear to be positive that growth can be achieved after several difficult years,” she added. The survey indicated that the industry’s focus on cost control was easing, with 21 percent of respondents saying cost efficiency would be a top priority in 2019, down from 31 percent in 2018 and 41 percent in 2016. The survey also indicated that more energy companies were preparing for a long-term shift to cleaner energy sources. More than half of respondents, or 51 percent, said they would focus on adapting to a less carbon-intensive energy mix in 2019, up from 44 percent last year, due to stricter regulation. One third said they aimed to increase investment in renewable energy in 2019, and 35 percent said their firms would lift investment in gas-related projects and portfolios. Despite growing momentum among energy firms to reduce their carbon footprint, DNV said its survey indicated “that companies today are more likely to be doing so because they are told to, rather than because they want to.” The report said 46 percent of respondents believed high oil prices could delay the industry’s shift towards decarbonisation, as firms sought to make short-term gains from more efficient practices and improved margins.

2019-01-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Monday, reversing earlier losses, as investors shrugged off data that confirmed China’s economic growth is cooling and instead latched on to positive supply-side drivers for the market. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were up 12 cents at $62.83 a barrel by 3:23 p.m. EST (1727 GMT) versus Friday’s settlement price, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 were up 19 cents to $53.99 a barrel. The U.S. financial markets are closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Global equities fell after data pointed to a slowdown in Chinese economic growth in 2018 to a 28-year low. The numbers fed concern that the outlook for global growth may be darkening, particularly given U.S.-China trade tensions. “It remains quite likely that the trade spat with the U.S. has played a part in this latest slowdown,” CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson said. “But investors should also factor in that it simply isn’t possible for the Chinese economy to grow at the pace that it has over the last 10 years, in the next 10 years.” Stock markets are still up so far this month, which has given oil investors more confidence to bet aggressively on a rise in crude prices. Analysts said a more robust backdrop for financial markets and the prospect of slower crude production growth were the major drivers behind the rally in oil. “The stock market performance is one of the reasons why oil keeps marching higher. There also seems to be a general belief that the agreed cut in OPEC+ production will be sufficient to balance the market,” PVM Oil Associates said in a note. While there is concern that a slowing global economy could impact oil demand, production cuts implemented by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are likely to support crude oil prices, analysts said. “You can’t justify oil prices at these levels. We’re looking basically at an average of almost $70 a barrel for Brent in 2019,” ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson said. “I am getting increasingly concerned about how tight the market will be going into 2020.”  A separate report from China’s National Bureau of Statistics showed crude oil refinery throughput in 2018 climbed to a record 12.1 million barrels per day, up 6.8 percent from the previous year.             In the United States, energy companies cut the number of rigs drilling for oil by 21 last week, the biggest decline in three years, taking the count down to 852, the lowest since May 2018, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.

2019-01-21,"(Adds detail, quotes) LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Iran failed to find any buyers on Monday in its latest attempt to sell oil to private companies for export on the energy exchange, state media reported, in a setback to Tehran’s efforts to bypass U.S. sanctions. Crude oil trade is state-controlled in Iran, but to try to work around U.S. sanctions, the government last year started to sell crude to private buyers through the exchange. However, there were no buyers on Monday for the one million barrels the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) offered on the exchange at a starting price of $52 a barrel. In October, before U.S. sanctions came into force, Iran sold 280,000 barrels at $74 apiece of the one million barrels it offered on the exchange. Two weeks later it sold 700,000 barrels at $64 each. Iran has not revealed the identity of the private buyers in the energy exchange because they might be targeted by U.S. penalties. The buyers in the first two rounds had to settle 20 percent of the payment in rials and 80 percent in foreign currencies. However, in the last round, all purchases could be paid with rials. Washington re-introduced sanctions on Iran’s oil exports on Nov. 4 after withdrawing from a 2015 multinational deal that had lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran’s vice president on Monday said that Iran can still find buyers for its oil. “Despite U.S. plots to stop Iranian oil sales ... we have managed to sell as much crude as we need,” Eshaq Jahangiri was quoted as saying by SHANA, the oil ministry’s news agency.

2019-01-21,"* Ukraine earns transit fees from Russian gas * Russian gas no longer sold to Ukraine * Ukraine still important gas import route for EU * No threat to Russian gas supplies via Ukraine - EU (Adds details on meeting from sources) By Alissa de Carbonnel BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine will meet for further gas talks in May after an EU-mediated discussion in Brussels on Monday yielded no concrete results, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said. The talks have focused on Russian gas transit via Ukraine to Europe, the source of up to 3 percent of Ukrainian gross domestic product. With Russia embroiled in conflict with Kiev over breakaway regions in Ukraine’s east and the European Union reliant on Russian gas to fuel its industries, the future of gas transit - seen by Kiev as a crucial guarantor of its independence from Moscow - is the subject of intricate diplomacy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to keep its transit of gas to Europe through Ukraine once the current deal with Kiev expires on Dec. 31, 2019 if supplies are economically viable. Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz accused Russia of delaying negotiations in order to get its Nord Stream 2 pipeline built first. Russia’s planned doubling of capacity on the Nord Stream pipeline across the Baltic Sea to Germany could help Moscow bypass exports via Ukraine. That would deny Kiev transit fees. “Gazprom is delaying real talks in terms of transit in order to build Nord Stream 2,” Naftogaz Deputy Chief Executive Yuriy Vitrenko told Reuters before the talks on Monday. “Then they will say, ‘We are OK without any Ukrainian transits at all’.” Russian gas giant Gazprom’s partners in the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project include Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall and France’s Engie . THREE-WAY TALKS Sources familiar with Monday’s talks said European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, who chaired the three-way meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin and Novak, had floated a proposal for the two countries to agree a new 10-year transit contract, with a guaranteed minimum yearly transit volume of 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) and 30 bcm of additional flexibility. There was no immediate reaction from either the Russian or Ukraine delegations. Executives from Naftogaz and Gazprom also attended the meeting. Moscow and Kiev have clashed frequently over energy. Talks are complicated by a lengthy legal dispute between Gazprom and Naftogaz that led to a Stockholm arbitration court ruling in February 2018 that each company must compensate the other. Sefcovic said the Stockholm arbitration was the “elephant in the room”. Naftogaz emerged the net winner of that ruling, gaining $2.56 billion from Gazprom. Gazprom is challenging the decision - a process that could take years. “For the Russians, it is a huge stumbling block,” Sefcovic said. “For them, it is difficult to negotiate a good contract for the long term when they are still fighting the legal claims.” (Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel in Brussel and Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow; Editing by Jason Neely/Dale Hudson/Susan Fenton)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-ukraine-gas/update-2-russia-ukraine-to-hold-further-gas-talks-in-may-idUKL8N1ZL4MV,21 Jan 2019,"* No threat to Russian gas supplies via Ukraine - EU

2019-01-21,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada’s two major railways are rationing space on trains traveling to the country’s biggest port and recently prioritized some commodities over others to deal with congestion, the latest indication of their struggle to meet demand from new trade deals.  That move prompted Canada’s transport regulator last week to start an investigation into rail services around Port Metro Vancouver, after shippers complained of “discriminatory treatment of certain commodities” by Canadian National Railway (CN) (CNR.TO) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) (CP.TO). Canada is a top shipper of crops, fertilizer, oil and pulp, but has in recent years needed government intervention to keep commodities moving, from ordering railways to clear grain backlogs to Alberta’s crude oil curtailments this month due to full pipelines. Free-trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Nations are boosting demand for commodities, adding further strain to Canada’s transportation infrastructure. Currently, the United States and Mexico account for at least 75 percent of Canadian exports. Both railways last month rationed the volume of traffic around Vancouver by restricting movement of some commodities, such as peas, lentils, pulp and paper, according to shipper notices seen by Reuters.      The restrictions, called embargoes, are usually a tool of last resort for railways to ease congestion by temporarily limiting traffic. But in December, shippers allege that CN and CP used them more often than normal, harming some commodity sellers more than others in an effort to push through the maximum overall volume. CP imposed embargoes on three specific transloaders - facilities that empty rail cars into containers for loading onto vessels. These transloaders handle peas and lentils, but were prevented from doing so in December for days at a time, said Greg Northey, director of industry relations at Pulse Canada. The delays caused some containers to miss their vessels, triggering contract breach penalties, Northey said. “It was a total mess,” he said. Embargoes also added costs for pulp and paper producers, who are trying to bolster ties with Asian buyers amid ongoing tariff disputes with the United States. For a second consecutive year, the railways imposed more embargo restrictions on pulp and paper than usual in December, leading to shipping delays, according to the Forest Products Association of Canada, whose members include Canfor Corp (CFP.TO) and West Fraser Timber (WFT.TO). “We can’t do business like this if we want to diversify markets,” said association Chief Executive Derek Nighbor. “It’s just a missed opportunity.”   Poor rail service costs the forest products industry C$500 million ($376 million) annually, the association said. December’s problems cost mills as much as a further C$1 million each, it said. Several shippers said the transportation agency will be asked at a hearing in late January to consider whether the railways discriminated against shippers that fill manifest trains - those carrying a variety of products. The investigation could also consider whether the railways violated their common carrier obligations to haul a full range of freight. For CN and CP, the investigation raises the risk of further regulation in an industry where they already complain of too much government control. In a statement, CN said the transportation agency’s investigation should examine the full supply chain and take into account the impact that rain and wind had on operations late last year. CN said freight shipments are up 10 percent from November to mid-January year-over-year. CP Chief Executive Keith Creel said he takes “great exception” to CP being included in the agency’s investigation, adding in a statement that he is not aware of formal complaints. Since the railways’ embargo and permit system was implemented in December to clear backed-up freight, the flow of cars to grain terminals has improved. But it is unclear how the backlog happened in the first place, said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of Western Grain Elevator Association. It indicates that railways have failed to invest in adequate capacity to move goods at peak times, he said. Canpotex Ltd, the offshore sales arm of potash producers Nutrien Ltd (NTR.TO) and Mosaic Co (MOS.N) has also been affected by congestion and delays around Vancouver, spokeswoman Natashia Stinka said.

2019-01-21,"PARIS (Reuters) - French state-owned power company EDF (EDF.PA) said it would make further tests next month on faulty weldings at its Flamanville nuclear reactor plant, which has been plagued by technical problems. “EDF actively continues to implement the action plan on welds of the main secondary system announced on 25 July 2018. The ‘hot tests’ are now scheduled to commence during the second half of February,” EDF said in a statement. EDF added it would nevertheless keep the targeted construction costs for Flamanville at 10.9 billion euros ($12.4 billion), and it stuck to a target for completing the loading of nuclear fuel at the plant during the fourth quarter of 2019. Construction on the Flamanville site in northern France started in 2007, but it was then beset with a series of technical problems, which resulted in several delays. Last October, France’s ASN nuclear regulator had said that faulty weldings at the Flamanville site would require more repairs than originally estimated and said EDF would have to review materials on the site.

2019-01-21,"FRANKFURT/LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Ever wanted to run your electric car for free? If you’re open to a bit of give and take, then stay plugged in and your wishes might come true. At least that’s what some European power companies and Japanese carmakers believe. E.ON (EONGn.DE) and EDF (EDF.PA) are already working with Nissan (7201.T) to develop services that allow power stored in electric vehicle batteries to be sold back to the grid - and now they’re trying to persuade European carmakers to follow suit. With millions of electric cars expected on European roads over the next decade, utility firms see both an opportunity to sell drivers more electricity and a risk that surges in charging at peak times could destabilise stressed power grids. That’s why E.ON is working with Nissan to develop so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services, including software for aggregating and marketing charging data so the German power company can predict peaks and troughs in electricity demand. Nissan’s idea is that if you charge your electric vehicle (EV) at off-peak times and are prepared to sell power back to the grid when it’s under strain, you could effectively charge for free. French utility EDF has teamed up with San Diego-based V2G technology specialist Nuvve nuvve.com to build the first commercial-scale V2G charging network in Europe for vehicles made by Japan's Nissan and Mitsubishi (7211.T). Europe’s biggest utility by market value, Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI), has also worked with Nissan and Nuvve on V2G pilots in Denmark and the Netherlands, as well as in Rome and Genoa. The problem for the utilities is that unlike Nissan, the French and German firms that will make most of the electric cars expected on Europe’s road in coming years are not playing ball - at least for now.  E.ON and EDF are talking to European carmakers about taking V2G seriously, according to two industry sources, but they are more focused on EV charging technology that the sources say is less suited to two-way flows than Japanese standards. IONITY ionity.eu, a joint venture of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), BMW (BMWG.DE) and Ford (F.N), said it did not see an initial case for V2G in its drive to install high-speed charging stations across Europe to facilitate long-distance journeys. “Our clients want to charge fast and not feed back in,” a spokesman for IONITY said. “Only in combination with an external storage system would a use case possibly be interesting.” The other big V2G holdout is EV pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O), which also sells large stationary batteries for home power storage. Tesla declined to comment on V2G. The idea of using millions of EV batteries as large virtual power plants to put power back into the grid has been around for years though the concept is still mostly at the pilot phase, mainly because there are very few EVs on the roads now. But its appeal to the power industry is obvious. With a typical car driving less than 10 percent of the day, the rest of the time car batteries could be used to balance out demand and supply swings in energy networks that increasingly need to juggle intermittent solar and wind power. That’s the case in Germany in particular as it is phasing out baseload nuclear and coal-fired plants, unlike France and Japan which are sticking with nuclear to ensure a secure supply. (Analysis of planned spending on electric vehicles: tmsnrt.rs/2Hcr3H4) Jonathan Tudor, director of technology strategy at the innovation division of Britain’s biggest utility, Centrica (CNA.L), said V2G will be part of the mix of technologies stabilising networks - once more EVs hit the road. “Winding the clock forward 10-12 years, if consumer behaviour stays the same we will see thousands of people arriving home and wanting to charge up their cars at the time that is already peak demand for most countries,” he said. Alberto Piglia, global head of e-mobility at Enel, said as the EV market grows exponentially, there will be a tipping point at which there will be an explosion of related energy services. “We are preparing the world for this.” One major hurdle for the roll-out of V2G in Europe is that for now it only works well with the EV charging standard developed in Japan known as CHAdeMO. The IONITY e-mobility joint venture, meanwhile, is focused on establishing the Combined Charging System (CCS) plug as the industry standard. But experts say the communication protocol between CCS chargers and EV batteries is not being set up currently in way that allows rapid changes in two-way information flows to charge and discharge electricity. Rather, CCS is being developed so EV owners can charge vehicles as fast as possible, to encourage the acceptance of electric cars by drivers reluctant to give up the convenience of quickly filling up vehicles with gas. “We are missing a V2G charging standard,” said Gregory Poilasne, chief executive of Nuvve. The network of 4,000 V2G charging stations it is developing with EDF in Britain and France will only be used for now with corporate fleets of Nissan Leaf E-NV200 utility vans and Mitsubishi Outlanders running on the CHAdeMO standard. That’s why Nuvve is also in talks with French and other carmakers about making CCS compatible with V2G. China, the world’s biggest market for EVs, also has V2G in mind. China’s own GB/T standard is not well suited to V2G but the China Electricity Council struck an agreement with the Japan’s CHAdeMo Association last year to develop a common fast-charging plug that should handle rapid two-way flows. But at a time when global infrastructure standards for EVs have yet to be established, German carmakers are reluctant to give up on the technology they have invested in, nor cede too much control over their vehicle components to utility firms - something V2G effectively requires them to do. (Related article: Plug wars: the battle for electric car supremacy) Still, despite making little headway so far, E.ON hopes that the CCS standard will become part of the V2G mix. “The technology for aggregation and marketing that we’re developing at E.ON based on the CHAdeMO standard will also be applicable to the CCS standard,” said Johannes Werhahn, E.ON’s head of flexibility, renewables marketing and storage solutions. OVO Energy www.ovoenergy.com, a challenger to Britain's ""Big Six"" power retailers, is also eyeing CCS as a market for the V2G charger it launched last year in a deal with Nissan. “We are very close partners with Nissan but we do expect to work with other car manufacturers in future, including those that use CCS,” said Tom Pakenham, OVO’s head of EVs. Centrica invested in Israeli EV software charging firm Driivz driivz.com last year and said part of the deal would involve developing V2G technology. “Once the software is integrated and we understand what needs to be done we will look to start trials, likely sometime in the next 18 months,” Tudor said. One catch for V2G proponents is that constantly charging and discharging is widely perceived to be the fastest way to shorten the life span of a battery - the most expensive component in an EV usually accounting for about a third of its cost. Analysts say persuading consumers that V2G makes economic sense and doesn’t disrupt their daily lives will be crucial. Nissan, though, is convinced V2G will “change the rules of the game” once consumers can be offered a service that will effectively mean they can charge vehicles for free. Japan’s Honda (7267.T) also plans to incorporate V2G capability when it launches its first EV in Europe this year. Nuvve’s Poilasne said V2G could reduce the total cost of EV ownership by about 25 percent without ruining the battery, though earnings from grid-balancing services would be greater in countries with a larger share of intermittent renewable energy.

Total output fell to 76.12 million tonnes last month from 77.62 million tonnes in November, but was up 8.2 percent from December 2017, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday. That means average daily steel output dipped 5 percent from the month before to 2.46 million tonnes, the lowest level since the 2.39 million tonnes recorded in March, according to Reuters calculations. The world’s biggest steel maker churned out a record 928.26 million tonnes of crude steel in 2018, the data showed, up 6.6 percent from 2017, buoyed by firm demand in the first three quarters of the year. However, profits at steel mills have plunged nearly 60 percent since November on stronger-than-expected supply after Beijing ditched blanket measures to cut industrial production over the winter. The environment ministry has vowed to adopt more efficient and targeted measures to fight pollution in 2019. An executive at China’s Iron and Steel Association said last week that the country’s steel industry would shift its focus to optimising capacity structure in 2019 from reducing overall capacity. China currently has around 980 million tonnes of steelmaking capacity. A government consultancy predicted last month that steel output would slip back to 900 million tonnes in 2019, curbed by cooling demand in major downstream sectors such as property, automobiles and energy.

2019-01-21,"TLAHUELILPAN/MEXICO CITY, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico’s new government knew a pipeline was leaking but did not act for hours before a blast killed at least 85 people, a minister said on Sunday, increasing scrutiny of a push to stop fuel theft seen as the president’s first crackdown on crime. State oil firm Pemex did not close the gasoline pipe when first notified by the military, about four hours before Friday’s blast, because it considered the leak “minimal,” Security Minister Alfonso Durazo told a news conference.  In the hours that followed, the leak grew and as many as 800 people brought plastic containers to the gushing duct, filling up with free fuel in what witnesses described as an almost festive atmosphere. Relatives of some of the victims said fuel shortages stemming from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s plan attracted people to the leak at the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline, a few miles from a major refinery. In December, Lopez Obrador sent soldiers to refineries to help fight organised crime and white-collar fuel theft, while shutting down pipelines tapped by thieves. The measures have reduced theft, but in early January also led to shortages and lines at gas stations stretching for miles. Soon after dark on Friday in the Tlahuelilpan district of the central Hidalgo state, gasoline and fumes ignited in a fireball that killed at least 85 people and left a black scar on the land. Dozens were so badly charred they will only be identified through DNA testing, officials said.   Critics say the government did too little to prevent people from gathering at the scene before the explosion, was too hasty in sending gasoline through the duct after weeks of it being closed due to the fuel theft crackdown and acted too slowly once the leak was detected. Half a dozen people told Reuters their relatives went to the leaking duct because they had been struggling to find fuel and were desperate to fill up cars to get to work or run their farms.  “A lot of innocent people came here, perhaps their car didn’t have enough gasoline for tomorrow, and they said: ‘I’m just going to go for a few litres’,” said farmer Isidoro Velasco, 51, who said his nephew, Mario Hidalgo, was probably killed. Pemex had been in a rush to reopen the pipeline to avoid a new round of gasoline shortages in Mexico City, said Gonzalo Monroy, the head of Mexico-based energy consulting firm GMEC, citing conversations with oil industry professionals. Disputing accounts that fuel thieves opened up the pipe, he said sources in Pemex indicated the fissure occurred at a spot Pemex had previously repaired, and gave way under the pressure of a new surge of fuel.      Pemex officials decided to keep fuel running after the first signs of a leak, and send a team to inspect it, he said. Pemex did not respond to requests for comment.  When questioned about why it took so long to close the pipe’s valves after the leak was detected, Durazo said Pemex followed protocol. The explosion occurred half an hour after Pemex closed the valve, he said, because high-octane gasoline remained in the pipe. Lopez Obrador said on Sunday that the disaster had not weakened his resolve to fight fuel theft.  “I won’t take a single step backwards,” he said at the first of two news conferences. “I can only offer people apologies, if this action causes sacrifices, harm and inconveniences.”  Lopez Obrador said he hoped supply would normalise soon as Mexico buys more tanker trucks for distribution by road. If successful in uprooting a parallel fuel network that siphons off about $3 billion worth of fuel from Pemex each year, the veteran leftist who won last year’s election on promises to root out endemic corruption will have scored a big early victory, strengthening ailing national oil company Pemex and helping stabilise fuel prices.      The blast, however, has raised the stakes.  Failure would likely not only erode his popularity but pose risks for the economy, the world’s sixth-biggest fuel market.  An opinion poll last week showed the fuel strategy was a polarizing issue, with about half the population supporting the measure despite the lines at gas stations and other difficulties.   Pemex initially took the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline out of service in late December as the government tried to protect it from gangs who had hit it 10 times in Tlahuelilpan, Pemex Chief Executive Officer Octavio Romero said on Saturday.  After Pemex began attempting to restart operations on Wednesday, the line experienced four more attacks.              Romero said Pemex closed a valve at the pipeline on Friday after noting a drop in pressure from the leak. Pemex informed other authorities of the leak at 4:50 p.m., he added. Responding to questions about why fuel kept flowing from the leak up until the explosion, Lopez Obrador said that 10,000 barrels of gasoline were accumulated in the pipeline between the Tula refinery and the village. Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said the pipeline was pressurized. Lopez Obrador said the army, which deployed just 25 soldiers before the explosion, gave orders for villagers to stay back, but were ignored.

2019-01-21,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will order detailed punishment measures for officials in regions that miss air quality targets this winter, refusing to accept unfavorable weather or mounting economic pressure as excuses, an environment ministry official said on Monday. China is in the fifth year of a war on pollution to reverse the environmental damage of four decades of breakneck economic growth and last year cut concentrations of hazardous particles known as PM2.5 by an average of 9.3 percent in 338 cities.    But in the key northern control area of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the concentration of such particles rose to an average of 73 micrograms per cubic meter in the last three months of the year, more than double the official 35-microgram standard. That prompted fresh fears that local governments were turning a blind eye to polluters. Henan province, home to the worst performing cities in the last quarter of 2018, blamed “unfavorable weather conditions” for the rise. “There is no way for local officials to evade punishment by using weather conditions as an excuse,” said Liu Bingjiang, head of the atmospheric environment department of China’s environment ministry. “Similarly, the economic situation cannot be used as an excuse,” he told a regular briefing.  “For those who failed to meet the targets, we will hold them accountable publicly and local governments will need to come out with detailed punishment measures.” The ministry has repeatedly warned that China’s economic slowdown brought fresh challenges in the effort to curb smog. Economic growth fell to 6.6 percent in 2018, the lowest in 28 years, the statistics bureau has said. But while China will try to take a more “nuanced” approach to pollution, aiming to make companies “feel at ease”, Liu said it would show no leniency in punishing offenders.  China will impose even tougher ultra-low emission standards at steel mills this year, and has also pledged more action to clean up coal consumption in the north. Ministry officials said weather, which accounted for about a third of air quality improvements in 2018, had already been factored into assessments of local officials’ performance. China has long used a tactic of naming and shaming city governments, forcing mayors to make public apologies and firing local bureaucrats, to ensure pollution is tackled. “We have to win the war against air pollution, no matter what happens,” said Liu. “There is no leeway for us and we will not retreat.” Reporting by Muyu Xu and David Stanway; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-pollution/update-1-china-vows-no-leeway-for-underperformers-in-war-on-pollution-idUKL3N1ZL1T1,21 Jan 2019,"* Tougher steel mill standards, new action against coal

The world’s top producer churned out more than 3 million tonnes in a month for the first time, undeterred by aluminium prices at two-year lows, the impact of the U.S.-China trade war and Beijing’s environmental crackdown. Production was likely spurred by new smelter openings late last year and higher utilisation rates following a plunge in the cost of raw material alumina, said Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities. Output hit 3.05 million tonnes in December, National Bureau of Statistics data showed, up 8.2 percent from November and up 11.3 percent from December 2017. On a daily basis, China produced almost 98,400 tonnes of aluminium last month, up from 94,000 tonnes in November and also a record high, according to Reuters calculations. December had one more day than November. Full-year output came in at 35.8 million tonnes in 2018, up 7.4 percent from the previous annual record in 2017. China added 3.8 million tonnes of aluminium smelting capacity in 2018, according to consultancy AZ China, while about 2.8 million tonnes was shut due to a slump in aluminium prices. Winter restrictions on output to curb pollution were also less severe than expected. Shanghai aluminium prices slumped a hefty 14 percent over 2018 to below 14,000 yuan ($2,063) a tonne amid plentiful supply and worries over the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war on demand. “Even though at the current (aluminium) price you may say smelters are not making money, as long as they break even they will continue to produce,” said Lau, who expects another 5 percent increase in China’s output in 2019. “Those newly commissioned smelters have to start operating to pay back their loans. They have to generate enough cash flow to do that.” Alumina prices, which soared from March last year on an outage at Norsk Hydro’s Alunorte plant, fell almost 30 percent in the fourth quarter, easing the pressure on smelters. Meanwhile, output of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminium, lead, zinc and nickel - came in at a record 5.08 million tonnes in December, up 7.8 percent from November and up 10 percent year-on-year. Full-year output was up 6 percent at 56.88 million tonnes, also a record high. The other metals in the group are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.

Refiners processed 603.57 million tonnes of crude last year, or about 12.07 million barrels per day (bpd), up 6.8 percent from 2017, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. In December, crude runs rose 4.4 percent from the year before to 51.17 million tonnes, or 12.05 million bpd, hovering near a record of 52.78 million tonnes racked up in October. Top oil and gas group CNPC said on Monday that its crude processing volume rose 4.7 percent last year from 2017 to 207.3 million tonnes, or 4.15 million bpd. New refineries including Zhejiang Petrochemical and the Sinopec-Kuwait refining complex in Zhanjiang were expected to add 32 million tonnes of new refining capacity to the world’s largest energy consumer, according to the research unit of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC). China’s crude runs are likely to grow 4.7 percent in 2019 from last year to hit a record of 634 million tonnes, or 12.68 million bpd, according to a report from CNPC’s think tank on Wednesday. Crude oil output dropped in 2018 for a third straight year despite increasing capital spending from oil producers, the data showed. Annual crude production declined 1.3 percent to 189.11 million tonnes, or 3.78 million bpd. But in December, output recorded a rare year-on-year increase of 2 percent after companies stepped up drilling, with monthly output at 16.33 million tonnes, or 3.845 million bpd, the highest daily level since June last year. For most of the last three years, China’s monthly crude oil production has shown year-on-year declines amid the higher costs of operating mature fields and a lack of new discoveries. China’s CNOOC said on Friday that it aimed to double its domestic exploration work and proven oil and gas reserves in seven years. Meanwhile, December natural gas output surged to a record 15.3 billion cubic metres (bcm), up 10 percent from a year ago, exceeding a record of 14.27 bcm in November, the data showed. For all of 2018, gas output rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier to 161 bcm. tonne = 7.3 barrels for crude conversion

2019-01-21,"SINGAPORE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Monday, weighed down by expectations that China will report its weakest economic growth in almost three decades amid waning domestic demand and painful U.S. tariffs. Still, analysts expect oil prices to be relatively well supported this year by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC allies, including Russia. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.30 per barrel at 0022 GMT, down 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 37 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $53.43 a barrel. U.S. bank J.P. Morgan said there were ongoing signs of economic uncertainty. “The global outlook remains murky, despite emerging positives from a dovish Fed (now boosting U.S. mortgage applications), faster China easing (China credit growth stabilizing) and a more durable U.S.-China truce,” it said. Despite this, analysts said supply cuts led by OPEC would likely provide crude oil prices with support. “Brent can remain above $60 per barrel on OPEC+ compliance, expiry of Iran waivers and slower U.S. output growth,” J.P. Morgan said. It recommended investors should “stay long” crude oil. Researchers at Bernstein Energy said the supply cuts led by OPEC “will move the market back into supply deficit” for most of 2019 and that “this should allow oil prices to rise to U.S. $70 per barrel before year-end from current levels of U.S.$60 per barrel.” In the United States, energy firms cut 21 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 18, taking the total count down to 852, the lowest since May 2018, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in a weekly report on Friday. It was biggest decline since February 2016, as drillers reacted to the 40 percent plunge in U.S. crude prices late last year. However, U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA still rose by more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, to a record 11.9 million bpd. With the rig count stalling, last year’s growth rate is unlikely to be repeated in 2019, although most analysts expect annual production to average well over 12 million bpd, making the United States the world’s biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Chinese stocks had rallied on Friday on reports U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, a story later denied. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday there has been progress toward a trade deal with China, but denied that he was considering lifting tariffs. “Things are going very well with China and with trade,” he told reporters at the White House. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of talks with Washington. Over in Britain, May will return to parliament on Monday to set out how she plans to try to break the Brexit deadlock after her deal was rejected by lawmakers last week. May told ministers on Sunday she was looking for ways to make the so-called Northern Irish backstop more acceptable to her Conservative Party and Northern Irish allies. “We expect only incremental changes from “Plan A” given cross-party talks have fallen flat,” analysts at TD Securities wrote in a note. “Amendments are likely to be introduced all week, with MPs pushing to cancel ‘No-Deal’, introduce a second referendum, and perhaps push for a permanent customs union,” they added. “May will likely travel to Brussels to seek concessions from the EU.” The uncertainty kept sterling sidelined at $1.2860, having briefly been as high as $1.3000 last week. The dollar held firm on the yen at 109.63, while the euro was near the floor of its recent trading range at $1.1365 . Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a shade firmer at 96.362. In commodity markets, spot gold was steady at $1,282.80 per ounce. Oil prices eased Monday after jumping about 3 percent on Friday as OPEC detailed specifics on its production-cut activity to ease global oversupply. Brent crude dipped 35 cents to $62.35 a barrel.

Data showed the Chinese economy, the world’s second biggest, grew 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis. It was in line with forecasts, while factory output picked up stronger-than-expected in December and stronger services sector were some bright spots. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose to the highest since early-December, while Chinese mainland markets and Tokyo also firmed, banking on further stimulus from Beijing.  . But the rally in world shares appeared to end there. In Europe, stock markets with the exception of Britain were broadly lower .

U.S. stock market futures, which offer an indication of how Wall Street shares will next open, were down roughly half a percent “It seems that the optimism we saw in Asia did not extend into Europe,” said Brittany Baumann, macro strategist at TD Securities in London. “And the start of this week is a reflection of the downside risk that still exist - Brexit and China/U.S. trade developments.” Chinese stocks had rallied on Friday on reports U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, a story later denied. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday there has been progress toward a trade deal with China, but denied that he was considering lifting tariffs. Growing signs of weakness in China — which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years — has fueled anxiety about risks to the world economy in recent weeks and are weighing on profits for firms such as Apple. “On balance, the (China) data is relatively positive and does not point to a hard landing,” said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Advisors in London. “The consumption data being better than expected is the positive takeaway in that China is trying to engineer a move towards a consumer-led economy.” In other signs that caution was setting in, the Australian dollar, often used a liquid proxy for China investments, nudged down to $0.7155. China’s economy faces deep and complicated changes, President Xi Jinping said on Monday. Oil prices also fell on further evidence that economic growth in China, the world’s second largest crude consumer, eased in 2018. Brent crude oil futures fell 0.3 percent to $62.50, having briefly nudged above $63 for the first time in 2019. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down about 0.25 percent at $53.67 a barrel.

2019-01-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds have started to accumulate bullish positions in crude oil and diesel once more, amid rising optimism about the outlook for the global economy in 2019. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in Brent crude futures and options by 15 million barrels to 173 million barrels in the week to Jan. 15. Portfolio managers have raised their net long position in Brent in five of the last six weeks, by a combined 36 million barrels since Dec. 4, according to exchange data. Funds also boosted their net long position in European gasoil by 6 million barrels to 11 million barrels, the second small weekly increase in a row, after twelve large consecutive declines. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2S2rQP2) In both cases, most of the new buying came from the closure of existing short positions rather than opening fresh long ones. It follows the largest sell-off ever recorded in crude and gasoil during the fourth quarter and suggests many fund managers sense prices have found a floor, at least temporarily. The new wave of buying in crude and gasoil is still small and net positions are still a fraction of the 500 million barrels of Brent and 126 million barrels of gasoil held in September. But it comes amid increasing optimism among investors about a future trade deal between the United States and China that could help avert a feared recession. The same optimism that has boosted the U.S. S&P 500 share index by 14 percent since Dec. 26 and South Korea’s trade-exposed KOSPI-100 index by 8 percent since Jan. 4 is helping reverse some of the recent losses in oil prices.

2019-01-21,"* LNG tanker Neo Energy en-route to Japan - data * Unusual for Chinese to resell cargoes during winter - source * Domestic gas prices are flat - source By Jessica Jaganathan and Chen Aizhu SINGAPORE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) has resold a liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo floating offshore South Korea, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon and three industry sources, highlighting the drop in winter gas demand in China. The move is a departure from the 2017/18 winter, when China was desperate to procure LNG to meet demand for the super-chilled fuel amid a spike in natural gas consumption following a government-mandated switch from coal to gas for residential heating and industrial processes. In 2017, CNOOC spent $10 million to lease two LNG tankers, including one called the Neo Energy, as an emergency stash of the fuel for unloading at the company’s receiving terminals at Tianjin in northern China and Ningbo on the east coast. Now, CNOOC has sold a cargo on the Neo Energy, which was loaded onto the ship on Nov. 15 from the Bontang liquefaction plant in Indonesia, one of the sources, with direct knowledge of the move, said on Monday. On Sunday, CNOOC redirected the Neo Energy to Tokyo from the Okpo anchorage in South Korea, the Eikon data showed. The vessel, currently fully laden, can hold about 150,000 cubic metres of LNG. Details of the buyer were not immediately clear. “The whole idea of leasing Neo Energy was to cope with spikes in winter demand but now it seems there is less such need,” the source added, who asked not to be identified as he is not authorised to speak with the media. CNOOC could not immediately be reached for comment. Last winter’s gas shortages prompted Chinese companies this winter to secure supply ahead of time and pushed LNG imports to a record monthly high in December. But temperatures have been higher than normal this winter and weather data from Refinitiv Eikon forecasts warmer-than-usual temperatures ahead, leaving suppliers with high inventories. Chinese buyers do not typically resell LNG cargoes during winter, highlighting the country’s reduced appetite for the fuel, said a second source, who is involved in LNG shipping. Companies were under pressure to remove the surplus LNG cargoes because of the supply and demand imbalance this winter, likely resulting in losses from the sales because of flat domestic gas prices, said the first source. An LNG distributor based in the northern Chinese city of Tangshan, the country’s biggest steel producing city, said Monday that industrial LNG demand has been flat this winter as users such as steel mills have curbed output to meet air pollution reduction targets. Ex-terminal LNG prices for the Tangshan region are at 5,050 yuan to 5,100 yuan ($751) per tonne, little changed from the start of the heating season in November, the operator said. $1 = 6.7925 Chinese yuan renminbi

2019-01-21,"JUBA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - South Sudan has begun to repair and pump oil from wells damaged in the civil war and will ramp up production by the end of the year, the oil minister told Reuters ahead of a Monday trip to the oil fields. Production is currently at 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) and the wells reopening on Monday will add 12,000 bpd to that, rising to 70,000 bpd by the end of 2019, South Sudan’s oil minister Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth told Reuters on Sunday as he prepared to travel north to meet his Sudanese counterpart for a ceremony at the oilfields. South Sudan’s oil infrastructure was badly damaged in its civil war, which broke out in 2013, two years after it had become independent from neighbouring Sudan. Production plunged to less than half of prewar levels but wells are being repaired with the help of the Sudanese, said Gatkuoth. Malaysia’s Petronas, India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC Videsh) and the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) all have stakes in South Sudan. Cargoes have been booked until the end of March, Gatkuoth said, but now there would be additional oil for sale. South Sudan’s Dar blend is currently being sold for $61 per barrel. Neighbouring Sudan receives between about $9-11 per barrel of oil that landlocked South Sudan pumps through its pipeline to the port, the minister said.

2019-01-21,"TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese refiners have loaded Iranian oil onto a tanker, resuming imports after halting purchases because of sanctions by the United States, a spokesman for a Japanese refinery and an Iranian official said on Monday. Japan is the last of the four biggest Iranian oil buyers in Asia to resume imports after receiving a waiver from U.S. sanctions on crude imports that started in November. China and India maintained their imports after November while South Korea halted imports for four months, resuming them over the weekend.   Iran is the fourth-largest oil producer among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “After China, South Korea, India and Turkey, Japan also started the process of importing Iranian oil,” Abdolnaser Hemmati, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran, said according to the state news agency IRNA. Japanese refiner Fuji Oil Co (5017.T) lifted a cargo of Iranian crude oil over the weekend, a company spokesman said. The very large crude carrier (VLCC) Kisogawa loaded about 2 million barrels of Iranian oil on Sunday and is expected to reach Japan on Feb. 9, according to the Fuji spokesman and Refinitiv Eikon data. Fuji Oil owns about half of the oil onboard, while Showa Shell Sekiyu KK (5002.T) owns the remainder, the Fuji spokesman said. “It took a while for us to resume imports of Iranian oil,” he said, adding that the biggest hurdle was to get banks to agree to handle payments to Iran. A Showa Shell spokesman declined to comment on specific deals, adding that it has an option to resume Iran oil imports if all conditions are met. Still, the Iranian exports to Japan, the world’s fourth-biggest oil import, may be short-lived as two buyers based in Japan said they may not be able to continue after annual tanker insurance backed by the Japanese government expires in March. “We have already bought oil in case we can’t take Iranian cargoes for March loading,” one of the buyers said. Iran’s oil exports have fallen sharply since U.S. President Donald Trump said in May 2018 the United States would withdraw from a pact curtailing Iran’s disputed nuclear program and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Japan stopped oil imports from Iran in November when the sanctions came into effect. Iranian oil accounted for 5.3 percent of Japan’s total crude imports in 2017. However, waivers were granted to Iran’s biggest oil clients  - Japan, China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Italy, Greece and Turkey - which allow them to import some oil for another 180 days. On Saturday, South Korea received its first Iranian oil cargo in four months.

2019-01-21,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s December coal output climbed 2.1 percent from the year before, government data showed, hitting the highest level in over three years as major miners ramped up production amid robust winter demand and after the country started up new mines. Miners produced 320.38 million tonnes of coal in December, according to data released on Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics. That is the largest volume since June, 2015.   China approved more than 45 billion yuan’s ($6.64 billion)worth of new coal mining projects last year, much more than 2017, official documents show.  That came after the country closed old and more-polluting coal mines as part of its battle to clean up the environment. “Coal mining capacity coming online will lead to another increase in output this year after boosting December output to a more than three-year high,” said a Beijing-based coal analyst with a major broker. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised by his company to speak to media on the matter. The new projects stoked overall coal output last year, with annual production rising 5.2 percent to the highest since 2015 at 3.55 billion tonnes. However, some miners and traders expect supplies to fall sharply in January following a crackdown on coal mines after a major accident on Jan. 13 in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, potentially dragging on output through the year. “It is now possible that Shaanxi will implement the strictest-ever regulations on illegal production, which would significantly reduce output in the province for the year,” Zhai Yu, senior consultant at analysts Wood Mackenzie said in a note published last week. “If stricter checks are extended to other provinces, domestic supply could tighten from its currently relaxed situation, helping coal imports as a result,” Zhai wrote.  Shaanxi accounts for about 20 percent of China’s annual coal production.

2019-01-21,"PARIS (Reuters) - French state-owned power company EDF (EDF.PA) said it would make further tests next month on faulty weldings at its Flamanville nuclear reactor plant, which has been plagued by technical problems. “EDF actively continues to implement the action plan on welds of the main secondary system announced on 25 July 2018. The ‘hot tests’ are now scheduled to commence during the second half of February,” EDF said in a statement. EDF added it would nevertheless keep the targeted construction costs for Flamanville at 10.9 billion euros ($12.4 billion), and it stuck to a target for completing the loading of nuclear fuel at the plant during the fourth quarter of 2019. Construction on the Flamanville site in northern France started in 2007, but it was then beset with a series of technical problems, which resulted in several delays. Last October, France’s ASN nuclear regulator had said that faulty weldings at the Flamanville site would require more repairs than originally estimated and said EDF would have to review materials on the site.

2019-01-21,"FRANKFURT/LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Ever wanted to run your electric car for free? If you’re open to a bit of give and take, then stay plugged in and your wishes might come true. At least that’s what some European power companies and Japanese carmakers believe. E.ON (EONGn.DE) and EDF (EDF.PA) are already working with Nissan (7201.T) to develop services that allow power stored in electric vehicle batteries to be sold back to the grid - and now they’re trying to persuade European carmakers to follow suit. With millions of electric cars expected on European roads over the next decade, utility firms see both an opportunity to sell drivers more electricity and a risk that surges in charging at peak times could destabilise stressed power grids. That’s why E.ON is working with Nissan to develop so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services, including software for aggregating and marketing charging data so the German power company can predict peaks and troughs in electricity demand. Nissan’s idea is that if you charge your electric vehicle (EV) at off-peak times and are prepared to sell power back to the grid when it’s under strain, you could effectively charge for free. French utility EDF has teamed up with San Diego-based V2G technology specialist Nuvve nuvve.com to build the first commercial-scale V2G charging network in Europe for vehicles made by Japan's Nissan and Mitsubishi (7211.T). Europe’s biggest utility by market value, Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI), has also worked with Nissan and Nuvve on V2G pilots in Denmark and the Netherlands, as well as in Rome and Genoa. The problem for the utilities is that unlike Nissan, the French and German firms that will make most of the electric cars expected on Europe’s road in coming years are not playing ball - at least for now.  E.ON and EDF are talking to European carmakers about taking V2G seriously, according to two industry sources, but they are more focused on EV charging technology that the sources say is less suited to two-way flows than Japanese standards. IONITY ionity.eu, a joint venture of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), BMW (BMWG.DE) and Ford (F.N), said it did not see an initial case for V2G in its drive to install high-speed charging stations across Europe to facilitate long-distance journeys. “Our clients want to charge fast and not feed back in,” a spokesman for IONITY said. “Only in combination with an external storage system would a use case possibly be interesting.” The other big V2G holdout is EV pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O), which also sells large stationary batteries for home power storage. Tesla declined to comment on V2G. The idea of using millions of EV batteries as large virtual power plants to put power back into the grid has been around for years though the concept is still mostly at the pilot phase, mainly because there are very few EVs on the roads now. But its appeal to the power industry is obvious. With a typical car driving less than 10 percent of the day, the rest of the time car batteries could be used to balance out demand and supply swings in energy networks that increasingly need to juggle intermittent solar and wind power. That’s the case in Germany in particular as it is phasing out baseload nuclear and coal-fired plants, unlike France and Japan which are sticking with nuclear to ensure a secure supply. (Analysis of planned spending on electric vehicles: tmsnrt.rs/2Hcr3H4) Jonathan Tudor, director of technology strategy at the innovation division of Britain’s biggest utility, Centrica (CNA.L), said V2G will be part of the mix of technologies stabilising networks - once more EVs hit the road. “Winding the clock forward 10-12 years, if consumer behaviour stays the same we will see thousands of people arriving home and wanting to charge up their cars at the time that is already peak demand for most countries,” he said. Alberto Piglia, global head of e-mobility at Enel, said as the EV market grows exponentially, there will be a tipping point at which there will be an explosion of related energy services. “We are preparing the world for this.” One major hurdle for the roll-out of V2G in Europe is that for now it only works well with the EV charging standard developed in Japan known as CHAdeMO. The IONITY e-mobility joint venture, meanwhile, is focused on establishing the Combined Charging System (CCS) plug as the industry standard. But experts say the communication protocol between CCS chargers and EV batteries is not being set up currently in way that allows rapid changes in two-way information flows to charge and discharge electricity. Rather, CCS is being developed so EV owners can charge vehicles as fast as possible, to encourage the acceptance of electric cars by drivers reluctant to give up the convenience of quickly filling up vehicles with gas. “We are missing a V2G charging standard,” said Gregory Poilasne, chief executive of Nuvve. The network of 4,000 V2G charging stations it is developing with EDF in Britain and France will only be used for now with corporate fleets of Nissan Leaf E-NV200 utility vans and Mitsubishi Outlanders running on the CHAdeMO standard. That’s why Nuvve is also in talks with French and other carmakers about making CCS compatible with V2G. China, the world’s biggest market for EVs, also has V2G in mind. China’s own GB/T standard is not well suited to V2G but the China Electricity Council struck an agreement with the Japan’s CHAdeMo Association last year to develop a common fast-charging plug that should handle rapid two-way flows. But at a time when global infrastructure standards for EVs have yet to be established, German carmakers are reluctant to give up on the technology they have invested in, nor cede too much control over their vehicle components to utility firms - something V2G effectively requires them to do. (Related article: Plug wars: the battle for electric car supremacy) Still, despite making little headway so far, E.ON hopes that the CCS standard will become part of the V2G mix. “The technology for aggregation and marketing that we’re developing at E.ON based on the CHAdeMO standard will also be applicable to the CCS standard,” said Johannes Werhahn, E.ON’s head of flexibility, renewables marketing and storage solutions. OVO Energy www.ovoenergy.com, a challenger to Britain's ""Big Six"" power retailers, is also eyeing CCS as a market for the V2G charger it launched last year in a deal with Nissan. “We are very close partners with Nissan but we do expect to work with other car manufacturers in future, including those that use CCS,” said Tom Pakenham, OVO’s head of EVs. Centrica invested in Israeli EV software charging firm Driivz driivz.com last year and said part of the deal would involve developing V2G technology. “Once the software is integrated and we understand what needs to be done we will look to start trials, likely sometime in the next 18 months,” Tudor said. One catch for V2G proponents is that constantly charging and discharging is widely perceived to be the fastest way to shorten the life span of a battery - the most expensive component in an EV usually accounting for about a third of its cost. Analysts say persuading consumers that V2G makes economic sense and doesn’t disrupt their daily lives will be crucial. Nissan, though, is convinced V2G will “change the rules of the game” once consumers can be offered a service that will effectively mean they can charge vehicles for free. Japan’s Honda (7267.T) also plans to incorporate V2G capability when it launches its first EV in Europe this year. Nuvve’s Poilasne said V2G could reduce the total cost of EV ownership by about 25 percent without ruining the battery, though earnings from grid-balancing services would be greater in countries with a larger share of intermittent renewable energy.

Total output fell to 76.12 million tonnes last month from 77.62 million tonnes in November, but was up 8.2 percent from December 2017, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday. That means average daily steel output dipped 5 percent from the month before to 2.46 million tonnes, the lowest level since the 2.39 million tonnes recorded in March, according to Reuters calculations. The world’s biggest steel maker churned out a record 928.26 million tonnes of crude steel in 2018, the data showed, up 6.6 percent from 2017, buoyed by firm demand in the first three quarters of the year. However, profits at steel mills have plunged nearly 60 percent since November on stronger-than-expected supply after Beijing ditched blanket measures to cut industrial production over the winter. The environment ministry has vowed to adopt more efficient and targeted measures to fight pollution in 2019. An executive at China’s Iron and Steel Association said last week that the country’s steel industry would shift its focus to optimising capacity structure in 2019 from reducing overall capacity. China currently has around 980 million tonnes of steelmaking capacity. A government consultancy predicted last month that steel output would slip back to 900 million tonnes in 2019, curbed by cooling demand in major downstream sectors such as property, automobiles and energy.

2019-01-21,"TLAHUELILPAN/MEXICO CITY, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico’s new government knew a pipeline was leaking but did not act for hours before a blast killed at least 85 people, a minister said on Sunday, increasing scrutiny of a push to stop fuel theft seen as the president’s first crackdown on crime. State oil firm Pemex did not close the gasoline pipe when first notified by the military, about four hours before Friday’s blast, because it considered the leak “minimal,” Security Minister Alfonso Durazo told a news conference.  In the hours that followed, the leak grew and as many as 800 people brought plastic containers to the gushing duct, filling up with free fuel in what witnesses described as an almost festive atmosphere. Relatives of some of the victims said fuel shortages stemming from President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s plan attracted people to the leak at the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline, a few miles from a major refinery. In December, Lopez Obrador sent soldiers to refineries to help fight organised crime and white-collar fuel theft, while shutting down pipelines tapped by thieves. The measures have reduced theft, but in early January also led to shortages and lines at gas stations stretching for miles. Soon after dark on Friday in the Tlahuelilpan district of the central Hidalgo state, gasoline and fumes ignited in a fireball that killed at least 85 people and left a black scar on the land. Dozens were so badly charred they will only be identified through DNA testing, officials said.   Critics say the government did too little to prevent people from gathering at the scene before the explosion, was too hasty in sending gasoline through the duct after weeks of it being closed due to the fuel theft crackdown and acted too slowly once the leak was detected. Half a dozen people told Reuters their relatives went to the leaking duct because they had been struggling to find fuel and were desperate to fill up cars to get to work or run their farms.  “A lot of innocent people came here, perhaps their car didn’t have enough gasoline for tomorrow, and they said: ‘I’m just going to go for a few litres’,” said farmer Isidoro Velasco, 51, who said his nephew, Mario Hidalgo, was probably killed. Pemex had been in a rush to reopen the pipeline to avoid a new round of gasoline shortages in Mexico City, said Gonzalo Monroy, the head of Mexico-based energy consulting firm GMEC, citing conversations with oil industry professionals. Disputing accounts that fuel thieves opened up the pipe, he said sources in Pemex indicated the fissure occurred at a spot Pemex had previously repaired, and gave way under the pressure of a new surge of fuel.      Pemex officials decided to keep fuel running after the first signs of a leak, and send a team to inspect it, he said. Pemex did not respond to requests for comment.  When questioned about why it took so long to close the pipe’s valves after the leak was detected, Durazo said Pemex followed protocol. The explosion occurred half an hour after Pemex closed the valve, he said, because high-octane gasoline remained in the pipe. Lopez Obrador said on Sunday that the disaster had not weakened his resolve to fight fuel theft.  “I won’t take a single step backwards,” he said at the first of two news conferences. “I can only offer people apologies, if this action causes sacrifices, harm and inconveniences.”  Lopez Obrador said he hoped supply would normalise soon as Mexico buys more tanker trucks for distribution by road. If successful in uprooting a parallel fuel network that siphons off about $3 billion worth of fuel from Pemex each year, the veteran leftist who won last year’s election on promises to root out endemic corruption will have scored a big early victory, strengthening ailing national oil company Pemex and helping stabilise fuel prices.      The blast, however, has raised the stakes.  Failure would likely not only erode his popularity but pose risks for the economy, the world’s sixth-biggest fuel market.  An opinion poll last week showed the fuel strategy was a polarizing issue, with about half the population supporting the measure despite the lines at gas stations and other difficulties.   Pemex initially took the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline out of service in late December as the government tried to protect it from gangs who had hit it 10 times in Tlahuelilpan, Pemex Chief Executive Officer Octavio Romero said on Saturday.  After Pemex began attempting to restart operations on Wednesday, the line experienced four more attacks.              Romero said Pemex closed a valve at the pipeline on Friday after noting a drop in pressure from the leak. Pemex informed other authorities of the leak at 4:50 p.m., he added. Responding to questions about why fuel kept flowing from the leak up until the explosion, Lopez Obrador said that 10,000 barrels of gasoline were accumulated in the pipeline between the Tula refinery and the village. Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said the pipeline was pressurized. Lopez Obrador said the army, which deployed just 25 soldiers before the explosion, gave orders for villagers to stay back, but were ignored.

2019-01-21,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will order detailed punishment measures for officials in regions that miss air quality targets this winter, refusing to accept unfavorable weather or mounting economic pressure as excuses, an environment ministry official said on Monday. China is in the fifth year of a war on pollution to reverse the environmental damage of four decades of breakneck economic growth and last year cut concentrations of hazardous particles known as PM2.5 by an average of 9.3 percent in 338 cities.    But in the key northern control area of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the concentration of such particles rose to an average of 73 micrograms per cubic meter in the last three months of the year, more than double the official 35-microgram standard. That prompted fresh fears that local governments were turning a blind eye to polluters. Henan province, home to the worst performing cities in the last quarter of 2018, blamed “unfavorable weather conditions” for the rise. “There is no way for local officials to evade punishment by using weather conditions as an excuse,” said Liu Bingjiang, head of the atmospheric environment department of China’s environment ministry. “Similarly, the economic situation cannot be used as an excuse,” he told a regular briefing.  “For those who failed to meet the targets, we will hold them accountable publicly and local governments will need to come out with detailed punishment measures.” The ministry has repeatedly warned that China’s economic slowdown brought fresh challenges in the effort to curb smog. Economic growth fell to 6.6 percent in 2018, the lowest in 28 years, the statistics bureau has said. But while China will try to take a more “nuanced” approach to pollution, aiming to make companies “feel at ease”, Liu said it would show no leniency in punishing offenders.  China will impose even tougher ultra-low emission standards at steel mills this year, and has also pledged more action to clean up coal consumption in the north. Ministry officials said weather, which accounted for about a third of air quality improvements in 2018, had already been factored into assessments of local officials’ performance. China has long used a tactic of naming and shaming city governments, forcing mayors to make public apologies and firing local bureaucrats, to ensure pollution is tackled. “We have to win the war against air pollution, no matter what happens,” said Liu. “There is no leeway for us and we will not retreat.” Reporting by Muyu Xu and David Stanway; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-pollution/update-1-china-vows-no-leeway-for-underperformers-in-war-on-pollution-idUKL3N1ZL1T1,21 Jan 2019,"* Tougher steel mill standards, new action against coal

2019-01-21,"* China Dec aluminium output at record 3.05 mln tonnes * Annual production hits record 35.8 mln tonnes * Alumina price drop eases pressure on smelters * China aluminium output to climb 5 pct in 2019 - analyst * Dec nonferrous output tops 5 mln tonnes for first time (Recasts, adds analyst quote, graphic) By Tom Daly BEIJING, Jan 21 (Reuters) - China’s primary aluminium output defied low prices to rise for a second straight month to a record high in December as falling alumina costs boosted margins, while 2018 annual output was also a record, official data showed on Monday. The world’s top producer churned out more than 3 million tonnes in a month for the first time, undeterred by aluminium prices at two-year lows, the impact of the U.S.-China trade war and Beijing’s environmental crackdown. Production was likely spurred by new smelter openings late last year and higher utilisation rates following a plunge in the cost of raw material alumina, said Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities. Output hit 3.05 million tonnes in December, National Bureau of Statistics data showed, up 8.2 percent from November and up 11.3 percent from December 2017. On a daily basis, China produced almost 98,400 tonnes of aluminium last month, up from 94,000 tonnes in November and also a record high, according to Reuters calculations. December had one more day than November. Full-year output came in at 35.8 million tonnes in 2018, up 7.4 percent from the previous annual record in 2017. China added 3.8 million tonnes of aluminium smelting capacity in 2018, according to consultancy AZ China, while about 2.8 million tonnes was shut due to a slump in aluminium prices. Winter restrictions on output to curb pollution were also less severe than expected. Shanghai aluminium prices slumped a hefty 14 percent over 2018 to below 14,000 yuan ($2,063) a tonne amid plentiful supply and worries over the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war on demand. “Even though at the current (aluminium) price you may say smelters are not making money, as long as they break even they will continue to produce,” said Lau, who expects another 5 percent increase in China’s output in 2019. “Those newly commissioned smelters have to start operating to pay back their loans. They have to generate enough cash flow to do that.” Alumina prices, which soared from March last year on an outage at Norsk Hydro’s Alunorte plant, fell almost 30 percent in the fourth quarter, easing the pressure on smelters. Meanwhile, output of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminium, lead, zinc and nickel - came in at a record 5.08 million tonnes in December, up 7.8 percent from November and up 10 percent year-on-year. Full-year output was up 6 percent at 56.88 million tonnes, also a record high. The other metals in the group are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.

Refiners processed 603.57 million tonnes of crude last year, or about 12.07 million barrels per day (bpd), up 6.8 percent from 2017, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. In December, crude runs rose 4.4 percent from the year before to 51.17 million tonnes, or 12.05 million bpd, hovering near a record of 52.78 million tonnes racked up in October. Top oil and gas group CNPC said on Monday that its crude processing volume rose 4.7 percent last year from 2017 to 207.3 million tonnes, or 4.15 million bpd. New refineries including Zhejiang Petrochemical and the Sinopec-Kuwait refining complex in Zhanjiang were expected to add 32 million tonnes of new refining capacity to the world’s largest energy consumer, according to the research unit of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC). China’s crude runs are likely to grow 4.7 percent in 2019 from last year to hit a record of 634 million tonnes, or 12.68 million bpd, according to a report from CNPC’s think tank on Wednesday. Crude oil output dropped in 2018 for a third straight year despite increasing capital spending from oil producers, the data showed. Annual crude production declined 1.3 percent to 189.11 million tonnes, or 3.78 million bpd. But in December, output recorded a rare year-on-year increase of 2 percent after companies stepped up drilling, with monthly output at 16.33 million tonnes, or 3.845 million bpd, the highest daily level since June last year. For most of the last three years, China’s monthly crude oil production has shown year-on-year declines amid the higher costs of operating mature fields and a lack of new discoveries. China’s CNOOC said on Friday that it aimed to double its domestic exploration work and proven oil and gas reserves in seven years. Meanwhile, December natural gas output surged to a record 15.3 billion cubic metres (bcm), up 10 percent from a year ago, exceeding a record of 14.27 bcm in November, the data showed. For all of 2018, gas output rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier to 161 bcm. tonne = 7.3 barrels for crude conversion

2019-01-21,"SINGAPORE, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Monday, weighed down by expectations that China will report its weakest economic growth in almost three decades amid waning domestic demand and painful U.S. tariffs. Still, analysts expect oil prices to be relatively well supported this year by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC allies, including Russia. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.30 per barrel at 0022 GMT, down 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 37 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $53.43 a barrel. U.S. bank J.P. Morgan said there were ongoing signs of economic uncertainty. “The global outlook remains murky, despite emerging positives from a dovish Fed (now boosting U.S. mortgage applications), faster China easing (China credit growth stabilizing) and a more durable U.S.-China truce,” it said. Despite this, analysts said supply cuts led by OPEC would likely provide crude oil prices with support. “Brent can remain above $60 per barrel on OPEC+ compliance, expiry of Iran waivers and slower U.S. output growth,” J.P. Morgan said. It recommended investors should “stay long” crude oil. Researchers at Bernstein Energy said the supply cuts led by OPEC “will move the market back into supply deficit” for most of 2019 and that “this should allow oil prices to rise to U.S. $70 per barrel before year-end from current levels of U.S.$60 per barrel.” In the United States, energy firms cut 21 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 18, taking the total count down to 852, the lowest since May 2018, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in a weekly report on Friday. It was biggest decline since February 2016, as drillers reacted to the 40 percent plunge in U.S. crude prices late last year. However, U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA still rose by more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, to a record 11.9 million bpd. With the rig count stalling, last year’s growth rate is unlikely to be repeated in 2019, although most analysts expect annual production to average well over 12 million bpd, making the United States the world’s biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.

2019-01-21,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Nikkei opens +0.7 pct, S&P futures flat with US on holiday * China GDP seen slowing to 6.4 pct in Q4 * Market awaits Plan B on Brexit from British PM May By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Asian markets were in limbo early on Monday ahead of data likely to show the Chinese economy slowed at the end of last year, underlining the urgent need for more stimulus as Beijing wrestles with the United States over trade. Investors are also waiting to hear British Prime Minister Theresa May’s ‘Plan B’ for Brexit which is due to be presented to parliament later on Monday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed in early trade, after rising 1.6 percent last week. E-Mini future for the S&P 500 were 0.1 percent lower, though trade was light with the U.S. on holiday. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.7 percent, helped by a recent pullback in the yen. China is expected to report that economic growth cooled to its slowest in 28 years in 2018 in the face of weakening domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the world’s second-largest economy to have grown 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis. That could pull 2018 gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 6.6 percent, the lowest since 1990 and down from a revised 6.8 percent in 2017. Chinese stocks had rallied on Friday on reports U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, a story later denied. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday there has been progress toward a trade deal with China, but denied that he was considering lifting tariffs. “Things are going very well with China and with trade,” he told reporters at the White House. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the next round of talks with Washington. Over in Britain, May will return to parliament on Monday to set out how she plans to try to break the Brexit deadlock after her deal was rejected by lawmakers last week. May told ministers on Sunday she was looking for ways to make the so-called Northern Irish backstop more acceptable to her Conservative Party and Northern Irish allies. “We expect only incremental changes from “Plan A” given cross-party talks have fallen flat,” analysts at TD Securities wrote in a note. “Amendments are likely to be introduced all week, with MPs pushing to cancel ‘No-Deal’, introduce a second referendum, and perhaps push for a permanent customs union,” they added. “May will likely travel to Brussels to seek concessions from the EU.” The uncertainty kept sterling sidelined at $1.2860, having briefly been as high as $1.3000 last week. The dollar held firm on the yen at 109.63, while the euro was near the floor of its recent trading range at $1.1365 . Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a shade firmer at 96.362. In commodity markets, spot gold was steady at $1,282.80 per ounce. Oil prices eased Monday after jumping about 3 percent on Friday as OPEC detailed specifics on its production-cut activity to ease global oversupply. Brent crude dipped 35 cents to $62.35 a barrel. U.S. crude futures fell 31 cents to $53.49 a barrel.
