2019-02-22,"(Reuters) - Asdrubal Chavez, chief executive of Houston-based Citgo Petroleum Corp, boarded the Venezuelan-owned firm’s corporate jet in Caracas on Jan. 30, after meeting with top officials of the embattled administration of socialist President Nicolas Maduro about the latest U.S. oil sanctions. Upon landing in the Bahamas - where Chavez has worked for about a year after being denied a U.S. visa - he had received word from Houston that it would be his last trip on a company plane and that his Citgo email account had been shut off. Day-to-day control of the company had passed to Citgo’s top U.S. executive, Rick Esser, who with the backing of Venezuela’s rising political opposition and the U.S. government would begin clearing the way for a new, anti-Maduro board of directors at Citgo. Esser oversaw the moves to isolate Chavez - a cousin of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez - and would soon start ousting other Citgo executives close to the Maduro administration. The house-cleaning at the prized U.S.-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil firm, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), marked a crucial early victory for the country’s rising opposition government - led by self-declared president Juan Guaido - as it struggles to remove Maduro from office and break his grip on the OPEC nation’s oil assets.  The account of the transition of power at Citgo is based on Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former Citgo and PDVSA executives, employees, and U.S. and Latin American advisors. Guaido, head of the Venezuelan congress, announced he would seize the presidency on Jan. 23 because Maduro’s re-election last year was a sham, rendering the socialist leader illegitimate under Venezuela law. Guaido’s claim to interim leadership, until fair elections can be held, was quickly backed by the United States and dozens of other nations. But Maduro remains in control of the military and PDVSA - making Citgo the obvious first target among national asset for Guaido’s opposition movement to claim, with the help of the U.S. government. The battle for Citgo could prove pivotal in the effort to unseat Maduro because full control of a major U.S. refiner would provide a crucial source of revenue to a post-Maduro administration. Citgo, with more than $23 billion in annual sales and operations that supply about 4 percent of U.S. fuels, may be the last remaining asset owned by PDVSA with a healthy balance sheet. As PDVSA’s oil production and revenue have plummeted amid crippling debt, mismanagement and international political pressure, Citgo’s U.S. location and financial independence have shielded the firm from the worst of its parent company’s meltdown. At the end of September, Citgo had net income of about $500 million, according to a creditor with access to financial statements that are not public. The company had almost $500 million in cash and an available credit line of $900 million. Inside Citgo’s Houston headquarters, many employees weary of operating under the control of a failing socialist state eagerly awaited an expected official announcement of the appointments of new company directors, who were chosen by Venezuela’s congress. “We are not expecting any resistance” to the new board inside the company, said one manager who spoke on condition of anonymity. “On the contrary, we are waiting for directions to lay out the red carpet.” The new board met together for the first time in Houston on Thursday and named executives to replace those who were ousted. Board directors and a new executive team was confirmed by Citgo in a statement on Friday. Esser assumed responsibility for day-to-day strategic decisions and operations while a search for a new CEO has begun, it said, without mentioning former CEO Chavez.  “These officers were chosen not only for their experience and knowledge, but also because of their demonstrated commitment to the company over the years,” said Chairwoman Luisa Palacios in the statement. PDVSA and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.  As U.S. sanctions on Jan. 28 shifted the balance of power to Citgo’s anti-Maduro faction of executives, Maduro loyalists scrambled to find their place in the emerging corporate structure. Two of four senior executives appointed by Chavez openly pledged support for the incoming board of directors in meetings with employees, said two sources who attended the meetings.  But all four - Frank Gygax, Nepmar Escalona, Simon Suarez and Eladio Perez - were escorted out of the building on Monday, according to four people with knowledge of their departures. Gygax declined to comment and the others did not respond to requests.  It is unclear whether Chavez has yet been formally terminated, an action that can only be taken by company directors, but he has been effectively shut out of the firm, Citgo employees said. Chavez did not respond to a request for comment. Esser has essentially run the company since Chavez’ ouster, in close consultation with U.S. government officials, according to three Citgo employees and two people close to the incoming company board.  A Jan. 30 meeting between White House National Security Advisor John Bolton and Citgo executives thrust the low-key Esser into the spotlight after Bolton tweeted a photo of the meeting, calling it “very productive.” U.S. officials have voiced concern that Guaido and his supporters had been too slow in seizing control of Citgo and also have pushed for a say in choosing members of the refiner’s new board - a request Guaido’s team declined, according to two people familiar with the talks. Since clearing Citgo’s upper ranks of Maduro allies, Esser has focused on securing alternatives to the Venezuelan oil that feeds its refineries. Recent U.S. sanctions prevent the firm from importing Venezuelan crude after April 28, which could cripple the company unless it can ensure it has the cash, credit and contracts for alternate supplies. Advisors to the incoming Citgo board have separately urged U.S. officials to exempt Citgo from sanctions and protect its assets from creditors once it is officially controlled by Guaido’s team.  Esser saw this crisis coming two years ago and put together a group to find new suppliers and test their oils in the event Venezuelan crudes were restricted by sanctions, according to a person familiar with the effort.  The firm’s efforts to sustain operations face a threat from creditors owed money by Venezuela and PDVSA, who could try to use that leverage to hamstring Citgo’s finances, said Carlos Jorda, a former Citgo chairman and now a Houston business consultant. The U.S. government could help the company hold off that threat, he said. “The U.S. Treasury could say, ‘Hold your horses, you’ll get paid - but not paid by Citgo, but by Venezuela - when the Maduro regime exits,’” Jorda said.  Esser and Citgo finance executive Curtis Rowe travelled to Washington this week to meet with U.S. government officials for at least the second time in three weeks, according to two Citgo employees.  Opposition leaders had difficulty recruiting candidates willing to join the new Citgo board, according to three people familiar with the recruitments.  “There are many risks,” one of the people said, “and if these people have family members in Venezuela, they could be putting them at risk, too.” In late 2017, six Citgo executives were called to Caracas and jailed amid a graft probe over a failed debt refinancing. Their detention led to Chavez’s appointment as CEO and the arrival of several Maduro loyalists at Citgo’s Houston headquarters.  New Citgo Chairwoman Palacios has been huddling with newly appointed directors and legal advisers to guard against the threat of a potential U.S. court challenge by PDVSA to the new board’s legitimacy, according to two sources close to her team. Palacios and other board members, which include former Citgo and PDVSA executives living in the United States, did not respond to requests for comment. One of their priorities will be to audit the finances of a refinery project in Aruba, said the two people close to Palacios. PDVSA and Citgo agreed to a $685 million overhaul of the idled facility in 2016, causing some Citgo executives to resign in protest, arguing the deal made no business sense. On Monday, Citgo Aruba Refining officially put the money-losing venture on hold and laid off workers, citing the impact of U.S. sanctions on PDVSA. The project has been clouded by corruption allegations, according to four former and current Citgo employees and two people close to the new Citgo board.  “There is also worry about the audits to come. We are expecting ‘frogs and snakes’ to come from there,” said a Citgo employee, using a Venezuelan figure of speech similar in meaning to the opening of a Pandora’s box. Since Esser took over Citgo operations, the company has sent clear signals of a return to its century-old American roots. “We the people of Citgo have a story to tell you” read an advertisement in Tuesday’s Washington Post, borrowing language from the U.S. constitution. The text emphasized the firm’s 6,000 U.S. workers, fiscal strength and U.S. charity work.   Workers at the company’s Houston headquarters also have purged the company website and marketing materials of references to PDVSA and stripped the building of the symbols of Venezuela’s socialist government. For years, the hallways have been decorated with renderings of a controversial painting of Latin American independence leader Simon Bolivar that had been commissioned by former president Hugo Chavez - and looked more like Chavez than any historical Bolivar painting. The portraits began to disappear, Citgo employees said, soon after Venezuela’s congress appointed the company’s new board of directors.

2019-02-22,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Weak returns at U.S. shale producers could cost more executives their jobs and lead to increasing battles with activist investors, analysts said following changes at two producers. After years of outspending cash flow to expand oil and natural gas production, executives are under pressure to pull back on spending and deliver higher returns. Investors have sold shares in companies that increased their drilling budgets, and some have avoided the sector altogether. Pioneer Natural Resources Co Chief Executive Tim Dove retired on Thursday after a two-year stint in the job, with founder and former CEO Scott Sheffield returning to the top role. Halcon Resources Corp CEO Floyd Wilson and two other executives - finance chief Mark Mize and Steve Herod, executive vice president of corporate development - resigned the same day. The company said it began the search for a new CEO. “It’s a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately scenario,” said Jason Wangler, analyst with Imperial Capital in Houston. “Not only are investors holding people accountable, they’re watching every move.” He expects management and board changes at other companies this year. Activist investor Fir Tree Partners this month called for Halcon to appoint independent board directors, cut costs and sell itself. Fir Tree in a statement on Friday called the management changes “important first steps.” On Friday, Kimmeridge Energy Management Co announced an activist stake in PDC Energy Inc and urged the producer to cut expenses and pay a dividend. PDC in response said it was focused on capital discipline. Such battles are likely to “be pretty steady in 2019,” said Leo Mariani, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. “The common complaint from activist investors is that a lot of these companies have relatively poor returns on capital and outspend cash flow.” While producers have pledged to pare spending, investors want proof. “There’s a difference between saying and actually doing,” said Morningstar Inc analyst Dave Meats. Pioneer, one of the largest U.S. shale producers, last week released financial results that fell short of Wall Street expectations due to hedging-related costs. Halcon was hard hit by the 2014 oil price drop and emerged from bankruptcy restructuring in 2016. The stock market values its land at less than $5,000 an acre, compared with peers whose land is valued above $20,000 an acre, Fir Tree said in a Feb. 4 letter.  Analysts expect the firm to report a loss of 8 cents per share when it releases quarterly results on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data. “They laid out a pretty aggressive growth strategy,” Wangler said. “The market obviously has not been conducive to those types of stories, outspending cash to try to grow production.” Reporting by Jennifer Hiller; Editing by Chris Reese",https://uk.reuters.com/article/shale-results-executives/investor-demands-could-push-out-more-u-s-shale-oil-executives-idUKL1N20H1D5,22 Feb 2019,"Weak returns at U.S. shale

2019-02-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose in major markets across the world on Friday on bets of progress in trade talks between China and the United States, while crude futures hit their highest level in more than three months supported by ongoing supply cuts. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that there was a very good chance the United States would strike a deal with China to end their trade war and that he was inclined to extend his March 1 deadline to reach an agreement. U.S. and Chinese negotiators meeting in Washington had made progress and would extend this week’s round of negotiations by two days, he said. Main stock indexes on Wall Street rose as the optimistic trade talk more than offset signs of slower growth in both U.S.  earnings and the economy, with the S&P 500 posting a fourth consecutive week of gains.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 181.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to 26,031.81, the S&P 500 gained 17.79 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,792.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 67.84 points, or 0.91 percent, to 7,527.55. The Dow rose for the ninth consecutive week. Overnight, shares in Asia were buoyed by a late rally in Chinese shares, with the main blue-chip index rising more than 2 percent to a near seven-month high. Emerging market stocks rose 0.73 percent after touching the highest level since August. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.7 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.18 percent. Trade talks and a growing number of policy U-turns by global central banks have propped up equities in recent weeks, although     this week saw the first outflows from emerging market debt and equity funds since October 2018, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said, citing EPFR data. Oil prices touched their highest level in more than three months, supported by OPEC supply cuts as well as the trade developments. New record U.S. oil supply, however, limited gains in post-settle trade. U.S. crude rose 0.37 percent to $57.17 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.00, down 0.1 percent on the day. In currencies, the U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of peers. The dollar index fell 0.05 percent, with the euro down 0.03 percent to $1.1331. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 110.68 per dollar. Sterling was last trading at $1.3053, up 0.03 percent on the day. The Australian dollar recovered a day after falling more than 1 percent after Reuters reported the Chinese port of Dalian had barred imports of Australian coal indefinitely. China said on Friday that imports would continue, but customs has stepped up checks on foreign cargoes. Separate comments by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe that a rate increase may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. The Aussie dollar recently gained 0.56 percent versus the greenback at 0.7128. Despite gains on risky assets, safe-haven U.S. Treasuries also gained in price. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.6536 percent, from 2.688 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond last rose 18/32 in price to yield 3.0159 percent, from 3.045 percent late on Thursday. Spot gold added 0.4 percent to $1,328.20 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.21 percent to $1,330.60 an ounce. Copper rose 1.52 percent to $6,477.00 a tonne.

2019-02-22,"(Corrects spelling of Citgo CEO’s first name to Asdrubal in first paragraph) By Marianna Parraga Feb 22 (Reuters) - Asdrubal Chavez, chief executive of Houston-based Citgo Petroleum Corp, boarded the Venezuelan-owned firm’s corporate jet in Caracas on Jan. 30, after meeting with top officials of the embattled administration of socialist President Nicolas Maduro about the latest U.S. oil sanctions.

Brent crude futures briefly reached $67.73 a barrel, their 2019 high. The global benchmark fell 5 cents to settle at $67.12 a barrel. Brent gained 1.2 percent on the week.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 30 cents to settle at $57.26 per barrel, after hitting $57.81 earlier on Friday, also their highest for the year. WTI recorded a 3-percent weekly rise and reached its strongest settlement price of 2019. Top U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators met on Friday to wrap up a week of talks that have seen the two sides struggle to reach a deal by a March 1 deadline. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the Oval Office later on Friday. “Oil prices, as well as the stock market have been rising on the anticipation that China and the U.S. would agree to a trade deal,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. “In addition, we’re seeing a tightening of oil supplies around the world resulting from OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts.” Both oil benchmarks have risen this year after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, began to cut output to prevent a supply glut from growing.   Surging U.S. crude oil production, is partly offsetting OPEC’s cuts. U.S. crude production last week climbed to a record 12 million barrels per day as stockpiles built for a fifth straight week to their highest since October 2017 and exports hit an all-time high, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. [EIA/S] “We see total U.S. crude production hitting 13 million bpd by year-end, with 2019 averaging 12.5 million bpd,” U.S. bank Citi said following the release of the EIA report. However, U.S. energy firms cut four oil rigs operating this week after three weeks of adding rigs, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its report on Friday. [RIG/U]  Meanwhile, crude inventories in West Texas fell to the lowest in four months after an additional pipeline started transporting crude from the largest U.S. shale field to the Gulf Coast, largely for exports, data from market intelligence provider Genscape showed.  With U.S. supply surging, Goldman Sachs said it expected non-OPEC supply to grow by 1.9 million bpd this year, more than offsetting the OPEC cuts. That means much will depend on demand, which Goldman said it expected to grow by 1.4 million bpd in 2019. Goldman said it expected an average Brent price of $60-$65 per barrel in 2019 and 2020.

2019-02-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday it has agreed to conduct a long-delayed study to assess the impact that burning ethanol as a motor vehicle fuel has on air quality.  The Sierra Club had filed a lawsuit against the EPA late last year in an effort to compel the agency to conduct the study, which the group said was supposed to be done roughly eight years ago. The two parties reached a partial agreement and the EPA said it will conduct the so-called anti-backsliding study by March of 2020. The outcome of the study could trigger new EPA action on the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the law requiring the use of biofuels in the nation’s gasoline and diesel, if it finds that burning ethanol makes the air dirtier. The RFS, first established in 2005, has been a financial boon for farmers, but environmental groups like Sierra Club say it creates an incentive to convert land for farming and helps maintain a dependence on combustible engines.

2019-02-22,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada’s National Energy Board (NEB) regulator recommended on Friday that Ottawa approve expansion of the government-owned Trans Mountain oil pipeline, but made new, nonbinding recommendations to mitigate harm to Pacific Ocean killer whales. The pipeline is in the national interest as it will create jobs and allow Canadian oil to reach more markets, the NEB said in a report.  But expanding it is likely to significantly harm the killer whale population off the coast of British Columbia and increase greenhouse gas emissions from ships, the board said in its report. A “worst-case” spill, while unlikely, would also be damaging, it said.  The NEB made 16 new recommendations, ranging from offsetting increased underwater noise to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The recommendations constitute nonbinding advice to the government. Ottawa in September directed the board to conduct a new review of its application to nearly triple the capacity of Trans Mountain, which the government bought for C$4.5 billion ($3.43 billion) last year from Kinder Morgan Canada to ensure it gets built. The move came after Canada’s Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Liberal government’s 2016 approval to expand the pipeline, which runs from Alberta to the British Columbia coast. The court ruled that the NEB failed to consider marine impacts and that the government did not adequately consult indigenous groups. The NEB’s ruling is a political win, albeit with mixed implications, for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, ahead of a fall election. He faces both anger from Western Canadians over the oil industry’s struggles and pressure from environmentally minded voters who do not want pipelines built. Canada’s oil production has expanded faster than pipeline capacity, causing a glut last year that depressed prices.  The NEB’s reaffirmation that the project is of national interest was essential, said Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Pending government legislation will make regulatory approval of future pipelines more difficult, making it more important that the ones already in the queue get built, he said.   Given recurring delays, companies that drill wells remain doubtful Trans Mountain will be expanded, said Mark Scholz, chief executive of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, calling Canada the “black hole of approvals.” The NEB’s 689-page report now goes to Trudeau and his Cabinet, which by law has 90 days to respond. Consultation with indigenous groups is well under way and the government is in a “strong position” to decide within that time frame, but has made no decision, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said in an interview. Sohi said the NEB’s recommendations “broadly align” with his government’s values, but that it needs more time to study them. The Southern Resident killer whale population is already endangered, and even the pipeline’s “relatively minor” impacts would cause additional harm, including from potential strikes by ships, the board’s chief environment officer, Robert Steedman, said.  The board’s decision is unsurprising, given that the NEB limited its review to 12 nautical miles of the whales’ habitat, and refused to consider the impact on salmon-spawning areas, said Eugene Kung, lawyer at West Coast Environmental Law.   “The fix was in from the start,” he said. “This project amounts to a death sentence for the South Resident orcas.” The NEB failed to produce evidence that the pipeline’s expansion will benefit the economy, said Elizabeth May, leader of Canada’s Green Party. The board also imposed 156 binding conditions, including issues of emergency preparedness and consultation with indigenous communities.

2019-02-22,"OSLO (Reuters) - Finland’s nuclear regulator has identified a safety issue at Olkiluoto 3, a 1.6-gigawatt reactor built by France’s Areva, now renamed Orano, and the problem needs to be fixed before the unit can receive a permit to operate, the regulator told Reuters. The reactor is due to start producing electricity in January next year after a decade-long delay. Part of the pressuriser, a primary circuit component of the reactor, is vibrating at levels that exceed safety limits, said Pekka Valikangas, the regulator’s section head for nuclear reactor regulation, ahead of an important assessment which is due to be published on Monday. “The test results show that these vibrations are not approved,” Valikangas said in an interview. The safety assessment by STUK, Finland’s radiation and nuclear safety authority, is a key report that will influence the government’s decision on whether to grant Olkiluoto 3 an operation permit. “This must be taken care of before the ministry decides on the permit,” Valikangas said, adding that the regulator would offer two options for a solution. The reactor’s owner, Finnish consortium TVO, and supplier Orano would need to choose from those options. STUK is also expected to publish on Monday its recommendation to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, which decides energy policy and will rule on the reactor’s permit. Valikangas said he could not tell whether the development would lead to further delays, adding it was up to Areva and TVO to fix the problem on time. “I do not know if it will delay the reactor. There is still time in the testing programme to fix it,” he said. The part of the pressuriser that needs fixing is the pipeline, which is related to the reactor’s cooling system and was supplied by Areva, Valikangas said. This component is responsible for balancing pressure in the reactor. He did not elaborate on the two solutions STUK had identified and said further details would be made public on Monday. There was no suggestion that the problem identified at Olkiluoto 3 would affect other reactors. The facility in western Finland, already more than a decade behind schedule, has sustained several delays. The latest, announced last November, entitled the Finnish operator to a payment of 18 million euros (£15.6 million) from Areva. Before that, in March, Areva settled a long-running dispute with TVO by agreeing to pay 450 million euros for cost overruns and delays. It also agreed to pay a further 20 million euros for each additional month of delays from Jan. 1, 2020. The reactor previously experienced vibration issues which delayed hot testing in the first half of 2018. TVO said then that they would be fixed within few months but STUK said the problem remains ahead of the permit decision. TVO said it had identified the problem and been working with Areva on a fix, which it expected to have in place during spring. “We have been testing different options. We have a solution for that. There are two support system options and we have picked the right one ... We need to show STUK that it works,” a TVO spokesman said. He could not say whether that would secure the permit TVO needs, adding that Olkiluoto 3 could not start loading fuel before receiving that approval. Orano was not immediately available for comment. Finland needs the reactor as it imports more than 25 percent of its electricity from neighbouring Sweden and Russia, while its energy needs are growing. TVO’s owners include utility company Pohjolan Voima, its rival and Nordic electricity major Fortum, EPV Energia, Loiste Holding and Kemira.

2019-02-22,"(Adds rig count in Permian basin in paragraph 9) Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil rigs operating for the first time in three weeks week after U.S. crude production hit an all-time high, boosting exports to a record high and stockpiles to their highest in over a year. Drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to Feb. 22, bringing the total count down to 853, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the rig count fell by nine. That was the first time drillers removed rigs for three months in a row since October 2017. The rig count declined by two in December and 23 in January. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still higher than a year ago when 799 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise 84,000 barrels per day (bpd) in March to a record of about 8.4 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Tuesday. A shale revolution has helped boost the United States to the position of world’s biggest crude oil producer, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Overall crude production has climbed to a weekly record of 12 million bpd, the EIA said in its latest report, mainly due to increases in the Permian, the biggest U.S. oilpatch in the United States, and the Bakken in North Dakota. Crude stockpiles have built for a fifth straight week to their highest since October 2017 and exports hit an all-time high. In 2019, however, several drillers have said they plan to remove rigs due in part to forecasts for lower crude prices than last year. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian where active units were unchanged after falling last week to 473, the lowest since June. U.S. crude futures were trading around $57.40 per barrel on Friday, after hitting their highest since mid-November. Prices were  heading for a more than 3-percent weekly rise. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $59 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and around $58 a barrel for the calendar 2020. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said this week that early indications from the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks point to a 6 percent decline in capital expenditures for drilling and completions in 2019. In total, Cowen said those E&P companies spent about $93.4 billion in 2018. There were 1,047 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes.

2019-02-22,"ABUJA/MAIDUGURI (Reuters) - President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday urged Nigerians “to go out and vote”, promising there would be adequate security for Saturday’s postponed election that pits him in a tight race with businessman Atiku Abubakar. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced a week’s delay to voting in the early hours of last Saturday, just as some of Nigeria’s 72.8 million eligible voters were preparing to go to polling stations. In a televised morning address on the eve of the vote, Buhari asked Nigerians to “cast aside doubt and have faith that INEC will rise to the occasion” on Saturday. “Do not be afraid of rumours of violence and unrest. Our security agencies have worked diligently to ensure that adequate security measures are in place,” he said. Buhari’s rival Atiku, a former vice president who is representing the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), made a similar appeal to voters through his Twitter feed on Thursday night. “This Saturday, a vote for PDP is a vote to get Nigeria working again. Come out, vote and #DefendYourVote,” Atiku said in a tweet accompanied by a video of his rallies. Buhari, a former military ruler who was later elected president in 2015, faces a close contest against Atiku to lead a country that has Africa’s largest economy and is its top oil producer, but is plagued by corruption and insecurity. The Boko Haram militant insurgent group and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, have carried out deadly sporadic raids in the northeast’s Borno state. Boko Haram has warned people not to vote. Suspected Islamist militants attacked Geidam town in northeastern Yobe state on Saturday forcing people to flee, residents said around two hours before polls were due to open.  “We have along with our wives and children and hundreds of others fled. We are right now running and hiding in the bushes,” said resident Ibrahim Gobi, speaking by phone.  Around the same time a Reuters witness said blasts were heard in Maiduguri, the state capital of neighbouring Borno state. He also said he heard gun shots and Nigerian air force jets were flying overhead. Witnesses and security officials told Reuters an attack in Borno on a governor’s convoy en route to an election rally on Feb. 12 was deadlier than the government had said. More than 1,000 soldiers from neighbouring Chad, belonging to a multinational joint force comprised of troops from the region, crossed the border into Nigeria on Friday to help with the fight against Islamists, according to two Chadian military sources. Police patrol vehicles were seen moving around Maiduguri on Friday. Electoral commission vehicles were also seen ferrying election material under heavy police guard. “I think everybody has to be concerned about the security...it is something that worries people,” James Jatto, a pastor in Maiduguri said. Ali Gwarfa, an internally displaced person in Bakassi camp in Maiduguri, said he was preparing to cast his vote in a nearby centre despite the insecurity.  “We must go and vote for the candidates of our choice,” Gwarfa said. Acting Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu said police would ensure security at the polls. In President Buhari’s hometown of Daura in northern Nigeria, an election official, Saeed Ahmed, said electoral materials were being transferred to polling stations.  In Lagos, Cheta Nwanze, head of research at SBM Intel, a Lagos based intelligence firm, said the postponement of the election would favour the opposition. “I think it is important to say that, it cast the APC ruling party in bad light and it builds popular anger towards them,” Nwanze said, referring to Buhari’s All Progressives Congress (APC) party.  However, Bukola Saraki, director general of Atiku’s campaign, told Reuters the delay “disadvantages us”. Members of Buhari’s APC party and those of Atiku’s PDP have accused each other of being behind the delay and colluding with the electoral commission, but neither party has publicly provided evidence to back up their allegations. The electoral commission’s chairman Mahmood Yakubu has insisted the vote will go ahead on Saturday. He blamed logistical reasons for the postponement, and said there had been no external pressure.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He were set to meet at the Oval Office later in the day in a sign negotiations are advancing. Main indexes on Wall Street rose as trade talk more than offset signs of slower growth in both earnings and the U.S. economy, with the S&P 500 on track for a fourth consecutive week of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 177.54 points, or 0.69 percent, to 26,028.17, the S&P 500 gained 16.62 points, or 0.60 percent, to 2,791.5 and the Nasdaq Composite added 61.04 points, or 0.82 percent, to 7,520.75. Shares in Asia were buoyed by a late rally in Chinese stocks, with the main blue-chip index of Chinese shares rising over 2 percent to a near seven-month high. Emerging market stocks were up 0.73 percent after touching the highest level since August. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.72 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.18 percent. Trade talks and a growing number of policy U-turns by global central banks have propped up equities in recent weeks, although this week brought the first outflows from emerging market debt and equity funds since October 2018, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said, citing EPFR data. Oil prices rose, supported by OPEC’s ongoing supply cuts and hopes that Washington and Beijing may soon end their trade dispute. U.S. crude rose 0.63 percent to $57.32 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.11, up 0.06 percent on the day. In currencies, the U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of peers. The dollar index fell 0.11 percent, with the euro up 0.09 percent to $1.1344. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01 percent versus the greenback at 110.71 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3061, up 0.09 percent on the day. The Australian dollar recovered a day after falling more than 1 percent after Reuters reported the Chinese port of Dalian had barred imports of Australian coal indefinitely. China said on Friday, however, that imports would continue, but customs has stepped up checks on foreign cargoes. Separate comments by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe that a rate increase may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. The Aussie dollar was up 0.71 percent versus the greenback at 0.7139. Despite gains on risky assets, safe-haven U.S. Treasuries also rose in price. Benchmark 10-year notes were up 10/32 in price to yield 2.6536 percent, from 2.688 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond last rose 22/32 in price to yield 3.0095 percent, from 3.045 percent late on Thursday. Spot gold added 0.6 percent to $1,330.45 an ounce.

Anadarko said in a statement on Friday it was actively monitoring the situation and in close contact with government authorities. The U.S. energy firm said it would not comment further on the attacks until it had a “full picture” of the events. The company is working to build a 17,000-acre liquefaction complex in the country’s remote north to chill gas pumped from the Golfinho/Atum fields in its Area 1 deepwater block, 16.5 km (10 miles) offshore. The block holds one of the world’s biggest recent gas discoveries, estimated at 75 trillion cubic feet. Anadarko has finalized five deals with long-term buyers of LNG from the project and said it was nearing a final investment decision (FID) to build a giant LNG terminal. An FID is the trigger for construction of massive infrastructure projects to begin after financing has been completed. In June the company had said it was closely monitoring the security situation in northern Mozambique after a spate of beheadings and attacks by suspected Islamist militants. Any sign of militant activity is a concern for the country’s fledgling gas industry. The first attack on Thursday was on a road from Mocimboa da Praia to Afungi in northern Mozambique, approximately 20 km (12.4 miles) from the construction site and involved a convoy in which six workers sustained non-life threatening injuries, the company said. The second attack resulted in the death of the unidentified worker, who was contracted to a firm that is engaged in building an airstrip for the project, Anadarko said. The injured workers have been treated or were getting treatment. The company said all personnel were accounted for. Anadarko shares were down 1 percent to $43.40 in morning trade.

The International Atomic Energy Agency is policing the deal, which lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on Tehran’s atomic activities aimed at increasing the time Iran would need to make an atom bomb if it chose to. Iran has stayed within caps on the level to which it can enrich uranium, as well as its stock of enriched uranium, the IAEA said in a confidential quarterly report sent to its member states and obtained by Reuters. “Not much has changed..., a continuing reporting of the implementation (by Iran),” a senior diplomat said on condition of anonymity, summarising the report. The IAEA also repeated its usual statement that it carried out so-called complementary access inspections - which are often at short notice - at all locations in Iran that it needed to visit.  President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal last May, reimposing U.S. sanctions on Iran’s economy and lifeblood oil industry that were lifted under the 2015 agreement. European powers that signed the deal - France, Britain and Germany - have sought to cushion the blow to Iran of those sanctions. They are setting up a new channel for non-dollar trade with Iran but diplomats say it will not be able to handle the big transactions Iran says it needs to keep the deal afloat.  Setting up that channel, however, has angered Washington for undermining its effort to choke Iran’s economy in response to Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and its influence on the wars in Syria and Yemen. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence last week called on those European powers to follow Washington in pulling out of the agreement despite their long-held position that the deal is worth keeping as long as Iran sticks to it. The Islamic Republic has long said that it wants nuclear power only for purposes of civilian energy. Iran’s stock of heavy water, a substance used as a moderator in some nuclear reactors, stayed within the limit set by the deal and Tehran continued to ship some of it out of the country, with 1 tonne having been exported during the quarter. The senior official said it was sold to an unspecified IAEA member state.

2019-02-22,"LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) dropped to new lows this week as sporadic spot demand failed to change the overall trend of oversupply in the market. Spot prices for April delivery to northeast Asia LNG-AS are estimated at around $6.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 10 cents from the previous week. BP sold a cargo to Gunvor at this price on Thursday for mid-April delivery to Asia in the Platts open window. Japanese utility Tohoku Electric bought a cargo in the market for April delivery at a similar price, a trade source said. There were several enquiries for deliveries to China between late April and early May after traders returned from the Lunar New Year holidays, but overall LNG demand across north Asia remained exceptionally weak, sources in Singapore said. The current price is at the lowest level since September 2017, but it is unlikely to have reached its bottom yet. “I think (when the price falls to) between $5-6/mmBtu, we should start to see some demand creation in Asia,” a trader in Europe said, adding that it would start rebalancing the flow of cargoes between the Atlantic and Pacific basins. There were some offers in Europe from sellers looking to divert their cargoes from Asia to Europe, another trader said. South Korea’s KOGAS is also diverting cargoes from its U.S. offtake to Europe this winter, with the latest cargo to reach Britain’s Isle of Grain terminal on Feb. 28. Gas prices in Europe fell this week too, contributing to the weakness in the global LNG market. A stronger oil market may support gas prices somewhat but weak demand and ample supply are expected to keep them generally low. Cargoes in Europe traded this week at around 95 percent to Britain’s gas price benchmark for delivery into Britain, around 96-97 percent to the Dutch gas benchmark for delivery to the Netherlands, a 30 cent discount to the Dutch price for delivery to Spain and a 20 cent discount to the Dutch price for delivery to Italy, a trader said. A number of outages that have taken place so far this year contributed to at least 15 missed cargoes, but oversupply is much higher than that. Train 2 at Nigeria’s Bonny plant was off this week, after going offline last week, sources in Europe said. Train 1 which was also offline last week is back online, they added. In the United States, production recovered after an outage last week at one of the trains at Sabine Pass, a U.S. trade source said. “The train didn’t fall to zero, as evidenced by still a lot of gas trading out there,” the source said, adding that current production levels were around 5.2 billion cubic feet per day. U.S. producer Cheniere, which operates Sabine Pass, declined to comment. Cheniere, however, could make a transhipment of a Yamal LNG cargo in Europe, which would signify that the company may need to substitute volumes lost in maintenance and loading halts in the United States earlier this month. The Cool Explorer which is empty and is heading to the Gate terminal in the Netherlands is chartered by Cheniere, shipping sources said. New supply options this week came from Russia’s Sakhalin 2 plant and Angola LNG. India’s Gail offered a new swap of its U.S. offtake. On the demand side, Argentina’s Integracion Energetica Argentina (IEASA), Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) and Mexico’s CFE issued buy tenders.

2019-02-22,"HOUSTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Crude inventories in West Texas dropped this week to the lowest in four months after a converted pipeline began transporting crude from the nation’s biggest shale oil field to the U.S. Gulf Coast, data from market intelligence provider Genscape showed. The drop in storage in the Permian Basin is another sign that new pipelines out of the region have begun to alleviate a crude bottleneck that depressed local crude prices as production overwhelmed pipeline capacity and filled storage tanks. Crude inventories in the Permian Basin fell to 15 million barrels in the week to Feb. 19, the lowest since October and down from a record 22 million barrels in November. That glut had doubled in size from 11 million barrels in June, according to the Genscape data. The decline began in mid-November after Plains All American Pipeline LP expanded the capacity of its about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) Sunrise Pipeline. The drawdown accelerated this month when Enterprise Products Partners LP began shipping crude on a converted natural gas liquids pipeline, the 200,000 bpd Seminole-Red line, two months ahead of schedule. West Texas Intermediate crude at Midland WTC-WTM traded at a $1.30 per barrel premium to U.S. crude futures on Thursday, its strongest since January 2018. Midland crude in late August had sold at a $18.25 discount to the U.S. benchmark. Permian area storage levels could rise again in mid-2019, weakening Midland prices, before other pipeline projects begin, analysts said. Permian Basin output is expected to hit 4 million bpd in March, a year-on-year surge of over 1 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected this week. “The next outbound pipeline capacity expansions are not expected until the third quarter of 2019, potentially leading to further constraints and storage builds,” said Dylan White, an analyst at Genscape. Three major pipelines transporting more than 2 million bpd from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast are scheduled to open over the next 18 months. They include the 900,000 bpd EPIC pipeline, the 670,000 bpd Cactus II pipeline and the 800,000 bpd Grey Oak pipeline. U.S. producers, responding to lower crude prices and pipeline constraints, have idled 20 oil drilling rigs in the Permian since December, bringing the region’s oil rig count to 473, the lowest since June, according to General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm.

2019-02-22,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Microsoft Corp have agreed to use cloud technology in the U.S. oil producer’s shale operations, they said on Friday, helping to boost profitability in the nation’s largest shale field. The companies will collect data from Exxon’s wells and other production assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company holds 1.6 million acres, and make it immediately accessible to Exxon workers.  The value of the agreement was not disclosed. But the partnership is the industry’s largest in cloud computing, Exxon said in a statement. The technology would allow equipment leaks to be immediately detected to reduce repair times in remote locations, and apply artificial intelligence to analyse drilling and completions data, Exxon said.  Exxon has pledged to increase its Permian Basin production to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2025. The company’s fourth-quarter Permian production was 190,000 barrels of oil and gas per day. The Permian, which produces about 3.85 million bpd, is forecast to generate 5.4 million bpd by 2023, greater than any single member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries other than Saudi Arabia, according to consultancy IHS Markit. In January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Exxon announced an agreement with International Business Machines Corp to explore the potential for quantum computing in energy and manufacturing.

2019-02-22,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s government presented a draft proposal on how to drastically reduce carbon emissions on Friday, less than two weeks before parliament is due to be dissolved ahead of a general election that may nix its chances of becoming law. The package aims to make Spain carbon neutral by 2050, through measures including phasing out coal and nuclear power generation in favor of renewable and making sure all new cars are emission-free by 2040.  The ruling Socialists have emphasized their green ambitions since taking power last summer, promising support for renewable energy generation and passing measures aimed at cooling Europe’s fourth-highest electricity prices. But the long-promised draft has reached parliament two months before an April 28 snap election that Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was forced to call after a spat with his regional separatist partners. Presenting the package, Energy Minister Teresa Ribera said it was worthwhile to forge ahead. “This is not pie in the sky,” she told a news conference. “There is no reason for us to delay this debate. I am convinced that whoever (is in government), this will be approved and broadly supported by all Spaniards and political forces.”  A shift away from fossil fuels necessitates deep change and hefty investment across Europe to meet national and regional objectives for renewable generation while guaranteeing the lights stay on.             Sanchez has said implementing the carbon-reduction plans would require 200 billion euros ($227 billion) of total investment in the next decade, 47 billion euros of which he said would come from the public sector.  By favoring cheaper, renewable generation, the package would reduce Spaniards’ steep electricity bills, before taxes, by 12 percent by 2030, the energy ministry calculated.  An energy ministry source said the government expects investment in renewable generation projects, which are set for a record year in 2019, will not need much public money, but works to increase the energy efficiency of the housing stock would. NATURAL PHASE-OUT The package includes the draft law, a national climate proposal all European countries have to send to Brussels, and a strategy for offsetting job losses in polluting industries. The government submitted the national plan on Friday to European authorities who will start assessing it. The plan foresees the weight of coal - which fired 13.5 percent of mainland Spain’s electricity last year - dwindling although perhaps not entirely disappearing from the energy mix by 2030, the draft document showed. “We do not expect to force closures, we believe that the companies will naturally stop their coal businesses,” the ministry source said, adding the plan envisaged incentives to close coal plants. Meanwhile, nuclear plants, which provided just over 20 percent of Spain’s electricity in 2018, would close gradually in order of age between 2025 and 2035, the source added.       Ribera said the obligation for cars to be emission-free did not imply a prohibition of any type of vehicle, but she did not explain how such a result would be possible without a ban. A previous draft of the law which said new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars would not be allowed in Spain from 2040 caused some consternation in the industry.

2019-02-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. government pumped up the economy in 2018 by taxing less, spending more, especially on defence, and boosting borrowing, but it probably cannot repeat the same stimulus in 2019/2020. As the fiscal stimulus from last year fades, economic growth is set to slow, especially in the manufacturing sector, which has been a major beneficiary from higher defence spending. The federal government’s receipts from taxes, social security contributions, customs duties and other items fell by 0.4 percent in 2018, as reduced tax rates more than offset the impact of an expanding economy. Federal revenues have recently been growing at some of the slowest rates outside recession periods in the last four decades (“Monthly Treasury Statement”, U.S. Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Feb. 13). At the same time, government spending has continued rising at a rate close to its long-term average, with federal outlays increasing by more than 4.4 percent last year compared with 2017. The result has been a massive fiscal stimulus in an economy already well advanced in the business cycle with unemployment at multi-decade lows and limited spare capacity. Much of the extra spending has been directed towards the Department of Defense, where outlays jumped by almost 5.6 percent in the fiscal year to September 2018. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2BNmTQV) Within the military budget, a big part of the extra spending has gone on equipment, with procurement surging by 8.2 percent in fiscal 2018, up from a 1.4 percent increase in fiscal 2017 and 1.3 percent in fiscal 2016. Much of the extra spending has been directed towards long-lived hardware rather than non-durable items, giving a massive boost to the defence industrial base. U.S. manufacturers reported that new orders for defence capital goods grew at an annual rate over 20 percent in 2018, separate data published by the U.S. Census Bureau showed. New orders for defence capital goods rose four times faster (23.7 percent) than new orders for non-defence capital goods (6.0 percent) last year, according to the Census Bureau. The question is whether this rate of fiscal expansion is sustainable, and, if not, what will happen when the military spending boom slows. The government recorded a deficit of $779 billion in fiscal 2018 (3.8 percent of GDP), according to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (“Budget and economic outlook”, CBO, January 2019). On current policies, the deficit is already projected to increase to $897 billion in fiscal 2019 (4.2 percent) and $1.1 trillion by fiscal 2022 (4.7 percent). The scope for boosting the economy further by cutting taxes or increasing spending may therefore be more limited in future. Higher government spending and lower tax payments made a major contribution to the rise in U.S. manufacturing activity last year, but the boost may not be repeatable in 2019 and 2020.

2019-02-22,"(Adds quotes by regulator, TVO, background on reactor) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Finland’s nuclear regulator has identified a safety issue at Olkiluoto 3, a 1.6-gigawatt reactor built by France’s Orano, and the problem needs to be fixed before the unit can receive a permit to operate, the regulator told Reuters. The reactor is due to start producing electricity in January next year after a decade-long delay. Part of the pressuriser, a primary circuit component of the reactor, is vibrating at levels that exceed safety limits, said Pekka Valikangas, the regulator’s section head for nuclear reactor regulation. “The test results show that these vibrations are not approved,” Valikangas said in an interview. The safety assessment by STUK, Finland’s radiation and nuclear safety authority, is a key report that will influence the government’s decision on whether to grant Olkiluoto 3 an operation permit. “This must be taken care of before the ministry decides on the permit,” Valikangas said, adding that the regulator would offer two options for a solution. The reactor’s owner, Finnish consortium TVO, and supplier Orano, previously known as Areva, would need to choose from those options. STUK will present the details of its assessment on Monday, when it is also expected to publish its recommendation to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, which decides energy policy and will rule on the reactor’s permit. Valikangas said he could not tell whether the development would lead to further delays, adding it was up to Areva and TVO to fix the problem on time. “I do not know if it will delay the reactor. There is still time in the testing programme to fix it,” he said. The part of the pressuriser that needs fixing is the pipeline, which is related to the reactor’s cooling system and was supplied by Areva, Valikangas said. He did not elaborate on the two solutions STUK had identified and said further details would be made public on Monday. There was no suggestion that the problem identified at Olkiluoto 3 would affect other reactors. The facility in western Finland, already more than a decade behind schedule, has sustained several delays. The latest, announced last November, entitled the Finnish operator to a payment of 18 million euros ($20.4 million) from Areva. Before that, in March, Areva settled a long-running dispute with TVO by agreeing to pay 450 million euros for cost overruns and delays. It also agreed to pay a further 20 million euros for each additional month of delays from Jan. 1, 2020. TVO said it had identified the problem and been working with Orano on a fix, which it expected to have in place during spring. “We have been testing different options. We have a solution for that. There are two support system options and we have picked the right one ... We need to show STUK that it works,” a TVO spokesman said. He could not say whether that would secure the permit TVO needs, and added that Olkiluoto 3 could not start loading fuel before receiving that approval. Orano was not immediately available for comment. Finland needs the reactor as it imports more than 25 percent of its electricity from neighbouring Sweden and Russia, while its energy needs are growing. TVO’s owners include utility company Pohjolan Voima, its rival and Nordic electricity major Fortum, EPV Energia, Loiste Holding and Kemira. $1 = 0.8823 euros

2019-02-22,"* Water needed to pressurise Kenya’s first oil wells * Plan has been to reach water deal in Q2 * First indication of Kenya crude pricing expected next week (Adds detail) By Shadia Nasralla NAIROBI, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A deal with local Kenyan authorities that would allow Tullow Oil to pump water to pressurise oil wells, crucial for a final green light for the country’s only oil project, may be slightly delayed to the third quarter, a Tullow executive said on Friday. Tullow, with partners Total and Africa Oil , is working towards a final investment decision (FID) by year-end and said last week it had hoped to conclude the deal on water supply with the authorities in the second quarter. “I would probably realistically put it more for Q3 in terms of landing that agreement,” Tullow’s Kenya Managing Director Martin Mbogo told Reuters, referring to the deal organising the way Tullow can tap a body of water straddling two counties in northwestern Kenya. “(It’s) one of those things we absolutely need before we can get to FID.” Tullow estimates that Kenya’s onshore fields in Turkana province hold 560 million barrels of oil and expects them to produce up to 100,000 barrels per day from 2022. Another milestone to pass is land acquisition for infrastructure around the oil fields and the 820 km pipeline to the Indian Ocean for which it plans to send out construction tenders within weeks. The government recently gazetted land it wants to buy in order to lease it to the oil partners. Having clarity on land acquisition and pipeline tariffs is crucial to reach a final investment decision on the $2.9 billion project which Tullow wants to make money at $50 a barrel. “There is good but slower than expected progress on the land issue,” Mbogo said. This week, the Kenyan government together with Tullow approached potential buyers of Kenya’s low-sulphur crude, including Asian refiners like India’s Reliance, independent oil groups and majors such as Royal Dutch Shell . There will be further such meetings during International Petroleum week in London next week to see whether buyers are willing to pay a premium or discount to Brent crude for Kenyan oil. The government has an option to buy up to 20 percent in both the fields and the pipeline, which Tullow expects it to exercise at least in part before the final investment decision. Kenya has mooted floating its national oil company as holder of such a stake on the Nairobi and London bourses. The oil ministry was not immediately available for comment on this.

2019-02-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented a $10 billion (7.7 billion pounds) deal for a refining and petrochemical complex in China on Friday, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping who urged joint efforts to counter extremism and terror. The Saudi delegation, including top executives from state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, arrived on Thursday on an Asia tour that has already seen the kingdom pledge investment of $20 billion in Pakistan and seek to make additional investments in India’s refining industry. Saudi Arabia signed 35 economic cooperation agreements with China worth a total of $28 billion at a joint investment forum during the visit, Saudi state news agency SPA said. “China is a good friend and partner to Saudi Arabia,” President Xi Jinping told the crown prince in front of reporters. “The special nature of our bilateral relationship reflects the efforts you have made,” added Xi, who has made stepping up China’s presence in the Middle East a key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role there. The crown prince said Saudi Arabia’s relations with China dated back “a very long time in the past”.  “In the hundreds, even thousands, of years, the interactions between the sides have been friendly. Over such a long period of exchanges with China, we have never experienced any problems with China,” he said. Crown Prince Mohammed, who has come under fire in the West following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate in October, said Saudi Arabia saw great opportunities with China. “The Silk Road initiative and China’s strategic orientation are very much in line with the kingdom’s Vision 2030,” he said according to SPA, referring to Saudi Arabia’s sweeping economic reform programme. Trade between the countries increased by 32 percent last year, he said. Saudi Arabia also said it was working to add Chinese to the curriculum in Saudi schools and universities. “The introduction of Chinese to the curriculum is an important step towards the opening of new horizons for students,” the government said in a statement. China has had to step carefully in relations with Riyadh, since Beijing also has close ties with Saudi Arabia’s regional foe, Iran. China is also wary of criticism from Muslim countries about its camps in the heavily Muslim far western region of Xinjiang, which the government says are for de-radicalisation purposes and rights groups call internment camps. Xi told the crown prince the two countries must strengthen international cooperation on de-radicalisation to “prevent the infiltration and spread of extremist thinking”, Chinese state television said. Saudi Arabia respected and supported China’s right to protect its own security and take counter-terror and de-radicalisation steps, the crown prince told Xi, according to the same report, and was willing to increase cooperation. Meeting the crown prince earlier on Friday, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said the two countries should enhance exchanges on their experiences in de-radicalisation, China’s official Xinhua news agency said in a separate report. Chinese state media made no direct mention of Xinjiang in their stories on the crown prince’s meetings. Aramco agreed to form a joint venture with Chinese defence conglomerate Norinco to develop a refining and petrochemical complex in the northeastern Chinese city of Panjin, saying the project was worth more than $10 billion. The partners would form a company called Huajin Aramco Petrochemical Co as part of a project that would include a 300,000-barrels per day (bpd) refinery with a 1.5-million-metric tonnes per year ethylene cracker, Aramco said. Aramco will supply up to 70 percent of the crude feedstock for the complex, which is expected to start operations in 2024. The investments could help Saudi Arabia regain its place as the top oil exporter to China, a position Russia has held for the last three years. Saudi Aramco is set to boost market share by signing supply deals with non-state Chinese refiners. Aramco also signed an agreement to buy a 9 percent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical, Saudi state news agency SPA said. This formalised a previously announced plan to gain a stake in a 400,000-bpd refinery and petrochemicals complex in Zhoushan, south of Shanghai. China sees “enormous potential” in Saudi Arabia’s economy and wants more high-tech cooperation, State Councillor Wang Yi, the Chinese government’s top diplomat, said on Thursday. But China was not seeking to play politics in the Middle East, the widely read state-run tabloid, the Global Times, said in an editorial. “China won’t be a geopolitical player in the Middle East. It has no enemies and can cooperate with all countries in the region,” said the paper, published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily. “China’s increasing influence in the Middle East comes from pure friendly cooperation. Such a partnership will be welcomed by more countries in the Middle East.” (This story refiles to clarify that statement is from the government and not royal court in para 11.)

2019-02-22,"LISBON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Portugal will launch its first big auction of solar power capacity in June or July, offering 1,750 megawatts as it seeks to boost emission-free electricity production, Environment and Energy Transition Minister Joao Matos Fernandes told Reuters. The new capacity to be offered to investors, who have already shown strong interest in such an auction, is more than 2.5 times the installed solar power capacity in Portugal as of the end of last year and is part of a plan to reach between 8,100 MW to 9,900 MW by 2030, the minister said. “It is scientifically proven that south Algarve and north Alentejo are the areas with the biggest potential for solar energy in Europe, the only comparable area being in central Turkey,” he said, referring to Portugal’s two southern regions. “So we will deliberately bet on promoting solar power generation projects,” he said. The terms of the auction will be known in March or April, he said, adding that the government wanted to take into account the opinions of “many foreign investors who are very interested in taking part”. He expects the new capacity to be added over the next two or three years in a sharp acceleration from the pace seen over the past couple of years when licences for 1,200 MW were attributed but only 49 MW have been installed. The recent requirement for producers to sell the energy at market prices and not a fixed guaranteed rate as before has been one of the key obstacles to new additions as it constrained small producers’ access to financing. The auction will be designed to allow small producers to fix a guaranteed price, while bigger players with good access to financing will likely prefer to use market electricity prices, Matos Fernandes said. He said there were players interested in installing projects as big as 300-400 MW. So far, Portugal’s largest solar project has been the 219 MW Solara - also one of Europe’s biggest - which was bought by Allianz Capital Partners in December. The 1,200 MW already licensed do not need to go to the auction, but licensees will be able to sign up for the guaranteed price to be set there, the minister said. The government expects market prices to be higher than those to be set in the auction and is planning to require that large producers contribute a share of their gains above the fixed price to the national grid.

2019-02-22,"OSLO (Reuters) - Finland’s nuclear regulator has identified a safety issue at Olkiluoto 3, a 1.6-gigawatt reactor built by France’s Orano, and the problem needs to be fixed before the unit can receive a permit to operate, the regulator told Reuters. The reactor is due to start producing electricity in January next year after a decade-long delay. Part of the pressurizer, a primary circuit component of the reactor, is vibrating at levels that exceed safety limits, said Pekka Valikangas, the regulator’s section head for nuclear reactor regulation. “The test results show that these vibrations are not approved,” he said in an interview. “This must be taken care of before the ministry decides on the permit,” Valikangas said, adding that the regulator would offer two options for a solution. The reactor’s owner, Finnish consortium TVO, and supplier Orano, previously known as Areva, would need to choose from those options. Finland needs the reactor as it imports more than 25 percent of its electricity from neighboring Sweden and Russia, while its energy needs are growing.

More than 20 people were trapped underground in early February when a gas pipe exploded after they entered the mine to steal copper wire that supplies power for lighting and ventilation. Rescuers had to abort their mission on Friday after bringing 13 bodies to the surface due to the presence of thick smoke, police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said. “By Monday they will go back again and continue with their job,” he told Reuters. The Gloria Coal Mine in the eastern province of Mpumalanga is owned by Tegeta Resources and Exploration, which is under creditor protection after its owners, the Gupta brothers, found it difficult to continue doing business in South Africa following corruption allegations against them.

2019-02-22,"QUITO/LIMA (Reuters) - A deep magnitude-7.5 earthquake struck the Peru-Ecuador border region early on Friday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey said, causing tremors that the Ecuadorian president said were felt  around the country. The quake’s epicenter was in a sparsely populated area 224 km (140 miles) east-southeast of Ambato, Ecuador, at a depth of 132 km. The USGS’s initial reading assessed the quake, which occurred at 5:17 a.m. local time (1017 GMT), at magnitude 7.7. There was no risk of a tsunami being triggered, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, and there were no initial reports of casualties or damage. Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno said on Twitter that preliminary reports “do not indicate major damage,” though he added that provincial response teams had been activated and that the tremors had been “felt throughout the country.” One resident in Cuenca, Ecuador, 253 km (157 miles) from the epicenter, described the temblor as very strong, while a second resident there reported experiencing “a good 30-second shake,” according to witness statements on the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center website.  Ecuador’s emergency response service said the main quake and other smaller ones had shook the south of the country with reports of some minor injuries, evacuation of patients and staff from several hospitals and damage reported in some Amazonian towns. Some areas were without electrical power, authorities said, while the country’s oil pipelines and hydroelectric dams were operating normally. In towns near the epicenter of the quake, the tremors caused alarm. “I felt the walls and the floor move. I was very scared and we went out to the street,” Lissette Alarcón, a 25-year-old university student, told Reuters. “We still aren’t used to these earthquakes,” she said. A magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck Peru’s southern coast in January 2018, killing one person, injuring scores more and causing roads and homes to collapse.

2019-02-22,"* Water needed to pressurise Kenya’s first oil wells * Plan has been to reach water deal in Q2 * First indication of Kenya crude pricing expected next week By Shadia Nasralla NAIROBI, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A deal with local Kenyan authorities that would allow Tullow Oil to pump water to pressurise oil wells, crucial for a final green light for the country’s only oil project, may be delayed to the third quarter, a Tullow executive said on Friday. Tullow, with partners Total and Africa Oil , is working towards a final investment decision (FID) by year-end and had hoped the water deal would be reached by mid-year, Tullow’s Kenya Managing Director Martin Mbogo said. “I would probably realistically put it more for Q3 in terms of landing that agreement,” Mbogo told Reuters, referring to the deal organising the way Tullow can tap a body of water straddling two counties in northwestern Kenya. “(It’s) one of those things we absolutely need before we can get to FID.” Tullow estimates that Kenya’s onshore fields in Turkana province hold 560 million barrels of oil and expects them to produce up to 100,000 barrels per day from 2022. Another milestone to pass is land acquisition for infrastructure around the oil fields and the 820 km pipeline to the Indian Ocean for which it plans to send out construction tenders within weeks. The government recently gazetted land it wants to buy in order to lease it to the oil partners. Having clarity on land acquisition and pipeline tariffs is crucial to reach a final investment decision on the $2.9 billion project which Tullow wants to make money at $50 a barrel. “There is good but slower than expected progress on the land issue,” Mbogo said. This week, the Kenyan government together with Tullow approached potential buyers of Kenya’s low-sulphur crude, including Asian refiners like India’s Reliance, independent oil groups and majors such as Royal Dutch Shell . There will be further such meetings during International Petroleum week in London next week to see whether buyers are willing to pay a premium to Brent crude for Kenyan oil. The government has an option to buy up to 20 percent in both the fields and the pipeline, which Tullow expects it to exercise at least in part before the final investment decision. Kenya has mooted floating its national oil company as holder of such a stake on the Nairobi and London bourses. The oil ministry was not immediately available for comment on this.

Brent crude oil hit a 2019 high, supported by OPEC’s ongoing supply cuts. Corporate earnings drove stock swings on European markets. The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.3 percent and Germany’s DAX was up over half a percent by afternoon trade in London. Futures indicated an upbeat start to trading on Wall Street. Shares in Asia were buoyed by a late rally in Chinese shares, with the main blue-chip index of Chinese shares rising 2.2 percent. Chinese shares had faltered earlier amid concern about slowing domestic growth and indications that China would cut its benchmark interest rate only as a last resort to boost the economy. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.2 percent lower after data showed core consumer inflation accelerated in January but remained far from the central bank’s 2 percent target. Australian shares gained 0.5 percent and Seoul’s Kospi .KS11 ended up 0.1 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was nearly 0.1 percent higher on the day. It was set for a second week of gains. Trade talks and a growing number of policy U-turns by global central banks have propped up equities in recent weeks, although this week saw the first outflows from emerging market debt and equity funds since October 2018, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said, citing EPFR data. “We still expect China stocks to outperform on trade hopes and domestic stimulus,” Credit Suisse strategists wrote in a daily note to clients. Trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators continued in Washington, with little more than a week left before a U.S.-imposed deadline expires, triggering higher tariffs. Reuters reported on Wednesday the two sides were drafting language for six memoranda of understanding on proposed Chinese reforms, progress that had helped to lift investor sentiment. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, the White House said. “Given that enough headway seems to have been made to warrant a meeting between Trump and the Chinese negotiator today, it appears more likely that the U.S. will not raise the levies, which should help high-beta currencies and equities push higher,” said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS. However, U.S. data showed its economic outlook was growing cloudy. The. Commerce Department said on Thursday domestic orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft unexpectedly fell 0.7 percent in December. AUSSIE REBOUND The Australian dollar recovered after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday, when Reuters reported the Chinese port of Dalian had banned imports of Australian coal indefinitely. China’s foreign ministry said on Friday coal imports continued, but customs had stepped up inspections environment and safety checks on foreign cargoes. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe cautioned against seeing restrictions as being directed at Australia, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ban does not indicate a souring relationship between the countries. Separate comments by Lowe that a rate increase may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. It was last up 0.35 percent at $0.71120. Elsewhere, the euro was flat at $1.1331, though not far off a two-week high. German business morale fell for a sixth month in a row, to its lowest in over four years, a survey showed. European Central Bank policymakers asked for swift preparations to give banks more long-term loans, minutes of its last meeting showed on Thursday. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against six others, was 0.1 percent higher at 96.673. Italian government bond yields crept up on Friday, reflecting caution among investors before a Fitch ratings review. Oil prices rose, supported by OPEC’s ongoing supply cuts and hopes that Washington and Beijing may soon end their trade dispute. U.S. crude oil  rose 0.8 percent to $57.43 a barrel.

2019-02-22,"(Repeats Feb. 21 story with no changes to headline or text) By Frank Jack Daniel and Stefanie  Eschenbacher MEXICO CITY, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state-oil company Pemex burned through $665 million at its fertilizer unit, ignored consultants and made high-risk investments with no discernible business strategy, according to a devastating government audit of its 2017 operations. The report, published late on Wednesday, offers insight into how Pemex ended up creaking under $106 billion of debt during the six-year term of former President Enrique Pena Nieto. Mexico’s Federal Audit Office (ASF) used unusually frank language in its assessment of Pemex’s use of public resources, particularly with regard to the company’s fertilizer subsidiary and a failed power generation unit. The fertilizer company suffered net losses of $665 million in 2017, and its assets were worth $1.1 billion less over the course of the year. “It destroyed value,” read the assessment, the last of three reports by the audit office on the state of government finances in 2017. Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to revive Pemex by clamping down on over-spending, rampant fuel-theft and corruption, but ratings agencies and investors are wary that expansive plans to revamp Mexico’s refineries could further weigh on finances. Fitch downgraded the company’s credit rating to one notch above junk last month. David Colmenares, who has headed the ASF since before last year’s election, told Reuters the results showed Pemex needed to be “re-engineered” to revive its finances. “We believe that if we resolve many of these points, we will be able to recover (Pemex’s) finances,” he said. He acknowledged corruption in the company, citing examples of contracts given to recently-created companies with no energy experience. Many of the problems at Pemex Fertilizers, a subsidiary created under Pena Nieto’s liberalization of the energy sector, stem from its purchase of two fertilizer plants in 2013 and 2016, the report said. Both plants had previously belonged to Pemex before being privatized in the 1990s by Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The first plant, ProAgro, was not operational when Pemex bought it back for $475 million. Despite three attempts to revive it, the plant was still not up and running this year, the report said. The second plant, Fertinal, operated well below capacity, the report said. Before the purchase, international auditors including PWC, warned Pemex’s board of directors of the parlous state of the two plants, but the company went ahead and bought them anyway, the report said. Similarly, Pemex created a new power generation unit, called Pemex Cogeneration and Services, in 2015, without the board of directors being presented any evidence or studies to show it could be a profitable business, or seeing a business or operation strategy, the report said. Without any infrastructure to generate electricity, the company lost $19 million in 2017. Pemex closed the unit the following year. Wilbur Matthews, founder of Texas-based Vaquero Global Investment, called Pemex’s business decisions during the 2013-18 period “completely incongruous.” “The way that they were conducting business in the past six years did not make any sense at all,” Matthews said. During Pena Nieto’s term, Pemex took on an additional $47 billion in debt, citing the deterioration in finances and commitments to keep up investment levels at a time when the oil prices collapsed. Shamaila Khan, director of emerging market debt strategies at AllianceBernstein, which has $550 billion of assets under management and owns Pemex bonds, blamed the company’s problems on the federal government charging it too much in taxes. “The real issue is that the sovereign has taken a lot of money out of Pemex,” she said. Khan said the company’s management had improved in the last years of Pena Nieto’s government. “The decision to do energy reform, to reduce the burden of expenditures for the company and to try and stabilize the company were actually good decisions from a management perspective.” (Additional reporting by Adrianna Barerra and Noe Torres; Editing by Tom Brown)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-pemex-audit/rpt-how-pemex-destroyed-1-bln-with-erratic-business-choices-idUKL1N20G2H8,22 Feb 2019,"Mexico's state-oil company

2019-02-22,"(Repeats item with no changes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - It’s been weird in the coal world in recent days, with the world’s largest shipper saying it’s capping output, biggest seaborne buyer China putting restrictions on some imports, and an Australian court saying mines must factor in climate change. Throw in an executive at a major Indian coal-fired power generator saying his company won’t build any new plants as coal can’t compete with renewables, and it’s little surprise that environmental activists may be tempted to pop champagne corks. The common theme at work is that coal is finding it harder to secure a long-term future in the world’s energy mix. But it’s worth unpacking the various developments and assessing the likely real impacts beyond public relations spin. The most significant development this week was Glencore’s announcement on Feb. 20 that it will cap its annual output around its current capacity of 145 million tonnes. Glencore is the world’s fourth-biggest coal mining company but also the largest supplier to the seaborne market, as miners that produce more - Coal India, China Shenhua Energy and Peabody Energy of the United States - are focused on their domestic markets. Glencore said it was taking the step to help mitigate climate change, prompting commentators and activists to claim another victory in the campaign to end burning of the polluting fuel. While Glencore may genuinely be trying to do its part to halt global warming, it’s also likely the mining giant has calculated that restricting coal output will be good for business. It is accepted that coal consumption is likely to drop in the coming decades, to virtually nothing in Europe and North America, and will even start to decline in Asia. But Glencore has probably calculated that this will be a slow, profitable death, and is positioning itself to take advantage. While overall coal consumption is important for climate considerations, Glencore’s interest lies in the seaborne market, and it’s here that business may actually be good for an extended period, even as overall coal demand drops. The seaborne market is set to become tighter, especially in Asia, as more countries in the region build coal-fired generators that rely on imported fuel. Countries on this list include Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines and others in Southeast and South Asia. The world’s three biggest exporters of coal, however, all have various reasons as to why they may not be able to supply much more than they ship now. Indonesia, the world’s biggest shipper of thermal coal used in power plants, has a domestic reservation policy that forecasts declining exports as more fuel is diverted to feed local generators. Australia, the biggest exporter of coking coal used to make steel and number two in thermal coal, may find it hard to boost its shipments, given increasing domestic opposition to the industry and the difficulties in getting new mines approved, financed and insured. South Africa, the third-biggest exporter, has capacity constraints in its rail system and is also trying to balance the needs of its home market against the desirability of earning foreign exchange through exports. Glencore, which spent some $3.7 billion last year on coal mines in Australia, has also probably acquired all the assets it needs in the coal sector. Its mission now is to operate these mines efficiently and to try and ensure that prices remain as high as possible. It may be cynical, but one way to do that is to say the company will cap output, thereby helping to keep the seaborne market tight and prices elevated. China is showing that two can play that game, with customs at the northern port of Dalian placing an indefinite ban on imports from Australia, and restricting those from other countries, according to an exclusive Reuters report on Thursday. This isn’t the first time China has taken such measures, and the most likely outcome is that imports will decline for a period of time, but may eventually recover. Much of the coal China imports from Australia is coking coal, and this is harder to source from other countries, with the only real alternatives being Canada and the United States. What is clearer is that China, the world’s biggest coal importer, wants to limit its total imports, which means that over time it’s unlikely to be much of a growth market. India, the second-biggest coal importer, looms as a great hope for the sector, but the Coaltrans India conference this week in New Delhi showed that while imports may grow this year and next, a dearth of new projects and the likely eventual improvement of domestic coal availability should result in a shrinking market. New-build coal plants are struggling to compete against wind and solar in India, with Rajit Desai, an executive at major private generator Tata Power, telling the conference that his company wasn’t looking at developing any new plants, and will instead focus on buying existing units that are effectively distressed assets. In another apparent victory for climate activists, an Australian court ruled on Feb. 8 that a mine development couldn’t go ahead, citing the impact from the greenhouse emissions that would be created. While the mine in question most likely would have been rejected on other grounds, such as its close proximity to a retirement complex, the court nonetheless signalled that climate mitigation may become a part of any future approval process. Putting the recent developments together gives a picture of a fuel battered from all sides. But there is always a caveat. In this case, it’s simply that vast numbers of coal-fired power plants in Asia are still in the early stages of useful lives, and will likely operate for decades to come. Coal may be down, but it’s far from out. I’m sure Glencore’s canny chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, would agree.

2019-02-22,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Lighter fuel, deodorant cans and drums full of chemicals stored in a residential building in the Bangladeshi capital fuelled a blaze this week that killed at least 70 people and injured more than 50, a senior fire official said on Friday. “We found hundreds of cans of deodorants, lighter refuelling fuel, plastic substances, electronic items and drums containing chemicals,” said Julfikar Rahman, director of Fire Services and Civil Defence, who visited the site on Friday. “These are highly flammable so when the fire came in contact with these goods the fire spread rapidly,” Rahman told Reuters.  The city’s worst fire since 2012 broke out late on Wednesday in a five-storey building before spreading to others in the Chawkbazar precinct, parts of which date back more than 300 years to the Mughal period. The building housed shops on its ground floor, a warehouse on the first floor, and homes on three floors above.      Lax regulations and poor enforcement of rules in Bangladesh have often been blamed for several large fires that have led to hundreds of deaths in recent years. Following the fire, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaydul Quader, said that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had ordered officials to relocate all chemical warehouses away from residential areas as soon as possible. “If during the investigation it is found that the fire was caused due to any negligence ... then it may take a turn as a murder case,” a senior police official said.

2019-02-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shell plans to enter Britain’s offshore wind market by acquiring seabed leases or taking stakes in existing projects, despite the country’s impending departure from the European Union, the head of the company’s New Energies division said. Oil firms are increasingly building portfolios of clean energy projects to satisfy investor demands that they reduce their carbon footprint. Shell previously said it would spend $1 billion to $2 billion a year on green technology. “We absolutely would like to get a position in the UK offshore (wind) market,” Mark Gainsborough, executive vice president at New Energies, told Reuters in an interview. Many international firms, such as automakers and nuclear plant developers, have shied away from fresh UK investment with Brexit creating uncertainty over the future of the country’s economy. But Gainsborough said Britain’s plans to leave the EU next month would not dampen the company’s interest in its offshore wind industry. “The thing that is more important is there continue to be supportive government policies,” he said. Britain is the world’s biggest offshore wind market, hosting almost 40 percent of all globally installed wind capacity, and the government is this year expected to outline planned support for the offshore wind industry. Gainsborough said the company could seek to buy a stake in or acquire an existing British offshore wind project and that it planned to take an “active role” in bidding for a British seabed offshore wind lease expected to be tendered this year. Shell has been successful in similar seabed lease sales in the United States. Under such deals, developers first acquire the seabed rights to build wind projects in certain locations.   Shell’s Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind joint venture with EDF Renewables and its Mayflower joint venture with EDP Renewables have U.S. seabed leases capable of hosting up to 4.1 gigawatts of wind power capacity. As part of efforts to boost its clean power portfolio, Shell also said it could bid for Dutch energy company Eneco with Dutch pension fund manager PGGM. Gainsborough said Eneco’s renewable power generation, retail and B2B customers and power trading teams would be a good fit for Shell’s plans to build the New Energies portfolio. “To make sure we stay relevant in the energy transition, we need to look at how we can bring lower-carbon solutions,” he said. Analysts have pegged Eneco’s value at around 3 billion euros  ($3.4 billion). Gainsborough said bidding for Eneco did not rule Shell out of other big-ticket acquisitions. “We are not a single-bet company,” he said. “We never want to be in the position of being dependent on one deal to be make or break for the growth of the business.” Reporting by Susanna Twidale and Ron Bousso; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/shell-windpower-britain/shell-shrugs-off-brexit-to-eye-foothold-in-uk-offshore-wind-market-idUKL5N20G6OD,22 Feb 2019,"Shell plans to enter

2019-02-22,"(Repeats story with no changes to text) By Anthony Esposito PORT-AU-PRINCE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The cacophony of sirens, horns and street vendors in Haiti’s capital was quieter than usual this week as residents remained on edge after recent anti-government protests, which organizers have promised will start again on Friday. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Port-au-Prince and the island nation’s other main cities for days of protests that began on Feb. 7, calling for President Jovenel Moise to resign amid ballooning inflation, a weakening currency and allegations of misused funds. “The protests hurt my business. We’re frustrated and the people are still scared,” said 33-year old Jocelyn Alexis, a street vendor in the city center. Other small business owners said that customers were still staying away after the recent protests turned violent, even though the marches died down this week. Opposition leaders are calling for an independent probe into the whereabouts of funds from the PetroCaribe agreement, an alliance between Caribbean countries, including Haiti, and Venezuela. The agreement’s preferential terms for energy purchases were meant to help free up funds to aid development in Haiti, a poor country habitually hammered by natural disasters. “The fight will continue ... we will continue to seek the president’s resignation, and we need to have a PetroCaribe probe because we need to end the corruption in this country that has allowed a small minority to get majority of wealth,” said opposition leader Andre Michel. “The new protests are set for Friday,” he said. “The fight will start again.” In an address from the presidential palace on Feb. 14, Moise struck a combative note and defied calls for his ouster, saying he would not hand the country over to drug traffickers and that dialogue was the only way to stop a civil war. Haiti has a long tradition of corruption and international partners and anti-graft watchdogs have often blamed Haitian politicians for failing to crack down on the scourge. The government’s “mismanagement of the economy” has also fueled Haitians’ frustrations, said economist Kesner Pharel at consultancy Group Croissance. Annual inflation of 15 percent as of December and a currency that weakened nearly 20 percent versus the dollar last year, and continued to depreciate in 2019, has made buying basic necessities more difficult in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation. “People are living in misery. We won’t stop until we get what we need. We need better leaders in government that give people hope. Until then the battle will continue,” said senator Evalliere Beauplan.

Emerging market stocks have had a strong run since the end of 2018 and pulled in flows of $18 billion in 2019 so far, but were named the “most crowded” trade in a BAML survey last week, which may be a bad omen.

2019-02-22,"PARIS/WARSAW/LONDON (Reuters) - Households across Europe should brace for higher energy bills this year as governments have had little success in limiting rises in the face of soaring wholesale and environmental costs. This has already spelt trouble for some. Rising energy prices and plans to hike fuel taxes were a catalyst for the “yellow vest” protests that have swept France since November, prompting the government to reverse several tax initiatives. Other governments across the continent have also felt the heat of public frustration over rising bills but have struggled to find a formula to keep a lid on charges. Britain imposed a household energy price cap in January but the regulator has allowed a 10 percent price hike from April. Poland has to amend its plans for a cap to ensure they do not violate European Union rules on state aid for utilities. Failure to address the issue could help fuel popular anger and protest votes in European Union parliamentary elections in May or looming national polls, including Poland’s elections. “There is a risk of protests like the yellow vests spreading so long as people feel that they are excluded from discussions around energy issues reserved for technocrats,” said Francois Gemenne at SciencesPo University in Paris, adding that the votes would highlight “questions around social justice.” Since the start of 2019, power prices have risen 8 percent in Spain and Italy, while in France regulated electricity tariffs for more than 28 million customers of EDF will rise 5.9 percent on June 1, the biggest increase since 2010.  In Belgium, regulator CREG sparked a public outcry by proposing a 21 percent rise in the electricity tariffs that are paid by low-income households. Utilities say they have to charge more because wholesale costs are rising. The European benchmark power price German Cal’20 is trading 40 percent higher than a year ago at 49.25 euros per megawatt hour (MWh), even after falling 10 percent in 2019. The utilities also say they face extra expenses from the drive to cut down carbon emissions and shift to renewable power. Benchmark European carbon prices, which power generators buy to offset carbon emissions, almost trebled in 2018 to average about 15.95 euros ($18.13) a tonne and are now trading at 19.13 euros. Analysts expect the price to average above 20 euros for the next few years. Graphic: Evolution of European Baseload Power, Coal and Carbon Contracts  (tmsnrt.rs/2V7yZLS) In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May called energy tariffs a “rip off” and a cap on bills was introduced on Jan. 1. But regulator Ofgem, which reviews the cap each six months, said it had to let utilities charge more due to rising wholesale prices. It approved a more than 10 percent hike from April 1. All six of the big suppliers — Centrica’s British Gas, Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, Innogy’s npower, EDF’s EDF Energy and E.ON’s  E.ON UK and SSE — announced price rises of about 10 percent. “Unfortunately, there is no magic formula to control rising wholesale costs,” said Stephen Forbes, chief commercial officer of SSE Energy Services. In Poland, the government adopted legislation in December designed to prevent an expected rise in power prices for households and big consumers at the start of 2019, ahead of a general election in the autumn. The bill aimed to cap power prices at mid-2018 levels at a cost of about 9 billion zlotys ($2.36 billion), covering costs of compensating utilities and for cutting taxes and fees. But the legislation needs amending to meet EU rules on state aid. Entrepreneurship and Technology Minister Jadwiga Emilewicz said the government acted after energy prices rose 300 percent in 2018, but she said prices could climb again in 2020, when a presidential election is due. “The questions are whether there will be more meddling with retail power prices or whether the problem will be solved as coal prices are falling,” said Robert Maj, analyst at Ipopema Securities in Warsaw.  Graphic: European Electricity prices for household consumers in the first half of 2018 (tmsnrt.rs/2TZ6xvy) Spain, Norway and Denmark, where consumers face some of the highest electricity bills, have cut taxes to help reduce household bills. But such a step also leaves governments with less to spend on the shift to renewables. The German government has hinted it could look at cutting its eco-tax on electricity that helps fund development of renewables and could consider reducing network transmission fees. But it faces a juggling act as it seeks to keep retail prices down while paying for a move away from fossil fuels. Germany aims to close its coal power plants by 2038 and could face a bill of at least 40 billion euros for the phase out.     “More renewables bring down wholesale prices,” said Pierre Georges, lead EMEA utilities analyst at S&P Global Ratings. “But to build these renewables, you need subsidies.” Additional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen, Vera Eckert in Frankfurt, Simon Carraud in Paris, Isla Binnie in Madrid and Lefteris Karagiannopoulos in Oslo; Editing by Nina Chestney and Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/europe-electricity-prices/little-leeway-to-ease-consumer-pain-as-european-power-prices-soar-idUKL5N20G4B3,22 Feb 2019,"Households across

2019-02-22,"JAKARTA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Indonesia plans to start processing its rich supplies of nickel laterite ore for use in lithium batteries on the way to becoming a global hub for producing and exporting electric vehicles (EVs) to Asia and beyond, a senior minister told Reuters. Southeast Asia’s biggest economy is hoping a $4 billion Chinese-led project to produce battery-grade nickel chemicals will pay dividends by helping to attract EV production into the country. “We have to be a global player,” Coordinating Maritime Minister Luhut Pandjaitan said in an interview, in which he mapped out a broader strategy to go beyond simply exporting batteries or battery chemicals. Indonesia, the second-largest car production hub in Southeast Asia after Thailand, last month announced plans to introduce a fiscal scheme that will offer tax cuts to EV battery producers and automakers, as well as preferential tariff agreements with other countries that have a high EV demand. “Of course, maybe we can export these batteries ... But then, if you build a factory here you can also supply batteries to cars produced in Indonesia,” said Pandjaitan, who also oversees energy, mining and transportation. “Our strategy is we can export (EVs) to Australia because we have a trade agreement, and also to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and domestically,” he said. Indonesia and Australia are expected to sign a long-awaited free trade agreement next month. Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto told a briefing to foreign correspondents on Feb. 13 that Indonesia aimed for 20 percent of vehicle production in the country to be EVs by 2025, representing 400,000 vehicles. He said investment in EV production was expected from companies in South Korea, Japan, China and Europe. The deputy minister for industry, Harjanto, also said last December that Hyundai Motor Co, the world’s No.5 automaker, plans to start producing EVs in Indonesia as part of an $880 million auto investment in the country. Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors announced in 2018 as well that it would partner with the Indonesian government to expand the use and availability of EVs in Indonesia. Developers started building a lithium battery project in Morowali, on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, last month led by Chinese companies including battery firm GEM Co Ltd and units of lithium battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) and stainless steel-maker Tsingshan Holding Group. Analysts caution, however, on how quickly such plans can be carried out, as some of the required nickel smelter technology is complicated.

Earnings from companies drove big stock swings as European markets opened. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.1 and Germany’s DAX 0.2 percent. Shares in Asia were buoyed by a late rally in Chinese shares, with the main blue-chip index of Chinese shares rising 2.2 percent. Chinese shares had faltered earlier amid concern about slowing domestic growth and indications that China would cut its benchmark interest rate only as a last resort to boost the economy. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.2 percent lower after data showed core consumer inflation accelerated in January but remained far from the central bank’s 2 percent target. Australian shares gained 0.5 percent and Seoul’s Kospi .KS11 ended up 0.1 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was less than 0.1 percent higher on the day. Trade talks and a growing number of policy U-turns by global central banks have propped up equities in recent weeks. Trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators continued in Washington, with little more than a week left before a U.S.-imposed deadline expires, triggering higher tariffs. Reuters reported on Wednesday the two sides were drafting language for six memoranda of understanding on proposed Chinese reforms, progress that had helped to lift investor sentiment. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, the White House said. “Given that enough headway seems to have been made to warrant a meeting between Trump and the Chinese negotiator today, it appears more likely that the U.S. will not raise the levies, which should help high-beta currencies and equities push higher,” said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS. However, U.S. data showed its economic outlook was growing cloudy. The. Commerce Department said on Thursday domestic orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft unexpectedly fell 0.7 percent in December. AUSSIE REBOUND The Australian dollar recovered after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday, when Reuters reported the Chinese port of Dalian had banned imports of Australian coal indefinitely. China’s foreign ministry said on Friday coal imports continued but customs had stepped up inspections environment and safety checks on foreign cargoes. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe cautioned against seeing restrictions as being directed at Australia, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ban does not indicate a souring relationship between the countries. Separate comments by Lowe that a rate increase may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. It was last up 0.35 percent at $0.71120. Elsewhere, the euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1346 , nearing a two-week high. German business morale fell for a sixth time in a row, to its lowest in over four years, a survey showed. European Central Bank policymakers asked for swift preparations to give banks more long-term loans, minutes of its last meeting showed on Thursday. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against six others, was down 0.1 percent at 96.549. Italian government bond yields crept up on Friday, reflecting caution among investors before a Fitch ratings review. U.S. crude oil  rose 0.3 percent to $57.14 a barrel. Brent crude was up nearly 0.2 percent at $67.18. Spot gold was trading up about 0.2 percent at $1,325.83 per ounce.

I can’t leave them for another week,” said the English teacher - who travelled from the eastern city of Yola - weighing up the expense and disruption in returning to the city in which he registered to vote. Many of the country’s 72.8 million eligible voters, having spent considerable sums of money on travel, face the same dilemma. The delay to the election, now scheduled for Saturday, could depress turnout, according to politicians and civil society groups. That in turn would reduce the mandate of the eventual winner to rule Africa’s most populous country and its biggest economy. The two main candidates - President Muhammadu Buhari and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar - are also both over 70 years old and have failed to generate significant excitement from a relatively youthful population. “It disadvantages us because we need the turnout. Our base is the youth population, and they’re the ones who can just easily get turned off from the whole process,” Bukola Saraki, director general of Atiku’s campaign, told Reuters in an interview. “The momentum was on our side,” he said. Idayat Hassan, director of the Abuja-based think tank Centre for Democracy and Development, also said the delay would likely benefit Buhari. His supporters had been galvanised in the last two elections with a high turnout in his core base in the northwest, she said, the region with the highest number of registered voters. The main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) typically attracts more support in the southeast, a region  where turnout has historically been low, she said. Yusuf Tuggar, a campaign team member of the ruling All Progressives Congress, said his party would be hit harder because many of its northern supporters live in the south and could not afford to travel home. “It hurts us more because we have more supporters,” he said. Turnout in presidential elections has declined steadily since 2003 from nearly 70 percent to just 44 percent in 2015. That is largely because of growing disenchantment with a political class seen as corrupt and out of touch with a population that includes a high proportion of people living in extreme poverty.  Hassan said that, irrespective of the outcome, lower voter numbers would be dangerous for the winner. “Sooner or later many people will question the legitimacy of elected representatives, especially when they have not participated in the process,” said Hassan. Such concerns have led to the announcement of measures aimed at boosting turnout. The interior ministry said Friday would be a public holiday, to give people time to travel to the polls, while fuel suppliers cut the price of petrol and a trade union that operates bus routes nationwide agreed to provide discounts for trips to voting points. The hope was that people would overcome the difficulties involved in making a second trek to the polls. “I need to travel to perform my citizenship of Nigeria,” said student Francisca Esidoy as she boarded a bus in the northern city of Kano, where she lives, to make the 970 kilometre (600 miles) journey to her southeastern home state of Abia. But others could not be enticed.  Brauna Afraimu, 41, a civil servant based in Yola, said he was too disillusioned to make the 440 kilometre journey to nearby Bauchi state. “All these things will not motivate me to go and vote. I’ve already spent a lot of my resources and time last week,” he said.

2019-02-22,"SYDNEY/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s foreign ministry said on Friday that Australian coal imports to the country continue as normal, although it added customs authorities had stepped up environment and safety checks on foreign cargoes. The statement came after sources at Chinese ports told Reuters Australian coal imports are facing longer waiting times to clear customs than other supplies, and the northern port of Dalian was halting Australian coal shipments. “At present, customs throughout the country are accepting as normal customs declarations for imported coal, including from Australia,” said Geng Shuang, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China, during a press briefing. But Geng added the customs authorities in China have stepped up environment and safety checks on foreign cargoes, to “protect the rights of Chinese importing companies and the environment”. Overseas coal supplies into China, especially from Australia, have slowed for weeks, causing shipping backlogs outside key Chinese ports. The Australian currency fell more than 1 percent to a 10-day low of $0.7070 on Thursday after Reuters reported that customs at Dalian had banned imports of Australia’s biggest export earner since the start of February. Seeking to ease fears of a further rift in ties with China, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday there was nothing to suggest the move was out of the ordinary. The country has asked its ambassador to China to seek urgent clarification. “People should be careful about leaping to conclusions about this. This is not the first time that on occasion local ports make decisions about these matters,” Morrison told reporters in Auckland. China is the largest buyer of Australian coal, taking 89 million tonnes last year, worth A$15 billion ($10.7 billion), according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Dalian’s move came after major ports elsewhere in China prolonged clearing times for Australian coal and stoked concerns that Beijing is using trade to punish Australia amid a recent souring of bilateral ties. Tensions arose in 2017 when Canberra accused Beijing of meddling in its domestic affairs, and the relationship suffered another setback last year when Australia banned China’s Huawei from its 5G broadband network. Australia’s Minister for Trade, Simon Birmingham, said delays to exports of coal to China were caused by import quotas. “We have no basis to believe that there is a ban on Australian coal exports into China, or into any part of China,” he told reporters. The move is not the first time China has restricted coal imports. The country has periodically imposed customs delays and quality controls over the past several years, juggling efforts to curb smog, cut coal use, balance imports against domestic production and protect jobs. “The potential political nature of this targeted ban after a number of bilateral issues have surfaced ... may be reminiscent of the impediments to Mongolia’s coal exports to China after the Dalai Lama visit in 2016,” U.S. bank Citi said on Friday in a note. Dalian will ban imports of all Australian coal indefinitely and limit coal imports from all sources to 12 million tonnes in 2019, a port official told Reuters on Thursday. A manager at Beibu Gulf Port Group, which operates the port of Fangchenggang and two other harbors in the southern region of Guangxi, said on Friday the port had no ban on Australian coal. “For now, Australian coal can clear customs,” he said, declining to be named because of company policy. However, Australian coal, which accounts for more than half of the port’s 18 million tonnes of imports each year, was taking longer to clear customs, he said, adding that official policy on product from Australia was “very fuzzy”. An trader based in Guangzhou also said customs clearance for Australian coal imports is taking more than 40 days, much longer compared to other countries. A purchasing manager at a large steel mill in eastern China said his firm was not concerned about their supply of coking coal, a type of coal used in steelmaking, given sufficient inventory at ports, and did not expect the restriction to spread. The ban at Dalian was due to relatively weak coal demand in northeastern China, but broadening the restriction to eastern and southern China where demand is firmer would affect downstream users like utilities and steel mills, the manager said. Total imported coking coal inventory at five major Chinese ports stood at 3.02 million tonnes as of Feb. 22, up 180,000 tonnes from last week, according to Mysteel consultancy. To make up for any shortfall in Australian coal for power generation, known as thermal coal, traders said there was ample domestic supply, and also the option to import from Mongolia and Indonesia. Shares in Australian coal miners fell on Friday amid broad weakness in the resources sector, but losses eased in afternoon trade. Stanmore Coal slipped more than 7 percent before closing down 2.1 percent. New Hope Corp fell 3.6 percent and Yancoal fell 3 percent, despite saying it was not directly affected. The Australian dollar steadied, boosted by upbeat central bank comments on the economy and government comments on the ban, but had still not recouped its losses from Thursday.

2019-02-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Humanitarian aid should not be forced into Venezuela, lest it cause violence, China’s Foreign Ministry said on Friday, warning that Beijing opposed military intervention in the country. Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro threatened to close the border with Colombia on Thursday as opposition leader Juan Guaido and some 80 lawmakers ran a gauntlet of roadblocks trying to get to the frontier to receive humanitarian aid. Guaido, who is recognised by dozens of countries as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, was poised for a showdown with Maduro’s government on Saturday, when the opposition will attempt to bring in food and medicine being stockpiled in neighbouring countries. Maduro denies there is a humanitarian crisis and said on Thursday he was considering closing Venezuela’s key border with Colombia and would close the country’s other main border with Brazil, effectively shutting off any legal land access. Speaking at a daily news conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that the Venezuelan government had “remained calm and exercised restraint”, effectively preventing large-scale clashes. “If so-called aid material is forced into Venezuela, and then if it causes violence and clashes, it will have serious consequences. This is not something anyone wants to see,” Geng said.  “China opposes military intervention in Venezuela, and opposes any actions causing tensions or even unrest,” he said. Maduro retains the backing of both Russia and China. Beijing has lent more than $50 billion to Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements over the past decade, securing energy supplies for its fast-growing economy. A change of government in Venezuela would favour Russia and China, who are the country’s two main foreign creditors, Guaido told Reuters in an interview last month.

2019-02-22,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Friday began large-scale naval drills at the mouth of the Gulf, which will feature its first submarine cruise missile launches, state media reported, at a time of rising tensions with the United States. More than 100 vessels were taking part in the three-day war games in a vast area stretching from the Strait of Hormuz to the Indian Ocean, the state news agency IRNA reported.         “The exercise will cover confronting a range of threats, testing weapons, and evaluating the readiness of equipment and personnel,” navy commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, said in remarks carried by state television.   “Submarine missile launches will be carried out ... in addition to helicopter and drone launches from the deck of the Sahand destroyer,” Khanzadi said. State media said Iran would be testing its new domestically built Fateh (Conqueror) submarine which is armed with cruise missiles and was launched last week. Iranian officials in the past have threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action, including attempts to halt Iranian oil exports through sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme last May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq. Iran has expanded its missile programme, particularly its ballistic missiles.     Iran launched its domestically made destroyer Sahand in December, which official say has radar-evading stealth properties. The USS John C. Stennis entered the Gulf in December, ending a long absence of U.S. aircraft carriers in the strategic waterway. Iran displayed a new cruise surface-to-surface missile with a range of 1,300 km (800 miles) earlier this month during celebrations marking the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Western experts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities, although there are concerns about its long-range ballistic missiles.

2019-02-22,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia’s biggest oil consumers are flooding the region with fuel as refining output is exceeding consumption amid a slowdown in demand growth, pressuring industry profits. Since 2006, the Asia-Pacific has been the world’s biggest oil consuming region, led by traditional industrial users South Korea and Japan along with rising economic powerhouses China and India. Yet overbuilding of refineries and currently sluggish demand growth have caused a jump in fuel exports from these demand hubs. Car sales in China, the world’s second-biggest oil user, fell for the first time on record last year, and early 2019 sales also remain weak, implying a slowdown in gasoline demand. For diesel, China National Petroleum Corp in January said it expected demand to fall by 1.1 percent in 2019. That would be China’s first annual demand decline for a major fuel since its industrial ascent started in 1990. The surge in fuel exports combined with a 25 percent jump in crude oil prices so far this year has collapsed Singapore refinery margins, the Asian benchmark, from more than $11 per barrel in mid-2017 to just over $2. Combine the slumping margins with labour costs and taxes and many Asian refineries now struggle to make money. The squeezed margins have pummelled the stocks of most major Asian petroleum companies, such as Japan’s refiners JXTG Holdings Inc or Idemitsu Kosan, South Korea’s top oil processor SK Innovation, Asia’s top oil refiner China Petroleum & Chemical Corp and Indian Oil Corp., with some companies dropping by about 40 percent over the past year. Jeff Brown, the president of energy consultancy FGE, said the surge in exports and resulting oversupply were a “big problem” for the industry. “The pressure on refinery margins is a case of death by a thousand cuts... Refinery upgrades throughout the region are bumping up against softening demand growth,” he said. For a graphic on Asia refining industry, see -  tmsnrt.rs/2EkfMBa For a graphic on Asia refined oil product exports, see - tmsnrt.rs/2EiUTq1 The profit slump follows a surge in fuel exports from China, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Refinitiv shipping data shows fuel exports from those countries have risen three-fold since 2014, to a record of around 15 million tonnes in January. The biggest jump in exports has come from China, where refiners are selling off record amounts of excess fuel into Asia. “There is a risk for Asian market turmoil if (China’s fuel) export capacity remains at the current level or grows further,” said Noriaki Sakai, chief executive officer at Idemitsu Kosan during a news conference last week. But Japan’s and South Korea’s fuel exports have also risen as demand at home falls amid mature industry and a shrinking population. Japan’s 2019 oil demand will drop by 0.1 percent from 2018 while South Korea’s will remain flat, according to forecasts from Energy Aspects.  In Japan, oil imports have been falling steadily for years, yet its refiners produce more fuel than its industry can absorb. The situation is similar in South Korea, the world’s fifth-biggest refiner by capacity, according to data from BP Plc. Cho Sang-bum, an official at the Korea Petroleum Association, which represents South Korean refiners, said the surging exports had “triggered a gasoline glut”. That glut caused negative gasoline margins in January. Compounding the supply overhang in Asia, fuel exports from the Middle East, which the BP data shows added more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity from 2013 to 2017, have doubled since 2014 to around 55 million tonnes, according to Refinitiv estimates. Even more fuel is set to come. Malaysia’s state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd is starting up its RAPID refinery, capable of processing 300,000 bpd of crude, while China and India also have several projects coming online this year and next. “Asia is expected to lead the global refining industry, both in terms of capacity as well as capital expenditure, between 2019 and 2023,” data analytics firm GlobalData said in a report published this week. “Between 2019 and 2023, 45 new refineries are expected to become operational in Asia,” said the report, adding that this would “increase petroleum products exports” from Asia. Despite so many refineries coming to the market, the outlook is not entirely bleak. FGE’s Brown said new regulations by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) that will require shippers to reduce the sulphur content in their fuel from next year meant demand for products like diesel and low-sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) would rise and improve refinery profits. “The main relief will come as the market shifts into IMO2020 mode in the fourth quarter,” said Brown. “Margins will recover, restoring order to the market.” For a graphic on Middle East refined product exports to Asia, see - tmsnrt.rs/2VbZArc Reporting by Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE; additional reporting by Jane Chung in SEOUL and Yuka Obayashi in TOKYO; editing by Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/asia-refining-industry/analysis-asias-surging-fuel-exports-depress-refining-industry-profits-idUKL5N20F0B5,22 Feb 2019,"* Fuel exports rise from China, India, S.Korea, Japan &

2019-02-22,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan +0.3 pct, reverses earlier losses * European markets set for mixed open * China blue-chips post best week since 2015 * Aussie dollar rebounds as officials seek to reassure investors * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia recouped early losses on Friday, buoyed by strong gains in China as signs of progress in trade talks with the United States offset worries about a deteriorating global economic outlook. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.3 percent higher by mid-afternoon, having spent the day dipping in and out of negative territory. Spread-betters CMC Markets expect an uneven performance in Europe, with London’s FTSE seen up 0.1 percent at the open, Frankfurt’s DAX down 0.1 percent and Paris’ CAC down 0.2 percent. Chinese shares rallied in the afternoon after a tentative start as optimism over trade talks reasserted itself, pushing the blue-chip index 2.2 percent higher. For the week, the it gained 5.4 percent, its strongest week since November 2015. China stocks had faltered earlier on investor concerns over slowing domestic growth and on indications that Chinese authorities will resort to a benchmark lending rate cut only as a last resort to boost the economy. Growth in China’s new home prices fell to a nine-month low in January as broader economic weakness increasingly weighs on the property sector and consumer confidence. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.2 percent lower after data showed core consumer inflation accelerated slightly in January but remained far from the central bank’s 2 percent target, underscoring the fragility of the country’s economic recovery. Australian shares gained 0.5 percent and Seoul’s Kospi reversed earlier losses to end up 0.1 percent. A combination of trade talks and Federal Reserve caution over further rate hikes has provided support to riskier assets, including equities, in recent sessions, said Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING. But with a more dovish Fed and some sort of trade deal already priced in, further developments on trade “haven’t really been having anything like the impact in markets that they would have done a week or a couple weeks or months ago,” he said. Nevertheless, investors continue to closely watch high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators in Washington, with little more than a week left before a U.S.-imposed deadline for an agreement expires, triggering higher tariffs. Reuters reported exclusively on Wednesday that the two sides were drafting language for six memorandums of understanding on proposed Chinese reforms, progress that had helped to lift investor sentiment. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, the White House said. Amid the trade discussions, new data from the U.S. Thursday highlighted its economic outlook is also growing cloudy. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday that domestic orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.7 percent. Moreover, the U.S. Mid-Atlantic factory sector fell into contraction territory in February for the first time since May 2016, data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed. “While global manufacturing is weak, services activity is looking more positive. But it is difficult to see manufacturing and services diverging for long,” analysts at ANZ said in a morning note. “There are strong multiplier effects from manufacturing that imply downside risks to the services sector, particularly in Europe. And trade uncertainty, which is overhanging the manufacturing sector, needs to be resolved.” The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes edged lower to 2.6824 percent Friday, compared with a U.S. close of 2.688 percent on Thursday as a bump from investor optimism about trade talks progress ebbed. The two-year yield, watched as a gauge of expectations of higher Fed fund rates, eased to 2.5204 percent from a U.S. close of 2.529 percent. The Australian dollar rebounded after tumbling more than 1 percent on Thursday on a Reuters report that China’s northern port of Dalian has placed an indefinite ban on imports of Australian coal. On Friday, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe cautioned against seeing restrictions as being directed at Australia, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ban does not point to a souring of ties between the countries. Separate comments by Lowe that a rate hike may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. It was last up 0.2 percent at $0.71025. The U.S. dollar edged up against the yen to 110.76, while the euro gained less than 0.1 percent to buy $1.1342. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was steady at 96.611. U.S. crude turned around from small declines to rise 0.1 percent to $57.01 a barrel. Brent crude was nearly unchanged at $67.09. Gold rebounded after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday, with spot gold trading up about 0.2 percent at $1,325.16 per ounce.

2019-02-22,"* Buhari has faith in electoral commission to conduct vote * President urges Nigerians to “go out and vote” * Rival Atiku also makes Twitter pitches for support By Felix Onuah ABUJA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday urged Nigerians “to go out and vote”, promising that there would be adequate security for Saturday’s postponed election that pits him in a tight race with businessman Atiku Abubakar. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced a week’s delay to voting in the early hours of last Saturday, just as some of Nigeria’s 72.8 million eligible voters were preparing to go to polling stations. In a televised morning address on the eve of the vote, Buhari asked Nigerians to “cast aside doubt and have faith that INEC will rise to the occasion” on Saturday. “Do not be afraid of rumours of violence and unrest. Our security agencies have worked diligently to ensure that adequate security measures are in place,” he said. The Boko Haram militant group and its offshoot, Islamic State in West Africa Province, have carried out deadly sporadic raids in the northeast’s Borno state. Boko Haram has warned people not to vote. Buhari’s rival Atiku, a former vice president who is representing the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), made a similar appeal to voters through his Twitter feed on Thursday night. “This Saturday, a vote for PDP is a vote to get Nigeria working again. Come out, vote and #DefendYourVote,” Atiku said in a tweet accompanied by a video of his rallies. Buhari, a former military ruler who was later elected president in 2015, was criticised on Monday for saying that anyone trying to intimidate voters or interfere with the voting “will do it at the expense of his own life”. Atiku’s party said Buhari’s comments were a call for “jungle justice”. Members of Buhari’s All Progressives Congress party and those of Atiku’s PDP have accused each other of being behind the delay and colluding with the electoral commission. Neither party has publicly provided evidence to back up their allegations. The INEC’s chairman Mahmood Yakoob has insisted that the vote will go ahead on Saturday. He blamed logistical reasons for the postponement, and said there had been no external pressure. Buhari faces a close contest against Atiku to lead a country that has Africa’s largest economy and is its top oil producer, but is plagued by corruption and wide gaps between rich and poor. The election has been fought over Buhari’s handling of the economy amid fragile growth and growing unemployment as the country recovers from a recession in 2016. Writing by James Macharia;

2019-02-22,"(Repeats story from Thursday) * Engie to announce new three-year strategy plan next week * Insiders say Engie needs a big deal to restore cash flows * State stake sale would increase vulnerability to activists * Engie shares among most undervalued in EU utilities index By Geert De Clercq and Benjamin Mallet PARIS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Utility Engie is poised to cut back its geographical spread of businesses and focus on grids and renewables in a 1 billion euro cost-cutting drive to bolster revenues, sources familiar with the matter said. Engie has been criticised for being too complex and conglomerate-like and CEO Isabelle Kocher is expected to address this in a 2019-2021 corporate strategy plan to be announced next Thursday, when the company also releases 2018 results. Two sources with knowledge of the company’s plans said Kocher was likely to scale back the number of countries Engie operates in - it is present in some 70 countries - notably in central Europe. Both said Kocher would focus the gas and power group more strongly on grids and renewables after selling some 15 billion worth of fossil-fuel related assets in 2016-18. One of the two sources, a union official, said Kocher would aim to cut costs by 1 billion over three years, extending a 1.3 billion euro cost reduction plan in 2016-18. Daily business newsletter La Lettre A had first reported that Engie was targeting a billion-euro profit-boosting plan. Engie will also need to acquire at least one well-established, cash-generating business too make up for cash flow lost in its move away from fossil fuels, two sources, including a banker, said. “The plan will have to involve major acquisitions. The planets are aligned, but the target remains to be decided,” one of them said. Potential targets include the Transportadora Associada de Gás pipeline owned by Petrobras, Dutch renewables utility Eneco, or the U.S. renewable energy assets of Portugual’s EDPS, sources said. Engie cut is net debt to core earnings ratio to 2.2 at the end of 2017 from 2.5 two years earlier. It can further boost its financial firepower by selling part of its 75 percent stake in French gas transport firm GRTgaz, which will become possible under the government’s new “Loi Pacte” law. Engie declined to comment on strategy or potential targets ahead of next week’s presentation. More than anything, Kocher and new chairman Jean-Pierre Clamadieu have to come with plan that reduces Engie’s conglomerate discount and boosts its shares. This is because the government’s plan to cut its 23.64 percent holding will remove Engie’s best defence against activist investors. “For now, the state’s presence is a deterrent for activist investors, but once it leaves, Engie becomes a possible target,” said an investment banker familiar with the company’s thinking. Activist investor Elliott Management’s acquisition of a 2.5 percent stake in drinks firm Pernod Ricard in December has focused minds across France’s CAC40 bluechip index on the need for a clear strategy, attractive valuation and close relationships with major shareholders. At German rival Uniper, the presence of Elliott and activist investor Knight Vinke has become a source of tension in the company’s relationship with Finnish shareholder Fortum. Engie’s deeply discounted stock price shows the valuation potential of splitting off some of the group’s assets. With a 0.95 price/book ratio, Engie is the second-most undervalued share in the Stoxx European utilities index, with only Uniper more undervalued by that measure, Refinitiv Eikon data shows. More focused utilities trade at much higher multiples, with renewable energy group Orsted and Innogy around 2.5 times book and grid pureplays like Red Electrica and Terna trading at nearly three times book. “Engie’s conglomerate discount is due to its complexity,” one banker said. A large UK-based institutional investor said the company was “a black box”, incomprehensible to investors. Bankers and advisers say Kocher’s biggest problem - Engie’s nuclear assets in Belgium - may offer its strongest defence against an activist attack. Belgium plans to phase out nuclear energy by 2025, which will leave Engie the decades-long expensive task of decommissioning its seven nuclear plants there. “When an activist takes aim at a company, it is usually because he sees something that management doesn’t. But I don’t see what solution an activist could bring for Belgian nuclear,” the banker said.

2019-02-22,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - The cacophony of sirens, horns and street vendors in Haiti’s capital was quieter than usual this week as residents remained on edge after recent anti-government protests, which organizers have promised will start again on Friday. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Port-au-Prince and the island nation’s other main cities for days of protests that began on Feb. 7, calling for President Jovenel Moise to resign amid ballooning inflation, a weakening currency and allegations of misused funds. “The protests hurt my business. We’re frustrated and the people are still scared,” said 33-year old Jocelyn Alexis, a street vendor in the city centre. Other small business owners said that customers were still staying away after the recent protests turned violent, even though the marches died down this week. Opposition leaders are calling for an independent probe into the whereabouts of funds from the PetroCaribe agreement, an alliance between Caribbean countries, including Haiti, and Venezuela. The agreement’s preferential terms for energy purchases were meant to help free up funds to aid development in Haiti, a poor country habitually hammered by natural disasters. “The fight will continue ... we will continue to seek the president’s resignation, and we need to have a PetroCaribe probe because we need to end the corruption in this country that has allowed a small minority to get majority of wealth,” said opposition leader Andre Michel. “The new protests are set for Friday,” he said. “The fight will start again.” In an address from the presidential palace on Feb. 14, Moise struck a combative note and defied calls for his ouster, saying he would not hand the country over to drug traffickers and that  dialogue was the only way to stop a civil war. Haiti has a long tradition of corruption and international partners and anti-graft watchdogs have often blamed Haitian politicians for failing to crack down on the scourge. The government’s “mismanagement of the economy” has also fuelled Haitians’ frustrations, said economist Kesner Pharel at consultancy Group Croissance. Annual inflation of 15 percent as of December and a currency that weakened nearly 20 percent versus the dollar last year, and continued to depreciate in 2019, has made buying basic necessities more difficult in the Western Hemisphere’s poorest nation. “People are living in misery. We won’t stop until we get what we need. We need better leaders in government that give people hope. Until then the battle will continue,” said senator Evalliere Beauplan.

2019-02-22,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - It’s been weird in the coal world in recent days, with the world’s largest shipper saying it’s capping output, biggest seaborne buyer China putting restrictions on some imports, and an Australian court saying mines must factor in climate change. Throw in an executive at a major Indian coal-fired power generator saying his company won’t build any new plants as coal can’t compete with renewables, and it’s little surprise that environmental activists may be tempted to pop champagne corks. The common theme at work is that coal is finding it harder to secure a long-term future in the world’s energy mix. But it’s worth unpacking the various developments and assessing the likely real impacts beyond public relations spin. The most significant development this week was Glencore’s announcement on Feb. 20 that it will cap its annual output around its current capacity of 145 million tonnes. Glencore is the world’s fourth-biggest coal mining company but also the largest supplier to the seaborne market, as miners that produce more - Coal India, China Shenhua Energy and Peabody Energy of the United States - are focused on their domestic markets. Glencore said it was taking the step to help mitigate climate change, prompting commentators and activists to claim another victory in the campaign to end burning of the polluting fuel. While Glencore may genuinely be trying to do its part to halt global warming, it’s also likely the mining giant has calculated that restricting coal output will be good for business. It is accepted that coal consumption is likely to drop in the coming decades, to virtually nothing in Europe and North America, and will even start to decline in Asia. But Glencore has probably calculated that this will be a slow, profitable death, and is positioning itself to take advantage. While overall coal consumption is important for climate considerations, Glencore’s interest lies in the seaborne market, and it’s here that business may actually be good for an extended period, even as overall coal demand drops. The seaborne market is set to become tighter, especially in Asia, as more countries in the region build coal-fired generators that rely on imported fuel. Countries on this list include Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines and others in Southeast and South Asia. The world’s three biggest exporters of coal, however, all have various reasons as to why they may not be able to supply much more than they ship now. Indonesia, the world’s biggest shipper of thermal coal used in power plants, has a domestic reservation policy that forecasts declining exports as more fuel is diverted to feed local generators. Australia, the biggest exporter of coking coal used to make steel and number two in thermal coal, may find it hard to boost its shipments, given increasing domestic opposition to the industry and the difficulties in getting new mines approved, financed and insured. South Africa, the third-biggest exporter, has capacity constraints in its rail system and is also trying to balance the needs of its home market against the desirability of earning foreign exchange through exports. Glencore, which spent some $3.7 billion last year on coal mines in Australia, has also probably acquired all the assets it needs in the coal sector. Its mission now is to operate these mines efficiently and to try and ensure that prices remain as high as possible. It may be cynical, but one way to do that is to say the company will cap output, thereby helping to keep the seaborne market tight and prices elevated. China is showing that two can play that game, with customs at the northern port of Dalian placing an indefinite ban on imports from Australia, and restricting those from other countries, according to an exclusive Reuters report on Thursday. This isn’t the first time China has taken such measures, and the most likely outcome is that imports will decline for a period of time, but may eventually recover. Much of the coal China imports from Australia is coking coal, and this is harder to source from other countries, with the only real alternatives being Canada and the United States. What is clearer is that China, the world’s biggest coal importer, wants to limit its total imports, which means that over time it’s unlikely to be much of a growth market. India, the second-biggest coal importer, looms as a great hope for the sector, but the Coaltrans India conference this week in New Delhi showed that while imports may grow this year and next, a dearth of new projects and the likely eventual improvement of domestic coal availability should result in a shrinking market. New-build coal plants are struggling to compete against wind and solar in India, with Rajit Desai, an executive at major private generator Tata Power, telling the conference that his company wasn’t looking at developing any new plants, and will instead focus on buying existing units that are effectively distressed assets. In another apparent victory for climate activists, an Australian court ruled on Feb. 8 that a mine development couldn’t go ahead, citing the impact from the greenhouse emissions that would be created. While the mine in question most likely would have been rejected on other grounds, such as its close proximity to a retirement complex, the court nonetheless signalled that climate mitigation may become a part of any future approval process. Putting the recent developments together gives a picture of a fuel battered from all sides. But there is always a caveat. In this case, it’s simply that vast numbers of coal-fired power plants in Asia are still in the early stages of useful lives, and will likely operate for decades to come. Coal may be down, but it’s far from out. I’m sure Glencore’s canny chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, would agree.

2019-02-22,"SYDNEY, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Australia’s Minister for Trade, Simon Birmingham, said on Friday delays to exports of coal to China were caused by import quotas and not a blanket ban on Australian coal. The Australian dollar fell more than 1 percent on Thursday after Reuters reported that customs at Dalian had banned imports of Australia’s biggest export earner since the start of February. Birmingham, however, denied Australia has been unduly treated. “We have no basis to believe that there is a ban on Australian coal exports into China, or into any part of China,” Birmingham told reporters Adelaide. “The application of those quotas combined with different testing and the quality assurance and environment is testing centres, may be slowing down the processing of costing data of coal in certain parts of China.” Reporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Sam Holmes",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-australia-coal-minister/australian-trade-minister-says-import-quotas-not-blanket-ban-slowing-coal-exports-to-china-idUKS9N1YA022,22 Feb 2019,"Australia's Minister for Trade,

2019-02-22,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan -0.1 pct * China home price growth eases in January * Aussie dollar rebounds as officials seek to reassure investors * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia slipped on Friday as a deteriorating global economic outlook outweighed further signs of progress in trade talks between China and the United States. After inching higher in early trade, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell into the red as more markets opened across the region, dipping 0.1 percent. Chinese blue-chip shares were down 0.1 percent in late-morning trade after briefly breaking into positive territory. After surging on Monday on optimism over trade talks, China’s major equity indexes have faltered on investor concerns over slowing domestic growth and on indications that Chinese authorities will resort to a benchmark lending rate cut only as a last resort to boost the economy. Growth in China’s new home prices fell to a nine-month low in January as broader economic weakness increasingly weighs on the property sector. Seoul’s Kospi lost 0.3 percent. Shares in Taiwan were also 0.3 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.4 percent after data showed core consumer inflation accelerated slightly in January but remained far from the central bank’s 2 percent target, underscoring the fragility of the country’s economic recovery. Australian shares gained 0.4 percent. A combination of trade talks and Federal Reserve caution over further rate hikes has provided support to riskier assets, including equities, in recent sessions, said Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING. But with a more dovish Fed and some sort of trade deal already priced in, further developments on trade “haven’t really been having anything like the impact in markets that they would have done a week or a couple weeks or months ago,” he said. Nevertheless, investors continue to closely watch high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators in Washington, with little more than a week left before a U.S.-imposed deadline for an agreement expires, triggering higher tariffs. Reuters reported exclusively on Wednesday that the two sides were drafting language for six memorandums of understanding on proposed Chinese reforms, progress that had helped to lift investor sentiment. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, the White House said. Amid the trade discussions, new data from the U.S. Thursday highlighted its economic outlook is also growing cloudy. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday that domestic orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.7 percent. Moreover, the U.S. Mid-Atlantic factory sector fell into contraction territory in February for the first time since May 2016, data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed. “While global manufacturing is weak, services activity is looking more positive. But it is difficult to see manufacturing and services diverging for long,” analysts at ANZ said in a morning note. “There are strong multiplier effects from manufacturing that imply downside risks to the services sector, particularly in Europe. And trade uncertainty, which is overhanging the manufacturing sector, needs to be resolved.” The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes edged lower to 2.6842 percent Friday, compared with a U.S. close of 2.688 percent on Thursday as a bump from investor optimism about trade talks progress ebbed. The two-year yield, watched as a gauge of expectations of higher Fed fund rates, eased to 2.5224 percent from a U.S. close of 2.529 percent. The Australian dollar rebounded after tumbling more than 1 percent Thursday on a Reuters report that China’s northern port of Dalian has placed an indefinite ban on imports of Australian coal. On Friday, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe cautioned against seeing restrictions as being directed at Australia, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ban does not point to a souring of ties between the countries. Separate comments by Lowe that a rate hike may be appropriate next year also helped to boost the Aussie dollar. It was last up 0.06 percent at $0.7092. The U.S. dollar edged up against the yen to 110.73, while the euro inched slightly higher to buy $1.1337. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was steady at 96.602 U.S. crude dipped 0.2 percent to $56.85 a barrel. Brent crude also shed 0.2 percent to $66.92. Gold rebounded after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday, with spot gold trading up about 0.2 percent at $1,326.30 per ounce.

2019-02-22,"(Repeats Feb. 21 column, no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TZZN0D By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil traders are becoming very bullish on the outlook for prices, betting that Saudi Arabia will do whatever it takes to tighten the market even if consumption growth slows, helped by U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Brent’s calendar spread for the second half of 2019 has surged into a backwardation of 90 cents per barrel, the strongest for more than three months and a huge swing from a 70 cent contango near the end of last year. For many traders, spreads rather than spot prices are a better indicator of expected balance between production and consumption (“Price relations between July and September Wheat Futures at Chicago”, Working, 1933). Backwardation implies many traders expect the market to be undersupplied in the second half of the year with a significant drawdown in global inventories of crude and fuels. The current swing to backwardation is similar to previous shifts in market structure when OPEC and its allies reduced production in 2017 and the United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran in 2018. Both of those shifts were accelerated and amplified by significant position-building in crude oil by hedge fund managers, and something similar is likely in 2019. Hedge funds and other money managers have been net buyers of Brent crude futures and options in nine of the last 10 weeks with net purchases equivalent to 130 million barrels (tmsnrt.rs/2TZZN0D). Fund managers have almost doubled their bullish position in Brent to 266 million barrels, up from just 136 million barrels in early December, according to position records published by ICE Futures Europe. Position-building has been very similar to previous episodes, but total positions are still well below previous peaks of 500-600 million barrels, suggesting it could still have some way to run. Like other financial traders, hedge funds and other money managers tend to concentrate their positions in nearby futures contracts where there is more liquidity. Hedge fund buying is therefore lifting the price of nearby contracts and accelerating the shift into backwardation (just as fund selling depressed nearby contracts and accelerated the shift to contango in the fourth quarter). Traders have become relatively bullish on oil even as they maintain a more defensive position in equities and bonds, suggesting oil prices are being lifted by idiosyncratic factors. Brent has continued to march steadily into deeper backwardation even as the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield curve has remained close to flat and major U.S. equity indices have moved sideways. Traders seem increasingly confident Saudi Arabia’s output cut coupled with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela will push the market into deficit, especially in the second half, when consumption is normally higher. The market is expected to be undersupplied despite a slowdown in consumption growth this year and poor compliance with the production agreement by other countries in the enlarged OPEC+ group of exporters. In effect, hedge fund managers are gambling on Saudi Arabia’s determination to tighten the market and lift prices plus a relatively tough sanctions policy from the White House to counteract weakness from other sources. If the U.S. economy slows and the Federal Reserve responds by trimming interest rates, the resulting decline in the dollar would also be supportive for oil prices, provided the slowdown is not too deep or too long. The investment narrative is drawing strong interest from fund buyers even as investors remain more neutral in other asset classes. The principal risks are a deeper and more prolonged slowdown in global growth; a more dovish approach to sanctions from the White House; or renewed criticism about rising prices from the U.S. president. The White House has so far been relatively quiet about rising oil prices, but that might change if they rise above $75, the level that provoked a flurry of presidential tweets in 2018. Until then, oil traders seem convinced the oil market will continue to tighten.

2019-02-22,"BEIJING, Feb 22 (Reuters) - China sees “enormous potential” in Saudi Arabia’s economy and wants more high-tech cooperation, the Chinese government’s top diplomat said, as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman began a two-day trip to Beijing. The Saudi delegation, including top executives from Aramco, arrived on Thursday on an Asia tour that has already seen the kingdom pledge investment of $20 billion in Pakistan and seek additional investment in India’s refining industry. The crown prince will meet President Xi Jinping, who has made stepping up China’s presence in the Middle East a key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role there. Meeting Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, State Councillor Wang Yi said the main features of their ties were respect, understanding and support for each other, China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement late on Thursday. “All countries in the world have the right to develop, and Saudi Arabia is an emerging market country with enormous potential,” the ministry paraphrased Wang as saying. China supports Saudi’s efforts to diversify its economy and is willing to strengthen high-tech cooperation, Wang added. Saudi Aramco, the world’s top oil exporter, will sign a pact to build a refinery and petrochemical project in northeastern Liaoning province in a joint venture with China’s defence conglomerate Norinco, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. The investments could help Saudi Arabia regain its place as the top oil exporter to China, a position Russia has held for the last three years. Saudi Aramco is set to boost market share by signing supply deals with non-state Chinese refiners. China has had to step carefully in relations with Riyadh, since Beijing also has close ties with Saudi regional foe Iran. On Wednesday, Xi told the speaker of Iran’s parliament that China’s desire to develop close ties with Iran would stay unaltered, regardless of the global situation. China is also wary of criticism from Muslim countries about its camps in the heavily-Muslim far western region of Xinjiang, which the government says are for de-radicalisation purposes and rights groups call internment camps. Wang said both countries face the threats of terrorism and extremism, and should strengthen cooperation to safeguard security and stability. China was not seeking to play politics in the Middle East, the widely-read state-run tabloid, the Global Times, said in an editorial on Friday. “China won’t be a geopolitical player in the Middle East. It has no enemies and can cooperate with all countries in the region,” said the paper, published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily. “China’s increasing influence in the Middle East comes from pure friendly cooperation. Such a partnership will be welcomed by more countries in the Middle East.” (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/asia-saudi-china/china-sees-enormous-potential-in-saudi-economy-as-crown-prince-visits-idUKL3N20H05S,22 Feb 2019,"China sees ""enormous potential""

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $56.85 per barrel at 0010 GMT, down 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA reached 12 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday in a weekly report. That means U.S. crude output has soared by almost 2.5 million bpd since the start of 2018, and by a whopping 5 million bpd since 2013. America is the only country to reach 12 million bpd of production. As output surges, U.S. oil stocks are also rising. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA rose by 3.7 million barrels in the week ending Feb. 15, to 454.5 million barrels, the EIA said. Analysts say U.S. oil firms will export more oil to sell off surplus stocks. “The continued surge in U.S. production stands as a bearish dynamic for market prices, especially as increasing volumes get sold abroad in a direct challenge to Saudi Arabia and Russia,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. For now, at least, the price dips have halted a rally that pushed crude to 2019 highs this week amid supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC and some non-affiliated producers such as Russia agreed late last year to cut output by 1.2 million bpd to prevent a large supply overhang from growing. Another price driver has been U.S. sanctions against oil exporters Iran and Venezuela.

2019-02-22,"LONDON, Feb 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From homeowners facing higher flood insurance premiums to investors putting money into coal-fired power plants, financial risks related to climate change are growing, analysts say. But working out how a switch to lower-carbon train travel could affect an airline, or what an insurance firm should do to weather more flood claims is neither clear nor simple, they say. Help may be at hand, however, from guides published on Friday to assess financial risks from the physical threats of climate change, as well as the risks and opportunities of a global transition away from fossil fuels. “What is the exposure financial institutions have to natural catastrophes? I don’t think that question traditionally has been asked,” said Greg Lowe, global head of resilience and sustainability for Aon, a London-based insurance and risk firm. For disasters, “there’s always been an assumption we have insurance for that”, said Lowe, whose firm contributed to the reports by ClimateWise, an initiative of the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership that aims to better disclose and respond to climate-related insurance risks. With those risks growing - particularly as heat-trapping emissions continue to rise - traditional methods of dealing with them may not be enough as the world tracks toward 2 degrees Celsius or more of global warming, the twin reports warn. “If indeed people think we’re headed on that path (past 2C), it’s going to be a hugely difficult task for the financial system to manage,” Lowe predicted. Over the next 30 years, the risks from heatwaves, storm surges and floods will increase substantially because of warming already underway, the physical threats report noted. In Britain, that could lead to higher flood insurance premiums and people more often made homeless by floods, as well as greater investment by cities and towns in flood defences. That homeowners understand changing flood risks and will respond adequately to them “is probably a generous assumption”, Lowe said. But even for those who do grasp the shift, simply boosting insurance coverage is unlikely to be an answer, he said. “I don’t think buying more insurance is a politically or financially sustainable thing to do,” he said. “Even with insurance, this is still a tremendous hardship on people if they are out of their homes.” Rather, there should be honest discussions about who foots the bill for the growing risk and damage, he said. “Someone is going to pay for this. How that gets distributed through the financial system is the question,” he added. The new reports aim to demonstrate that it is possible to start taking a more precise look at the risks and their financial impacts, and to give experts tools to do that, said Bronwyn Claire, senior programme manager for ClimateWise. For instance, they could explore how changes in transport demand between trains and planes, or a carbon tax that is influencing fuel prices might affect an airport in Germany. The guides could also help investors spot opportunities, she added. (Reporting by Laurie Goering @lauriegoering; editing by Megan Rowling.
