2018-05-29,"(Repeats story first published on Tuesday, no change to text) * Harbour Energy pursued Santos for a year, raising bid 5 times * Discussions cordial but Santos unyielding on seeking big premium * Santos balked at hedging requirements for debt-heavy deal By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, May 29 (Reuters) - Blame it on Trump, Iran or Venezuela. Rising oil prices combined with a heavy debt load killed the world’s biggest private equity oil and gas industry deal last week. Harbour Energy left Australia empty-handed after a year of chasing gas producer Santos Ltd, missing out on Santos’ stakes in three liquefied natural gas projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea as it sought to become a major LNG player. The U.S. firm, backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, was forced to bid against itself five times, including twice over one weekend, until it made a final offer of $10.8 billion, up more than 50 percent from its first approach last August. “The grievance runs deep and it’s heartfelt,” said a person in the Harbour camp. Harbour Chief Executive Linda Cook, a former senior executive at Royal Dutch Shell, was on a plane last Tuesday when she heard Santos had rejected its sixth offer, worth about A$6.95 a share. She declined to comment for this story. Harbour’s disappointed chairman, Blair Thomas, was already back in Washington, DC, and didn’t mince words. “There was insufficient engagement with Santos on valuation, no meaningful attempt by Santos to discuss a realistic price which could supported by any reasonable set of technical and commercial assumptions, and an unwillingness by their Board to explore means of closing the gap between the offer and their expectations,” he said in a two-page statement. Thomas believed by the end of a weekend of back and forth between advisers on both sides that he had a deal with Santos Chairman Keith Spence, a person in the Harbour camp said. Harbour’s team were parked in Sydney, where Harbour’s backer EIG has an office and advisers at JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Highbury are based, according to people involved. “A couple of hundred” people were involved in analysing data and conducting due diligence, they said. Cook and Thomas met Kevin Gallagher and Keith Spence, their counterparts at Adelaide-based Santos, on May 18. They felt encouraged the board would facilitate an offer going to shareholders, people in the Harbour camp said. People on both sides said talks were cordial the whole time, but the Santos board was firm on value, and Harbour failed to offer enough of a premium as oil prices marched higher. Crude prices climbed from around $52 a barrel when Harbour made its first approach in August to $80 last week, their highest since late 2014, as U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Venezuela and pulled out of a nuclear arms control deal with Iran, both key oil producers. What hurt Harbour was the $7.75 billion in debt they had lined up from JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, which required oil price hedging against 30 percent of Santos’ oil-linked LNG sales, making the deal complex, Santos, investors and bankers said. “The problem is when you get high-leverage deals there are a lot of terms and conditions you have to meet and it makes it inflexible,” said a veteran Australian investment banker not involved in the bid. Santos balked when Harbour tried to force the company to lock in the hedges, in order to cut costs for the banks and allow Harbour to raise its offer. Santos said it was “resilient” to the oil price fall, as it has slashed costs to be cash flow breakeven at $36 a barrel. The value of the Harbour bid was “simply not compelling enough” compared with Santos’ own growth plan, the risks associated with the hedging and the reliance on Santos’ balance sheet to help fund the deal, a Santos spokeswoman said. Not only was Harbour jilted at the altar, but the biggest shareholders in Santos, Chinese gas distributor ENN Ecological and private equity firm Hony Capital missed out on more than doubling their combined stake to up to 40 percent in a privatised Santos. Sources said ENN and Hony were as furious as Harbour. “They’re deeply disappointed and angry and frustrated,” a person close to ENN said. “They feel that the outcome didn’t reflect some of the conversations with senior Santos people.” However in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange last week, ENN, which has a director on the board of Santos, said: “The company’s future cooperation with Santos is not affected.” A Santos spokeswoman said ENN is part of a united Santos board, and the company’s strategic relationship with ENN and Hony remains in place. Hony said it “will closely follow the further development”. Swiss energy and commodities trader Mercuria, which was set to contribute 10 percent of the bid, was thwarted in its ambition to use Santos to get into LNG trading, where its rivals Glencore, Gunvor, Trafigura and Vitol are already active. “A lot of time and money went into this...so it is annoying,” said a person familiar with Mercuria’s thinking. Mecuria declined to comment. Harbour’s first approach last August was swiftly rejected by the board under then-chairman Peter Coates, who had also rebuffed a $5.1 billion takeover offer two years earlier when Santos was wallowing in debt as oil prices collapsed. The August approach was only disclosed by Santos in November after a newspaper outed Harbour. It took Harbour until March to line up funding from JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley and equity from Mercuria, ENN and Hony in order to make another approach. Top 10 shareholder Argo Investments said the deal was too complex and would have involved Santos taking on too much risk when there was a lot of uncertainty around whether it would be approved. Shareholders have faith in CEO Gallagher, who slashed costs and cut debt faster than expected over the past two years. “It’s fair to say that he’s done a pretty good job,” said Argo Investments Managing Director Jason Beddow. “The proof will be in the pudding as to how Santos looks in a year or two’s time - which is somewhat dependent on the oil price.” (Reporting by Sonali Paul.

2018-05-29,"OTTAWA/WINNIPEG (Reuters) - Canada will buy Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s (KML.TO) Trans Mountain pipeline for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion), the government said on Tuesday, hoping to save a project that faces formidable political and environmental opposition.  Finance Minister Bill Morneau said purchasing the pipeline was the only way to ensure that a planned expansion could proceed. The pipeline, running from the oil sands of Alberta to a port in the Pacific province of British Columbia, would allow Canadian crude to gain greater access to foreign markets and higher prices. Kinder Morgan Canada gave Ottawa until May 31 to come up with reassurances it could press ahead with plans to more than double the capacity of the existing pipeline amid efforts by British Columbia to block construction.      The company also faced opposition from environmentalists and aboriginal groups who worried about the pipeline spilling its tar-like heavy oil.  “When we are faced with an exceptional situation that puts jobs at risk, that puts our international reputation on the line, our government is prepared to take action,” Morneau told reporters. He said the pipeline purchase provided the federal jurisdiction needed to overcome British Columbia’s opposition, but gave no details of how this would work. The federal government can in theory step in and disallow any provincial laws that British Columbia might use to block the pipeline, but this provision in the Canadian constitution has not been used since the 1940s.  Ottawa could also deploy the police and troops to maintain a barrier between protesters and construction workers. Although Ottawa has taken stakes in struggling energy projects, Tuesday’s announcement marked the first time Ottawa has bought an entire pipeline. It does not intend to own the project for long. “There is a very strong business case for this pipeline,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Bloomberg Television, saying the government takeover meant “a lot of the legal barriers and a lot of the challenge points actually disappear”. Kinder Morgan Canada shares initially jumped as much as 8.5 percent before ending down 3 percent, while the broader Canada share index fell 0.6 percent. The move drew immediate criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, and could hurt Trudeau’s popularity in the key British Columbia battleground in a 2019 federal election. The decision represents “a massive, unnecessary financial burden on Canadian taxpayers,” Canadian Taxpayers Federation Federal Director Aaron Wudrick said.    The government will also offer federal loan guarantees to ensure construction of the expansion continues through the 2018 season as part of the deal with the company, a unit of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N). Morneau sidestepped questions about how Ottawa will deal with opposition from environmentalists and aboriginal groups, who cite the risk of a catastrophic spill. “It’s a mess out there,” said a Calgary industry source not authorized to speak publicly. “Given it will be stuck in court for a while, I don’t think we will see this pipe built anytime soon.” Morneau said more spending would be needed to complete the expansion, but gave no precise financial details, and stressed he felt the project should be returned to the private sector. Canada’s oil sector has been stung in the past year as foreign energy companies retreated amid concerns about the environmental toll, high production costs and a risky regulatory regime.  “We have agreed to a fair price for our shareholders,” said Steve Kean, chief executive officer of Kinder Morgan Canada and Kinder Morgan Inc. Kean did not say why he decided to sell rather than absorb the risk of further delays. Kinder Morgan Canada will continue to own the remaining assets, including crude storage, rail terminals and a condensate pipeline, and look to expand. “I think the transaction is a win-win. It’s actually better for Kinder Morgan than it is for Canada. They are getting a very good value,” said Paul Bloom at Bloom Investment Counsel Inc, which owns about 300,000 shares in Kinder Morgan Canada. The fact the federal government needed to buy Trans Mountain to ensure the project goes ahead does not bode well for the industry, said Chris Bloomer, CEO of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association.  Trans Mountain stirred an unusual public fight between neighboring provinces. Alberta threatened to halt crude and fuel shipments to British Columbia, where consumers already pay high gasoline prices, and briefly halted imports of the coastal province’s wines. Alberta will contribute up to C$2 billion toward unforeseen costs, payable once the project is complete, Premier Rachel Notley said. The contribution will convert into equity in the pipeline. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said the province would push ahead with a court case to establish its right to restrict increased shipments of crude oil to its coastal waters.

Updates shares) OSLO, May 29 (Reuters) - Norway’s BW LPG, the world’s largest liquid petroleum gas shipper, said on Tuesday it had offered to buy competitor Dorian LPG in a $1.1 billion all-stock deal in an effort to boost its earnings in a weak market. Dorian shareholders will receive 2.05 BW LPG shares for each Dorian share, equal to $7.86 per share, a premium of 13 percent from Friday’s closing price, and based on BW LPG’s share price on May 28. Shares of Dorian closed 5.2 percent higher at $7.32, its best day since December 2017. In a separate statement, Dorian confirmed BW LPG’s “unsolicited proposal”, adding that its board was reviewing the offer. New York-listed Dorian LPG’s equity is valued at about $441 million and including debt the transaction is valued at $1.1 billion. The deal is backed by shipping conglomerate BW Group, owned by the Hong Kong-based Sohmen-Pao family, which owns 14.2 percent of Dorian and about 45 percent of BW LPG. Dorian LPG’s fleet consists of 22 very large gas carriers (VLGC) and the combined company would own 73 vessels, of which 68 would be very large gas carriers, 2 VLGCs currently under order and 3 large gas carriers if the deal goes through. BW LPG said it expected minimum annual savings of $15 million from the deal.

2018-05-29,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s decision on Tuesday to buy a troubled oil pipeline is a big risk that could cost Prime Minister Justin Trudeau important voter support in a major province, but insiders say failure to act decisively to boost energy exports might hurt his chances to win re-election in 2019. Trudeau’s Liberal government said it will buy Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s (KML.TO) Trans Mountain pipeline for C$4.5 billion (£2.6 billion) in hopes of saving a project that faces major political and environmental opposition.  “I think this could end up being the biggest gamble of his mandate,” said pollster Nik Nanos, noting Trudeau came to power in late 2015 promising to do more for the environment. “This is a very risky political move in terms of the prime minister’s personal brand and the brand of the Liberal party, but weighed against the needs of the economy, the Liberals probably see this as a necessary move.” Liberal insiders hope the move will help dispel criticism that Trudeau dithers on big issues, ditching some campaign promises and consulting endlessly on others with little actual achievement after three years in office. Party operatives dispute that Trudeau has frittered away his time in power but they concede the accusations of inaction are taking a toll. The main opposition Conservative party is becoming more competitive in polls, and even took the lead in one Nanos Research survey released on Tuesday, which showed Conservatives at 36 percent public support and the Liberals at 33 percent. “It is better in this case to take action - even if it turns out to be the wrong choice - than do nothing,” said a well-placed Liberal source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Trans Mountain runs from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific province of British Columbia, and a planned expansion is a centrepiece of Trudeau’s energy policy and key to helping meet carbon emission agreements.  Opposition is fierce in British Columbia, where the Liberals won an unexpectedly large number of seats in 2015, yet Trudeau says the expansion must go ahead so exporters can ship oil to global markets.    Senior Liberals play down the chances of a political massacre in the 2019 election, noting recent polls show a slim majority of people in British Columbia back the pipeline. The pipeline’s biggest supporters are in western provinces like Alberta where Liberals traditionally do poorly.         The government has “staked so much on this that if they don’t come out with a deal of some sort, that will be highly problematic for them politically,” said Monica Gattinger, director of the Institute for Science, Society and Policy at the University of Ottawa.  The Liberals, who promise to balance the needs of the natural resources industry with the environment, blocked one proposed pipeline to the Pacific coast in 2016. The proponents behind a similar line to the Atlantic pulled out in 2017 after the national energy regulator imposed more conditions.

2018-05-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A spiralling Italian political crisis provoked a global stock market sell-off on Tuesday, cut the euro to a 10-month low and spiked borrowing costs for the government in Rome. Investors fear that repeat elections - which now seem likely in the euro zone’s third-largest economy as soon as July - may become a de-facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc and the country’s role in the European Union. Safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds and German bunds rallied, as did the Japanese yen, the U.S. dollar and gold by midday in the U.S. trading day. Oil sank further from the near-four-year highs set earlier in the month. That all weighed on already embattled emerging markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 391.64 points, or 1.58 percent, to 24,361.45, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 31.47 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,689.86 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 37.26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,396.59. “As part of the overall narrative of cautionary situations and risks that the market needs to worry about, this could potentially become cause for contagion,” said Wasif Latif, head of global multi-assets for USAA Asset Management Co. “What once seemed like a synchronized global economic recovery is now a waning growth story.” Italy seems likely to repeat elections soon after its prime minister-designate, Carlo Cottarelli, failed to secure support from major political parties for even a stop-gap government, sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Italy has searched for a new government since inconclusive elections in March, and investors fear voters will choose leaders hoping to break with the continent’s austere fiscal policy approach and even the multinational euro currency that replaced the lira in 2002. “As the slide continues, you ask where is the end,” said John Hardy, Saxo Bank’s head of foreign-exchange strategy. “If this continues for another couple of sessions, I think you will have to see some official response. A ‘whatever it takes’ kind of moment,” he said. Facing a sovereign debt crisis, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised in a legendary 2012 speech to “whatever it takes” to keep the single currency intact. Short-dated Italian bond yields IT2YT=RR - a sensitive gauge of political risk - soared 1.5 percentage points from Monday to their highest since 2013 in their biggest move in nearly 26 years. Tradeweb Markets LLC reported average trading volume in the debt is up by more than 60 percent in May compared to the month prior. The euro fell against the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and U.S. dollar, nearing $1.15 EUR= and touching its lowest point since July. Stocks in Milan .FTMIB slid 2.7 percent in their fifth straight day of losses. Bank shares there .FTIT8300 fell 4.7 percent, bruised by the sell-off in government bonds, a core part of bank portfolios. Adding to the uncertainty in Europe, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will face a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday.  Spain's bond-yield spread with Germany also went to its widest this year at nearly 1.35 percentage points ES10YT=RR and Madrid's IBEX bourse .IBEX closed down 2.5 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 1.3 percent. Away from Europe, the focus was on the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and on the U.S.-China trade relationship. An aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, and the White House said a “pre-advance” team was travelling to the city to meet the North Koreans. The reports indicate that planning for the summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead even though U.S. President Donald Trump called it off last week. A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details. Asia flinched. Japan's Nikkei .N225 slipped 0.6 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.9 percent lower. The United States also said on Tuesday that it would continue pursuing action on trade with China, days after Washington and Beijing announced a tentative solution to their dispute and suggested that tensions had cooled. In the United States, volatility .VIX leapt and bank stocks .SPSY withered. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose in price to yield 2.786 percent, from 2.935 percent late on Friday. Spot gold XAU= added 0.2 percent to $1,299.85 an ounce. Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF lost 1.2 percent, marking a new low point for the year, under continued pressure from a rising U.S. dollar for countries that often borrow in that currency. The greenback is poised to turn in its best monthly performance against a basket of trading partners’ currencies .DXY since 2015. Oil struggled under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran, even as U.S. output has surged in recent years. Rising U.S. oil supplies have helped pushed the spread between Brent and U.S. crude CL-LCO1=R to nearly $9 a barrel, its widest since March 2015 because of the depressed price of U.S. crude compared with Brent. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 1.56 percent to $66.82 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was at $75.50.

2018-05-29,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures fell more than $1 on Tuesday on worries that Saudi Arabia and Russia will pump more crude to boost supplies after more than a year of reducing worldwide inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.15 to settle at $66.73 a barrel, a 1.7 percent loss. Brent crude LCOc1 futures settled up 9 cents to $75.39 a barrel. Saudi Arabia and Russia have discussed raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil production by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran. Ahead of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ meeting on June 22, concerns that Saudi Arabia and Russia could increase output have exerted downward pressure on oil prices.     “Market participants remain unsure how quickly an exit strategy can be implemented and whether it will go beyond just balancing the output drop from Venezuela,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.  Credit Suisse analysts on Tuesday said even if Russia and OPEC producers raise output, they would likely only add an additional 500,000 bpd, which would leave inventories in the most developed countries short of the five-year average by the end of 2018. Brent has fallen about 6 percent since hitting $80.50 on May 17, its highest since 2014. Falling stocks and a stronger U.S. dollar index also weighed on prices. U.S. stock markets sank more than 1 percent, while the dollar gained about 0.7 percent. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. “There is a risk-off trade today where we have seen people going back into dollar assets and less so in the stock market,” said Brian Kessens, portfolio manager and managing director at Tortoise in Leawood, Kansas. Hedge funds and other money managers reduced their net long position in Brent and WTI by 169 million barrels over the five weeks to May 22, suggesting unease about the rally's strength. (tmsnrt.rs/2LBbW8l). Brent now commands its largest premium over U.S. futures in more than three years, meaning U.S. exports are rapidly becoming far more competitive globally than those from northern Europe, Russia or parts of the Middle East. The spread between Brent and U.S. crude CL-LCO1=R hit $9.38 on Monday in thin holiday volumes, widest since March 2015. U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has surged by more than 20 percent in the past two years to 10.7 million bpd.

2018-05-29,"(Reuters) - Alberto, the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season,  spawned scattered flooding in Alabama as it weakened into a subtropical depression on Tuesday, a day after two journalists were killed in North Carolina when a tree fell on their car. In Maryland, searchers on Monday found the body of a man swept away when a flash flood triggered by a separate storm tore through the main street of a historic town. Near hurricane-force winds from Alberto dropped to about 30 miles per hour (48 km per hour) as it lost strength while crossing the Gulf of Mexico and making landfall in the U.S. South, the National Weather Service said. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) canceled coastal warnings and watches for the storm, which spun up days before the formal start of the hurricane season on June 1. Local media in Alabama and the Florida Panhandle reported scattered flash flooding, downed trees and minor power outages as Alberto rumbled north. About half of Alabama’s 67 counties were under a flash flood watch.  Alberto was forecast to weaken to a “remnant low pressure” system by Tuesday evening as it moves into the Tennessee Valley and then the Ohio Valley, the weather service said. The NHC warned the storm would dump rains of 2-6 inches (6-15 cm), with up to 12 inches over north Florida and Alabama through Tuesday night. It could deliver up to 6 inches of rain in some areas as it moves toward lower Michigan by Wednesday evening, officials said.  Karen Clark & Co, a risk-modeling firm, on Tuesday estimated the insured losses from Alberto at $50 million. In Maryland, searchers found the body of Eddison Hermond, 39, who was swept away by a torrent of water in historic Ellicott City on Sunday, the Howard County Police Department said on Twitter. Hermond was swept up as he tried to help a shop owner who had escaped flood waters with her cat, police said. The flooding was the second time Ellicott City had been devastated by high water in two years. Two television journalists covering the worsening weather in North Carolina were killed on Monday by a falling tree that struck their car. Anchor Mike McCormick and camera operator Aaron Smeltzer from Greenville, South Carolina’s, WYFF News were on Highway 176 when the tree came down after heavy rains saturated the ground, police said. After Alberto’s passage, Royal Dutch Shell Plc was sending workers back to the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Chevron Corp restored some production on Monday. Four deadly hurricanes struck the United States last year, killing at least 144 people and causing billions of dollars in damage, massive power outages and devastating hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, according to the NHC.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 493.64 points, or 1.99 percent, to 24,259.45, the S&P 500 lost 43.1 points, or 1.58 percent, to 2,678.23 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 66.34 points, or 0.89 percent, to 7,367.51. “As part of the overall narrative of cautionary situations and risks that the market needs to worry about this could potentially become cause for contagion,” said Wasif Latif, head of global multi-assets for USAA Asset Management Co. “What once seemed like a synchronized global economic recovery is now a waning growth story.” Italy seems likely to repeat elections soon after its prime minister-designate, Carlo Cottarelli, failed to secure any support from major political parties for even a stop-gap government, sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Italy has searched for a new government since inconclusive elections in March, and investors fear voters will choose a party hoping to break with the continent’s austere fiscal policy approach and even the multinational euro currency that replaced the lira in 2002. “As the slide continues, you ask where is the end,” said John Hardy, Saxo Bank’s head of foreign-exchange strategy. “If this continues for another couple of sessions, I think you will have to see some official response. A ‘whatever it takes’ kind of moment,” he said. Facing a sovereign debt crisis, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised in a legendary 2012 speech to “whatever it takes” to keep the single currency intact. Short-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - soared 1.5 percentage points from Monday to their highest since 2013 in their biggest move in nearly 26 years. Tradeweb Markets LLC reported average trading volume in the debt is up by more than 60 percent in May compared to the month prior. The euro fell against the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and U.S. dollar, nearing $1.15 and touching its lowest point since July. Stocks in Milan slid 2.65 percent in their fifth straight day of losses. Bank shares slid 4.73 percent, bruised by the sell-off in government bonds, a core part of bank portfolios. Adding to the uncertainty in Europe, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will face a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday. Spain’s bond-yield spread with Germany also went to its widest this year at nearly 135 basis points and Madrid’s IBEX bourse closed down 2.5 percent . The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 1.4 percent. Away from Europe, the focus was on the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and on the  U.S.-China trade relationship. An aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, and the White House said a “pre-advance” team was travelling to the city to meet the North Koreans. The reports indicate that planning for the summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead even though President Donald Trump called it off last week. A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details. Asia flinched. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.93 percent lower. In the United States, volatility leapt and bank stocks withered. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 45/32 in price to yield 2.772 percent, from 2.935 percent late on Friday. Spot gold added 0.4 percent to $1,303.00 an ounce. Emerging market stocks lost 1.28 percent, marking a new low point for the year under continued pressure from a rising U.S. dollar for countries that often borrow in that currency. The dollar is poised to turn in its best monthly performance against a basket of trading partners’ currencies since 2015. Oil struggled under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil, even as U.S. output rises. That has pushed the spread between Brent and U.S. crude CL-LCO1=R to nearly $9 a barrel, its widest since March 2015 because of the depressed price of U.S. crude compared with Brent. U.S. crude fell 1.74 percent to $66.70 per barrel and Brent was at $75.38. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

2018-05-29,"TORONTO, May 29 (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest public pension funds could be long-term buyers of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain pipeline but are unlikely to invest until the C$7.4 billion ($5.7 billion) project has been built, several pension fund sources said on Tuesday. The Canadian government said on Tuesday it will buy the Trans Mountain assets for C$4.5 billion, hoping to salvage a project that faces formidable political and environmental opposition. The pipeline is intended to move Canadian crude to ports in the Vancouver area for shipment to foreign markets. Although the federal government has taken stakes in other struggling energy projects, Tuesday’s announcement marked the first time it is being an entire pipeline, and Ottawa said it does not want to hold the asset for the long term. Frank McKenna, Toronto-Dominion Bank’s deputy chairman and a former New Brunswick premier, said he expected pension funds and private equity players to be interested in the asset as well as other pipeline or infrastructure players. “I think there will be a lot of private sector interest in this project once the political risk is taken out of it. These are very desirable assets. They pay good economic rents and they’re long-life assets,” he said. TD is the biggest lender to the project. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Canada’s biggest public pension plan, said on Tuesday it was “not actively assessing an investment in the extension opportunity.” The Canadian government could bring in partners to help finance the expansion, according to pension fund sources. However, it is unlikely to do so through its Infrastructure Bank, set up last year to facilitate public-private partnerships but not yet operational, they said. Canadian pension funds have a long-held preference for buying assets that are already built rather than those with construction risks, and the reputational risk associated with the project could also be a turnoff. With that in mind, pension fund sources said the federal government may have to hold the asset for a number of years to eventually attract the best price and give it the best chance to recover money for taxpayers, or even make a profit. Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, Canada’s second biggest public pension and Kinder Morgan Canada’s biggest independent shareholder, has shown the most appetite for financing the construction of new infrastructure among Canada’s biggest pension plans.

2018-05-29,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Brazil’s government are “very close” to resolving a long-running dispute over an oil-rich offshore area, a deputy minister said, dismissing concerns a fuel pricing crisis had emerged as an obstacle in talks. On Sunday, Brazilian President Michel Temer offered new fuel subsidies to soften the blow from a run-up in diesel prices that has sparked a nationwide truckers’ protest, paralyzing the country’s economy. His government also promised to compensate Petrobras for losses it may incur by abandoning a market-focused pricing policy.  The offers of the subsidies fanned fears among investors that the turmoil could delay Petrobras’ bid to conclude a longstanding compensation dispute with the government over the so-called transfer-of-rights area, dimming hopes for a windfall for the world’s most indebted oil company.  Despite overlapping with the truckers’ strike, talks “were not suspended,” Deputy Mining and Energy Minister Marcio Felix told Reuters late on Monday. “There are just a few sticking points ... They are very close.” Earlier this month, a Brazilian paper reported that Petrobras was likely to get the rights to produce an additional 1 billion to 2 billion barrels of oil to settle the dispute. Resolving the dispute would let the cash-strapped government, which is expected to be ousted in elections in October, raise extra revenue to close a huge budget gap by auctioning off the rights to billions of barrels of oil. Following a resolution of the dispute, Felix said such an auction could still be possible in November, before the current government turns over power to a new president in January.   He emphasized that the goal was shared by Petrobras CEO Pedro Parente, who has been rumored to be considering resigning from the company he is credited with turning around after a massive corruption scandal and years of mismanagement. “Transfer-of rights would be a crowning achievement for him after two years in management,” Felix said, adding that “it would not be good for him to leave now.” The dispute has its roots in a 2010 deal under which Brazil’s government granted Petrobras rights to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas from under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor for a price based on oil prices then.  However, the contract stipulated that costs, among other things, would be reviewed after the area was declared commercially viable in 2014. That has led to years of sparring, as oil prices have fluctuated.  Oil executives say a bid round for the remaining areas would draw enormous bids, thanks to top notch geology and lack of risk.

2018-05-29,"(Reuters) - SandRidge Energy Inc (SD.N) warned shareholders on Tuesday they would be handing control of the company too cheaply to activist investor Carl Icahn if they elect his new nominees to the board at an annual meeting next month.  Icahn earlier in May added two more nominees to his slate, demanding yet more influence after the company expanded its board to seven directors from five to accommodate the activist investor’s demands. In a letter to shareholders, SandRidge Chief Executive Officer William Griffin said the billionaire investor, who has said he could make an all-cash offer for the company, was not competing “fairly with other potential counterparties”. An Icahn-led board would “likely have a chilling effect on the participation of potential counterparties because such a process would be rigged in favor of Icahn,” Griffin said. Icahn has made a career out of shaking up company management and, as the biggest shareholder in SandRidge with a 13.6 percent stake, he has already forced the resignation of both its chief executive and chief financial officers. SandRidge’s shares, however, have fallen more than 15 percent since Icahn disclosed his stake on Nov. 21 and the jury is still out on how new management - or sales of company assets - would deliver more value to shareholders.  A slump in oil prices and its exposure to costly production in the Mississippi Lime forced the Oklahoma City-based oil producer briefly into bankruptcy proceedings in 2016. Oil prices have since recovered to $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014 and shale producers in the United States have benefited from cheaper drilling methods and ever increasing global demand. The question is whether SandRidge now has a better spread of drilling sites to take advantage of the rise.  David Beard, analyst at Coker Palmer Institutional said while short-term investors often penalize the valuations of companies with current, declining production, Icahn is betting on SandRidge’s undrilled locations in the hope that those will bring the production levels up.   “SD operates in a relatively higher cost Mississippi Lime basin, thus the downturn hurt them particularly hard, having to drop almost all their rigs. This placed downward pressure on production,” Beard said. “But should production grow and undrilled locations become valuable, we can see net asset values approach ~$50/sh.” Icahn initially persuaded SandRidge’s leadership to back out of a $746 million deal with rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc (BCEI.N) but he has now spent months laying into its management.  In April, the billionaire nominated Jonathan Frates and Nicholas Graziano - both of whom work for Icahn companies - to SandRidge’s board.  The other three nominees are John Lipinski and Bob Alexander who have worked with refining company CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N) and Randolph Read, who has worked with investment fund Nevada Strategic Credit Investment. Ahead of the June 19 shareholders meeting, Griffin said Icahn’s continuous additions to the board would “end the impartial process, drive away competition and position Icahn to consolidate control as cheaply as possible”. Icahn’s involvement and pressuring of Newell Brands Inc NWL.N to appoint four of his nominees to its board ran parallel to the company’s shares recovering some of last year’s almost 50 percent loss. They have since retreated to back to near record lows.  Icahn’s move with fellow shareholder Darwin Deason to prevent Xerox Corp (XRX.N) merging with Fujifilm Holdings (4901.T) have seen shares in the photocopying icon fall around 25 percent from a 3-year high hit when the deal was announced in January.

2018-05-29,"LONDON, May 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sitting in straight rows on the floor, supping on bowls of soup made from foraged nettles and home-grown vegetable stew, a group of London Muslims are breaking with Ramadan tradition. The evening meal known as iftar breaks the fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and is often associated with environmentally-unfriendly excess, with tables groaning under the weight of heavy meat dishes. Here though, the emphasis is on ethically-sourced, seasonal food - no meat and no dairy - while plastic forks and straws and disposable plates are nowhere to be seen. “This ethical iftar is about looking particularly at key issues around meat consumption during Ramadan, food waste during Ramadan and plastic waste ... We wanted to do an iftar plan that had none of those things,” said organiser Jumana Moon. “It’s about trying to reconnect our responsibility to nature as part of our worship not a separate hobby or interest,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Participants in the event at Rumi’s Cave, a London venue that hosts courses for millennial Muslims and open-mic nights, had to bring their own cutlery and crockery, as well as containers for leftovers. Wherever possible, the food was locally sourced - including the nettles used to make the classic British soup, which grow in the wild, and the home-grown vegetables. There were readings from the Quran that focused on the importance of caring for the environment, while the seeds from the dates that are traditionally used to break the fast were collected for replanting or composting. Participant Sohaib Elnahla said the green iftar underscored the importance in Islam of eating food that was sustainable and wholesome. “If mosques all did a green iftar it would have a massive impact on the practices,” said Elnahla, a prayer leader and teacher. John Parry, a Christian minister who attended the iftar event, said it offered a vital message for people of all faiths. “We have thought of ourselves as human beings that can do what we want with creation when in fact, we’re given god-given responsibilities to look after creation and not to abuse it,” he said. “It’s a message that is absolutely vital in this day and age.” Piles of left-over food and plastic plates often spill out of bins at the end of iftar meals, said Moon who organised the event with The Rabbani Project, a creative collective, who hoped the event would also raise awareness about limiting food waste. Traditional practices such as eating from shared plates or with hands to using clay cups and wooden spoons could all be revived, she said. “I’d love to see us as individuals, families and organisations doing a kind of ‘green audit’ in our personal lives as well as our public lives.” Reporting by Adela Suliman, Editing by Claire Cozens.

2018-05-29,"NEW DELHI, May 29 (Reuters) - Two Indian banks have asked exporters to complete their financial transactions with Iran by August in response to the threat of new U.S. sanctions, according to the country’s main exporters’ organisation and bank letters seen by Reuters. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month pulled out of the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions. India and Iran have long-standing political and commercial ties, but New Delhi has been careful to not fall foul of U.S. sanctions on Iran. The Federation of Indian Exporters Organisation (FIEO) said IndusInd and UCO, the two banks facilitating exports to Iran, had set August 6. as the deadline for winding up deals. “IndusInd and UCO bank are telling exporters that you complete all Iran business by August 6,” Ajay Sahai, director general of FIEO, told Reuters. Indian exporters mostly receive payments in rupees for exports to Iran, under a mechanism devised in 2012 when banking channels were restricted due to the U.S. sanctions. India, Iran’s top oil customer after China, had implemented a barter-like scheme that allowed it to make some oil payments to Tehran in rupees through UCO Bank. IndusInd Bank in a May 24 letter, seen by Reuters, asked Indian exporters to provide a declaration from customers that the entire export LC (letter of credit) transaction would be completed before August 6, 2018. An Indian exporter executing Iranian orders worth 90 million rupees said he was worried because he would get some payments in the second half of August. “How does an exporter feel safe? I don’t know whether I will get my money or not,” said the exporter, who did not wish to be identified. He said payment for an Iranian export order normally takes between one to one-and-a-half months. Indian companies receive payments for exports to Iran using the oil payments held in rupee balances at UCO. The mechanism helped India to narrow its trade deficit with Iran from about $11.3 billion in 2011/12 to about $3.5 billion in 2015/16, when the Iran sanctions were lifted. In the fiscal year to March 2017, India’s trade deficit with Iran widened to $8.24 billion, according to the government data. UCO Bank told the exporter mentioned above that payment would be made only if the Iran account had enough money. “Payments will also be subjected to any trade restrictions/currency restrictions being put in place by U.S.A. post 08-05-2018 and as per the Government of India guidelines on the date of claim,” UCO said in its letter to the exporter dated May 29, which was seen by Reuters. UCO Bank chairman R. K. Takkar told Reuters his bank was continuing with the rupee mechanism. He refused to elaborate on the letter issued by his bank, and said Iran had 18 billion rupees in its account with UCO. Reporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani. Editing

2018-05-29,"KATHMANDU, May 29 (Reuters) - Nepal’s government said on Tuesday it will build a 750 megawatt hydroelectric plant that was earlier cleared to be developed by China’s state-owned Three Gorges International Corp, in a surprise announcement made while laying out the annual budget. “We will mobilize Nepal’s internal resources and build the West Seti hydroelectric project,” the country’s Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada said while unveiling a $12.18 billion annual budget in parliament on Tuesday. The announcement effectively scraps a $1.6 billion plan by the Chinese firm to build the plant on West Seti river in the west of the Himalayan nation, the second such plant to be withdrawn from Chinese builders in six months. Three Gorges, China’s biggest hydropower developer and the operator of the world’s largest hydropower plant at the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river, could not be immediately contacted for comments on Nepal’s decision. In 2015, Nepal cleared the Chinese firm to build the long-delayed West Seti hydropower project that was scheduled for completion by 2021-22.  Power from the facility was to be sold to Nepal which now imports nearly 500 megawatts of electricity from India to offset crippling shortages. According to Nepali officials, work had yet to begin as the Chinese company was haggling with the government for better terms on construction and tariffs. In November last year, Nepal scrapped a $2.5 billion deal with another Chinese company, Gezhouba Group, to build a 1,200 MW hydroelectric plant on the Budhi Gandaki river also in west Nepal. One of the world’s poorest countries, Nepal is opening up its vast hydropower potential to help ease chronic power shortages and develop an economy still emerging from a decade-long civil war and a devastating earthquake that killed 9,000 people in 2015. That has prompted a rush by China and India to invest billions exploiting their neighbour’s rivers. This month, India began the construction of a 900 MW hydro-power project to be built in east Nepal by state-run Indian firm Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) Limited at a cost $1.04 billion during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Nepal. Nepal is estimated to have the potential to generate some 42,000 MW of hydropower, but it currently produces 1,000 MW — less than the demand of about 1,500 MW.

Investors fear that repeat elections - which now seem inevitable in the euro zone’s third-largest economy - may become a de-facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc and the country’s role in the European Union. Safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds rallied, as did the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, but gold was nearly unchanged with spot prices at $1,301.94 an ounce early in U.S. trading after earlier gains. “As the slide continues, you ask where is the end,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy, John Hardy. Global contagion is a risk, he said, with the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stocks index breaching key “technical” support levels. Hardy recalled a promise made in 2012 by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to keep the euro intact. “If this continues for another couple of sessions, I think you will have to see some official (European) response. A ‘whatever it takes’ kind of moment,” he said.

Short-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - soared as much as 150 basis points to their highest since 2013 in their biggest move in 26 years . The euro dropped towards $1.15 for the first time this year, down 0.8 percent on the day. Against the Swiss franc , it fell to 1.15 francs. Stocks in Milan slid 2.3 percent on the main index after a 2.1 percent fall on Monday. Bank shares slumped more than 4 percent after losing the same amount in the previous session, bruised by the sell-off in government bonds, a core part of bank portfolios. Adding to the uncertainty in Europe, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will face a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday. Spain’s bond-yield spread with Germany also went to its widest this year at 132 bps. Madrid’s IBEX bourse was down 2.2 percent. Asia flinched, too. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent. Chinese and Hong Kong shares ended 0.6 to 0.7 percent in the red. The dollar was up against almost all major currencies except the safe-haven Japanese yen. The U.S. currency is heading for its best month since late 2015 - a move that is hurting many emerging market countries that borrow in dollars. “The biggest contributor is fear of a euro zone crisis, and the spillover from that into demand for safe-haven currencies,” said Koon Chow, an FX strategist at UBP. Away from Europe, the focus was on the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and the U.S.-China trade relationship. An aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, and the White House said a “pre-advance” team was travelling to the city to meet the North Koreans. The reports indicate that planning for the summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead even though President Donald Trump called it off last week. A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details. Italian Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli will see the President Sergio Mattarella at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT), the president’s office said in a statement. Mattarella effectively vetoed a coalition government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and League party at the weekend. He has asked Cottarelli to form a stop-gap government to lead the country to early elections instead. Cottarelli is expected to announce his cabinet after the meeting. Oil struggled to rebound to the near-four-year highs it set earlier in the month. Crude is under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil, even as U.S. output rises. That has pushed the spread between Brent and U.S. crude CL-LCO1=R to nearly $9 a barrel, its widest since March 2015 because of the depressed price of U.S. crude compared with Brent. U.S. crude fell 1.87 percent to $66.61 per barrel and Brent was last at $75.42, up 0.13 percent on the day. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

2018-05-29,"(Adds details on work group in fourth paragraph) BRASILIA, May 29 (Reuters) - Brazil’s antitrust regulator on Tuesday laid out a plan to increase competition in the fuels market, which could lower prices in the medium term after a spike that sparked a week-long strike by truckers which roiled Latin America’s largest economy. In a study, the economic department of the Cade regulator and its technical body laid out nine measures that it says could boost competition in a sector often accused of collusion. The proposal includes changes to the tax code and the regulatory framework, such as lifting a ban on direct sales of ethanol from producers to gasoline stations, allowing refineries and distributors to own gas stations and distributors to import fuels. Cade and Brazil’s oil regulator ANP will set up a working group this week, comprising three representatives from each watchdog, to assess the implementation of the nine measures. The plan should decrease local fuel prices in the medium term, the study said, in effect providing a new response to growing calls for government measures to offset rising global prices. The government on Sunday agreed to introduce fuel subsidies and tax cuts as striking truckers demanded. But so far, officials have resisted demands to change state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA’s pricing policy that takes global prices as a benchmark. Cade’s board will meet later on Tuesday to discuss potential actions related to the fuel crisis.

2018-05-29,"PARIS (Reuters) - Rival Libyan factions agreed on Tuesday on a declaration that would create a political framework to pave the way for U.N.-backed elections in December to end the country’s seven-year-old conflict.  The oil-producing nation splintered following the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, and since 2014 has been divided between competing political and military groups based in Tripoli and the east. The United Nations is leading an effort to reunify Libya and to organise national elections. France under President Emmanuel Macron has sought to play a bigger role in coaxing the factions to end the turmoil, which has let Islamist militants gain a foothold and migrant smugglers flourish.  The Paris meeting, included eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, and the leaders of rival parliamentary assemblies, aimed to urge them to agree general principles for ending the conflict and moving towards elections. The four stakeholders said they had agreed on a document to work constructively with the U.N. to realise credible and peaceful elections by Dec. 10 and abide by the results. “Nobody says it will be a path layered with roses. The challenges exist and will continue to grow,” Seraj told a news conference.  “Last month there was a terrorist attack and there are a certain number of enemies to this democratic process.”  The declaration was not signed as originally planned because the parties do not all recognise each other’s legitimacy and want to consult their home base, but they agreed in principle. The eight-point document includes a call for the immediate unification of the central bank and the phasing out of parallel government and institutions. It makes a commitment to support the creation of a national army and encourage a dialogue on the issue in Cairo. The parties committed to set the constitutional basis for elections and to adopt electoral laws by Sept. 16 with a view to holding legislative and presidential elections on Dec. 10.  Libya U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame said he would have his work cut out in the coming weeks, but that he saw a convergence between the will of the Libyan people and the international community. “This convergence must not be lost,” he said. The declaration also agrees to an inclusive political national conference, without setting a timeframe. Unlike an earlier draft, it no longer directly threatens international sanctions on those who impede the accord or dispute the outcome of elections.  Claudia Gazzini, senior Libya analyst for the non-governmental International Crisis Group, said the statement was more nuanced than earlier drafts, but set an “extremely optimistic” timeframe for elections and left unclear how the powers of a future president would be decided. Past attempts at peace deals in Libya have often been scuttled by internal divisions among the country’s armed groups and by the different countries backing the local actors. To tackle that, 20 countries and organisations were represented, including Italy, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Libya’s neighbours, who all have influence over different groups on the ground. “By accepting these dates and a protocol, nobody will be able to say they don’t agree, because (all the protagonists) were here today,” Macron said at the news conference.

2018-05-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss lender Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP) has suspended new transactions with Iran and is winding down Iran-related activities, the latest company to halt business after the United States said it would reimpose sanctions on Tehran.  BCP, founded in 1963, has been among the players active in Iran-related trade finance in commodities, finance sources say. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international  nuclear deal with Iran on May 8 and said he would reimpose  sanctions within 180 days, prompting several European companies to announce they would end business with Tehran. “We have suspended any new transaction related to Iran after May 8, 2018 and started the ‘wind down period’ within the framework of OFAC announcement,” BCP said in a emailed statement to Reuters, referring to the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions enforcement arm.     Geneva-headquartered BCP said following the U.S. decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal that the bank complied with all sanctions in force “and conducts its business accordingly”. Earlier this month, Germany’s No.2 lender DZ Bank said it would halt financial transactions with Iran in July. Finance and trade sources say Iran faces increasing difficulties accessing capital. Transactions had already been constrained as many large foreign banks remained wary of trade even under the nuclear deal.   “The exodus by the limited number of foreign banks willing to process transactions with Iran is a big blow, especially on the trade finance side,” one finance source said.  The 2015 nuclear agreement, worked out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran, lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for limits to its nuclear programme. Tehran is pressuring Europe to come up with a package of economic measures by May 31 after major powers agreed on Friday to move quickly to offset Washington’s withdrawal from the deal. Those measures include banning EU-based firms from complying with the reimposed U.S. sanctions, urging governments to make transfers to Iran’s central bank to avoid fines and creating alternative financing channels. But analysts say there are big challenges to keeping the nuclear deal alive.  “The U.S. sanctions will make Iran’s business environment more difficult to operate in,” BMI Research said in a note last week. “Firms that ... have exposure to the U.S. market are therefore unlikely to want to maintain or expand their Iranian presence for fear of U.S. sanction related penalties and backlash in the U.S. market.” Editing by Adrian Croft and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/switzerland-iran-bcp/update-2-swiss-bank-bcp-halts-all-new-business-with-iran-idUKL5N1T03GU,29 May 2018,"* Iran pressing Europe to provide economic package by May 31

2018-05-29,"NAIROBI, May 29 (Reuters) - Tullow Oil has awarded an engineering design contract for oil production in its northern Kenyan blocs to Australia’s Worley Parsons, a Kenyan petroleum ministry official told Reuters on Tuesday. Kenya this month moved a step closer to full production at the blocs when the local government and the national government agreed on revenue sharing. The blocs, Kenya’s only source of oil so far, are estimated to contain 750 million barrels. Andrew Kamau, principal secretary in the ministry of petroleum and mining, did not provide more details on the engineering design contract. Tullow and its partner Africa Oil discovered commercial reserves in the Lokichar basin in 2012. French oil producer Total has since taken a 25 percent stake. Tullow, which operates the blocs, and Worley Parsons, were not immediately available for comment. On Sunday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to wave off a convoy of trucks carrying crude oil, marking the start of small scale exports meant to help the firms carry out technical studies like oil well flow rates ahead of full production in 2021/22. The agreement on revenue sharing will pave the way for the passage of a much delayed law on petroleum production, allowing Tullow to start shipping oil, which has been held in storage tanks for a year as it waited for the law. The government and the firms involved in the blocs earlier this month also awarded an engineering design contract for a new pipeline.

2018-05-29,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition regulator on Tuesday set out more detail about what it intends to examine in its investigation of the tie-up between the retail power units of energy companies SSE (SSE.L) and Innogy’s (IGY.DE) Npower. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said earlier this month it had launched in-depth investigation into the tie-up between the companies, saying it may reduce competition and increase prices for some households.  On Tuesday, the CMA said it would consider the impact of the merger on the supply of gas and electricity to customers in Britain. The CMA will also consider any implications arising from plans for a larger asset swap between Innogy’s parent company RWE (RWEG.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE), which also has a British retail energy business. The CMA will also look at the potential impact on British independent energy supplier Utility Warehouse, which has around 600,000 customers and relies on Npower for is gas and electricity supplies. “This theory of harm considers whether the Merged Entity would have an incentive to raise SVT (standard variable tariff) prices to increase its wholesale prices to Utility Warehouse,” the CMA said. The SSE/Npower merger would create Britain’s second-largest retail power provider and reduce the “Big Six” dominating the market to five companies when they are already facing political scrutiny for high prices.

2018-05-29,"MAPUTO (Reuters) - At least 10 people were beheaded in an attack in northern Mozambique over the weekend in an area where previous Islamist attacks have been reported, state Radio Mocambique said on Tuesday. Police in the capital Maputo could not immediately give details of the attack in a village near the town of Palma, close to Mozambique’s border with Tanzania and near one of the world’s biggest untapped offshore gas fields. “Unknown persons killed by decapitation at least 10 people in recent days in the administrative post of Olumbi, Palma district, in the north of Cabo Delgado province,” Radio Mocambique said in a brief report. The radio station did not provide any further details on the attack. Portuguese news agency Lusa, quoting national broadcaster TVM, said two children were among those beheaded but this could not be independently verified. Palma district administrator David Machimbuko told the station that authorities had moved security teams to areas where further attacks were feared. Police spokesman Inacio Dina said officers were gathering information from a team dispatched to the north. Local media have reported a series of attacks carried out by Islamists since October last year, when police stations were attacked in the north, a predominantly Muslim region.  Mozambique has not been a focal point of Islamist militant activity in the past and police have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists. Muslims make up about 18 percent of Mozambique’s population. Roman Catholics form the largest single religious grouping, with about 30 percent of its 30 million people.    The gas project is located in the Rovuma basin off the northern coast of Mozambique, an area where oil firms are exploring.

Friends of the Earth informed the oil and gas company last month it planned to take legal action if Shell did not reduce investment in fossil fuels and cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. In response, Shell Company Secretary Linda Szymanski said in a letter, dated May 28, seen by Reuters, that the company did not believe that these claims had merit. “Nor do we consider that the courts provide the right forum to advance the global energy transition.” A Shell spokeswoman confirmed the letter had been sent and its content.

Investors fear that repeat elections - which now seem inevitable in the euro zone’s third-largest economy - may become a de facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc and the country’s role in the European Union. Short-dated Italian bond yields — a sensitive gauge of political risk — soared as much as 150 basis points to their highest since late 2013 in their biggest move in 26 years. The euro dropped towards $1.15 for the first time in close to a year, down 0.8 percent on the day. Against the Swiss franc, it fell to 1.15 francs. Stocks in Milan slid 2.6 percent on the main index after a 2.1 percent fall on Monday. Bank shares slumped another 5 percent after losing 4 percent in the previous session, bruised by the sell-off in government bonds, a core part of bank portfolios. “It is just a slide, and as the slide continues, you ask where is the end,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy, John Hardy. Global contagion is a risk, he said, with the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stocks index also close to breaching some key support levels. Hardy recalled a promise made in 2012 by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to keep the euro intact. “If this continues for another couple of sessions, I think you will have to see some official (European) response. A ‘whatever it takes’ kind of moment,” he said. Adding to the uncertainty, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will face a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday . Spain’s bond-yield spread with Germany also went to its widest in 11 months at 144 bps. Madrid’s IBEX bourse was down almost 2.5 percent. Asia flinched, too. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent and Chinese and Hong Kong shares ended 0.6 to 0.7 percent in the red. U.S. markets pointed to losses later, with the S&P500 E-Mini futures for the down 0.7 percent. The dollar was up against almost all major currencies except the safe-haven Japanese yen. The U.S. currency is heading for its best month in a year and a half - a move that is hurting many emerging market countries that borrow in dollars. EM stocks hit a five-month low while South Africa’s rand led the currency retreat as it dropped 1.5 percent. “The biggest contributor is fear of a euro zone crisis, and the spillover from that into demand for safe-haven currencies,” said Koon Chow, an FX strategist at UBP. Away from Europe, the focus was on the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and the U.S.-China trade relationship. An aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday night, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, and the White House said a “pre-advance” team was travelling to the city to meet the North Koreans. The reports indicate that planning for the summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead even though President Donald Trump called it off last week. A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details. In another sign that investors were flocking to safer bets, though, the euro hit a 11-month low versus the yen with a 1.5 percent drop to 125.10 yen, its biggest slide in four months. Elsewhere in bonds, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to six-week lows of 2.883 percent after a U.S. holiday on Monday. The climb in Italy’s yields - yields move inversely to price - meant they were above the U.S. equivalent for the first time in over a year. Analysts are awaiting U.S. inflation data later in the week, which could provide clues to future interest rate moves before the Federal Reserve policy meets next month. Italian Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli will see the President Sergio Mattarella at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT), the president’s office said in a statement. Mattarella effectively vetoed a coalition government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and League party at the weekend. He has asked Cottarelli to form a stop-gap government to lead the country to early elections instead. Cottarelli is expected to announce his cabinet after the meeting. Oil prices remained under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more crude, even as U.S. oil output rises. U.S. crude futures tumbled to six-week lows and looked set for a fifth straight day of declines. The July contract was last down 1.3 percent at $67.02 a barrel. Brent crude futures edged up 0.5 percent after dropping to $74.49 per barrel on Monday, their lowest in about three weeks. They were last at $75.82.

2018-05-29," LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers were busy reducing bullish positions in petroleum well before OPEC and its allies indicated in the middle of last week that they would consider relaxing output curbs. Hedge funds and other money managers reduced their net long position in the six major petroleum futures and options contracts in each of the five weeks to May 22 by a total of 108 million barrels. The reduction has been concentrated in crude, where net long positions in Brent and WTI were cut by 169 million barrels over those five weeks. (For a chartbook, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2LBbW8l) Liquidation was heaviest in Brent (-131 million barrels over six weeks) rather than NYMEX and ICE WTI (-51 million barrels over four weeks). It was partly offset by increased net length in fuels, especially U.S. gasoline (34 million barrels), with smaller increases in U.S. heating oil (+26 million barrels) and European gasoil (+2 million barrels). Liquidation hit near-term Brent futures prices particularly hard, since most hedge fund positions are held in contracts just a few months from expiry, which has helped push near-term contract prices into contango. Portfolio managers cut their net long position in Brent by almost 50 million barrels in the week to May 22, the largest one-week reduction since before the rally started in June 2017. Hedge funds have continued to add bullish positions in fuels, especially gasoline, in a bet consumption will remain relatively strong. But the decision to pare positions in crude points to deeper unease about the sustainability of the rally in oil prices over the last 10 months. Hedge funds started to reduce their net long position in petroleum around the time U.S. President Donald Trump used Twitter on April 20 to blame OPEC for pushing up oil prices. For all the bullish commentary around oil prices in recent weeks, hedge fund managers have used rising prices to realise some profits rather than increase their positions. Hedge fund positioning in the petroleum complex had become exceptionally stretched, with long positions outnumbering short ones by a record ratio of 14:1 by April 17. Positioning was even more lopsided in Brent, where portfolio managers held more than 20 long positions for every short one, according to exchange and regulatory data. Since then, however, fund managers have cut long positions across the petroleum complex by 52 million barrels and boosted shorts by 57 million barrels. The number of shorts has risen from just 109 million barrels to 166 million barrels, the highest for five months since the middle of December. Positioning is still stretched, but much less so than before, with long positions now outnumbering shorts by 9:1 in petroleum and 7:1 in Brent. Large concentrations of hedge fund positions have normally preceded a sharp reversal in the price trend over the last four years. Recent sharp falls in oil prices, especially Brent, are therefore not surprising, given that fund managers have been steadily liquidating long positions and adding shorts for more than a month. Comments from senior OPEC and non-OPEC officials suggesting they would consider raising output to compensate for lost production from Venezuela and sanctions on Iran catalysed a sharp fall in oil prices. But the market had been primed for a sharp correction given steady hedge fund selling over the last five weeks.  John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-05-29,"* Lebanon aims to launch second licensing round * First offshore exploration deals signed in February * Block 9 includes area subject to dispute with Israel (Adds detail on second round) By Lisa Barrington BEIRUT, May 29 (Reuters) - Lebanon’s search for its first oil and gas reserves began on Tuesday after authorities approved an exploration plan submitted by a consortium of France’s Total , Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek. Energy and Water Minister Cesar Abi Khalil also said in a televised statement that Lebanon hoped to launch a second offshore licensing round by the end of 2018 or early 2019. In February, Lebanon signed its first offshore oil and gas exploration and production agreements with the Total-Eni-Novatek consortium for offshore Blocks 4 and 9. Part of Block 9 contains waters disputed with neighbouring Israel but the consortium has said it has no plans to drill in the disputed area. Khalil said authorities gave the go ahead on Monday for exploration of the two blocks to begin. The exploration period can last up to three years and the first well is expected to be drilled in 2019, providing all government departments grant necessary licences and permissions “on time and without delay”, the minister said. Khalil has served as energy minister since December 2016 but is now a caretaker minister because Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has not yet formed a government after parliamentary elections on May 6. The minister said drilling would determine whether Lebanon had commercial reserves and their scale. Lebanon is on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean where a number of big sub-sea gas fields have been discovered since 2009 in Cypriot, Israeli and Egyptian waters. Khalil did not say how many or which of the country’s 10 offshore blocks would be included in a second licensing round. Khalil, who in April asked the Lebanese Petroleum Administration (LPA) to prepare for a second licensing round, said authorities were considering modifying existing qualification criteria for firms interested in the next round. Lebanon tried to launch its first offshore exploration in 2013 but domestic political problems delayed it until 2017. Khalil previously said the delay, during which time global energy prices plummeted, undermined interest in the first licensing round. In the end, Total-ENI-Novatek was the only consortium to submit an offer out of 51 companies which had qualified since 2013 to bid. He said on Tuesday he hoped market conditions in 2019 would be better and that companies’ positive experience with the first round would lead to wider participation in a second.

Japan is Asia’s biggest aluminium importer and the premiums for primary metal shipments it agrees to pay each quarter over the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price set the benchmark for the region. The premium, if accepted, would be the highest in over three years and the third straight quarterly rise, reflecting premiums in the United States that have surged amid the country’s tariffs on aluminium imports and sanctions on Rusal - the world’s No.2 producer of the metal. “We have received an offer at $159 per tonne from one producer and at $160 from another supplier late on Monday,” a source at a trading house said on Tuesday. “The producers claimed firmer U.S. spot premiums and tighter supplies due to U.S. sanction on Rusal as the reasons for their stronger offers, but we are not feeling physical tightness in Asia at least for now,” another source at a fabricator said. For the quarter ending June, Japanese buyers agreed to pay a premium of $129 PREM-ALUM-JP, up 25 percent from the prior quarter to reflect the spike in U.S. spot premiums. Spot premiums in the United States have more than doubled so far this year, underpinned by a 10 percent tariff on aluminium imports to counter what U.S. President Donald Trump has described as unfair international competition. The United States’ move in April to impose sanctions on Rusal, preventing customers with U.S. exposure from continuing to buy metal from the company, fanned further supply worries and drove up benchmark London prices to their highest in almost seven years. But Rusal resumed shipping aluminium to some customers earlier this month following an extension of the deadline for companies to wind down contracts under the U.S. sanctions, sources told Reuters last week. Given the uncertainty about global metal supply, all the sources said they expect “more difficult negotiations than usual” between Japanese buyers and producers. The latest quarterly pricing negotiations began this week between Japanese buyers and smelters, including Rio Tinto Ltd , Rusal, South32 Ltd and Alcoa Corp and are expected to continue through next month.

2018-05-29,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL.TA) on Tuesday reported a bigger loss in the first quarter, reflecting the impact of higher jet fuel and salary costs and a further deterioration in market share. Israel’s flag carrier has met with stiff competition from rivals including Turkish Airlines, Aeroflot (AFLT.MM), easyJet (EZJ.L) and WizzAir (WIZZ.L), which offer lower fares on routes to Israel even though some flights require a stopover. During the quarter, El Al’s market share at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion airport slipped to 27.5 percent from 32.3 percent a year earlier, but the airline remained the market leader. El Al’s passenger numbers rose 2.6 percent versus 20.7 percent for all airlines, according to data from the Israel Airports Authority. El Al said its passenger load factor, which measures, capacity utilization, was 83.8 percent, compared with 83.6 percent last year. Chief Executive Gonen Usishkin said the first-quarter results reflected “the many challenges stemming from the open skies (with Europe) and the fierce and increasing competition from foreign airlines — especially low cost carriers.” He said due to the increasing competition, El Al would accelerate its efficiency plan, including removing older Boeing 767 aircraft from service this year rather than in 2020 and changing its commission payments to travel agents. It is also postponing the launch of a non-stop route to San Francisco until the second quarter of 2019 from later this year. “The plan ... examines all channels of operation and areas of activity and aims to increase revenue and significantly reduce expenses to create a clear path of an improvement of results over many years,” Usishkin said.     The company reported a $44 million loss in the first three months of 2018, compared with a $30 million loss a year earlier, partly weighed down by a weaker dollar against the shekel. Revenue rose 11 percent to $464 million, although expenses rose 15 percent, largely because of a 25 percent increase in jet fuel costs and higher salary expenses as the minimum wage increased. El Al is banking on a more than $1 billon overhaul of its long-range fleet to win back customers while also revamping its short-haul fare structure. It has received the first four of 16 Boeing (BA.N) 787 aircraft that will be delivered by 2020 and it expects three more by the end of October. In March, El Al petitioned Israel’s Supreme Court to restrict any new flights to the country via Saudi airspace until it can also use a shorter route.  Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel and El Al must take a more circuitous route to avoid Saudi Arabia, which it has said adds two hours to flight times and increases costs. The petition came a week after Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel. Reporting by Steven Scheer.

2018-05-29,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Blame it on Trump, Iran or Venezuela. Rising oil prices combined with a heavy debt load killed the world’s biggest private equity oil and gas industry deal last week. Harbour Energy left Australia empty-handed after a year of chasing gas producer Santos Ltd (STO.AX), missing out on Santos’ stakes in three liquefied natural gas projects in Australia and Papua New Guinea as it sought to become a major LNG player.  The U.S. firm, backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, was forced to bid against itself five times, including twice over one weekend, until it made a final offer of $10.8 billion, up more than 50 percent from its first approach last August. “The grievance runs deep and it’s heartfelt,” said a person in the Harbour camp.     Harbour Chief Executive Linda Cook, a former senior executive at Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), was on a plane last Tuesday when she heard Santos had rejected its sixth offer, worth about A$6.95 a share. She declined to comment for this story. Harbour’s disappointed chairman, Blair Thomas, was already back in Washington, DC, and didn’t mince words. “There was insufficient engagement with Santos on valuation, no meaningful attempt by Santos to discuss a realistic price which could supported by any reasonable set of technical and commercial assumptions, and an unwillingness by their Board to explore means of closing the gap between the offer and their expectations,” he said in a two-page statement. Thomas believed by the end of a weekend of back and forth between advisers on both sides that he had a deal with Santos Chairman Keith Spence, a person in the Harbour camp said. Harbour’s team were parked in Sydney, where Harbour’s backer EIG has an office and advisers at JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Highbury are based, according to people involved. “A couple of hundred” people were involved in analysing data and conducting due diligence, they said. Cook and Thomas met Kevin Gallagher and Keith Spence, their counterparts at Adelaide-based Santos, on May 18. They felt encouraged the board would facilitate an offer going to shareholders, people in the Harbour camp said. People on both sides said talks were cordial the whole time, but the Santos board was firm on value, and Harbour failed to offer enough of a premium as oil prices marched higher. Crude prices climbed from around $52 a barrel when Harbour made its first approach in August to $80 last week, their highest since late 2014, as U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Venezuela and pulled out of a nuclear arms control deal with Iran, both key oil producers. What hurt Harbour was the $7.75 billion in debt they had lined up from JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, which required oil price hedging against 30 percent of Santos’ oil-linked LNG sales, making the deal complex, Santos, investors and bankers said. “The problem is when you get high-leverage deals there are a lot of terms and conditions you have to meet and it makes it inflexible,” said a veteran Australian investment banker not involved in the bid. Santos balked when Harbour tried to force the company to lock in the hedges, in order to cut costs for the banks and allow Harbour to raise its offer. Santos said it was “resilient” to the oil price fall, as it has slashed costs to be cash flow breakeven at $36 a barrel.  The value of the Harbour bid was “simply not compelling enough” compared with Santos’ own growth plan, the risks associated with the hedging and the reliance on Santos’ balance sheet to help fund the deal, a Santos spokeswoman said.  Not only was Harbour jilted at the altar, but the biggest shareholders in Santos, Chinese gas distributor ENN Ecological 60003.SS and private equity firm Hony Capital missed out on more than doubling their combined stake to up to 40 percent in a privatised Santos. Sources said ENN and Hony were as furious as Harbour. “They’re deeply disappointed and angry and frustrated,” a person close to ENN said. “They feel that the outcome didn’t reflect some of the conversations with senior Santos people.” However in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange last week, ENN, which has a director on the board of Santos, said: “The company’s future cooperation with Santos is not affected.” A Santos spokeswoman said ENN is part of a united Santos board, and the company’s strategic relationship with ENN and Hony remains in place. Hony said it “will closely follow the further development”.  Swiss energy and commodities trader Mercuria, which was set to contribute 10 percent of the bid, was thwarted in its ambition to use Santos to get into LNG trading, where its rivals Glencore, Gunvor, Trafigura and Vitol are already active. “A lot of time and money went into this...so it is annoying,” said a person familiar with Mercuria’s thinking. Mecuria declined to comment. Harbour’s first approach last August was swiftly rejected by the board under then-chairman Peter Coates, who had also rebuffed a $5.1 billion takeover offer two years earlier when Santos was wallowing in debt as oil prices collapsed. The August approach was only disclosed by Santos in November after a newspaper outed Harbour. It took Harbour until March to line up funding from JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley and equity from Mercuria, ENN and Hony in order to make another approach.  Top 10 shareholder Argo Investments said the deal was too complex and would have involved Santos taking on too much risk when there was a lot of uncertainty around whether it would be approved. Shareholders have faith in CEO Gallagher, who slashed costs and cut debt faster than expected over the past two years. “It’s fair to say that he’s done a pretty good job,” said Argo Investments Managing Director Jason Beddow.  “The proof will be in the pudding as to how Santos looks in a year or two’s time - which is somewhat dependent on the oil price.” Reporting by Sonali Paul.

2018-05-29,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Tariffs on steel, threats of car import levies and intense  pressure for a two-way economic deal: despite warm personal ties, U.S. President Donald Trump is giving Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a decidedly tough time on trade. Trump has also withdrawn from a multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) promoted by Abe as a counterweight to China, abandoned a climate change accord backed by Tokyo and is pursuing talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un notwithstanding Abe’s warnings about past mistakes. Since Trump was elected, the two leaders have met nine times, shared burgers, played golf three times and spoken nearly two-dozen times by phone. In their latest telephone chat overnight, Abe and Trump agreed to meet again before a U.S.-North Korea summit that could take place next month. “I think he has penetrated Trump’s mind to a certain degree, but that is different from his pet agenda on trade,” said Keio University professor Toshihiro Nakayama. “Prime Minister Abe and his team expected a bit more because of the personal chemistry. That was a bit of wishful thinking - look at Macron,” Nakayama added. Like Abe, French President Emmanuel Macron has developed a strong personal relationship with Trump yet has clashed with him over issues including Iran, climate change and trade.  Trump’s administration decided last week to begin a national security investigation into auto imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those already imposed on imported steel and aluminum. Motor vehicles make up about 30 percent of Japanese exports to the United States. The auto probe follows an April agreement by Trump and Abe to set up a new framework to discuss “free, fair and reciprocal” trade that will be led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. Trump has made clear he prefers a bilateral deal to cut a U.S. trade deficit with Japan that hit 615.7 billion yen ($5.64 billion) last month. However, Abe’s administration insists multilateral pacts are still the best bet. “FFR is not a negotiation or scoping exercise for a bilateral FTA (Free Trade Agreement),” a Japanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. “We see it in a broader context.” Behind Japan’s resistance to a bilateral FTA is in part the fear of pressure to open up its agriculture sector. The farm lobby is an important base for Abe’s ruling party. For now, Japan is working from a familiar playbook with a strategy combining highlighting past and planned purchases of U.S. goods and investments, possible moves sanctioned by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and expanding a web of trade pacts that Tokyo hopes will eventually lure Washington back to the multilateral order. Japan has notified the WTO it reserves the right to take counter-measures against the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum totaling $440 million, the amount of added duties the U.S. tariffs would impose on its exports of those products. “We have the right but not the obligation to do it,” the Japanese official said, adding any steps against future tariffs on Japanese car exports would also be WTO-consistent. As they’ve done since Trump was elected, Japanese officials are highlighting how much Japanese carmakers and other firms contribute to the U.S. economy. As of 2016, Japan says its companies have invested a cumulative $421 billion in the United State, creating more than 850,000 jobs. A rise in energy imports is also expected to help trim the bilateral trade imbalance.  Japan received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) last week from Dominion Energy Inc’s newly completed Cove Point, Maryland export plant, the beginning of a jump in imports from the United States. “The balance will tilt toward the United States. Whether it is big enough is open to question but at least things will be happening in the eyes of the president,” the Japanese official said. Japanese officials deny they are foot-dragging on trade negotiations, but some experts said playing for time could be useful. “It’s not Japan that needs a bilateral FTA. It’s the United States,” said former Japanese trade negotiator Yorizumi Watanabe. “Japan can take the approach of wait-and-see.” That tactic, however, risks backfiring.  “The president is, as you know, a man of action and expects us to get results quickly,” U.S. ambassador to Japan William Hagerty said earlier this month. “I think Mr. Abe understands that.”  Reporting by Linda Sieg.

2018-05-29,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Monsoon rains hit the southern Indian state of Kerala a few days earlier than normal on Tuesday, the country’s weather office said, potentially brightening the nation’s outlook for agricultural output and economic growth. Monsoons deliver about 70 percent of India’s annual rainfall and are the lifeblood of its $2.5 trillion economy, spurring farm output and boosting rural spending on items ranging from gold to cars, motorcycles and refrigerators. “The southwest monsoon has set in over the southern state of Kerala, three days ahead of its normal date,” the state-run India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement. The early arrival of monsoon rains typically enables farmers to bring forward sowing of crops such as rice, sugar cane, corn, cotton and soybeans because nearly half the country’s farmland lacks irrigation. However, IMD Monsoon Director General K.J. Ramesh last month forecast that monsoon rains were expected to be 97-percent of a long-term average. India’s weather office defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season beginning June. Other than boosting farm output and wider economic growth, a spell of roughly average rains could help keep a lid on inflation, potentially tempting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring forward a general elections due in May 2019. Monsoon rains are likely to be unaffected by the El Nino weather pattern, which is expected to set in only after the four-month rainy season ends in September. In 2017, monsoon rains were 95 percent of the long-term average compared to forecasts of 98 percent. Before receiving average rains in 2016, India suffered back-to-back drought years for only the fourth time in more than a century, hurting incomes and driving some farmers to suicide. Average monsoon rainfall would help India retain its position as the world’s top rice exporter, but could further stoke a glut in supply of sugar.

The 380-centistoke bonded fuel oil contract would be China’s second bonded energy futures after the March launch of crude oil futures on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), a ShFE subsidiary. Chairman Jiang Yan said the ShFE would also launch pulp futures contracts, while bringing forward the development of natural gas and other refined oil product futures. It will also accelerate the internationalisation of futures products to attract more foreign investors, he added in his speech to the Shanghai Derivatives Market Forum, a copy of which was available on the exchange’s website. A senior ShFE official told Reuters the bourse wanted the new fuel oil futures to replace its existing 180-centistoke contract “pretty soon” and that - unlike the current contract - the new one would be open to foreign investors. The official declined to be identified because the information is not yet public. The INE’s crude oil contract was the first commodities derivatives contract in China to be opened to foreign investors when it launched in March, while an iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange went international on May 4. The ShFE is continuing to make preparations to list options for rubber and copper, Jiang said. The exchange is currently testing out copper options via simulated trading. The chairman said ShFE would explore opportunities to set up warehouses in the Hainan free-trade zone, which China is aiming to establish by 2020, and overseas, without specifying for which commodities.

European shares looked set to extend losses, spreadbetters showed, as investors feared Italy’s election campaign could focus on the country’s membership of European institutions after the anti-establishment 5-Star and League parties abandoned plans to form a government. FTSE futures slipped 0.5 percent while Eurostoxx 50 futures eased 0.1 percent. Adding to the uncertainty, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will face a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday. All that hit risk appetite, sending MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.4 percent after three consecutive sessions of gains. E-Mini futures for the S&P500 also gave up early gains. Japan’s Nikkei skidded 0.6 percent. Chinese shares were in the red, too, with the blue-chip down 0.6 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index off 0.7 percent. Liquidity was relatively thin with public holidays in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. “The market has turned its focus to the continuing political situation in Italy,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “This should keep the risk trades pressured to the downside,” Twidale added. “(The) focus will remain on the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and the U.S.-China trade relationship as we move through the Asian trading session.” A top aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday night, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, and the White House said a “pre-advance” team was traveling to Southeast Asian city-state to meet with the North Koreans. The reports indicate that planning for the historic summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead after Trump called it off last week. A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details. The euro held at $1.1630 from Monday’s $1.1608, its lowest since early November. The dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of major currencies to stay near the highest since mid-November. But against safe harbour yen, it dipped to 109 to edge closer to a recent three-week trough of 108.94. In a sign that investors were flocking to safer bets, U.S. 10-year Treasuries opened at six-week lows at 2.886 percent after a U.S. holiday on Monday. Analysts will next focus their attention on U.S. inflation data due later in the week which could provide clues to future interest rate rises ahead of the Federal Reserve policy meeting next month. Oil prices remained under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more crude, even as U.S. oil output rises. U.S. crude futures tumbled to six-week lows and looked set for a fifth straight day of declines. The July contract was last down 1.6 percent at $66.81 a barrel. Brent crude futures edged up 0.3 percent after dropping to $74.49 per barrel on Monday, their lowest in about three weeks. They were last at $75.53.

2018-05-29,"May 29 (Reuters) - Former subtropical storm Alberto, which threatened to clobber the southeastern United States on Memorial Day, fizzled into a subtropical depression, with winds dropping to 35 mph (56 kph) as it rolled into southern Alabama on Tuesday, officials said. At its height, it was blasting sustained winds of 65 mph (105 kph) with gusts that packed full hurricane punches of 75 mph (121 kph), said meteorologist David Roth of the National Weather Service. “It’s slowly weakening and it’s not regaining any strength,” Roth said. “The chances of it spinning off tornadoes now has dropped to virtually zero.” Forecasters had feared the storm could bring dangerous high water to southern coastal states and possible tornadoes. The National Hurricane Center cancelled coastal warnings and watches. Minor power outages were reported in north Florida, and the state’s emergency response team started closing shelters on Monday, citing a “lack of public sheltering need.” Some areas on Gulf Coast barrier islands remained under evacuation orders as authorities weighed the flood risks, officials said. Alberto will probably weaken through Tuesday as it moves northward to the Tennessee Valley and then into the Ohio Valley, finally withering into a “remnant low pressure storm” by Tuesday evening, with winds around 25 mph (40 kph), Roth said. The NHC warned it would still deliver heavy, potentially damaging rains of 2 to 6 inches (6 cm to 15 cm), with chances of 12 inches (30 cm) in some spots in north Florida and Alabama through Tuesday night, possibly spurring flooding. It is expected to dump up to 6 inches (15 cm) of rain as it moves northward to lower Michigan by Wednesday evening, officials said. Alberto’s top winds weakened on Monday to 45 mph (75 kph) when its center made landfall near Panama City, Florida, weather officials said, with a city fire official adding that the wind and rain knocked down trees but did not force any rescues. Royal Dutch Shell Plc was returning workers to the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Chevron Corp restored some production on Monday after the storm’s passage. Shell plans to restore production at its Ram Powell Hub in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf as it soon as the platform can be operated safely, the company said in a statement. Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, spun up days before the formal June 1 start of the hurricane season, complicating holiday travel as it hit on the last day of the Memorial Day weekend. Authorities in Florida’s Franklin and Taylor counties issued mandatory evacuation orders for thousands of coastal residents. Deadly hurricanes in the United States and the Caribbean last year caused billions of dollars in damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures.

2018-05-29,"SEOUL, May 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed in early Asian trading on Tuesday, but remained under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more crude to ease a potential shortfall in supply. Brent crude futures were up 57 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $75.87 a barrel at 0028 GMT, after settling at their lowest since May 8 at $75.30. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 80 cents, or 1.18 percent, at $67.08 a barrel. It finished the last session at its lowest closing price since April 17 at $66.47 per barrel. “Investors have started pricing in the likelihood of Saudi Arabia and Russia increasing crude oil production,” ANZ Bank said in a note. “However, doubt remains, with any agreement to be finalised at the June OPEC meeting.” Concerns that Saudi Arabia and Russia could boost output have put downward pressures on oil prices, along with rising oil production in the United States. Saudi Arabia and Russia have discussed raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil production by some 1 million barrels per day to make up potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are due to meet in Vienna on June 22. Meanwhile, record crude oil volumes from the United States would head to Asia in coming months, nibbling away the market share of OPEC and Russia. U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has surged by more than 27 percent in the last two years to 10.73 million barrels per day (bpd). That puts the United States ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia, and only Russia pumps out more, at around 11 million bpd. Reporting by Jane Chung

2018-05-29,"(Reuters) - Subtropical Storm Alberto weakened as it made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on Monday, a day after flooding from another storm tore through a historic Maryland town and swept away a would-be rescuer, officials said. Forecasters said Alberto could bring dangerous high water to southern coastal states when it douses an area from Mississippi to western Georgia with up to 12 inches (30 cm) of rain and possible tornadoes. But Alberto’s top winds weakened as the storm advanced, dropping to 45 miles an hour (75 km per hour) as the center of the storm made landfall near Panama City, Florida, the National Weather Service said.  Heavy rainfall and flash flooding were occurring over parts of the Florida Panhandle, the National Hurricane Center said. In Panama City, Assistant Fire Chief Gary Swearingen said the rain and wind knocked down trees but did not require any rescues. Alberto, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, spun up days before the formal June 1 start of the hurricane season. Authorities in Florida’s Franklin and Taylor counties issued mandatory evacuation orders for thousands of coastal residents.  Deadly hurricanes in the United States and the Caribbean last year caused billions of dollars in damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures. The storm will bring powerful winds and heavy rains as it moves into the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday, the hurricane center said. The storm hit on the last day of the Memorial Day weekend, complicating holiday travel. In Maryland, officials in Howard County said a 39-year-old man was missing after flash flooding from a separate storm tore through the historic downtown of Ellicott City on Sunday. The man was swept away as he tried to help rescue people from floodwaters. The area had barely recovered from a devastating flood about two years ago that killed two people and damaged dozens of buildings.

2018-05-29,"(Repeats item with no changes to text) * U.S. exports to hit 2.3 mln bpd in June -source * Asia volumes seen at 1 mln-1.3 mln bpd -trade sources * China, India, South Korea boost U.S. crude imports * U.S. shipments replace Mideast, Russia, Africa supplies * Top three oil producers: tmsnrt.rs/2xk67ZR By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, May 28 (Reuters) - Record crude oil volumes exported from the United States will be heading to Asia in the next couple of months to take another piece of the market away from Russia and producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The United States is set to export 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, of which 1.3 million bpd will head to Asia, estimated a senior executive with a key U.S. oil exporters. Data from the Energy Information Administration shows U.S. oil exports peaked at 2.6 million bpd two weeks ago. The record outbound volumes come as U.S. crude production hit all-time highs, depressing U.S. prices to discounts of more than $9 a barrel below Brent crude futures on Monday, the widest in more than three years and opening an arbitrage for excess supplies to other markets. WTCLc1-LCOc1 The difference in the key benchmarks was a chance for Asian refiners to reduce light crude imports from the Middle East and Russia after Brent and Gulf prices touched multi-year highs, traders in Asia said. “We’re diversifying a lot to other regions. If Saudi Aramco still doesn’t reduce prices next month and ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) follows, we will increase our U.S. crude purchases,” a Southeast Asian oil buyer said. In Asia, China - led by Sinopec, the region’s largest refiner - is the biggest lifter of U.S. crude. The company, after cutting Saudi imports, has bought a record 16 million barrels (533,000 bpd) of U.S. crude, to load in June, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. India and South Korea are the next biggest buyers in Asia, each lifting 6 million to 7 million barrels in June, sources tracking U.S. crude sales to Asia said. Indian Oil Corp bought 3 million barrels earlier this month via a tender, while Reliance Industries purchased up to 8 million barrels, the sources said, although it wasn’t clear if Reliance’s cargoes would all load in June. The sources declined to be named due to company policies. South Korea’s purchases are driven by its top refiners SK Energy and GS Caltex. Taiwanese state refiner CPC Corp has also snapped up 7 million barrels to be lifted in June and July. U.S. exports to Thailand will increase to at least 2 million barrels. State oil company PTT PCL is 1 million barrels of WTI Midland, while Thai Oil and Esso Thailand bought at least 500,000 barrels of Bakken crude each, said traders with knowledge of the country’s crude deals. Reliance declined to comment. PTT, Thai Oil and Esso Thailand all did not respond to requests for comment. But even if Asia and Europe are keen to take more U.S. crude, the record volumes are straining export infrastructure in the United States, limiting its ability to pump and ship more oil. “Tight (shale) oil’s been eating OPEC’s lunch for the last few years. The lack of infrastructure will temporarily cede market share back to OPEC,” R.T. Dukes, head of U.S. Lower 48 oil supply at Wood Mackenzie said in a note last week.
