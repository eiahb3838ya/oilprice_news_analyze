2018-05-25,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A truckers protest over diesel prices that has crippled key sectors of Latin America’s biggest economy dragged into Friday night, putting drivers in a standoff with Brazilian President Michel Temer who authorized military force to clear highways.  The protest will stretch into its sixth day on Saturday. South America’s largest city and economic hub Sao Paulo decreed a state of emergency, as did Rio de Janeiro.   Gas stations and airports across the nation ran out of fuel, supermarket shelves went bare and hospitals said they were running out of supplies. Public transport and trash collection was reduced or halted across the country, and many schools cancelled classes as teachers could not get to work. Lack of feed supplies may cause one billion birds and 20 million hogs to die, Brazilian meat group ABPA said. “Those blocking the highways and acting in a radical manner are hurting the population,” Temer said in a televised address. “We will not allow hospitals to run out of supplies to save lives. We will not allow children to be harmed by the closure of schools.”  Yet Friday night, much of the country remained paralysed.  Public Security Minister Raul Jungmann said at a Friday night news conference that there were over 500 blockades on roadways across Brazil, but that was half of those registered 24 hours before. Brazil’s oil regulator ANP said once roads are completely cleared, it would still take a week to normalise fuel supplies nationwide.      In response to the threat of military action, Abcam, a Brazilian truckers association that says it represents 600,000 drivers, called on them to no longer block roads.  However, it encouraged drivers to keep protesting and not deliver goods, meaning it was likely the situation would remain critical. Negotiators for several trucker groups agreed late on Thursday to suspend their blockages for 15 days after the government vowed to subsidise and stabilise diesel prices, which may cost 5 billion reais ($1.4 billion) this year. To win over truckers the government promised to extend for 30 days a 10-percent diesel price cut announced by state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Shares of Petrobras, as the company is known, closed down nearly 1.4 percent on Friday after plunging 19 percent in the prior two days, as the blockades continued.      But the Abcam trucking association that ignited the strike was not among the parties that signed the accord and insisted on Friday it would not do so until Congress puts diesel tax cuts into law, which would take several days at the quickest. No trucks were able to enter the port of Santos, Latin America’s largest, and oilseeds crushing group Abiove told Reuters that soy exports would halt on Saturday if truckers did not allow access to major ports.  ABPA said 152 poultry and pork processing plants had indefinitely suspended production. Auto production, which contributes about a quarter of Brazil’s industrial output, ground to a halt on Friday in the latest blow to a fragile economic recovery following the worst downturn in decades.

2018-05-25,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Subtropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, is forcing the evacuation of oil workers from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as it moves toward a Monday landfall between New Orleans and Florida’s panhandle. Royal Dutch Shell has begun evacuating some oil platform workers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and shut production at one energy hub as a precautionary measure, the company said on Friday afternoon. Production and drilling operations elsewhere in the Eastern Gulf had not been affected, it added.  The National Weather Service (NWS) on Friday issued a tropical storm warning from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to Indian Pass, Florida. It forecast the storm would bring heavy rain and flash flooding during the Memorial Day holiday weekend to the central Gulf Coast region and the southeastern United States this weekend and into next week.  Other U.S. energy companies with operations in the Gulf and along the coast said they are monitoring the progress of the storm.  The slow-moving storm is expected to drop 10 inches to 15 inches (25.5 cm to 38 cm) of rain on portions of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba, the NWS said. Between 4 inches and 8 inches (10-20 cm) of rain are expected across southern and southwestern Florida over the weekend.   Alberto is considered a subtropical storm because it a hybrid and not a tropical low, said Matt Rogers, president and co-founder of Commodity Weather Group. “This will most likely be a (fuel) demand destruction event, bringing cooler weather to the southeast United States and high temperatures to Texas next week,” Rogers said of the impact on energy consumption. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), located about 20 miles (32 km) south of the Louisiana coast in the Gulf, was operating normally, according to the company’s website. The LOOP is the only U.S. port that can offload the largest crude oil tankers. Shell said it has begun securing its Gulf facilities in preparation for potentially severe weather and had shut in production at its Ram Powell hub. The facility is capable of processing 60,000 barrels of oil and 200 million cubic feet of gas per day.   BP Plc spokesman Jason Ryan said its offshore operations are continuing as usual but workers are bracing for severe weather and the company is closely monitoring Alberto. “Offshore crews are preparing for strong winds and heavy rains,” Ryan said. Chevron Corp also said it was monitoring the storm’s forecast, and offshore operations and its 340,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery were continuing as planned on Friday. Phillips 66’s 247,000 bpd Alliance, Louisiana, refinery was also monitoring the storm on Friday, the company said.  Valero Energy Corp’s 125,000-bpd Meraux, Louisiana, refinery was continuing normal operations on Friday, sources familiar with plant operations said.  A storm coming before the Atlantic hurricane season begins on June 1 is not a harbinger of a busy season, Commodity Weather Group’s Rogers said. “We’ve had quiet years when we had an early storm and we’ve had busy years with an early storm,” he said. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude output and five percent of natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  More than 45 percent of the U.S. refining capacity and 51 percent of natural gas processing capacity is located along the Gulf.

2018-05-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than $2 per barrel on Friday as Saudi Arabia and Russia discussed easing production cuts that have helped push crude prices to their highest since 2014. Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell $2.35, or 3 percent, to settle at $76.44 a barrel. The global benchmark lost about 2.7 percent this week, its largest weekly drop since early April. The contract hit its highest since late 2014 at $80.50 last week.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 slumped $2.83, or 4 percent, to finish at $67.88 a barrel. For the week, WTI tumbled about 4.9 percent, its biggest loss since early February, a sharp course reversal after six weeks of gains. The premium of Brent to WTI WTCLc1-LCOc1 hit $8.75 per barrel in post-settlement trade, its widest since March 2015. For graphic on Russia vs Saudi vs U.S. oil production click reut.rs/2J1fC51 The energy ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia met in St. Petersburg to review the terms of a global oil supply pact that has been in place for 17 months, ahead of a key OPEC meeting in Vienna next month. The ministers, along with their counterpart from the United Arab Emirates, discussed an output increase of about 1 million barrels per day (bpd), sources told Reuters. Russia’s energy minister said oil ministers from OPEC states and non-OPEC countries participating in a deal to cut output would likely decide to gradually ease curbs at their meeting in Vienna next month. “After hitting that $80 level, which is a psychological level, we were seeing a little bit of a pull-back yesterday, and then rhetoric out of Saudi and Russia has only exacerbated the sell-off today,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. Global crude inventories have fallen over the past year because of the OPEC-led cuts, which were boosted by a dramatic drop in Venezuelan production.  The prospect of renewed sanctions on Iran after Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran has further supported prices in recent weeks. This comes even as U.S. crude production has risen. The United States in February produced 10.3 million bpd, a record.  The U.S. oil rig count, an indicator of future production, rose by 15 to 859 in the week to May 25, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures and options in the latest week after four consecutive cuts in the net long position, according to data released on Friday. The increase lifted the wagers from 6-month lows, in the week to May 22, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The speculator group raised its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 2,009 contracts to 421,916 during the period.

2018-05-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Growing expectations of increased oil supply hit crude prices on Friday, lifting the U.S. dollar and weighing on energy shares, while political upheaval in Europe and uncertainty over a U.S.-North Korea summit restrained equity markets. Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell $2.35, or 3 percent, to settle at $76.44 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs that have pushed prices to their highest since 2014. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signalled that a June 12 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could still take place a day after he cancelled the planned historic summit.  That led to a dip in gold prices, but it did little to increase demand for risk assets, investors said. “At this point investors are shrugging off Washington headlines because in most cases they won’t affect the markets and Washington has a hard time following through what they say,” said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial in Bethesda, Maryland. Gold prices dropped slightly after Trump’s latest North Korea comments, but remained above $1,300 per ounce. Wall Street ended mostly down as oil prices dragged down  energy stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States, which typically leads to low volume. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 59.15 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,752.61, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 6.46 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,721.3 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 9.43 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,433.85.  The S&P energy index .SPNY slid 2.9 percent, while Chevron (CVX.N) dropped 3.7 percent and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) fell 2.1 percent and were the biggest drags on the Dow. The tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC was aided by chipmakers, led by a 2.6 percent jump in Broadcom (AVGO.O). U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest level in three weeks as concerns about Italy’s new government and a leadership change in Spain boosted appetite for low-risk investments. Italian Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte began assembling his cabinet on Thursday, with party leaders pushing for an 81-year eurosceptic economist to be given the pivotal post of economy minister. Italy’s president is opposing the appointee. Political risk also reared its head in Spain, where a threat of no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sent Spanish stocks and bond prices plunging. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.05 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.29 percent. While yields on German and U.S. bonds fell amid the uncertainty, there have been few signs of a wide-ranging sell-off in higher-risk assets - Wall Street’s volatility index .VIX stayed near four-month lows. “Market reaction to heightened political risk remains reasonably muted,” Indosuez Wealth Management global head of economic research Marie Owens Thomsen said. She cited the example of Turkey and Italy, where a stock and bond sell-off has not spilled much into other emerging economies or euro zone states. However, worry about Italy kept the euro under pressure against the dollar.  The dollar index .DXY rose 0.48 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.53 percent to $1.1657.  The dollar has rebounded after touching two-week lows versus a basket of currencies .DXY on Thursday, helped by gains against commodity-linked currencies, as oil prices fell.

2018-05-25,"ADEN (Reuters) - Five people were killed and at least 40 missing on the Yemeni island of Socotra on Friday as Cyclone Mekunu pummelled the area before making its way to the Arabian Peninsula’s southern coast. The dead were four Yemenis and one Indian national, residents and medical sources told Reuters, while the missing included Yemenis, Indians and Sudanese. Among those missing were three local sailors lost when their ship capsized off the coast of the island. Yemen declared a state of emergency on Thursday for Socotra, which lies between southern Yemen and the Horn of Africa and is renowned for its unique animal and plant life. Largely untouched by Yemen’s three-year-old war, it is under the control of the internationally-recognised government whose president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is in exile in Saudi Arabia. The storm flooded Socotra’s villages and capsized boats, leaving much of the island without access to communications. Authorities in neighbouring Oman said they expected the cyclone to pass over the city of Salalah on Friday night. As wind and rain began to pummel southern Oman during the day, they extended the closure of the city’s airport until Saturday. Oman’s transport ministry warned residents throughout the southern province of Dhofar to stay in their homes, with run-off from river valleys flooding most main roads. A child in Salalah was hospitalised for injuries caused by the severe winds. Mekunu was expected to weaken to a tropical storm before reaching southeastern Saudi Arabia on Saturday, according to the kingdom’s meteorological authority. Yemen is already grappling with one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced three million others, triggered a cholera outbreak and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation, according to the United Nations.

2018-05-25,"(Adds land rig count and total oil and gas rig count from Baker Hughes, adds Permian rig count) By Scott DiSavino May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added the most oil rigs in both a week and a month since February as drillers continued to return to the well pad with crude prices at their highest since late 2014. The total oil rig count rose by 15 to 859 in the week to May 25, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the rig count rose by 34, its second increase in row, after rising 28 in April. More than half the total oil rigs are in Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there increased by 10 this week to 477, the most since January 2015. That was the biggest weekly increase in the basin since February. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 722 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s efforts to cut global output in a bid to take advantage of rising prices. On Friday, however, U.S. crude futures fell by almost $3 to around $68 a barrel after OPEC and Russia said they were considering an increase in output. Earlier in the week, U.S. crude traded over traded over $72, their highest since November 2014. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $67 for the balance of 2018 and around $63 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Cowen, which conducts its own count, said the total number of land oil and gas rigs fell by 13 this week to 1,057 due to private operators broadly distributed outside the major basins. Cowen noted the count in the Permian, the nation’s biggest shale oil basin, was flat week-over-week. That compares with 1,040 in the Baker Hughes land rig count. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, last week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise to 1,020 in 2018 and 1,125 in 2019. The Simmons forecast includes both land and offshore rigs. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 990, up sharply from 2017’s average of 876. That keeps the total count on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-05-25,"PARIS (Reuters) - French battery maker Saft, a unit of oil and gas major Total (TOTF.PA) said on Friday it plans to invest over 200 million euros (175.2 million pounds) in a next generation European battery alliance project.  Saft formed the alliance with European partners Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Solvay (SOLB.BR) and Manz (M5ZG.DE) in February to research, develop and build a new generation solid-state battery  to compete with Asian and U.S. manufacturers. The level of funding from its partners is still to be decided, Saft told Reuters in response to questions. The company said part of its investment will come from internal funds and part, yet to be determined, will come from the European Union’s executive arm which has said it will support the development of a European battery sector. Europe is lagging rivals in the development of its own battery sector and European car makers have turned to dominant battery manufacturers in Asia such as Japan’s Panasonic Corp, South Korea’s Samsung SD and China’s BYD Co as demand for electric vehicles grows. Saft plans to develop a solid-state battery technology which can be competitive by 2025, with a battery that has twice the performance of those in the market today, the company said.   It plans to develop batteries with 5,000–10,000 (charge and re-charging) cycles, with more than 10 years usage for electric vehicles, and a 20-year calendar life. “The target is to demonstrate a prototype cell at lab level by the fourth quarter of 2019 and build up a 2 megawatt-hour (MWh) pilot line by Q4 2021,” it said.  If the project is successful, it will build a 1 gigawatt-hour manufacturing standard block by the fourth quarter of 2023, and develop larger scale production based on 2024 market demand, Saft said.

The total oil rig count rose by 15 to 859 in the week to May 25, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the rig count rose by 34, its second increase in row, after rising 28 in April. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 722 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s efforts to cut global output in a bid to take advantage of rising prices. On Friday, however, U.S. crude futures fell by almost $3 to around $68 a barrel after OPEC and Russia said they were considering an increase in output. Earlier in the week, U.S. crude traded over traded over $72, their highest since November 2014. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $67 for the balance of 2018 and around $63 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Cowen, which conducts its own count, said the total number of land oil and gas rigs fell by 13 this week to 1,057 due to private operators broadly distributed outside the major basins. Cowen noted the count in the Permian, the nation’s biggest shale oil basin, was flat week-over-week. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-05-25,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Major powers and Iran agreed on Friday to move quickly to offset the U.S. pullout from its nuclear deal and Washington’s renewed sanctions, with Tehran pressuring Europe to come up with a package of economic measures by May 31.  The 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers lifted international sanctions on Tehran. In return, Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities, increasing the time it would need to produce an atom bomb if it chose to do so. Since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States this month, calling the agreement deeply flawed, European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal.  But this has proven difficult, with many European firms alarmed at the spectre of far-reaching U.S. financial penalties. Nations that remain in the deal - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - held a formal meeting on Friday without the United States for the first time since Trump’s announcement, but diplomats saw limited scope for salvaging the agreement. “For the time being we are negotiating... to see if they can provide us with a package which can actually give Iran the benefits of sanctions-lifting and then the next step is to find guarantees for that package,” Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters after the meeting.  The talks between senior officials aimed at fleshing out the package of measures to keep oil and investments flowing.  Those measures include banning EU-based firms from complying with the reimposed U.S. sanctions, urging governments to make transfers to Iran’s central bank to avoid fines and creating alternative financing channels.  “We expect the (economic) package to be given to us by the end of May,” a senior Iranian official said earlier, adding that Tehran was “weeks” away from deciding whether to quit the pact. European measures would need to ensure that oil exports did not halt, and that Iran would still have access to the SWIFT international bank payments messaging system, he said. A senior EU official said the participants had stressed on Friday that the package would not be immediate. “We made it very clear today that there are things that will take more time,” the official said. Foreign ministers of the remaining countries will meet in the coming weeks. Washington has not only reimposed sanctions but started to make them even tighter. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened Iran on Monday with “the strongest sanctions in history” if it did not change its behaviour in the Middle East. “Pompeo was like taking a cold shower,” said a European diplomat. “We’ll try to cling to the deal, but... we’re under no illusions.” Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei set out conditions on Wednesday for Iran to stay in the deal: unless Europe guarantees Iran’s oil sales will not suffer, Tehran would resume enrichment activities that are currently prohibited. The deal lets Iran enrich but under tight restrictions. “We were very clear we can’t give guarantees but we can create the necessary conditions for the Iranians to keep benefiting from the sanctions-lifting under the JCPOA (the nuclear deal) and to protect our interests and continue to develop legitimate business with Iran,” the EU official said. Iran has so far benefited less from the accord than it had initially hoped, partly because of remaining U.S. sanctions that have deterred major Western investors from doing business with Tehran. Some Western companies have already quit Iran or said they may have to leave because of the new U.S. sanctions. Trump denounced the accord, completed under his predecessor Barack Obama, because it did not cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its role in Middle East wars, or address the issue of what happens after the deal begins to expire in 2025. Khamenei rejected any new negotiations over Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its regional activities. European nations share some U.S. concerns but say that torpedoing the nuclear deal makes it far harder to address them. They have said that as long as Tehran meets its commitments, they will stick to the deal. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, which polices the pact, says Iran continues to comply with its terms..

2018-05-25,"ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan said on Friday there would be no winners if there was a trade war between China and the United States, but said Beijing had to be ready for any turn of events. Speaking at an economic forum in St Petersburg, Wang Qishan said there were frequent consultations between the world’s two largest economies aimed at tamping down trade tensions which have flared after talk of potential tariffs.  U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is unhappy about what he regards as the excessive nature of his country’s trade deficit with China and has cast uncertainty over progress in trade talks with Beijing. “We need to be restrained and not limited by emotions,” Wang Qishan told the forum, according to an instantaneous translation of his remarks into Russian.   “We must avoid a trade war because there won’t be any winners in such a war.” He said a mutually beneficial arrangement needed to be found and spoke out against pursuing what he called a zero sum game. “We can learn a lot from the United States,” he said, citing its super power status. “We need to cooperate.” However, despite the conciliatory tone of his comments on the subject, he said Beijing had to be ready for any turn of events. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde, speaking at the same event, said U.S. complaints about the size of its trade deficit with China were strange. She also said that U.S. complaints about alleged Chinese intellectual property violations should be discussed at the World Trade Organization.

2018-05-25,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations aid chief urged the Saudi-led military coalition that controls Yemen’s ports to expedite imports of food and fuel supplies, warning that a further 10 million Yemenis could face starvation by year-end. Yemen is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations, with some 8.4 million people severely short of food and at risk of starvation. For the past three years, the Yemeni government backed by Riyadh’s coalition which is armed and supported by the United States and Britain has battled Houthi fighters aligned to Iran. “I am particularly concerned about the recent decline of commercial food imports through the Red Sea ports,” Mark Lowcock, U.N. emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement read out to a Geneva briefing on Friday. For several weeks at the end of last year, the Saudi coalition imposed a blockade on Yemeni ports which it said was to prevent Houthis from importing weapons. This had a severe impact on Yemen, which traditionally imports 90 percent of its food. Under international pressure the coalition lifted the blockade, but tightened ship inspections.  Lowcock said commercial food and fuel imports remained “well short of pre-blockade averages”. “If conditions do not improve, a further 10 million people will fall into this category by the end of the year,” he said.  Yemen is one of world’s poorest countries and the United Nations says more than 22 million people need humanitarian assistance out of a population of around 25 million. Confidence among commercial shippers has eroded due to delays, “including as a result of inspections undertaken by the Saudi-led coalition after these vessels have been cleared by UNVIM,” Lowcock said, referring to a U.N. verification system. In a bid to speed up the delivery of aid to Yemen, the United Nations said last month it was beefing up its own inspections of ships. “I call on the Government of Yemen, with the support of the Coalition, to take active steps to boost commercial imports of food, fuel and humanitarian supplies through all Yemen’s ports,” Lowcock said. Houthi forces have also increased restrictions on the work of aid agencies in the northern areas they control, and it has become more difficult to reach civilians along the western coast and in the city of Taiz, he said. Lowcock, referring to violations by Houthis in northern areas, said: “Humanitarian staff are being detained and intimidated and visas are being delayed and denied. Programmes and missions are being interfered with in ways which contradict humanitarian principles.” The Saudi-led coalition is carrying out air strikes in Yemen in support of restoring the internationally-recognised government. Houthi forces have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United States voiced alarm on Friday that a Houthi missile struck a Turkish vessel carrying wheat to Yemen this month. Some 10,000 have been killed in the war which has triggered a major cholera outbreak that threatens to re-emerge with the ongoing rainy season.  Key supplies, including some needed to combat the deadly water-borne disease, remain on the prohibited list of imports, Lowcock said.

Crude oil prices declined more than 3 percent after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs that have pushed prices to their highest since 2014. Pyongyang gave a measured response to Trump’s decision to cancel the meeting, with Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan expressing hope for a “Trump formula” to resolve the standoff over its nuclear program. The remarks prompted Trump on Friday to dangle the possibility that the June 12 summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un might still happen. “They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it,” Trump said. Wall Street opened lower as slumping oil prices dragged on energy stocks ahead of a holiday weekend in the United States, which typically leads to low volume. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.9 points, or 0.12 percent, to 24,780.86, the S&P 500 lost 4.67 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,723.09 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.94 points, or 0.23 percent, to 7,441.37. Shares of Exxon and Chevron each fell more than 2 percent, while service firms Schlumberger, Halliburton and producers Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips were down between 3 percent and 4.2 percent. U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest level in three weeks as concerns about Italy’s new government and a leadership changed in Spain boosted appetite for low-risk investments. Italian Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte began assembling his cabinet on Thursday, with party leaders pushing for an 81-year eurosceptic economist to be given the pivotal post of economy minister. Italy’s president, meanwhile, is opposing the appointee. Political risk also reared its head in Spain, where a threat of no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sent Spanish stocks and bond prices plunging. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.04 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.23 percent. While yields on German and U.S. bonds fell amid the uncertainty, there have been few signs of a wide-ranging sell-off in higher-risk assets - Wall Street’s volatility index stayed near four-month lows. “Market reaction to heightened political risk remains reasonably muted,” Indosuez Wealth Management global head of economic research Marie Owens Thomsen said. She cited the example of Turkey and Italy, where a stock and bond sell-off has not spilled much into other emerging economies or euro zone states. However, worry about Italy kept the euro under pressure against the dollar. The dollar index rose 0.48 percent, with the euro down 0.54 percent to $1.1656. The dollar has rebounded after touching two-week lows versus a basket of currencies on Thursday, helped by gains against commodity-linked currencies, as oil prices fell. The Japanese yen weakened 0.11 percent versus the greenback at 109.41 per dollar, 1.3313reversing gains seen after the summit cancellation. down 0.49 percent Elsewhere, worries that investors could shift assets from emerging markets to higher-yielding U.S. bonds have been a major headwind for emerging markets this year.

2018-05-25,"PARIS (Reuters) - With Italy in political turmoil, oil prices on the rise and North Korea tensions back on the burner, the last thing the global economy needs is a big lurch towards a trade war further clouding the outlook. But that is exactly what the Trump administration faces if it does not extend temporary exemptions on steel and aluminium imports from Europe that expire on Thursday. The Europeans have opportunities for last minute diplomacy when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development holds its annual ministerial council in Paris on Wednesday. For his part, French President Emmanuel Macron is to due to make the case for breathing new life into the international economic order in a speech before the OECD on Wednesday. But there are few signs of U.S. appetite for that ahead of talks between U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and EU trade chief Ceclia Malmstrom on the sidelines of the OECD meeting. “The question is how can we accept a situation where the Americans manage their dialogue with a rival like China the same way as with their allies without special treatment for being a U.S. ally,” a senior French diplomat said. Even before Trump raised the spectre of import tariffs, trade flows faced an increasing number restrictions as economies struggled to get back on their feet following the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.  G20 economies have put up 1,400 new trade restrictions over the last decade against only 200 liberalisation measures during the same period, according to an OECD tally. OECD chief Angel Gurria said some governments were blaming globalisation, and by extension the broader multilateral trading system, rather than fixing bad policies that have failed to address voters’ concerns about jobs going overseas. “Globalisation does not have a face, globalisation does not have a neck from which you can hang it, so you use a proxy, the closest proxy is multilateralism,” Gurria told journalists. There is little prospect for a quick fix in the trade standoff between Washington and its allies after the Trump administration opened a new front on Wednesday by also threatening tariffs on auto imports. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will likely take flak over trade threats from his counterparts from other members of the Group of Seven economies when they meet in the Canadian Rocky Mountains on Friday and Saturday. The prospect of a trade war is particularly a concern in Europe where the economy is already losing steam, complicating the European Central Bank’s return to more conventional monetary policy as rising oil prices drive inflation higher. “In this context, the ECB now faces a classic stagflationary shock, with higher inflation and slower growth,” Oxford Economics Chief European economist James Nixon said in a research note. “Nevertheless, we continue to believe the ECB will end quantitative easing this year in order to avoid the risk of second round effects at a time when there is clear evidence of increasing labour shortages,” he added. Preliminary May euro zone consumer price data due on Thursday will offer evidence of how close inflation has come to the ECB’s just-below-2 percent target. Economists in a Reuters poll predict on average that it rebounded to a 13-month high of 1.6 percent from 1.2 percent in April. Among other data on the horizon next week are U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday for the month of May. Economists polled by Reuters forecast on average the world’s biggest economy added 185,000 new jobs this month, up from 164,000 in April.

2018-05-25,"DUBAI, May 25 (Reuters) - Five people were killed and at least 40 missing on the Yemeni island of Socotra on Friday as Cyclone Mekunu pummelled the area  then made its way towards the Arabian Peninsula’s southern coast. The five dead included four Yemenis and one Indian national, residents and medical sources told Reuters, while the missing including Yemenis, Indians and Sudanese. Yemen declared a state of emergency on Thursday for Socotra, which lies between southern Yemen and the Horn of Africa and is renowned for its unique animal and plant life. Largely untouched by Yemen’s three-year-old war, it is under the control of the internationally-recognised government whose president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is in exile in Saudi Arabia. The storm flooded Socotra’s villages and capsized boats, leaving much of the island without access to communications. Omani authorities said they expected the cyclone to pass over the city of Salalah on Friday night. As wind and rain began to pummel southern Oman during the day, they extended the closure of the city’s airport through Saturday. Mekunu was expected to weaken to a tropical storm before reaching southeastern Saudi Arabia on Saturday, according to the kingdom’s meteorological authority. Yemen is already grappling with one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced three million others, triggered a cholera outbreak and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation, according to the United Nations.

2018-05-25,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Daimler faces a recall order for more than 600,000 diesel-engine vehicles including C-Class and G-Class models because of suspected emissions manipulation, German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday. Germany’s KBA vehicle authority is probing concrete suspicions that the affected cars were fitted with illicit defeat devices designed to manipulate emissions levels, the magazine said, without citing sources. Daimler said on Friday it had not received a formal summons from KBA regarding its C-Class and G-Class models, a precursor to a recall, but declined to comment in detail on the Spiegel report. The report comes a day after the KBA ordered Daimler to recall the Mercedes Vito van model fitted with 1.6 litre diesel Euro-6 engines because of engine control features to reduce exhaust emissions which KBA said breached regulations. Daimler has said it is appealing the KBA findings on the Vito and will go to court if necessary. Since rival Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, German carmakers including VW, Daimler and BMW have faced a backlash against diesel technology in which they have invested billions of euros. After news of the Vito recall emerged, German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer summoned Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche to a meeting on Monday, a spokeswoman for the ministry said. He also asked the KBA to pursue any further leads related to emissions at Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz premium brand. The KBA declined comment.

ALJ is an abbreviation for “administrative law judge.” * The judge’s order, issued on May 21 but not made public until Thursday, applies only to West Whiteland Township, where a sinkhole discovered earlier this year led the PUC to halt service on Mariner East 1 from March 7-May 3. * The judge granted the request to halt work and flows on the pipelines so additional studies can be conducted on the geology in West Whiteland Township, which is about 30 miles (50 km) west of Philadelphia. * ETP had already held up work in the area around the township so it could get a permit modification due to the sinkhole problem. * Officials at ETP were not immediately available for comment. * The earlier shutdown of Mariner East 1 forced shippers, including U.S. gas producers Range Resources Corp and Antero Resources Corp, to find another route for their liquids, according to analysts. * Mariner East 1, which started service in the 1930s transporting refined products from the Philadelphia area to western Pennsylvania, was repurposed and expanded to transport propane in 2014 and ethane in 2016 from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from ETP’s Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia. * ETP has said it expects to complete construction on the $2.5 billion Mariner East 2 pipeline in the third quarter. Mariner East 2 will boost total capacity of the Mariner East project from 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 345,000 bpd and open the pipe to suppliers in Ohio and West Virginia. * At the same time ETP is building Mariner East 2, it is also working on Mariner East 2X, which will add another 250,000 barrels to the Mariner East project. ETP has said it expects to complete Mariner East 2X by the middle of 2019.

2018-05-25,"* Move would reduce over-compliance with agreed production cuts * Oil price up almost 20 percent since end of last year * Talks among Saudi Arabia, Russia, UAE in St. Petersburg (Adds Novak quote, details on supply curbs) By Katya Golubkova, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Rania El Gamal ST PETERSBURG/DUBAI, May 25 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil production by some 1 million barrels a day, sources said, while OPEC’s chief said a complaint from U.S. President Donald Trump over high prices had triggered the idea of upping output. Riyadh and Moscow are prepared to ease output cuts to calm consumer worries about supply adequacy, their energy ministers said on Friday, with Saudi Arabia’s Khalid al-Falih adding that any such move would be gradual so as not to shock the market. Raising production would ease 17 months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that a price rally has gone too far, with oil having hit its highest since late 2014 at $80.50 a barrel this month. OPEC began a discussion about easing production cuts following a critical tweet from Trump, OPEC’s Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said. Trump tweeted last month that OPEC had “artificially” boosted oil prices. “We pride ourselves as friends of the United States,” Barkindo told a panel with the Saudi and Russian energy ministers in St. Petersburg at Russia’s main economic forum. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia have agreed to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) through 2018 to reduce global stocks, but the inventory overhang is now near OPEC’s target. In April, pact participants cut production by 52 percent more than required, with falling output from crisis-hit Venezuela helping OPEC deliver a bigger reduction than intended. Sources familiar with the matter said an increase of about 1 million bpd would lower compliance to 100 percent of the agreed level. Barkindo also said it was not unusual for the United States to put pressure on OPEC as some U.S. energy secretaries had asked the producer group to help lower prices in the past. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent towards $77 a barrel on Friday as Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said current cuts were in reality 2.7 million bpd due to a drop in Venezuelan production - somewhere around 1 million bpd higher than the initially agreed reductions. Novak declined to say, however, whether OPEC and Russia would decide to boost output by 1 million bpd at their next meeting in June. “The moment is coming when we should consider assessing ways to exit the deal very seriously and gradually ease quotas on output cuts,” Novak said in televised comments. Initial talks are being led by the energy ministers of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and Russia at St. Petersburg this week along with their counterpart from the United Arab Emirates, which holds the OPEC presidency this year, the sources said. OPEC and non-OPEC ministers meet in Vienna on June 22-23, and the final decision will be taken there. Current discussions are aimed at relaxing record-high compliance with the production cuts, the sources said, in an effort to cool the market after oil hit $80 a barrel on concerns over a supply shortage. China has also raised concerns about whether enough oil is being pumped, according to a Saudi statement issued after Energy Minister Falih called China’s energy chief on Friday to discuss cooperation between their countries and to review the oil market. Nur Bekri, administrator of China’s National Energy Administration, told Falih he hopes Saudi Arabia “can take further substantial actions to guarantee adequate supply” in the crude oil market, the Saudi Energy Ministry statement said. While Russia and OPEC benefit from higher oil prices, up almost 20 percent since the end of last year, their voluntary output cuts have opened the door to other producers, such as the U.S. shale sector, to ramp up production and gain market share. The final production number is not set yet as dividing up the extra barrels among deal participants could be tricky, the sources said. “The talks now are to bring compliance down to the 100 percent level, more for OPEC rather than for non-OPEC,” one source said. OPEC may decide to raise oil output as soon as June due to worries over Iranian and Venezuelan supply and after Washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday. However, it is unclear which countries have the capacity to raise output and fill any supply gap other than Gulf oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia, and Russia, the sources said. “Only a few members have the capability to increase production, so implementation will be complicated,” one OPEC source said. So far, OPEC had said it saw no need to ease output restrictions despite concerns among consuming nations that the price rally could undermine demand. The rapid decline in oil inventories and worries about supplies after the U.S. decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with Iran, as well as Venezuela’s collapsing output, were behind the change in OPEC’s thinking.

2018-05-25,"SAO PAULO, May 25 (Reuters) - A nationwide truck drivers’ protest in Brazil was slow to wind down on Friday despite an agreement to end the mobilization, with many highway blockades in place for a fifth straight day rattling sectors from agribusiness to automaking. Negotiators for several trucker groups agreed late on Thursday to immediately suspend the strike for 15 days after the government vowed to stabilize diesel prices, which could cost it 5 billion reais ($1.4 billion) this year. To win over truckers, who began the blockades on Monday to protest high fuel prices, the government also promised to extend for 30 days a 10 percent diesel price cut announced by state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Abcam, a trucking group that was a major force behind the strike, was not among the parties that signed on to the accord, raising questions about how truckers around the country would respond to the agreement. Meanwhile, gas stations remained short of fuel, grocers’ aisles were understocked in many areas and access to the major port of Santos was still blocked. Public transportation and trash collection services have been reduced in major cities such as Sao Paulo because of fuel shortages. Auto production in Brazil, which accounts for about a quarter of its industrial output, ground to a halt on Friday, according to carmakers association ANfavea, in the latest blow to a fragile economic recovery following the worst downturn in decades.

2018-05-25,"* World shares steady but set for second weekly loss * Political risk rears head in Spain * Italian stocks bonds, set for big weekly falls * Turkey lira resumes slide, dollar resumes rise (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - World shares steadied and the dollar resumed its rise on Friday after a wobble caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel a summit with North Korea, though political risk put  Italian markets on track for heavy weekly losses. Equity futures signalled a firmer opening for Wall Street. Markets were soothed by Pyongyang’s measured response to Trump’s Thursday announcement, with Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan expressing hope for a “Trump formula” to resolve the standoff over its nuclear programme. North Korea tensions aside, the appetite for risk was kept in check by concern over Italy’s president opposing the incoming coalition government’s plan to appoint a politically inexperienced eurosceptic as economy minister. Political risk also reared its head in Spain, where a threat of no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sent Spanish stocks and bond prices plunging. However, MSCI’s all-country equity index was flat after three days of losses which put it on track for its second straight week in the red. Asian equities also eked out modest gains. While yields on German and U.S. bonds fell amid the uncertainty, there have been few signs of a wide-ranging sell-off in higher-risk assets - Wall Street’s volatility index stayed near four-month lows. “Market reaction to heightened political risk remains reasonably muted. If they are not global events affecting large swathes of countries in a major way, the calculation is that the impact will be limited,” Indosuez Wealth Management global head of economic research Marie Owens Thomsen said. She cited the example of Turkey and Italy where a stock and bond sell-off has not spilled much into other emerging economies or euro zone states. European shares rose 0.2 percent , ceding some gains after the Spanish news broke. They are set for their first weekly drop since March, pressured by politics and signs the euro bloc’s economic recovery continues to run out of steam. Italian stocks, which saw record outflows in the past week, fell 0.6 percent and were set for their third straight week of losses Spanish stocks fell 2 percent after news of the possible no-confidence motions. European carmakers’ shares which fell heavily after Trump mooted possible tariff increases on imported cars, bounced after the comments drew criticism from U.S. business groups and members of his own party. However, worry about Italy kept the euro under pressure. It fell 0.2 percent against the dollar, putting it on track for the sixth straight week of losses, while the Swiss franc, traditionally seen as a safe-haven, is set for a fourth consecutive weekly gain against the single currency. The dollar rebounded 0.25 percent after touching two-week lows versus a basket of currencies on Thursday. However, it held under this week’s five-month highs. The yen, another currency deemed to be a safe-haven asset, slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar, reversing gains seen after the summit cancellation. “The euro continues to be under pressure especially against the franc as Italian-German spreads are widening,” Societe Generale strategist Alvin Tan said, referring to the premium investors demand to hold Italian bonds compared with safer German Bunds. The spread on 10-year respective bonds widened Friday to 200 basis points (bps), having widened 30 bps this week. German 10-year yields fell almost 5 bps, tracking U.S. Treasuries where yields hovered near two-week lows. For Europe, another potential headache are signs its growth recovery is running out of steam. Some relief on this front was provided by Germany’s Ifo business confidence index which held steady this month after falling for five straight months. However, this week’s PMI business surveys indicated growth was slowing, with expansion at a 20-month low in Germany. UK data meanwhile confirmed first quarter growth at a lacklustre 0.1 percent. With U.S. capital goods orders data due later in the day, Treasury yields stayed well off this month’s seven-year highs. “For many Asian markets, rises in U.S. bond yields would have been a bigger problem (than cancellation of the meeting between Trump and Kim),” Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukino Yamada said. Worries that investors could shift assets from emerging markets to higher-yielding U.S. bonds have been a major headwind for emerging markets this year. Among them, Turkey has been the worst hit over concerns about the central bank’s ability to tame double-digit inflation because of political pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, a self-described “enemy of interest rates”. The Turkish lira has given up most of the gains made after the central bank’s emergency 300 bps rate rise on Wednesday and stood at flat against the dollar. It lost 0.5 percent on Friday and is down almost 15 percent this month. Additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney

2018-05-25,"(Repeats with different slug; no change in text.) * Powers, Iran meet in Vienna for first time since U.S. exit * Iranian official says meeting vital to get guarantees * Saving deal tough as U.S. re-imposes, adds sanctions By Francois Murphy and John Irish VIENNA, May 25 (Reuters) - Iran wants European powers to present it with measures by the end of May to compensate it for the U.S. decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear deal, a senior official said on Friday, and Tehran would decide within weeks whether to quit the accord. The 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers lifted international sanctions on Tehran. In return, Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme. Since President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out last month, European states have been trying to find a way to ensure Iran still gets the economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal. But that has proven difficult, with European companies frightened away by U.S. sanctions. Nations that remain in the agreement - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — began meetings on Friday for the first time since Trump left the pact, but diplomats see limited scope for salvaging it. Their officials will try to flesh out with Iran’s deputy foreign minister a strategy to save the deal by keeping oil and investment flowing. “To be honest with you, we are not confident,” a senior Iranian official told reporters on Friday before the talks. EU leaders have united behind the accord, with Brussels working on measures, including banning EU-based companies from complying with re-imposed U.S. sanctions and urging governments to make money transfers to Iran’s central bank to avoid fines. “We expect the (economic) package to be given to us by the end of May,” the Iranian official said. “I’m sorry to say that we haven’t (seen) the Plan B yet. The Plan B has just started to be figured out.” He said European measures would need to ensure that oil exports did not halt, and that Iran would still have access to the SWIFT international bank payments messaging system. Washington has not only re-imposed sanctions but started to make them even tighter. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday threatened Iran with “the strongest sanctions in history” if it did not change its behaviour in the Middle East. “Pompeo was like taking a cold shower,” said a European diplomat. “We’ll try to cling to the deal, but ... we’re under no illusions.” Iran’s supreme leader set out conditions on Wednesday for Iran to stay in the deal: unless Europe guarantees Iran’s oil sales will not be hurt, Tehran would resume enrichment of nuclear material. He also rejected any new negotiations over Iran’s missile programme, which was not covered in the nuclear deal. The official said time was running out and that if Iran was not satisfied by European efforts, Iran would seek a ministerial meeting before making its decision. Iran has struggled to benefit from the accord so far, partly because of remaining unilateral U.S. sanctions that have deterred major Western investors from doing business with Tehran. Some Western companies have already quit Iran or said they may have to leave because of the new U.S. sanctions. Trump denounced the accord, completed under his predecessor, Barack Obama, because it did not cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its role in Middle East conflicts or what happens after the deal begins to expire in 2025. French President Emmanuel Macron wants to complement the nuclear deal with negotiations between all sides over other issues, an idea cautiously received by Russian President Vladimir Putin during talks in St. Petersburg on Thursday . “Our position is very clear: make the JCPOA (Iran deal) a successful story, then come to us and ask for dialogue or discussion or negotiation on other subjects,” the Iranian official said. European nations share U.S. concerns, but they say that torpedoing the nuclear deal makes them far harder, not easier, to address. They have said that as long as Tehran meets its commitments, they would remain in the deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which polices the pact, said on Thursday that Iran continued to comply with its terms, but could be faster in allowing snap inspections . Its chief, Yukiya Amano, briefed participants before Friday’s meeting.

2018-05-25,"* Move would reduce over-compliance with agreed production cuts * Oil price up almost 20 percent since end of last year * Talks among Saudi Arabia, Russia, UAE in St. Petersburg (Adds graphics) By Rania El Gamal, Olesya Astakhova and Alex Lawler DUBAI/MOSCOW/LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil output by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd), easing 17 months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that a price rally has gone too far, sources familiar with the matter said. Such an increase would bring compliance with agreed supply curbs down to 100 percent from April’s level of around 152 percent, the sources said. The initial talks are being led by the energy ministers of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and Russia at St. Petersburg this week along with their counterpart from the United Arab Emirates, which holds the OPEC presidency this year, the sources said. OPEC and non-OPEC ministers meet next in Vienna on June 22-23, and the final decision will be taken there. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to curb output by about 1.8 million bpd until the end of 2018 to reduce global stocks, but the inventory overhang is now near OPEC’s target. The current discussions are aimed at relaxing record-high compliance with the production cuts, the sources said, in an effort to cool the market after oil hit $80 a barrel on concerns over a supply shortage. While Russia and OPEC benefit from higher oil prices, up almost 20 percent since the end of last year, their voluntary output cuts have opened the door to other producers, such as the U.S. shale sector, to ramp up production and gain market share. The final production number is not set yet as dividing up the extra barrels among deal participants could be tricky, the sources said. “The talks now are to bring compliance down to the 100 percent level, more for OPEC rather than for non-OPEC,” one source said. OPEC may decide to raise oil output as soon as June due to worries over Iranian and Venezuelan supply and after Washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday. However, it is unclear which countries have the capacity to raise output and fill any supply gap other than Gulf oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia, and Russia, the sources said. “Only a few members have the capability to increase production, so implementation will be complicated,” one OPEC source said. OPEC’s compliance with the output deal reached unprecedented levels in recent months, meaning it had cut well above target. Falling Venezuelan output due to an economic crisis has helped OPEC deliver a bigger cut than intended. So far, OPEC had said it saw no need to ease output restrictions despite concerns among consuming nations that the price rally could undermine demand. The rapid decline in oil inventories and worries about supplies after the U.S. decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with Iran, as well as Venezuela’s collapsing output, were behind the change in OPEC’s thinking. Concerns raised by the United States that oil prices were too high also made the exporting group start internal discussions, OPEC sources familiar with the matter have said. U.S. President Donald Trump, whose country is a major oil producer but is not part of the supply-cutting pact, last month said OPEC had “artificially” boosted oil prices.

2018-05-25,"YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - When Ben Lecomte stepped onto land for the first time after swimming across the Atlantic Ocean in 1998, he told himself ‘never again’. Yet, 20 years on, Lecomte is attempting an even more daunting challenge as he looks to become the first person to swim across the Pacific Ocean, covering 9,100 kilometres.  On Tuesday, Lecomte and his nine-person support team will set out from Tokyo on an epic expedition expected to last more than six months and see the Frenchman arrive in San Francisco. “I knew it was something that was part of me and my identity,” Lecomte told Reuters as his team undertook the final preparations to the support yacht in Yokohama’s Bayside Marina on Friday.  “The way I look at it is as a way to express myself. “It didn’t happen very soon after the Atlantic (swim) because I got married, I had children, so I put that aside. But I knew I was going to come back to that project eventually.” The 50-year-old’s plan is to swim for eight hours a day, as well as consume over 8,000 calories, as he undertakes an extraordinary journey that is part-adventure and part-scientific experiment. Much of Lecomte's backing comes from scientific publisher Seeker.com www.seeker.com, who will be providing daily updates on his progress as well as promoting research on the data collected by the support team. More than 27 different scientific organizations, some medical and some oceanographic, will be benefiting from the data gathered during the expedition. Much of the research will focus on plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean, specifically the build-up of ‘plastic smog’ containing billions of pieces of microplastic. There is increasing concern among scientists about the effect of pervasive plastic pollution on marine ecosystems. In particular, they are worried about microplastic particles, bits measuring no more than two-tenths of an inch (5 mm), which come from large plastic trash that has fragmented into smaller pieces or microbeads in products like facial soap, body wash and toothpaste. For Lecomte, raising awareness of these issues is more important than setting any record. “I remember my father and he was the one who taught me how to swim in the Atlantic. I remember times when we would go on the beach and walk and never see any plastic. Now, everywhere I go, on the beach I see plastic everywhere,” said Lecomte.  “If we are all aware of it then after it is much easier to take action and to change our behaviour because the solution is in our hands. We know what we have to do.” The Frenchman, whose Atlantic crossing was never ratified by Guinness World Records because it cannot be fully verified that he resumed his swims in the exact point he stopped them the day before, believes the mental battle will be tougher than the physical endurance. “It is mind over matter,” said Lecomte, who is also an architectural consultant based in Austin, Texas when not in the water. “To do the physical aspect of it, sure it is difficult and all that but what is much more difficult is to be in that very hostile environment, to do that days in and days out, to push you and to push your limits, then the mind has to be super strong.” To overcome this, Lecomte will make a strict plan for what he will think about for eight hours in the water each day. “The worst thing that can happen is not knowing what you are going to do with your mind and going to the wrong place,” he said.

2018-05-25,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to accept a fitness challenge from one of the nation’s top cricketers, Virat Kohli, has been seized on by opposition politicians who say the leader should be spending time on other challenges - such as reducing fuel prices and creating jobs. The nation’s sport minister and an Olympic medallist for shooting, Rajyavardhan Rathore, said Modi was the inspiration for the campaign to get Indians to be fitter when it was launched on Tuesday under the Hindi-English slogan “#HumFitTohIndiaFit” (If we are fit, India is fit.”).  “Challenge accepted, Virat! I will be sharing my own #FitnessChallenge video soon,” tweeted Modi, after the batsman had issued his challenge to the prime minister. Modi, who is reputed to rise at dawn to do yoga before starting work, pushed for June 21 to be celebrated as the International Day of Yoga soon after winning power in 2014, lending his political weight to an industry that has grown up around the ancient physical and spiritual discipline. The fitness challenge is partly a response to India’s increasing problem with obesity. But with a general election due by next May, the opposition was quick to politicise the matter. Opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, also a fitness enthusiast, dared Modi, one of most followed world leaders on Twitter, to take on a fuel challenge. “Reduce fuel prices or the Congress will do a nationwide agitation and force you to do so,” Gandhi tweeted. Prices of diesel and petrol in India have surged to a record high, stoking opposition criticism of Modi’s administration for causing hardship to ordinary people. The rise is only partly because global oil prices have risen in recent weeks - taxes on the fuel have also climbed in recent years. Tejashwi Yadav, chief of regional party Rahtriya Janata Dal, challenged Modi to provide more jobs for the nation’s youth, relief to farmers and to promise safety for minorities. Meantime, Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor hurled a “compassion challenge” to the PM through Twitter because Modi has been silent on the shooting this week of 13 people in protests against pollution by a copper smelter in Thoothukudi in southern Tamil Nadu state. Modi isn’t the only one facing sniping because of the challenge. Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan, who filmed in selfie mode his commute from home to office on a bicycle, after accepting the challenge, was slammed for violating traffic rules by some Twitter users.

Rosneft said it would conduct a pre-FEED (front engineering and design) of a gas pipeline in Kurdistan as part of its plan to build an integrated gas business value chain in the region. It said it would focus on partnerships and third-party project financing for gas projects in Kurdistan. Rosneft has agreed to invest billions of dollars in Kurdistan’s oil projects in the past two years including securing control of the region’s oil pipeline. That pipeline gave Rosneft access to crucial infrastructure that ships most of the region’s oil to global markets via Turkish territory. It made the Kremlin-controlled firm the biggest investor in the region by far, turning Erbil, traditionally a strong U.S. ally, into an important partner for Moscow as Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to expand influence in the Middle East. Russia chose not to oppose the Kurdistan Regional Government’s failed independence referendum last year, which was dismissed as illegal by Baghdad and caused alarm in Washington, the European Union, Iran and Turkey. Rosneft also said it aimed to produce up to 10,000 barrels per day of oil in Kurdistan by the end of this year.

2018-05-25,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Beijing outlined new measures on Friday to improve the way it recycles and disposes of solid waste like bricks and concrete and prevent illegal dumping, in a bid to tackle one of China’s biggest pollution problems. New mechanisms and preferential policies, including tax exemptions, would encourage the “comprehensive utilization” of waste, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said in a statement. It would encourage firms to “standardize, make green and scale up” the complete recycling of products, including materials used in construction such as cement, bricks, and fire retardants, as well as mine slag and tailings, and porcelain. Solid waste has emerged as one of China’s biggest environmental priorities as it tries to put an end to illegal dumping and rehabilitate land and water sources contaminated by hazardous chemicals or heavy metals. According to a study published by the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2015, as many as 100,000 industrial enterprises had closed or relocated since 2001, leaving behind huge amounts of untreated waste. It said as much as 8 percent of China’s arable land was contaminated by heavy metals.   China’s ministries have been scrambling to respond to a speech by President Xi Jinping last Saturday, where he vowed to use the full might of the ruling Communist Party to tackle long-standing environmental problems. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) also published new measures on Tuesday to crack down on the illegal transportation and dumping of solid waste. It called for action to improve China’s ability to recycle and dispose of hazardous materials. The MEE said in March that there were around 9 million sources of pollution in China, including 7.4 million industrial sources. The number has risen by more than half in just eight years. China has also banned the import of many types of waste material, with customs authorities now cracking down on illegal smuggling, as it tries to encourage recyclers to tackle rising levels of domestic waste instead.

2018-05-25,"* ONGC expects to quadruple Deendayal output by January 2019 * Gas output from field could grow to 3 mln cubic metres a day * Increase to give ONGC 3rd straight year of gas output gain By Promit Mukherjee MUMBAI, May 25 (Reuters) - India’s state-owned exploration company Oil and Natural Gas Corp will by early 2019 quadruple the output from an offshore gas block in the Bay of Bengal that it spent a billion dollars on last year, according to a senior ONGC official. Output from the Deendayal natural gas block off India’s east coast will reach as high as a million standard cubic metres per day by January 2019, according to Rajesh Kakkar, head of ONGC’s offshore division. ONGC bought the Deendayal field in 2017 from state-owned company Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) while it was still undergoing test runs for commercial gas production. The increase in production is marginal against India’s total consumption, although Kakkar said the field has a potential to go up to 3 million cubic metres a day, which would make up about 4 percent of ONGC’s total output. “The project will also help us in developing the adjoining gas fields in the KG (Krishna-Godavari) basin at lesser capex (capital expenditure) and time,” said Kakkar. ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd, along with partner BP Plc, are developing several natural gas discoveries in the KG basin. These discoveries could contribute up to 50 million cubic metres of daily output, or about a third of India’s current demand. ONGC, which meets up to 40 percent of India’s total natural gas demand, had been saddled with ageing fields and dropping production for almost a decade. But the company registered a marginal jump in production in fiscal 2016/17, and then production increased by another 6 percent last year in the year through March 2018. Analysts said the increase in output from the Deendayal field will help ONGC in clocking an increased overall output in the current fiscal year as well. The Deendayal gas field was discovered in 2005. The project was a flagship gas initiative of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who at the time was chief minister of Gujarat state on India’s west coast. Modi said then that the field held up to 20 trillion cubic feet (560 billion cubic meters) of natural gas, although delays and cost overruns in developing the field had some analysts questioning the quality of the investment for ONGC. ONGC, however, will be able to monetise the gas at a higher price and with more marketing freedom under new rules meant to encourage the development of frontier offshore reserves. Prime Minister Modi has set a target of increasing the share of natural gas in India’s energy mix to 15 percent by 2030, from 6.5 percent now. Modi also wants to cut down on energy imports, especially crude oil. India consumed around 145 million cubic metres of natural gas a day, nearly 50 percent of it imported, in 2017/18. The government has projected India’s potential demand at nearly 500 million cubic metres of gas a day.

2018-05-25,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A political row over Europe’s energy security is not hindering preparatory work for the subsea Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, with dredging work starting off the Baltic coast last week. The new pipeline, an initiative of Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and five European companies, will double Russia’s export capacity of 55 billion cubic metres to Germany. However, eastern European and Baltic states fear it will increase Europe’s reliance on Russian gas and undermine Ukraine’s lucrative gas transit route. The United States also opposes it. “The status of the project is on track and we have fulfilled all the conditions needed to start laying the pipeline in the Baltic in 2018 as planned,” said spokesman Jens Mueller, adding the consortium had ‘taken note’ of the political discussions. Dredgers started preparatory work for a trench for the two pipeline strings in the Greifswald bay off Germany’s Baltic coast last week. Gas is due to start flowing at the end of 2019. The pipeline’s construction schedule has not been affected by the U.S. contention that it could undermine Europe’s energy security, Nord Stream 2’s technical director, Sergey Serdyukov, told reporters in St. Petersburg on Friday. He said construction of the pipeline was set to start in July as planned. [nR4N1SS01G] Chancellor Angela Merkel had long argued the project was purely commercial but last month she acknowledged there were political considerations. In talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, she made clear that Ukraine must be able to continue to earn revenue from gas transit. Nord Stream argues that there is room for both as European gas demand is likely to rise. “More gas will be needed. All transport routes will be needed,” said Mueller. Gazprom is taking on half the planned costs of some 9.5 billion euros ($11 billion). The rest is divided between five European energy companies: BASF’s (BASFn.DE) Wintershall and E.ON spinoff Uniper (UN01.DE), Shell (RDSa.L), OMV (OMVV.VI) and Engie (ENGIE.PA).

2018-05-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. oil export infrastructure is straining to keep up as the country’s crude oil exports hit new highs and China snaps up more of it than ever before. U.S. crude production has surged to a record 10.7 million barrels a day, driven largely by growth from the Permian shale patch in West Texas, which pumps more than 3 million bpd. However, the infrastructure to move it abroad is lagging, even as U.S. prices are well below the Brent benchmark, a discount that sits just off three-year highs at $8.09 per barrel. WTCLc1-LCOc1 U.S. crude exports peaked at 2.6 million bpd two weeks ago, but are expected to keep rising.  No definitive data are available on how much crude the United States can export, though analysts estimate a nationwide capacity of 3.5 million to 4 million bpd. Most terminal operators and companies do not disclose capacity, and the U.S. Energy Department does not track it. “So far, export capacity is keeping pace, but we are walking a tightrope,” said Bernadette Johnson, vice president at DrillingInfo. That capacity may begin to be tested next month, as Sinopec (600028.SS), Asia’s largest refiner, bought a record 16 million barrels, or about 533,000 bpd of U.S. crude, to load in June, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. For the last six months of available data, ending in February, the United States only exported about 332,000 bpd to China. For a graphic on U.S. oil exports, click reut.rs/2LphJhb Analysts are concerned about how quickly the crude terminals at Gulf Coast ports, many initially designed for imports, can shift to handling exports. Only the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port can handle supertanker exports, but it only started testing in February. The supertankers, known as VLCCs or very large crude carriers, can handle some 2 million barrels of oil - the amount preferred by Asian buyers with bigger ports. “There’s only one dock on the Gulf Coast that can handle a VLCC deepwater, and that’s LOOP. And the LOOP has only started to export,” said Sandy Fielden, director of research in commodities and energy at Morningstar.      Port of Corpus Christi in Texas is developing its Harbor Island port, which will accommodate 120 VLCCs per year, said Jarl Pedersen, chief commercial officer at the port, with a targeted completion of late 2020.  Kpler, a cargo tracking service, on Thursday estimated that up to 4.8 million bpd can be moved from the top crude-exporting ports of Corpus Christi, Houston, Port Arthur and New Orleans. Their estimate in October was 3.2 million bpd. PIRA Energy Group put the U.S. overall crude export capacity at 3.5 million bpd, while Morningstar’s estimate is 3.8 million bpd at most.  In addition to port constraints, inadequate pipeline space has created a glut of supply in west Texas, pushing the principle cash grade there WTC-WTM to a $13 discount to benchmark U.S. crude futures this month, the biggest in 3-1/2 years. “The constraint is really the pipeline coming down from the Permian to Corpus Christi,” said Pedersen. However, the ship channel still needs to be deepened, a $320 million project in development with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. There is only 3.4 million bpd of pipeline capacity while total output from tight oil and legacy production from vertical wells in the Permian is at more than 4.2 million bpd, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “The combined volumes mean that the infrastructure is crammed full – there’s little or no room for incremental volumes,” R.T. Dukes, head of U.S. Lower 48 oil supply at Wood Mackenzie said in a note. About 300,000 bpd of new pipeline capacity is due to come on by end January, but “it’s really from next summer that we’ll see big new capacity,” Dukes said. In the second half of 2019, another 1.25 million bpd will be added, lifting total capacity up to 5 million bpd, he said. “That’s when the big discount of WTI at Midland will narrow,” Dukes said.

North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said Pyongyang still hoped for a “Trump formula” to resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons programme, noting that the country was open to resolving issues with the United States. European shares are expected to recover with spread betters seeing Britain’s FTSE, France’s CAC and Germany’s Dax rising 0.5-0.6 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan managed to eke out 0.1 percent gains, while South Korea’s Kospi pared much of its earlier loss of 0.9 percent to last trade down 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was up 0.1 percent. “Insofar as the North Koreans do not resume testing missiles, which would come as a surprise as it would forestall even a future round of peace talks, I do not see this setback as reigniting a prolonged bout of risk aversion towards South Korean assets,” said Aninda Mitra, senior sovereign analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management in Singapore. On Wall Street the S&P 500 ended 0.2 percent lower on Thursday, though it clawed back a large part of its earlier loss of 0.95 percent. Even before the reaction from Pyongyang, there were no immediate signs of widespread investor panic with Wall Street’s volatility index, seen as a gauge of investors’ fears, ending at a four-month low on Thursday. Analysts said that level of calm reflected investors becoming accustomed to Trump’s dramatic negotiation style, in which he makes drastic calls before making compromises, and are increasingly seeing his North Korea’s Kim Jong Un adopt a similar approach. “I suspect they couldn’t agree on denuclearisation. But looking at comments from the both sides, none of them is ruling out holding a meeting in the future. So I do not expect to see an immediate escalation in military tension,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Adding to political jitters was Trump’s raising the spectre of high U.S. tariffs on imported cars, reigniting fears of a trade war, although some investors see this as a Trump tactic to get better deals from big car-exporting countries. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dipped to as low as 2.955 percent on Thursday as bond prices rose before it ticked back to 2.992 percent in Asia on Friday. It is still off a seven-year high of 3.128 percent hit a week ago. “For many Asian markets, rises in U.S. bond yields would have been a bigger problem (than cancellation of the meeting between Trump and Kim),” said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. Worries that investors could shift assets from emerging markets to higher-yielding U.S. bonds have been a major headwind for emerging markets this year. Among them, Turkey has been the worst hit over concerns about the central bank’s ability to tame double-digit inflation because of political pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan, a self-described “enemy of interest rates”. The Turkish lira gave up a large chunk of the gains it made after the central bank raised interest rates by 300 points on Wednesday, falling 1.1 percent in Asia on Friday. It has fallen almost 15 percent so far this month. Among major currencies, the yen slipped in Asia after hitting a two-week high against the dollar on Thursday in a reflex flight-to-safety reaction to Trump’s manouevres. The dollar traded at 109.55 yen, up 0.3 percent for the day. But it was still off Monday’s four-month high of 111.395 yen and looks set to post its first weekly loss in nine weeks. The yen is seen as a safe haven because of Japan’s status as the world’s largest net creditor nation. The dollar extended its losses against the Swiss franc to hit 0.9886 franc overnight, its lowest level since April, before steadying at 0.9923. The euro traded at $1.1709, slightly above its six-month low of $1.1676 touched on Wednesday, on course to mark its sixth consecutive declining week. The currency was dogged by worries of a new coalition government in Italy to be formed by two anti-establishment parties, as well as mounting signs of an economic slowdown in the euro zone. Oil prices slipped, partly on speculation reduced supplies from Venezuela and Iran could prompt the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to wind down output cuts in place since the start of 2017. Russia hinted it may gradually increase output, after having withheld supplies in concert with the OPEC producer cartel since 2017. OPEC may decide in June to lift output to make up for reduced supply from crisis-hit Venezuela and Iran, which was stung by the U.S. decision to withdraw from a multilateral nuclear arms control deal, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters. Brent crude futures stood at $78.61 a barrel, down 0.23 percent on Friday after a 1.27 percent loss the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were down 0.17 percent at $70.59 per barrel. They lost 1.57 percent on Thursday. Additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney

2018-05-25,"BANGKOK/MANILA (Reuters) - Sujinda Cherdchai, who represents inter-regional bus operators in Thailand, told government officials this week that without any government support her industry has two options: higher fares or cutting services for some routes. One day later, the government, faced with sluggish domestic demand and high household debt, said it will use money from the 30 billion baht ($933.7 million) state oil fund, which is separate from the central budget, to subsidise fuel prices. “If retail oil prices rise 1 baht, the fund will help 0.50 baht,” Energy Minister Siri Jirapongphan said on Tuesday. A tough balancing act between scaling down business,  passing some rising costs to consumers and government interventions through subsidies or excise duty cuts is taking place across Asia, which is by far the worst hit region by a surge in oil prices LCOc1 to around $80 per barrel, a level not seen since 2014. For a graphic on oil production vs. consumption, click reut.rs/2HJNm2v Growth, budgets and inflation levels are at risk.

Cebu Air Inc (CEB.PS), operator of Cebu Pacific, says its oil price hedging strategy helped, but it still had to increase average fare prices by 10 percent in the first quarter after a 3.8 percent increase for the whole of 2017. “Coupled with the weakening peso, the rise in fuel cost has seen our expenses increase by double-digits,” said Charo Logarta-Lagamon, the airline’s director for corporate communications, adding that half of the cost was transferred to customers. Joe Zaldarriaga, spokesman of Manila Electric Company (MER.PS), the Philippines’ largest power distributor also known as Meralco, says if oil prices stay at $80, the cost of the power it buys from its biggest supplier may rise 10 percent. This may be passed on to consumers, who already pay the highest electricity prices in the region, within a few months, he said. In India, domestic demand has been weaker than in the Philippines after the implementation of a goods and services tax and the removal of large banknotes from circulation, and some companies are unable to raise prices. Uday Wagh, who runs a taxi business in the western Maharashtra state, says he is already losing money due to  advance bookings made when fuel was cheaper. “We can’t pass higher prices to customers,” Wagh said. “Business in summers is usually good due to weddings and school vacations, but this year it is subdued.” For a graphic on fuel costs vs. income, click reut.rs/2KwrNDI Economists say higher operational costs will eventually prompt companies to delay investment or trim activity. But the growth impact will take time to materialise. “It’s not like we can close flight (routes) or shorten the number of flights right away,” an official from South Korea’s Asiana Airlines (020560.KS) said, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.  Unlike Thailand, which is enjoying a boom in tourism and runs a current account surplus, governments in India, Philippines and Indonesia have little room to help businesses and consumers. But the pressure is there.

The group’s president, Rashesh Shah, acknowledged that for every rupee cut from excise duties, potential budget revenue losses could reach 0.1 percent of gross domestic product, but argued that otherwise for every $10 increase in oil prices, economic growth could slow 0.2-0.3 percentage points. “While such a move will have an implication on the fiscal revenues at this juncture, there is a need to do the fine balancing act,” Shah said. On Monday, India’s oil minister said he was looking at ways to keep prices in check, without giving details. In Indonesia, where President Joko Widodo also runs for a new mandate next year, the government has pledged to keep electricity and diesel prices steady until 2019, with state-owned firm Pertamina shouldering the burden.

Singapore, where economic growth figures beat expectations on Thursday, could be among beneficiaries, although the recovery is likely to be gradual. “There is growing optimism in the O&M (offshore and marine) industry underpinned by the rise in oil prices,” Chris Ong, CEO of the offshore and marine unit of Singaporean conglomerate Keppel (KPLM.SI), told Reuters.   “However, the drilling rig market continues to suffer from a supply overhang and will take some time before it fully recovers.” Another Singaporean company, Sembcorp Marine (SCMN.SI), which has cut jobs and other costs since the downturn, also said in an emailed statement the market faced oversupply but added it was now receiving “an encouraging pipeline of enquiries and tenders for innovative engineering solutions.” Reporting by Orathai Sriring in BANGKOK, Enrico Dela Cruz and Karen Lema in MANILA, Rajendra Jadhav in MUMBAI, Gayatri Suroyo in JAKARTA, Dahee Kim and Jane Chung in SEOUL and Aradhana Aravindan in SINGAPORE; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/asia-economy-oil/slower-growth-higher-prices-or-more-subsidies-asias-oil-related-trilemma-idUKL5N1SU2LV,25 May 2018,"* Companies face choice of trimming business or raising

2018-05-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Filling the fuel tank for vacation driving this summer will be pricier than it has been in nearly four years for American motorists, as gasoline prices nationwide rise toward the expected average seasonal price of $3 a gallon.  Lower-income consumers could be most likely to rethink their driving habits as pump prices rise, the American Automobile Association said. Prices ease as the peak summer season ends around September, AAA said, but they could remain at seasonal highs not seen since 2014.  “For consumers who have constrained budgets, they won’t be able to cope with the additional shock to their household budget after a certain point,” said Devin Gladden, a spokesperson for AAA. This could crimp total U.S. gasoline demand, which has risen for five straight years, even though the current price level does not approach 2008, when the average gallon topped $4.  On the eve of the long Memorial Day holiday weekend that kicks off summer driving season, analysts do not expect gasoline demand to suffer much as of yet. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects gasoline consumption to be unchanged in 2018 from 2017 as population and employment growth supports demand, said Tim Hess, a product manager for the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook. Global benchmark Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 have surged nearly 50 percent over the last year as demand has risen sharply while production has been restricted by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major exporters.  This past week, Brent topped $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014, and the gasoline futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange RBc1 hit its highest since October 2014. Whether that starts to pinch consumer spending depends on how long prices remain elevated, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch economists. The investment bank, in a note last week, said a sustained increase in oil to $80 or $100 a barrel would have a more pronounced effect on economic growth than a temporary spike.  As of Thursday, the average gasoline price was $2.961 a gallon nationwide, according to AAA, compared with $2.367 a year ago. The average exceeds $2.99 a gallon in 17 states, up from just 10 states two weeks ago. Prices for gasoline have already affected some consumer spending habits. U.S. retail sales increased marginally in April as rising gasoline prices cut into discretionary spending. Consumers could respond to higher prices by combining trips to the grocery store or carpooling, said Matthew Lewis, an associate professor of economics at Clemson University. However, much of gasoline demand is inelastic, Lewis said. “People will cut back, but not that much, which means they’re still driving a lot and they’re paying more to do it,” Lewis said, adding that for a 10 percent gasoline price increase, demand typically drops only about 3 to 3.5 percent. However, people who buy gasoline for the physical market have become more cautious about demand, a products trader said. Cash prices for Gulf Coast A2 gasoline, a grade that often reflects the U.S. domestic market, have fallen about 2 cents per gallon below the futures contract on NYMEX in the past week and a half.

2018-05-25,"* MSCI almost flat, South Korea shares pare much of losses * North Korea’s conciliatory stance soothes nerves * Vix at 4-month low as investors used to Trump tactics * Oil dips on speculation output cuts may be relaxed By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, May 25 (Reuters) - Market sentiment was a little shaky on Friday with Asian shares on the defensive after U.S. President Donald Trump scrapped a key summit with North Korea, though investors’ fears were calmed by Pyongyang’s measured response to the cancellation. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said Pyongyang still hoped for a “Trump formula” to resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons programme, noting that North Korea was open to resolving issues with the United States. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was almost flat, while South Korea’s Kospi pared much of its earlier loss of 0.9 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was up 0.1 percent. On Wall Street the S&P 500 ended 0.2 percent lower on Thursday, though it clawed back a large part of its earlier loss of 0.95 percent. Even before the reaction from Pyongyang, there were no immediate signs of widespread investor panic with Wall Street’s volatility index, seen as a gauge of investors’ fears, ending at a four-month low on Thursday. Analysts said that level of calm reflected investors becoming accustomed to Trump’s dramatic negotiation style, in which he makes drastic calls before making compromises, and are increasingly seeing his North Korea’s Kim Jong Un adopt a similar approach. “I suspect they couldn’t agree on denuclearisation. But looking at comments from the both sides, none of them is ruling out holding a meeting in the future. So I do not expect to see an immediate escalation in military tension,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Adding to political jitters was Trump’s raising the spectre of high U.S. tariffs on imported cars, reigniting fears of a trade war, although some investors see this as a Trump tactic to get better deals from big car-exporting countries. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dipped to as low as 2.955 percent on Thursday as bond prices rose before it ticked back to 2.992 percent in Asia on Friday. It is still off a seven-year high of 3.128 percent hit a week ago. “For many Asian markets, rises in U.S. bond yields would have been a bigger problem (than cancellation of the meeting between Trump and Kim),” said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. Worries that investors could shift assets from emerging markets to higher-yielding U.S. bonds have been a major headwind for emerging markets. The yen slipped in Asia after hitting a two-week high against the dollar on Thursday in a reflex flight-to-safety reaction to Trump’s manouevres. The dollar traded at 109.60 yen, up 0.3 percent for the day. But it was still off Monday’s four-month high of 111.395 yen and looks set to post its first weekly loss in nine weeks. The yen is seen as a safe haven because of Japan’s status as the world’s largest net creditor nation. The dollar extended its losses against the Swiss franc to hit 0.9886 franc overnight, its lowest level since April, before steadying at 0.9921. The euro traded at $1.1712, slightly above its six-month low of $1.1676 touched on Wednesday, on course to mark its sixth consecutive declining week. The currency was dogged by worries of a new coalition government in Italy to be formed by two anti-establishment parties, as well as mounting signs of an economic slowdown in the euro zone. Among emerging market currencies, the Turkish lira tumbled again, giving up a large chunk of the gains it made after the central bank raised interest rates by 300 points on Wednesday. The lira has been hit by concerns about the central bank’s ability to tame double-digit inflation, particularly after President Tayyip Erdogan — a self-described “enemy of interest rates” — said he expected to assert more policy control after June 24 elections. The lira fell 1.5 percent in Asia on Friday. Oil prices slipped, partly on speculation reduced supplies from Venezuela and Iran could prompt the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to wind down output cuts in place since the start of 2017. Russia hinted it may gradually increase output, after having withheld supplies in concert with the OPEC producer cartel since 2017. OPEC may decide in June to lift output to make up for reduced supply from crisis-hit Venezuela and Iran, which was stung by the U.S. decision to withdraw from a multilateral nuclear arms control deal, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters. Brent crude futures stood at $78.68 a barrel, down 0.15 percent on Friday after a 1.27 percent loss the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures were little changed at $70.66 per barrel. They lost 1.57 percent on Thursday.

2018-05-25,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will visit China early next month for another round of talks amid ongoing trade frictions between the world’s two largest economies. Ross will visit China from June 2 to June 4, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday, adding that Vice Premier Liu He, China’s chief negotiator in the trade dispute, had spoken with Ross over the phone. It gave no further details. The trade dispute took on added complexity this week when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a national security investigation into imports of cars and trucks, a probe that could lead to tariffs against China as well as key U.S. allies such as Canada, Mexico, Japan and Germany. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Ross is aiming to negotiate “a framework” that could then turn into “binding agreements ... between companies.” In the last round of talks in Washington in mid-May, China agreed to ramp up purchases of U.S. agriculture and energy products, and the two sides worked towards a possible reprieve for ZTE Corp (000063.SZ)(0763.HK) from a U.S. ban on American companies supplying the Chinese maker of telecoms equipment. The developments and constructive comments from both sides eased fears that the United States and China could plunge into a trade war, but President Donald Trump said this week that any deal would need “a different structure,” fueling uncertainty over the negotiations. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods to combat what he says is Beijing’s misappropriation of U.S. technology through joint venture requirements and other policies. Beijing has threatened equal retaliation, including tariffs on some of its largest U.S. imports, including aircraft, soybeans and autos.

2018-05-25,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s government struck a deal with truck drivers on Thursday to suspend a four-day protest that crippled swathes of the Latin America’s largest economy, promising changes to diesel pricing that could leave it footing a 5 billion reais ($1.37 billion) bill this year. Truckers agreed to immediately suspend the strike for 15 days, government ministers told reporters, appearing alongside representatives of truckers’ groups. “We need all of you truckers to get back to work. Brazil needs you,” said Eliseu Padilha, President Michel Temer’s chief of staff, while announcing the deal at the presidential palace in Brasilia.      Urgency to broker a solution mounted as lack of deliveries led to perishable items disappearing from store shelves, fuel shortages threatening airports and public transport, and the country’s automakers association Anfavea announcing that all vehicle production had been halted for Friday. The accord could leave the government with a bill of up to 5 billion reais a year to compensate state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA for any losses under a scheme to stabilize prices, according to government ministers. Under the deal, a 10-percent price cut for diesel announced by Petrobras on Wednesday will be extended to 30 days, with the government compensating the company for costs beyond the originally announced 15-day period. The price will then be re-evaluated every 30 days, replacing the policy of daily price changes, Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia said at the news conference. Petrobras will be compensated by Brazil’s treasury when the set price for diesel falls below the refinery price, he said, estimating a cost of 700 million reais a month until the end of the year. Petrobras shares plunged 14 percent earlier in the day after the firm initially slashed diesel prices, raising investor concerns of a return to government interference in the company that saw it run up huge losses and debts under ex-President Dilma Rousseff. Petrobras said in a statement that the accord was “highly positive and an unquestionable gain for the company.”  The company said the reimbursement provided by the government would “fully preserve” the company’s pricing policy. As the strike lifts, the country will not return to normal immediately. Truckers group Abcam said prior to the accord that it would take up to 12 days to normalize cargo deliveries in Brazil once demonstrations end.  Abcam, a major force behind the strike, did not sign onto the government accord, differing from many other truckers’ groups. Changes proposed in the accord, which also includes tax cuts on diesel, will still require congressional approval. Lawmakers are expected to take up the measures next week. Participation in the demonstrations had swollen to around a million truck drivers as trucking companies joined the movement kicked off by independent truck owners, according to Abcam. The group said there were about 330 blockades in 23 of 26 Brazilian states. The toll also mounted in industries from automaking and meat processing to aviation and agribusiness as the protests froze deliveries of fuel, feed and other essential inputs, threatening economic activity and exports of soft commodities. Poultry and pork processors association ABPA said 120 plants had halted production for lack of feed and storage space, up from 78 previously. At Paranaguá port, Brazil’s second-largest grain export hub, the protests impeded 1,000 trucks from delivering goods over two days, Brazil’s largest cooperative Coamo Agroindustrial said on Thursday.  Brazil’s top coffee exporter Cooxupé on Thursday warned foreign clients about possible shipping delays due to the truckers’ protests.          Brazil’s weak recovery from the deepest recession in decades could have been damaged if protests had lasted weeks, according to a senior member of the government’s economic team on condition of anonymity. Prior to the accord, automakers association Anfavea announced plans for all car production to halt starting Friday,  with the sector accounting for roughly 25 percent of Brazil’s industrial output alone potentially dealing a major blow to the economy.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked down. South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.65 percent. Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.3 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended 0.2 percent lower on Thursday, though it clawed back a large part of its earlier loss of 0.95 percent. Safety bids boosted bond prices globally, driving yields lower. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 2.988 percent, falling further from a seven-year high of 3.128 percent hit a week ago. The German 10-year Bund yield hit a 4-1/2-month low of 0.461 percent, having fallen more than 11 basis points so far this week. Despite the market’s shift to safe-haven assets, there are no immediate signs of widespread investor panic with the Wall Street’s volatility index, seen as gauge on investors’ fears, ending at a four-month low on Thursday. Analysts say that is primarily because investors are becoming accustomed to Trump’s dramatic negotiation style, in which he makes drastic calls before making compromises, and are increasingly seeing his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Un, adopt a similar approach. “I suspect they couldn’t agree on denuclearisation.

In addition to North Korea, the possibility of U.S. tariffs on foreign auto imports are stoking worries about trade war, although investors also see this threat from Washington as a tactic to get better bilateral deals from major auto exporter nations. In the currency market, traditional safe havens such as the Swiss franc and the yen were in favour. The dollar traded at 109.31 yen, down about two percent from Monday’s four-month high of 111.395 and looks set to post its first weekly loss in nine weeks. The yen is seen as a safe-haven because of Japan’s status as the world’s largest net creditor nation. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar extended losses to hit its lowest level since April of 0.9886 franc overnight and last stood at 0.9912. The franc also stood near 2-1/2-month high against the euro hit earlier this week, trading at 1.1615 franc per euro .

Brent crude futures were at $78.78 per barrel at 0024 GMT, down 1 cent from their last close, but more than 2 percent below the $80.50 November 2014 high they reached on May 17. Brent broke through $80 for the first time in a few years earlier in May. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $70.69 a barrel, down 2 cents from their last settlement. “Oil prices are now starting to drift a little,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader, adding that this was due to OPEC’s and Russia’s “moves toward an increase in production at the June meeting”. The Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia started withholding output in 2017 to tighten the market and prop up prices. But Russia, in particular, has been floating a potential end to the production cuts, with energy minister Alexander Novak saying on Thursday that restrictions on oil production could be eased “softly” if OPEC and non-OPEC countries see the oil market balancing in June. “The Russians have always struck me as production cut tourists keen to get off the boat and crank up production as soon as inventories were stabilised and prices once again elevated ... That possibility is top of the mind for traders and as a result oil prices are slipping,” McKenna said.

2018-05-25,"* Powers, Iran meet in Vienna for first time since U.S. exit * Iranian official says meeting vital to get guarantees * Saving deal tough as U.S. reimposes, adds sanctions By John Irish and Francois Murphy VIENNA, May 25 (Reuters) - Nations that remain in the Iran nuclear deal meet on Friday for the first time since U.S. President Donald Trump left the pact, but diplomats see limited scope to salvage it after Washington vowed to be tougher than ever on Tehran. British, Chinese, French, German and Russian officials will try to flesh out with Iran’s deputy foreign minister a strategy to save the deal by keeping oil and investment flowing, while circumventing U.S. sanctions that risk hurting the economy. The 2015 accord rests on lifting sanctions and allowing business with Iran in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. The deal’s proponents say it is crucial to forestalling a nuclear Iran and preventing wider war in the Middle East. But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday threatened the Islamic Republic with “the strongest sanctions in history” if it did not change its behaviour in the Middle East. “Pompeo was like taking a cold shower,” said a European diplomat. “We’ll try to cling to the deal hoping that there is a possibility of a transaction, but we’re under no illusions.” At the heart of Friday’s talks, chaired by the European Union, Iranian officials will seek guarantees from the Europeans that they can protect trade. They will also want assurances that all parties will continue to buy Iranian oil. Iran’s supreme leader set out a series of conditions on Wednesday for Iran to stay in the deal. “This is a very important meeting that will show whether the other parties are serious about the deal or not,” an Iranian official told Reuters. “We will understand whether, as our leader, said, the European can give us reliable guarantees or not.” Highlighting how difficult it will be, the U.S. Treasury announced Thursday more sanctions on several Iranian and Turkish companies and a number of aircraft in a move targeting four Iranian airlines. Some Western companies have already quit Iran or said they may have to leave because of U.S. sanctions. Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said he expected the other signatories to present “a new package” that would be within the boundaries of the agreement, but did not include “any other issues.” Trump denounced the accord, completed under his predecessor Barack Obama, because it did not cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its role in Middle East conflicts or what happens after the deal begins to expire in 2025. While European nations share those concerns, they have said that as long as Tehran meets its commitments, they would remain in the deal. The U.N. atomic watchdog policing the pact said on Thursday Iran continued to comply with the terms of the deal, but could be faster and more proactive in allowing snap inspections. “The European desire to remain in the agreement does not, however, detract from the concerns we have with regard to Iran,” France’s foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Thursday. “That is why we proposed to establish a comprehensive negotiating framework with Iran. We want Iran to understand the value of a cooperative approach.” (Additional reporting by Parisa Hafezi in Ankara Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-talks/no-illusions-as-iran-nuclear-deal-countries-look-to-future-without-u-s-idUKL5N1SV668,25 May 2018,"Nations that remain in the Iran

2018-05-25,"NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil export infrastructure is straining to keep up as the country’s crude oil exports hit new highs and China snaps up more of it than ever before. U.S. crude production has surged to a record 10.7 million barrels a day, driven largely by growth from the Permian shale patch in West Texas, which pumps more than 3 million bpd. However, the infrastructure to move it abroad is lagging, even as U.S. prices are well below the Brent benchmark, a discount that sits just off three-year highs at $8.09 per barrel. WTCLc1-LCOc1 U.S. crude exports peaked at 2.6 million bpd two weeks ago, but are expected to keep rising. No definitive data are available on how much crude the United States can export, though analysts estimate a nationwide capacity of 3.5 million to 4 million bpd. Most terminal operators and companies do not disclose capacity, and the U.S. Energy Department does not track it. “So far, export capacity is keeping pace, but we are walking a tightrope,” said Bernadette Johnson, vice president at DrillingInfo. That capacity may begin to be tested next month, as Sinopec , Asia’s largest refiner, bought a record 16 million barrels, or about 533,000 bpd of U.S. crude, to load in June, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. For the last six months of available data, ending in February, the United States only exported about 332,000 bpd to China. Analysts are concerned about how quickly the crude terminals at Gulf Coast ports, many initially designed for imports, can shift to handling exports. Only the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port can handle supertanker exports, but it only started testing in February. The supertankers, known as VLCCs or very large crude carriers, can handle some 2 million barrels of oil - the amount preferred by Asian buyers with bigger ports. “There’s only one dock on the Gulf Coast that can handle a VLCC deepwater, and that’s LOOP. And the LOOP has only started to export,” said Sandy Fielden, director of research in commodities and energy at Morningstar. Port of Corpus Christi in Texas is developing its Harbor Island port, which will accommodate 120 VLCCs per year, said Jarl Pedersen, chief commercial officer at the port, with a targeted completion of late 2020. Kpler, a cargo tracking service, on Thursday estimated that up to 4.8 million bpd can be moved from the top crude-exporting ports of Corpus Christi, Houston, Port Arthur and New Orleans. Their estimate in October was 3.2 million bpd. PIRA Energy Group put the U.S. overall crude export capacity at 3.5 million bpd, while Morningstar’s estimate is 3.8 million bpd at most. In addition to port constraints, inadequate pipeline space has created a glut of supply in west Texas, pushing the principle cash grade there WTC-WTM to a $13 discount to benchmark U.S. crude futures this month, the biggest in 3-1/2 years. “The constraint is really the pipeline coming down from the Permian to Corpus Christi,” said Pedersen. However, the ship channel still needs to be deepened, a $320 million project in development with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
