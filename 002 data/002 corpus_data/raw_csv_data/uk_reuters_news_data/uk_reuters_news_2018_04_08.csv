Orban won a third straight term in power at the election, and his party may also retain its two-thirds majority in parliament.

2018-04-08,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s private-sector trade unions reached a deal on Sunday with employers over wages, pensions and other compensation, averting the outbreak of major strikes, a state-appointed mediator said after five days of negotiations. Almost 35,000 employees had been scheduled to go on strike if no agreement was found, and a conflict could eventually have escalated to include more than 200,000 workers. A strike would immediately have idled aluminium smelters, fertiliser plants, ship yards and chemical factories, and could eventually have been extended to hit output of oil and gas, unions said ahead of the talks. The deal remains subject to a vote by labour union members, mediator Nils Dalseide told reporters. The agreement gives workers an estimated average pay rise of 2.8 percent in 2018, slightly more than the maximum 2.7 percent employers had said they were willing to pay. Some adjustments were also made to pensions for low-paid workers, although a union demand for more wide-ranging pension reform was rejected and will be subject to a future government study. A separate claim of compensation for travel-related expenses was resolved, unions said.

2018-04-08,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] took the first steps to integrating a petrochemicals business into the United States’ biggest oil refinery, which is operated by its subsidiary Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL]. Aramco’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth $8 billion-$10 billion with Honeywell UOP (HON.N) and Technip FMC (FTI.N) to study petrochemical production technology for use in a chemical plant the company is considering building at the Port Arthur refinery. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was winding up a two-week visit to the United States, was present at the signing in Houston, Texas, on Saturday along with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  “These agreements signal our plans for expansion into petrochemicals,” Motiva’s Chief Executive Brian Coffman said. Aramco, which wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the world’s largest oil firm in an initial public offering (IPO) this year, wants to use oil as a major petrochemicals feedstock. Coffman also said Motiva was evaluating boosting the 603,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur refinery’s capacity to 1 million or 1.5 million bpd, which would make it the largest in the world. The aromatics unit for which Honeywell UOP’s technology is being considered under one of the MoUs, would convert benzene and paraxylene, byproducts of gasoline production, into 2 million tons annually of feedstocks for chemicals and plastics. The other MoU would allow Aramco to use Technip FMC’s mixed-feed ethylene production technologies in the United States. The technology would produce 2 million tons a year of ethylene, which is used to make plastics, Motiva said. The final investment decision on setting up a multi-billion-dollar petrochemical plant at Port Arthur is not expected until 2019, and is “dependent on strong economics, competitive incentives, and regulatory support,” Aramco said in a statement. Coffman did not provide a timeline for the possible expansion of the Port Arthur refinery’s crude oil processing capacity. “That’s something we’re evaluating, we’re studying for in the future,” he said. The 1.2-million bpd Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) refinery in Jamnagar, India, has the world’s largest crude oil processing capacity. Aramco said last year that it would invest $18 billion in Motiva to expand the refinery and move into petrochemical production. Other U.S. companies, including Chevron Phillips Chemical Co CHEPH.UL - a joint venture of Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) - and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), have recently opened plants, like the one Motiva is considering, to process ethane into ethylene. Chevron Phillips is considering building a second ethane cracker on the Gulf Coast of Texas. The price tag for a large ethane cracker is typically over $6 billion, according to analysts. In addition to taking refining byproducts, ethane crackers provide hydrogen for refineries to use in making motor fuels.

2018-04-08,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Japan signed a grant and loan agreement with Cambodia on Sunday totalling over $90 million, despite concerns from the international community over Prime Minister Hun Sen’s crackdown on government critics ahead of a July general election. Japan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Kono and Cambodia’s Foreign Affairs Minister Prak Sokhonn signed the $4.6 million grant and $86 million loan, for economic and electricity transmission projects, in Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh. The main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved in November at the request of the government, prompting some Western countries to condemn the crackdown, cut aid, and impose visa bans on some ruling party members. Rights groups and members of the opposition have urged Tokyo to take a stronger stance against Hun Sen, but Japan has said it would continue to provide election support and would not interfere in what it said were Cambodia’s internal affairs. Hun Sen praised Japan for its financial assistance on Sunday, but lashed out at critics. “While Japan, a friend, is providing assistance to Cambodia, some bad people can poison the news as bad as they did,” Hun Sen said on his Facebook page. During a meeting with Hun Sen on Sunday, foreign minister Kono said Japan would help Cambodia to become an upper middle income country by 2030, said Hun Sen’s aide Eang Sophalleth. In a recent statement to Reuters, Kentaro Sonoura, advisor to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, urged Cambodia’s political rivals to hold talks to end the political crisis.

2018-04-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, and said the official’s travel and security expenses were reasonable. Taxpayers have paid more to protect Pruitt than past EPA chiefs but those expenses are justified since Pruitt has been under threat, Trump wrote. “Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA,” Trump wrote. The costs of Pruitt’s security detail have come under scrutiny recently as have the costs of his travel and housing in Washington. Trump defended those costs, too. “Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!” Trump wrote. The head of a congressional oversight panel is investigating Pruitt’s use of a condominium tied to an energy lobbyist, an aide said on Saturday. The House of Representatives Oversight Committee, chaired by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, has begun looking into Pruitt’s housing arrangements, according to the aide, who was not authorized to speak publicly. On Friday, an EPA spokesman said Pruitt has faced “unprecedented” threats and security has been costly. “Americans should all agree that members of the President’s cabinet should be kept safe,” said EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox. Gowdy’s probe adds to the pressure on Pruitt, a vocal critic of mainstream climate change science who sued the EPA more than a dozen times when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general. Many Democrats and even a few Republicans have said he should resign or be fired. Lawmakers have been scrutinizing Pruitt for renting a room in a high-end townhouse co-owned by the wife of energy industry lobbyist Steven Hart for $50 a night, an arrangement that has drawn fire from ethics experts. Media reports say the payment is less than one-third the price of similar properties.  Hart lobbies for companies regulated by the EPA. Pruitt is also under fire for frequent first-class air travel and for purchasing costly items for his office, including a soundproof telephone booth.     “I don’t have a lot of patience with that kind of stuff,” Gowdy said of Pruitt in a video released by the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “You’ve just got to be a good steward of public services.”       As part of the committee’s investigation, the EPA has produced documents, including a memo from the EPA ethics office that initially cleared Pruitt of accepting a gift from a lobbyist but did not address whether he broke other federal ethics regulations. An administration official said Pruitt met with President Donald Trump on Friday morning, a week after White House Chief of Staff John Kelly advocated for Trump to fire him. Trump told reporters on Thursday that he would take a look into ethics allegations against Pruitt but added the official was doing a “fantastic job.” Reporting by David Morgan; Additional reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Sandra Maler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-pruitt/update-2-trump-stands-by-embattled-epa-chief-pruitt-in-tweet-idUKL1N1RL00G,08 Apr 2018,"President Donald Trump on
