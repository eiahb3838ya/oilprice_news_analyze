2018-02-21,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil environmental agency Ibama will decide on French oil firm Total’s application to drill in the environmentally sensitive Amazon river basin before the end of May, and possibly as soon as the end of March, an agency official told Reuters on Wednesday. Ibama last August ordered Total to provide information missing from its application for an environmental license to explore for oil in the Foz do Amazonas basin, warning that it was the oil company’s last chance to provide necessary details before the application is scrapped. The agency received Total’s response at the end of January and has four months to evaluate the new report and issue a ruling, said Antonio Celso Junqueira Borges, the general coordinator for oil and gas licensing. But Ibama could rule more quickly, Borges said. “Total filed its supplement to its studies at the end of January, it’s in analysis,” he said. “(The timeline for finishing the analysis) is the end of March, but could be delayed a bit more than that.” He declined to comment on the chances of the application to explore being approved. “All of the blocks offered in the 11th round are in environmentally sensitive areas. In many regions the modeling indicates that if there was an oil spill, it would reach the coast,” Borges said. “Beyond that it’s a sensitive region, there are lots of fisherman and a great biodiversity, so it demands greater control and care,” he said. Officials at Ibama said pre-salt areas in recent auctions, thought to contain vast amounts of oil, were unlikely to face the same problem because of their greater distance from the coast. The analysis of Total’s application in Foz do Amazonas, once complete, must then pass through a series of approvals with the ultimate decision to be issued by the president of Ibama. Total did not respond to request for comment. The firm, leading a group of partners including BP Plc and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, won five blocks in Brazil’s 11th auction of oil blocks held in 2013. As the operator, Total is responsible for applying for environmental licenses. Total is the farthest along in the application process for Foz do Amazonas basin blocks awarded in 2013, with BP and Queiroz Galvão Exploration and Production (QGEP) in earlier stages of applying for licenses with Ibama for separate blocks they won in region, according to the agency.

2018-02-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Wednesday ahead of data expected to show rising crude inventories in the United States and as the dollar strengthened from last week’s three-year lows. Brent crude futures settled 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, higher at $65.42 a barrel, after trading between  $64.40 and $65.53.  West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) futures fell 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, to end at $61.68 a barrel, after trading between $61.86 and $60.92. U.S. crude inventories were forecast to have risen for the fourth consecutive week, increasing 1.8 million barrels last week, an extended Reuters poll showed. [EIA/S] Data on U.S. inventories from the American Petroleum Institute will be released at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT) and government figures are due on Thursday at 11 a.m.. Both reports were delayed a day due to a U.S. holiday on Monday. Rising U.S. shale output should lead to a modest inventory build, said Stewart Glickman, an energy analyst at CFRA Research in New York “U.S. shale continues to rise to the occasion,” he said. Higher oil prices and rising output should feed increased investment in drilling and production, in turn boosting shale output more, he said. U.S. crude oil production surpassed 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in November for the first time since 1970. Rising U.S. shale output has hindered efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, led by Russia, to reduce bloated global inventories and prop up oil prices by cutting output. The dollar index hit a one-week high after the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s January policy meeting. A stronger dollar makes oil and other dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. Oil gained some support from a rise on Wall Street markets. [.N]  “Oil prices and the S&P have been highly correlated, of late, with economic strength translating into improved company performance and higher energy demand,” said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York.  Futures prices have been dented by physical crude markets, which are showing signs of seasonal weakness as refineries prepare to shutdown for maintenance between peak summer and winter fuel demand periods.

2018-02-21,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shares of General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) rose on Wednesday after the parent company said it would not shed its holdings in the oilfield services business before the expiration of a two-year lockup period, reversing an earlier stance that had cast uncertainty around the stock.  General Electric (GE.N) last November said it was considering shedding its Baker Hughes holdings to refocus its business and boost cash flows. The announcement came just months after the conglomerate had purchased a 63 percent stake in the firm under a deal that combined its oil and gas services and equipment business with Baker Hughes to create the second largest oilfield services firm by revenue.  A recent move in oil prices CLc1 to above $60 a barrel and the relative low valuation of Baker Hughes stock had some investors questioning whether General Electric would spin off the company before a two-year lockup period the companies set as part of the merger agreement.  “Given today’s valuation levels, we see a lot of upside there. We like the macro trends. At this point in time, we have no intent to change anything or execute prior to the expiration of any of the lockup periods,” said Jamie Miller, GE’s finance chief, at a Barclay’s conference in Miami. Baker Hughes shares, which rose as much as 9 percent from the day’s low, closed at $26.76 on the New York Stock Exchange, up about 1.2 percent.   Under the merger agreement, General Electric cannot spin off its investment without special approval from a committee of board members.  Despite complementary offerings and the recent spike in oil prices, shares of GE’s Baker Hughes have fallen by more than 30 percent since the close of the merger. Disappointing fourth quarter results and lowered guidance prompted analysts to lower profit targets for the year.  “The uncertainty had been pressuring the shares,” said James West, senior managing director and partner at investment bank Evercore ISI. A spokeswoman for GE’s Baker Hughes on Wednesday said Miller’s comments had reinforced the parent company’s commitment and support. “We both see the value creation opportunity,” she said in an emailed statement.

2018-02-21,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Promit Mukherjee MUMBAI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp is set to hire international oil service giants for the first time to boost output from domestic oil fields in response to a government push to increase local supplies and cut expensive imports. ONGC, India’s biggest explorer, has short-listed U.S. oil service companies Halliburton, Schlumberger and GE subsidiary Baker Hughes to submit proposals on boosting production from two onshore fields, according to a document seen by Reuters. The three companies have until May to submit their proposals for what ONGC is calling a “production enhancement contract” for an oilfield in Assam state and another in Gujarat. “The shortlist is ready. We will now share our data on the two fields with these companies,” an ONGC executive said. The executive - who did not wish to be named as ONGC has yet to make an official announcement - said the final contract is likely to be awarded by May. Emails to Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes requesting comment on their participation were unanswered outside of U.S. business hours. The government last September proposed selling a 60 percent stake in ONGC’s producing fields to foreign companies to ramp up domestic oil and gas output and meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s target of cutting oil imports 10 percent by 2022. India’s oil production has stalled below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent years, even as oil demand has surged. That has resulted in its crude oil imports soaring, making it the world’s third-biggest importer, behind China and the United States. In January, India’s imports hit a record of almost 5 million bpd. ONGC, which the government hopes to eventually build into a global giant like Exxon Mobil or a state-owned oil major like PetroChina, has often been criticized by analysts and New Delhi for failing to increase its production. ONGC’s output - most of it from fields that have been operating for more than 30 years - is declining at the rate of 7 to 8 percent a year. A major part of the company’s capital expenditure is spent in efforts to pump more oil and gas to set off the yearly decline. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, ONGC’s standalone crude oil production stood at 20.855 million metric tonnes (417,000 bpd), a one percent fall from the previous year. Once the final contractor is chosen in May, the winning service company will be responsible for maintaining production at current levels, and also for boosting output incrementally from the two mature fields, the ONGC executive said. “We will reimburse the operational expenses incurred and share some pre-determined amount on each barrel of incremental crude that the contractor will produce,” the executive said. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes will get access to ONGC’s data rooms pertaining to its Kalol field in Gujarat and the Geleki field in Assam before submitting a final bid, according to the bidding document. ONGC might replicate the model for other fields if this pilot exercise is a success, the executive said. ONGC explored a similar move in 2016 and had signed agreements with Halliburton and Schlumberger aimed at enhancing production, but the agreements were later cancelled, according to reports in local media.

2018-02-21,"(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N) posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday that was less than Wall Street expected, with cost cuts and rising crude prices CLc1 helping to boost results.      Whiting, the largest oil producer in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation, took an $835 million charge to write down the value of its Colorado assets, an acknowledgment that acreage there needs even higher oil prices to be economically developed. The company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $798.3 million, or $8.80 per share, compared to a net loss of $173.3 million, or $2.34 per share, in the year-ago period.  Excluding the impairment charge and other one-time items, Continental lost 17 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected a loss of 30 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Production rose 8 percent to 128,050 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For 2018, Whiting plans to spend $750 million and pump 128,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in what would be a 9 percent increase over the average daily production in 2017. Most of that growth should come in North Dakota, the company said. Whiting has 70 percent of its 2018 production hedged. “Looking forward, we will work together to achieve our goal of becoming a top-tier exploration and production company as measured by capital efficient growth and free cash flow generation,” Brad Holly, Whiting’s chief executive, said in a statement.

2018-02-21,"(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by rising production and surging crude prices CLc1. The results reflect the broader push in the industry to boost output only when profitable. Continental easily exceeded that mark during the quarter, with executives vowing to continue to boost production not only in its core North Dakota acreage but in shale formations in Oklahoma. “We expect even stronger performance in 2018 with both significant production growth and robust free cash flow,” founder and Chief Executive Harold Hamm said in a statement.

2018-02-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a four-year high, the dollar rose and stocks fell on Wednesday in a rocky session  after the Federal Reserve at its latest policy meeting showed more confidence in the need to keep raising interest rates.     The Fed’s more upbeat take on inflation, as seen in the minutes of the Jan. 30-31 policy meeting released on Wednesday, will likely further cement expectations that new Fed chief Jerome Powell will lead his colleagues in raising rates next month. “Members agreed that the strengthening in the near-term economic outlook increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be appropriate,” the Fed said in the minutes. Wall Street, which started the day positive, closed lower after bond yields surged. In late trading, 10-year Treasury yields touched 2.957 percent, their highest level since January 2014. They were last at 2.95 percent. The U.S. 30-year bond yield hit 3.233 percent, its highest level since July 2015, before tipping back to 3.228 percent. The Fed minutes lined up with market expectations for future rate hikes, said Michael Skordeles, U.S. macro strategist at Suntrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.  “The market view is that we’ll see one in March, one in July and likely something later in the year, November or December,” he said. The minutes “reassured that there won’t really be a whole lot of change despite having a regime change.” The minutes also showed that both the voting members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee and the wider group of policymakers had upgraded their forecasts for the economy since December. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, dipped following the release of the minutes but then recovered. The index was last up 0.4 percent at a one-week high.  The dollar has been weighed down this year by concerns that Washington might pursue a weak-dollar strategy, and by the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easy-money strategies.  Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit. But the greenback finally appeared to be benefiting from rising U.S. bond yields, especially as the Treasury Department issues more debt in anticipation of increased federal spending and a higher deficit from last year’s tax overhaul. The euro edged 0.41 percent lower to $1.2286.  In Britain, an unexpected jump in the jobless rate weighed on the pound, helping to send sterling down 0.51 percent to $1.3924. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 166.97 points, or 0.67 percent, to 24,797.78, the S&P 500 lost 14.93 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,701.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.08 points, or 0.22 percent, to 7,218.23. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.17 percent. The Toronto Stock Exchange S&P/TSX composite index, however, closed 0.55 percent higher, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.11 percent. Oil prices pared losses in post-settlement activity after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories. Traders had been expecting a rise.

2018-02-21,"Philadelphia (Reuters) - Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump’s administration to push for an overhaul of the nation’s biofuels policy, during a rally at a Pennsylvania oil refinery that blames its bankruptcy on the controversial regulation. “We need a federal government that stands up for workers, not against them,” Cruz, whose state is home to numerous oil refining companies, told a cheering crowd of 1,200 people gathered in a tent on the grounds of the Philadelphia Energy Solutions plant. The oil industry and the corn lobby have been at odds over the causes of the Philadelphia-area refiner’s insolvency, which has become a touchstone in the debate over whether the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) needs to be rewritten. The decade-old regulation requires U.S. refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their fuel, or buy credits from those who do. While it has created a lucrative market for corn states like Iowa and Nebraska, refiners like Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) that have no blending facilities say it is unfair and costly. PES, which employs more than a thousand people, declared bankruptcy in January and placed the blame squarely at the feet of the RFS. The corn industry has pushed back, pointing out that other refining companies - like top U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp - are raking in their biggest profits in years, and suggesting PES’ problems may have had more to do with regional refining economics and management choices. Reuters reported this week that PES’ investor backers - led by the Carlyle Group - withdrew at least $594 million in a series of dividend-style distributions from PES since 2012, most of them backed by loans the company ultimately could not repay. The distributions, combined with a shift in U.S. energy economics, made complying with the RFS a challenge. “Workers at PES deserve real answers for the financial troubles facing the refinery, and that starts with investors who drained the company while other U.S. refiners flourished under the RFS,” said Emily Skor, chief executive of biofuels producer Growth Energy.  Cruz has been leading an effort to reform the RFS, putting holds on presidential nominations favored by corn-state lawmakers and organizing meetings with administration officials. The oil and gas industry is among Cruz’s top financial backers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Cruz has suggested putting a cap of 10 cents on credit prices - a fraction of their current value - a move that would save refiners millions of dollars but which was roundly rejected as unworkable by the biofuels industry. Cruz said on Wednesday that, despite his free market principles, he supports capping prices of the credits, called RINs: “A RIN is not a commodity ... it’s a made up government license,” he said.  The former presidential hopeful said that his proposal would help refiners without hurting corn growers. He added that if he had won the 2016 race for the White House, he would have done more than suggest tweaks to the program. “If I would’ve won, I would’ve ended the RFS,” Cruz said to a round of applause. PES is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly $350 million of its current RFS compliance costs as part of its restructuring package. Complying with the RFS was more expensive than the company’s payroll, and ranked only behind purchasing crude oil as its biggest cost, according to PES.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, dipped following release of the minutes but then recovered. The index was last up 0.31 percent at a one-week high. Some oil prices softened ahead of expectations that data would show rising U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $61.68 per barrel, down 11 cents, or 0.18 percent. Brent pared some losses after the dollar index dropped, with Brent last at $65.25, flat on the day. The U.S. currency has been weighed down this year by concerns that Washington might pursue a weak-dollar strategy, and by the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easy-money strategies. Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit. But the greenback finally appeared to be benefiting from rising U.S. bond yields, especially as the Treasury Department issues more debt in anticipation of increased federal spending and a higher deficit from last year’s tax overhaul. U.S. Treasury 30-year bond prices fell more than a point, with the yield hitting its highest since July 2015. Yields on 10-year notes hit session highs after the rate comments. The euro edged down 0.21 percent to $1.231 as the dollar rose. In Britain, an unexpected jump in the jobless rate weighed on the pound, helping to send sterling down 0.44 percent to $1.3934. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.17 points, or 0.03 percent, to 24,972.92, the S&P 500 gained 4.39 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,720.65 and the Nasdaq Composite added 34.99 points, or 0.48 percent, to 7,269.30. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.11 percent, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.48 percent. Reporting by Hilary Russ in New York; Additional reporting by

2018-02-21,"(Adds executive quotes, details about dividend hike, new service to Taipei) Feb 22 (Reuters) - Air New Zealand Ltd said on Thursday it expected fiscal 2018 earnings before tax to exceed the previous year, boosted by strength in the domestic market and robust inbound tourism while also announcing a dividend hike. The airline reported a profit before tax, the most closely watched measure of its performance, of NZ$323 million ($237.70 million) for the six months ended Dec. 31, down from NZ$349 million a year ago as higher fuel prices dampened profits. Still, the company said it was on track for the second highest annual profit in company history. “The domestic market continues to show strength driven by the New Zealand economy as well as inbound tourism, and we will be increasing capacity approximately 6 percent across our regional and jet services to support that demand over the second half of the financial year,” Chief Executive Christopher Luxon said. The airline said it would pay an interim dividend of NZ$0.11 per share, up from NZ$0.10 a year ago and the highest interim payout in the company’s history. It also announced plans to launch a new direct service to Taipei, beginning November 2018. Shares of the company soared to a 16-year high last year underpinned by growth in passenger numbers.

2018-02-21,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine truck drivers paralysed parts of Buenos Aires, throwing up road blocks in some of the city’s busiest downtown neighbourhoods, in a protest on Wednesday against President Mauricio Macri’s market-friendly economic policies. The protest was seen as a test of the president’s ability to keep pushing legislation in Latin America’s No. 3 economy after a violent outcry over pension reforms he got through Congress late last year. Macri, who took office in December 2015, is trying to cut Argentina’s fiscal deficit by gradually reducing subsidies for home heating gas and transportation, moves that have triggered an unpopular increase in utility bills and bus fares. “Mister President, don’t continue with policies that force  the most vulnerable parts of our society - retired people, old people - to go hungry,” Hugo Moyano, head of Argentina’s largest umbrella union, the CGT, shouted at an afternoon protest rally. Union activists danced and beat on drums on Avenida 9 de Julio, the city’s main thoroughfare, under banners representing various labour groups. Traffic was snarled for miles. Macri aims to cut the primary fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product this year from 3.9 percent in 2017.  If he presses on with his economic overhaul, aimed at winning the confidence of investors long put off by the high cost of doing business in Argentina, union leaders said they may call a trucking strike next month that could slow the flow of grains from one of the world’s top exporters of soy and corn.

2018-02-21,"NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The U.S. state of California and two Canadian provinces kicked off a cross-border auction of greenhouse gas emission credits on Wednesday, their first joint effort to buy and sell in the “cap and trade” market to fight global warming, experts said. The auction comes less than two months after the U.S. local and Canadian regional governments merged their trading markets for cap and trade, a system designed to limit carbon emissions by putting a price tag on pollutants produced. In a cap and trade market, those who produce low levels of greenhouse gases earn credits which they can sell to those who produce high emissions and exceed government-mandated limits. Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the major drivers of human-caused climate change. The auction by California, Quebec and Ontario represented a “big test” for the new cross-border market, said Erick Lachapelle, associate professor of political science at the University of Montreal and a specialist in energy and environmental politics. “It shows that this is workable. We can expand. We can link carbon markets across borders,” Lachapelle told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. The merging of Ontario’s cap and trade program with the previously linked California and Quebec markets created the world’s second largest carbon emissions market, officials have said. More than 110 million emission permits were being sold at the joint auction, authorities in Quebec said. North America’s joint cap-and-trade systems, set up over the last six years, have face some questions over how much carbon emissions they actually hold back, Lachapelle said. For now, the European Union is considered the world's largest carbon emission market, but China's market is rapidly growing, experts say.

2018-02-21,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition coalition said on Wednesday it could not participate in a “fraudulent, illegitimate” presidential election on April 22 due to unfair conditions created by President Nicolas Maduro’s government. The announcement by the Democratic Unity movement, which confirmed a Reuters story on Monday, leaves Maduro on track for re-election but is likely to fuel international condemnation of democratic shortcomings in the socialist-ruled OPEC nation.  Maduro’s two strongest opposition rivals are both barred from running against him: Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest, while Henrique Capriles is prohibited from holding office due to accusations of misconduct when he was a state governor.  Furthermore, the pro-government national election board already banned the Democratic Unity coalition, plus some of its main parties, from running under their party names. “The premature event announced for next April 22 lacking proper conditions is a show by the government to give an impression of legitimacy that it does not have in the midst of Venezuelans’ agony and suffering,” the coalition said in a statement, referring to the country’s economic crisis. “In the name of the immense majority of Venezuelans, we challenge the Maduro government to measure itself against the people in real elections” later in 2018, it added. The Democratic Unity’s decision leaves Maduro facing just one confirmed candidate so far: a little-known evangelical pastor named Javier Bertucci. Another likely candidate is opposition leader Henri Falcon, a former state governor who parted with the socialists in 2010. He has expressed his desire to run against Maduro and may break with the coalition decision to boycott the vote. Falcon’s candidacy will likely infuriate Maduro’s adversaries, many of whom see him as a Trojan horse seeking to help Maduro legitimize a rigged vote. Maduro has faced calls in Latin America and internationally to improve conditions for the vote, with the United States pondering oil sanctions to pressure him. He says the country is victim of an “economic war” led by the opposition with the help of the United States. “We’ll get to the elections whether there’s rain, thunder, or lightning - with or without the (Democratic Unity Coalition),” Maduro told a news conference in response to the opposition’s announcement. He added that he supports a proposal to hold an early congressional vote on April 22, adding that elections should be held the same day for state and local legislatures.

2018-02-21,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali  has pledged to raise its investments in environmentally-friendly projects and divest from the coal industry as part of a new climate-change strategy. Europe’s third biggest insurer said it would raise investments in “green” sectors by 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) by 2020, mainly through green bonds and infrastructure. At the same time, it will divest its current exposure to the coal sector of around 2 billion euros by selling equity stakes and exiting bond investments by bringing them to maturity or even divesting before maturity. Generali’s move adds to the recent trend of asset managers and wealth funds cutting back on carbon-related investments as policy makers step up efforts to address environmental concerns. Last December, French insurer AXA quadrupled its green investments and disinvested further from coal. Europe’s biggest insurer Allianz, which got out of the business of investing in coal in 2015, said last week it was considering whether to stop insuring new coal power plants.  “Protecting the environment and adopting effective actions to tackle climate change are central issues for Assicurazioni Generali,” Generali’s Chief Executive Philippe Donnet said.

2018-02-21,"PARIS (Reuters) - French right-wing opposition leader Laurent Wauquiez came under fire on Wednesday for taped comments in which he sniped at politicians in his own camp and government, often using rough language, prompting a senior party member to quit. The 42-year-old Wauquiez, president of the conservative Les Republicains, also mocked German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying she had no charisma, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, he said, was too politically correct. Wauquiez, whose party is the biggest opposition group in parliament, said in December when he was elected that he intended to make life difficult for centrist President Emmanuel Macron in parliament. But his hardline views on immigration and Europe have already prompted several senior, moderate party officials including former prime minister Alain Juppe to take their distance from party policy since his election. An opinion poll by Elabe for France’s BFM TV on Wednesday showed that 57 percent of people interviewed found his comments “shocking”.    The new controversy, now grabbing headlines across France, involves recordings broadcast by French TV TMC in which Wauquiez apparently seeks to impress business school students with “cool” language. He names a senior politician in his party as always saying “stupid” things, adding that he himself often speaks “bullshit” in interviews. He resorted to sometimes crude terms in criticising Macron’s lawmakers, the powerful employers’ groups, and other veterans in his party. “When I heard Wauquiez’s comments I first thought he had tried to act as the ‘trash and cash’ cool big brother in front of the students and would later say he regretted his comments,” Dominique Bussereau, a former transport minister, told Reuters on Wednesday. After Wauquiez told an evening TV show on Tuesday that he was standing by his comments in the name of free speech, Bussereau decided to quit Les Republicains. “He (Wauquiez) has given a very rightwing style to the party, flattering the grassroots. But if the party wants to win elections again one day, it needs to be able to attract a wide range of people and not focus on such a narrow line,” Bussereau said. An EU lawmaker and a mayor in eastern France have also said they are quitting the party in protest at Wauquiez’s comments. Wauquiez could be heard in one of the recordings telling the Lyon business school students that they would get in trouble if one of them leaked his comments.

2018-02-21,"Feb 21 (Reuters) - A regulatory agency has decided not to impose restrictions on Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA’s operations at its terminal on the Dutch Caribbean island of Bonaire after receiving new repair assurances, the Dutch Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT) said on Wednesday. The Caribbean island in December said PDVSA could lose its license to operate the oil storage facility, which is essential to Venezuelan fuel oil exports, if it could not fulfill regulators’ maintenance demands. The authorities had asked PDVSA to commit to a remediation project that involved firm financial commitments. In the meantime, several oil tanks were shut because they were not in compliance with regulations, according to a company source. The agency said on Wednesday that PDVSA has demonstrated it has the financial resources to urgently address the key overdue maintenance. The first payment was made several weeks ago, according to the source. “The ILT will not impose administrative coercion to the Bonaire Petroleum Corporation NV (BOPEC) for the time being. (It) will not shut down the use of the piers at the company,” the agency said in a statement. But “sharpened supervision” will follow to ensure the maintenance work is accomplished in a proper and safe way, the agency added. A series of inspections are planned this year to verify BOPEC is taking steps to comply with the regulations. Penalties and new restrictions could be imposed if the operator does not comply, the ILT said. BOPEC, fully owned by PDVSA, has held an environmental permit since 2014, but suffered “serious delays” in the maintenance of storage tanks, pipes, piers and electrical installations, according to the ILT. The 10-million-barrel oil terminal is critical to PDVSA’s logistics in the Caribbean, and its closure could hurt fuel shipments to customers in Asia at a time when the OPEC-member country is desperate for export revenue.

2018-02-21,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A senior U.S. diplomat met Lebanese officials on Wednesday in Beirut as part of a U.S. shuttle diplomacy effort to resolve tensions between Israel and Lebanon over a border wall and energy drilling in disputed waters. Disputes over Israeli construction of the border wall, Lebanon’s start of oil and gas exploration at sea and the growing arsenal of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Shi’ite group Hezbollah have caused a spike in tensions between Lebanon and Israel, both friends of the United States that regard each other as enemies.  Lebanon this month signed its first offshore energy exploration and production agreements with a consortium of France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek. One of two blocks given to the consortium, Block 9, contains waters claimed by Israel. David Satterfield, the acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, has been shuttling back and forth between Israel and Lebanon in a bid to resolve the disputes. He met Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil and Lebanon’s army head General Joseph Aoun on Wednesday in Beirut.  Satterfield last met Lebanese officials on Friday, after which Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reiterated Lebanon’s rejection of U.S. proposals to resolve the maritime dispute as “unacceptable”. This was an apparent reference to a maritime demarcation line proposed by U.S. diplomat Frederic Hof in 2012, which would give Lebanon around two-thirds and Israel around one-third of a disputed triangular area of sea of around 860 sq km (330 square miles).   A senior Lebanese government source said Satterfield did not come with any new plan, and talks still revolve around the Hof line.  A source in the foreign ministry said he discussed the disputed area, how Lebanon can preserve its rights and how to keep exploration and drilling from being affected.  Satterfield left without making any public comments. The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon said Satterfield “continues to engage” on regional issues and on helping Lebanon develop its resources in agreement with its neighbours.

2018-02-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday praised an experimental program in Oregon that charges a mileage tax to volunteer drivers, adding to signals that President Donald Trump is open to finding new revenue sources to pay for his proposed infrastructure program. Many of Trump’s fellow Republicans, however, dislike the idea of a transportation tax as it would go against the grain of the party’s push to lower taxes and could hit Republican-leaning rural areas harder than cities.  In the annual Economic Report of the President, the White House described Oregon - a Democratic-leaning state where environmental issues are a priority for many voters - as a “pioneer” in transportation funding and highlighted its funding initiative, which began in 2015. Volunteers are charged a fee of 1.7 cents for each mile driven on state roads. In return, drivers get rebates for state fuel taxes. As of the end of 2016, only about 700 people were participating in the program, which is intended to gather data and generate consumer feedback. “The program offers tangible evidence that a tax on vehicle miles traveled is a promising alternative to relying on fuel taxes,” the report said. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, described Oregon’s mileage tax as “innovative” in a conference call with reporters and made clear the Trump administration was open to looking at ways to raise revenue for infrastructure projects.     Trump last week called for using $200 billion in new federal spending over 10 years in an effort to stimulate $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending. It would largely see states shoulder most costs and rely on unspecified spending cuts to pay for repairs. The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline has not been hiked since 1993. The federal tax on diesel fuel is 24.4 cents a gallon. The money raised from those taxes is used to pay for infrastructure repairs but has failed to keep up with costs as cars became more fuel-efficient. Hassett said the administration was still looking at the “pluses and minuses” of different ways to pay for infrastructure. “There’s a lot of discussion that will continue to evolve, I’m sure, as the infrastructure legislation moves forward, about how should we pay for this stuff,” Hassett said. In a private meeting with lawmakers last week to discuss infrastructure, Trump expressed support for hiking the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents a gallon, according to Democratic Senator Tom Carper, who attended the meeting. The report also boosted the idea of driverless cars, estimating autonomous cars “could add more than $200 billion to GDP, 2.4 million jobs and $90 billion in wages to the U.S. labor force” once they account for half of U.S. vehicles.

2018-02-21,"* U.S. dollar hits one-week high * Euro slips, sterling down on unemployment data * Asian, European, U.S. stocks higher * Two- and 10-year Treasury yields edge lower * Oil down on strong dollar, expected U.S. production increase (Adds Wall Street open; changes dateline to New York; updates throughout) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The dollar hit its highest level in a week on Wednesday and stocks rose as investors waited to see if minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting would herald more rises in interest rates and global bond yields. Oil prices inched lower, pressured by the dollar’s recovery and an anticipated rise in U.S. crude production, while the MSCI’s world index of stocks gained 0.47 percent. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, rose 0.15 percent. The index has bounced almost 1 percent so far this week, after slumping 1.5 percent the previous week to its lowest level in three years. Investor attention was focused on minutes of the Fed’s policy meeting in late January, due at 1900 GMT. The latest readings of U.S. wages and inflation came in higher than expected, with some blaming the data for a violent selloff in stocks earlier in February. “Markets are particularly sensitive to inflation, and we think the odds that the minutes reinforce the narrative of firming inflation are high,” said Elsa Lignos, RBC’s global head of FX strategy. “We think there is a high probability that the Fed moves the dots to four hikes in 2018 (from three) near-term, and that the minutes could be another step in that direction.” The U.S. currency has been weighed down this year by concerns that Washington might pursue a weak-dollar strategy, and by the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easy-money strategies. Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit. But the greenback finally appeared to be benefiting from rising U.S. bond yields, especially as the Treasury Department issues more debt in anticipation of a higher deficit from last year’s tax overhaul and plans to increase federal spending. As markets braced for the next wave of this week’s $258 billion deluge of new debt, two-year and 10-year Treasury yields eased a touch, with the former retreating from nine-year highs of 2.282 percent hit on Tuesday. The euro edged down 0.15 percent to $1.2318 as the dollar rose. In Britain, an unexpected jump in the jobless rate weighed on the pound, sending sterling down 0.22 percent to $1.3964. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 105.73 points, or 0.42 percent, to 25,070.48, the S&P 500 gained 15.92 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,732.18 and the Nasdaq Composite added 62.17 points, or 0.86 percent, to 7,296.48. Wall Street had fallen during the previous session, but Asian-Pacific shares outside of Japan shrugged off that weakness to close 1.06 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.21 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.07 percent and the STOXX 600 index inched up 0.02 percent. Germany’s DAX lost 0.3 percent, however, still spooked by the recent rises in bond yields. European analysts noted that more than half of MSCI Europe companies have either met or beaten analysts’ earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. “The underlying earnings season has been quietly delivering the goods,” UBS equity strategists told clients, adding that they remained bullish on European equities for 2018. U.S. crude fell 0.36 percent to $61.57 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.18, down 0.11 percent. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho and Amanda Cooper in London;

2018-02-21,"ATHENS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Cyprus said on Wednesday it would press ahead with oil and gas exploration, signalling resolve in a standoff with Turkey over access to potential energy riches after Ankara extended military exercises in the eastern Mediterranean to early March. Cyprus has accused Turkey of obstructing a drill ship exploring for natural gas off the ethnically-split island on Feb. 9, highlighting tensions in the region over competing claims for offshore resources. The Saipem 12000 vessel is contracted by Italy’s state-controlled Eni which along with France’s Total operates the Block 3 of Cyprus’s economic zone. The ship was headed to that area when it was blocked by Turkish warships. Turkey issued a new navigational advisory this week extending military training to March 10. “Our goal is to fully explore Cyprus’s hydrocarbon potential, in the best terms possible, so as to maximize the benefits for all the people of Cyprus,” President Nicos Anastasiades said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that Cyprus’ planning in the field of energy would proceed. Anastasiades, who later met political leaders, also said the government had submitted a bill to parliament setting up a sovereign fund to manage any future hydrocarbon resources. Eni and Total announced earlier this month finding a promising gas field off Cyprus, which looked geologically similar to the mammoth Zohr field off Egypt. Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Peace talks collapsed last year. Greek Cypriots, who are exploring for natural gas, run Cyprus’s internationally recognised government. Turkish Cypriots run a breakaway state in north Cyprus recognised only by Ankara. Turkey, which does not have diplomatic relations with Cyprus, claims that some areas of Cyprus’s offshore maritime zone fall under the jurisdiction of Turkey or Turkish Cypriots. “The use of these resources must be handled in such a way as to provide economic benefits to both sides,” Northern Cyprus Energy Minister Ozdil Nami told the Anatolian News Agency.

2018-02-21,"PARIS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - French right-wing opposition leader Laurent Wauquiez came under fire on Wednesday for taped comments in which he sniped at politicians in his own camp and government, often using rough language, prompting a senior party member to quit. The 42-year-old Wauquiez, president of the conservative Les Republicains, also mocked German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying she had no charisma, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, he said, was too politically correct. Wauquiez, whose party is the biggest opposition group in parliament, said in December when he was elected that he intended to make life difficult for centrist President Emmanuel Macron in parliament. But his hardline views on immigration and Europe have already prompted several senior, moderate party officials including former prime minister Alain Juppe to take their distance from party policy since his election. The new controversy, now grabbing headlines across France, involves recordings broadcast by French TV TMC in which Wauquiez apparently seeks to impress business school students with “cool” language. He names a senior politician in his party as always saying “stupid” things, adding that he himself often speaks “bullshit” in interviews. He resorted to sometimes crude terms in criticising Macron’s lawmakers, the powerful employers’ groups, and other veterans in his party. “When I heard Wauquiez’s comments I first thought he had tried to act as the ‘trash and cash’ cool big brother in front of the students and would later say he regretted his comments,” Dominique Bussereau, a former transport minister, told Reuters on Wednesday. After Wauquiez told an evening TV show on Tuesday that he was standing by his comments in the name of free speech, Bussereau decided to quit Les Republicains. “He (Wauquiez) has given a very rightwing style to the party, flattering the grassroots. But if the party wants to win elections again one day, it needs to be able to attract a wide range of people and not focus on such a narrow line,” Bussereau said. An EU lawmaker and a mayor in eastern France have also said they are quitting the party in protest at Wauquiez’s comments. Wauquiez could be heard in one of the recordings telling the Lyon business school students that they would get in trouble if one of them leaked his comments.

2018-02-21,"(Adds quote from fund manager, deal details, analyst quotes) By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Ahmed Farhatha Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer EQT Corp said on Wednesday it would spin off its midstream business to create a standalone publicly traded company, yielding to months of pressure from shareholders. Hedge funds D.E. Shaw & Co and Jana Partners had pushed for a break-up of the company ever since it bought Rice Energy for $6.7 billion last year, saying a separation of its production and pipeline assets will get better returns for shareholders. The separation will also narrow EQT’s focus on its exploration and production business, or the upstream assets, at a time when shale production is expected to top a record 11 million barrels per day in late 2018. Under the deal, designed to be tax-free for its shareholders, EQT will drop its midstream assets into its master limited partnership EQT Midstream. Following this, EQT Midstream and Rice Midstream Partners, Rice’s master limited partnership, will merge to create a standalone midstream focused company. “By moving ahead with the tax-free spin-off of the midstream business ... we believe the company has put itself on the best path forward for itself and all shareholders,” said Quentin Koffey, a portfolio manager at D.E.Shaw. EQT had hinted at the break-up last year when it said it would address the “sum-of-the-parts discount” in its share price following the Rice Energy deal. “Master limited partnerships and exploration and production are such different types of investments that without separation plans like this the discount will always persist, even if investors understand the underlying assets,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Welles Fitzpatrick said. EQT’s shares have fallen 20.4 percent since closing the Rice Energy deal. The stock was up 1 percent by late morning, after paring premarket gains. Following the spin-off, expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter, EQT said the new midstream company will become the third-largest natural gas gathering hub in the United States, operating in the Appalachian Basin - the heart of U.S. shale gas boom. Midstream companies transport oil and natural gas through pipelines and store them at gathering stations or hubs, bridging the gap between producers and refiners. The company expects the separation to complete by end of third quarter this year. Some analysts were expecting the separation of units to take longer, with RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold saying he expected the break-up by the end of this year. EQT’s Senior Vice President, Jerry Ashcroft, will become CEO of the new company.

2018-02-21,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil refiner HollyFrontier Corp’s (HFC.N) fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday fell short of analysts’ estimates on lower than expected margins, sending its shares down as much as five percent. Chief Financial Officer Richard Voliva said gasoline margins “fell out” in the latter part of the quarter and that the company had not captured the improvement in crude prices in the fourth quarter. “We had a couple of conversion rate and unit issues during the quarter, which probably hit production and really sales of kind of the higher value of finished products that are the margin,” he said. HollyFrontier, which mostly processes sweet crude oil, said refining margins rose 85 percent to $12.54 per barrel in the quarter.  That was lower, however, than the $13.06 per barrel predicted by Jefferies analyst Corey Goldman and $13.84 estimated by Barclays. Some analysts pointed to technical problems at plants as one reason for the shortfall. Net profit rose to $521.1 million, or $2.92 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $53.2 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier, HollyFrontier said in a release. Excluding items, however, the company reported earnings of 70 cents per share compared to average expectations of 83 cents, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The figures followed results by larger rivals Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N), which both beat expectations earlier this month in a booming U.S. oil sector. Operating costs and expenses at the Dallas-based company rose 28 percent to $3.83 billion. Analysts expect refiners to outshine other energy businesses in 2018 as broadly higher global oil prices drive up U.S. production and they rack up some of the corporate world’s biggest gains from recent tax cuts.

2018-02-21,"Feb 21 (Reuters) - Houston-based Citgo Petroleum has slowed work on an overhaul of its 235,000-barrel-per-day Aruba refinery due to a lack of financing stemming from U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA, the refining firm said. Sanctions imposed last year by the United States on Venezuela have limited access to long-term credit for PDVSA and its subsidiaries, affecting many oil projects in the South American country and Caribbean islands where they operate. “Citgo Aruba ... needs to slow down the refinery revamp project due to sanctions by the U.S. government on PDVSA which are not allowing us to get additional financing for the project,” the unit said in a press release late on Tuesday. The Caribbean refinery has been leased since 2016 by Citgo, the U.S. refining subsidiary of PDVSA, under a 25-year agreement with the Aruba government that also includes an extensive $685 million overhaul aimed at restarting operations at the inactive refinery and converting the facility to a crude upgrader. “We are working hard to find a solution and hope to fully resume the project in the near future,” said James Cristman, Citgo’s refining vice president, in the release, adding that 600 workers had been hired for the project. Citgo Aruba did not say how long work would be delayed at the refinery, which has remained idle since 2012. The Aruba government declined to comment. At the end of 2016 two consortia, including Japanese engineering firm JGC Corp and French oil services company Technip, were shortlisted to handle the refurbishment. Months later Citgo asked its cash-strapped parent company PDVSA to provide initial funding of $100 million, according to an internal document seen by Reuters, but the credit was not granted and there has been little progress since then due to the lack of financing.

2018-02-21,"Philadelphia, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will speak at a rally against the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) on Wednesday hosted by bankrupt refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc - a company that blames the controversial biofuels policy for its financial demise. The rally comes as the oil industry and the corn lobby clash over the causes of the Philadelphia-area refiner’s insolvency, which has become a touchstone in the debate over whether the RFS needs to be rewritten or replaced. The decade-old regulation requires U.S. refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their fuel, or buy credits from those who do. While it has created a lucrative market for corn states like Iowa and Nebraska, refiners like PES that have no blending facilities say it is unfair and costly. Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in the Philadelphia area, declared bankruptcy in January and placed the blame squarely at the feet of the RFS. The corn industry has pushed back, pointing out that other refining companies are raking in their biggest profits in years, and suggesting PES’s problems may have had more to do with regional refining economics and management choices. Reuters reported that PES’s investor backers - led by the Carlyle Group - withdrew more than $594 million in a series of dividend-style distributions from PES since 2012, most of them backed by loans the company ultimately could not repay. The distributions, combined with a shift in U.S. energy economics, made complying with RFS challenging for PES. Cruz, who represents the big refining state of Texas, has been leading an effort to reform the RFS, putting holds on presidential nominations favored by corn-state lawmakers and organizing meetings with administration officials. The oil and gas industry is among Cruz’s top financial backers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Cruz has suggested putting a cap of 10 cents on credit prices - a fraction of their current value - a move that would save refiners millions of dollars but which was roundly rejected as unworkable by the biofuels industry. PES is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly $350 million of its current RFS compliance costs as part of its restructuring package. Complying with the RFS was more expensive than the company’s payroll, and ranked only behind purchasing crude oil as its biggest cost.

2018-02-21,"(Reuters) - British contractor Interserve (IRV.L), which is in talks with its bankers to secure funding after issuing two profit warnings last year, has decided to close its power business as part of an operational restructuring of its industrial unit. Outsourcers such as Interserve have been the focus of investor attention since competitor Carillion (CLLN.L) entered liquidation in January, putting 43,000 jobs at risk. Interserve, which employs about 80,000 people worldwide, is a major player in the outsourcing industry, managing facilities including washrooms and waste management at most of Britain’s busiest rail stations and some government departments. Interserve said it had decided to exit its small power business, which performs tasks such as maintaining electricity towers or installing underground cable for energy companies. “After careful consideration we have decided to close down our power business, as we look to consolidate and centralise our industrial portfolio,” a company spokesperson said in an e-mail. “We are undergoing an operational restructure within our industrial division.” Last year, revenue for the power business was about 15 million pounds out of group revenue of 3.3 billion pounds  ($4.61 billion). The British contractor said it expected to complete all contracted power work and forecast that the bulk of the projects would be completed by June. Interserve would run a consultation process until early April for the affected employees, it said, adding that it was working to try and redeploy as many affected people as possible within other parts of its business. A source familiar with the matter said the change would affect 70 people. The group is also reviewing its contract portfolio and non-trading balance sheet items and is in talks with its lenders to try to secure long-term financing. Its current financing deal runs till March. Interserve warned of lower annual earnings in September, sending its shares crashing by more than 50 percent. Another profit warning followed in October. However, Interserve said in January that 2018 operating profit would be ahead of forecasts. Interserve’s problems have been exacerbated by cost overruns in its energy from waste business, which it has already announced plans to wind up. The group is looking to exit other non-core areas and Wednesday’s decision fits into that strategy. Many British outsourcers such as Capita (CPI.L), Mitie (MTO.L) and Interserve have struggled after taking on work at low prices for long-running fixed-rate contracts following the financial crisis.

2018-02-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s plans to curb air pollution are inadequate and must be improved, the High Court ruled on Wednesday following a legal complaint from environmental lawyers, Client Earth. The judge, Justice Garnham, said more work was needed to be done to tackle harmful air pollution in 45 local authority areas in England and Wales. “Good faith, hard work and sincere promises are not enough ... and it seems court must keep the pressure on to ensure compliance is actually achieved,” Garnham said when handing down the judgment. The government’s pollution plans have been criticized by environmental groups which have said the 45 local authority areas would be unlikely to comply with European pollution rules until 2021. Under the EU’s Air Quality Directive, member states were supposed to comply with nitrogen dioxide emission limits in 2010 - or by 2015 if they delivered plans to deal with high levels of the gas, which is produced mainly by diesel engines. Britain’s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said it would launch more formal plans for areas with less severe air quality problems. “We have already delivered significant improvements in air quality since 2010 and we will continue to implement our 3.5 billion pounds ($4.88 billion) air quality plan,” a spokesperson said.

2018-02-21,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) By Tom Polansek and Karl Plume CHICAGO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co would need to issue equity to help finance a proposed takeover of rival Bunge Ltd, according to investors and bond analysts, as a years-long slump in agricultural commodity prices makes a debt-only deal too risky. Issuing equity would dilute the ownership of existing ADM shareholders in what would be the biggest grains industry deal on record. But it would put the company on a stronger financial footing – helping it preserve cheap access to credit to fund its regular operations of buying, processing and selling corn, soybeans and wheat. “Given the importance for capital market access, there would have to be some sort of equity component in this transaction,” said Bill Densmore, senior director of corporate ratings at Fitch Ratings. ADM’s proposed acquisition of Bunge came to light last month, although neither side has confirmed that they are in talks. The deal has an estimated price tag above $16 billion and comes as years of bumper harvests keep crop prices low and make it difficult for grains merchants to turn a profit. That downturn means creditors may keep ADM on a short leash if it did the deal. For example, Fitch would potentially give ADM a shorter window than its usual 18 to 24 months to reduce the ratio of its debt-to-earnings - or leverage - after a deal, something critical to maintaining its A long-term credit rating, Densmore said “We would have less confidence in those earnings going forward,” Densmore said. Companies can be downgraded if leverage exceeds a certain ratio range for too long. Like Fitch, S&P Global Ratings has assigned ADM an A long-term rating, indicating a corporate bond that is an attractive investment with a relatively low risk of default. ADM has a comparable long-term A2 rating from Moody’s Investors Service, which uses slightly different labels in its scale. ADM relies on the good ratings for easy and cheap access to credit to buy crops from farmers, make improvements to processing plants and build new grain facilities. Merchants typically pay off short-term borrowings after processing the crops and selling them to users like livestock producers. Volumes are huge but margins are typically thin, which makes access to cheap capital essential. Last year, ADM processed more than 57 million metric tons of corn and oilseeds and exported millions of tons more. ADM did not respond to a request for comment. But Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on a Feb. 6 conference call that maintaining strong ratings is “paramount” to ADM. He suggested there were other ways of funding a deal than debt. “We’ve got so many avenues in order to help raise capital,” he said. “They have to do an equity deal,” said Sam Halpert, a senior analyst for VanEck’s Natural Resources Equity strategy, which owns Bunge shares and previously owned stock in ADM. To be sure, concerns about how ADM would finance a deal for Bunge could dissipate if grain supplies tighten and earnings improve. ADM, which has a market capitalization of about $23.8 billion,  would also likely need to sell some of Bunge’s assets to win anti-trust approval from regulators due to an overlap of their businesses, particularly in the United States. Cash from those sales would help pay down some of the debt, said John Rogers, senior vice president at Moody’s. Those sales would be material, he added, but could come at a time when they may not fetch the highest prices. Rogers said the estimated price for Bunge may be too high for ADM. “It just seems to be an awfully large price to pay given what you might get for some of these assets,” Rogers said. “But never say never in this business.” Bunge is rated BBB by Fitch and S&P and Baa2 by Moody’s, three notches below ADM’s ratings. Last year, Fitch and Moody’s cut their outlooks for Bunge due to weak earnings and after the company issued $1 billion of debt to buy a controlling stake in a Malaysian palm oil company. Bunge has declined to comment on ADM’s approach, which followed a wave of tie-ups among top seed and crop chemical companies, including Dow Chemical and DuPont. Bunge has a market cap of about $10.7 billion.

2018-02-21," BEIRUT (Reuters) - Despite the collapse of Islamic State last year and a widespread international perception that Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad is winning the war, there have been major new escalations around the country. Seven years in, Syria’s conflict has killed hundreds of thousands, driven millions from their homes, disturbed the regional balance of power and dragged in foreign nations whose rivalry has upset existing alliances. It is that international element that has helped transform the war from a straight fight between Assad and rebel forces trying to overthrow the president into a mess of overlapping conflicts. In the process, Syria has become a battleground for geopolitical rivalries, pitching the United States against Russia and Iran against Israel while inflaming the rift between Sunni and Shi’ite Muslims in the Middle East. GRAPHIC - Syria areas of control: http://tmsnrt.rs/2EHfWEH * ASSAD’s goal is clear: the complete recapture of all parts of Syria and the restoration of his government’s rule. * His strongest ally RUSSIA turned the war in his favour by sending its air force to help him in 2015. But it may be readier than Assad to agree concessions with his adversaries. It has brought Iran and Turkey into talks to stabilise the crisis by agreeing “de-escalation zones” meant to stop the fighting. * Assad’s other main backer is IRAN along with allied militias such as HEZBOLLAH from Lebanon. Tehran says it is fighting anti-Shi’ite Sunni militancy. But Iran’s critics say it wants to cement regional power with a “land bridge” extending from Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon. * The most fearsome Sunni militant group is ISLAMIC STATE. Its self-declared caliphate is now in tatters. But it still holds pockets of desert and will take advantage of any new conflict to undermine stability and retake ground. * Syria’s REBEL GROUPS all want to oust Assad but they are divided internally over whether they want a state based on Islam or Syrian nationalism, and sometimes fight each other. They want to keep the uprising alive, maintain foreign support and defend their remaining territory. * TURKEY was one of the biggest rebel supporters. Its main focus now, however, is driving the Kurdish YPG away from its border as it sees the militia as an extension of the PKK, a group that has waged a three-decade insurgency against Ankara. * KURDISH FORCES sandwiched between Turkey and Syria’s army want to cement their autonomy in the north, where they have set up ruling councils and held elections. They want to stop Turkey or Assad attacking their territory. * The UNITED STATES helped anti-Assad rebels earlier in the war but became more focused on fighting Islamic State. It backs the SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) alliance, whose strongest element is the Kurdish YPG. However, Washington wants to smooth the outrage this has caused its NATO ally Turkey. Washington also wants to contain Iran as it sees the country’s growing influence across the region as threat to its closest Middle East allies Israel and Saudi Arabia. * ISRAEL wants to stop any expansion of power for its mortal foes Iran and Hezbollah and keep them far from its borders. GRAPHIC - Afrin areas of control: http://tmsnrt.rs/2EGdEFF * Assad and his allies want to hasten the end of the rebels by pushing them from EASTERN GHOUTA, and are using the siege and bombardment tactics that helped them crush opposition in Aleppo, Homs and other former insurgent strongholds. * Many rebels have been pushed into northwestern IDLIB province and neighbouring areas, their biggest remaining stronghold. Turkey has sent some troops to Idlib to monitor a de-escalation zone there after talks with Russia and Iran. But a recent advance by Assad and his allies took ground in Idlib. * Turkey and allied rebels launched an assault last month against the Kurdish YPG in AFRIN, a region that is separated from a much bigger area controlled by the Kurds further east. While the United States backed the YPG in its fight against Islamic State, it has not supported it against Turkey in Afrin, calling only for Turkish restraint. Russia had stationed troops in Afrin to help stop any Turkish assault but it also wants Ankara’s cooperation in its wider peacemaking efforts in Syria and pulled them out. The Kurds then turned to Assad for help despite their rivalry. Assad has not sent his army there, but did dispatch allied militias linked to Iran to help the Kurds against Turkey. * Turkey may turn next to attack the YPG near MANBIJ, 100 km (60 miles) to the east of Afrin. It is the only Kurdish-led area west of the Euphrates other than Afrin. But unlike Afrin, there are U.S. forces in Manbij who have fired on Turkish-backed rebels and say they will defend themselves and their SDF allies. * The United States is also present in oil-rich EASTERN SYRIA, where the SDF and a rival campaign by Assad and his allies have each taken swathes of ground from Islamic State. Despite the YPG’s request for Assad’s help in Afrin, there is no sign of agreement between them in the east, where U.S. jets backing Kurdish-led forces have struck Assad’s allies. * Potentially the most explosive area of conflict in Syria is the SOUTHWEST, where rebels still hold a swathe of territory near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The United States, Russia and Jordan, whose border is nearby, agreed a de-escalation zone there last year. But Assad and allied militia with ties to Iran and Hezbollah waged a weeks-long ground campaign there last year and remain stationed in the area. This is anathema to Israel, which sees the militias as Iranian pawns. Israel shot down an Iranian drone this month and responded with air raids in which one of its jets was downed. It showed the risk of fighting in Syria leading to a wider confrontation between Israel and Iran that could also expand to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Any war between Israel and Iran and its allies would also risk dragging in the United States.

2018-02-21,"(Updates with Transneft’s comments) LONDON/MOSCOW, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Shipments of oil products from a Russian Black Sea port, hit by a managerial conflict, have “collapsed”, Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft said on Wednesday. A Transneft spokesman said as many as six tankers have been held up at the port of Novorossiisk and 2,400 railcars have been waiting for reloading. Four industry sources told Reuters earlier that shipments from the IPP terminal at Novorossiisk have been disrupted since early February due to a row over control of the port. Transneft blames the port’s captain for “unlawful” interference in its commercial operations. It added that it was experiencing a shortage of railcars for loadings at Tikhoretsk, a railway junction and pipeline hub in the region, and had asked Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov to intervene. Three sources said oil product shipments from the IPP terminal at the port of Novorossiisk have been delayed over a managerial conflict. The port did not reply to a written request for comment. Trading sources said that loading operations of two tankers - Andromeda, chartered by Litasco, and Trafigura’s Atlantas II - had been cancelled. “Ships have been waiting in the harbour of Novorossiisk,” a trader said. It is not clear when the port will return to normal operations. Each month it handles around 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes of oil products, mainly naphtha and diesel.

2018-02-21,"BAKU, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil-rich Azerbaijan is making progress in its drive to diversify sources of economic growth and improve its business environment but needs to do more, officials from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday. Azerbaijan’s economy was hit by a slide in the price of oil, which with gas accounts for about 75 percent of state revenues and 45 percent of gross domestic product. But it stabilised last year, growing 0.1 percent as oil prices rebounded and the service and agriculture sectors expanded. “There is still a lot of work to be done, but ... the government is taking measures to encourage the non-oil part of the economy to grow,” the World Bank’s country manager, Naveed Hassan Naqvi, told Reuters in an interview. “When policymakers in Azerbaijan talk about diversification, they talk of improving the agriculture sector, improving services.” The World Bank expects the Azeri economy to grow by 1-1.5 percent in 2018, he said. Naqvi said there were some signs of improvement in the business environment in the last 18 months in the ex-Soviet country, including simplification of visa regulations for foreign visitors. Nariman Mannapbekov, the Asian Development Bank’s country manager, praised measures taken in the agriculture sector and the implementation of structural reforms to improve trade. “We see good progress in the simplification of customs clearance, the introduction of electronic payments of custom duties, reducing the time period for getting some licenses,” Mannapbekov told Reuters. He said the Asian Development Bank (ADB) wanted to see reforms in agriculture that were sustainable and results-oriented, and said the introduction of strong corporate governance at large state-owned enterprises would be “beneficial for the economy and its diversification.” Mannapbekov said that in April the ADB might raise its forecast slightly for 1 percent economic growth in Azerbaijan this year. The ADB supports Azerbaijan via programmes to improve governance and public sector efficiency, while the World Bank helps the country to improve its business environment by advising on budget and judicial reform.

2018-02-21,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should raise taxes on fossil fuels to help meet goals on climate change and plug a budget gap after Britain leaves the bloc, former senior EU officials said in a letter to EU leaders. European leaders will discuss options for the bloc’s next long term budget from 2021 to 2027 at a summit on Friday and the taxes were not among those laid out by the EU executive ahead of the talks. Instead, the European Commission proposed that a share of the revenue from national auctions of carbon permits under the bloc’s cap-and-trade Emission Trading System be used. “We call on the EU to create a contribution of the oil, gas and coal sector to the EU budget,” 19 economists wrote in the letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday and dated Feb. 20. Italian prime minister Enrico Letta, former WTO director Pascal Lamy, former German finance minister Hans Eichel and Belgian economist Paul de Grauwe were among the signatories. A “modest” price level of five euros per ton of carbon dioxide on coal, oil and gas burned in Europe would generate revenues of around 17 billion euros per year, they wrote. The letter also proposed raising the EU’s minimum diesel tax, introducing a kerosene tax to tackle aviation emissions or applying a minimum value added tax to airplane tickets. The Brussels-based climate campaign group Transport & Environment said the letter added clout to policy debates over using taxes to tackle air pollution from transport, Europe’s largest source of emissions. As part of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees, the bloc has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

2018-02-21,"(Adds stock reaction, analyst comments) By Jose Elías Rodríguez MADRID, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Shares in Spain’s Iberdrola fell 3.7 percent on Wednesday as concerns about lacklustre profit growth and a flat dividend over the next four years overshadowed its 32 billion euro ($39 billion) investment plan for the period. Iberdrola, which supplies energy to more than 30 million people in countries including Spain, the United States and Britain, said it planned to book a net profit of between 3.5 billion and 3.7 billion euros in 2022. The forecasts implied compound annual growth of 5.7 percent in the next four years compared to an earlier company prediction of 7.5 percent from 2016 to 2022, RBC Capital Markets said. Iberdrola, which also reported a 7.8 percent drop in annual core earnings that was lower than expected, recommended a 2017 dividend of 0.32 euro per share and said its 2022 profit forecast implied a 0.40 euro per share dividend for that year. RBC Capital Markets said earlier company forecasts pointed to a dividend of 0.37 to 0.40 euro per share for 2020, meaning there was hardly any increase. The firm said its four-year investment plan would focus on networks, renewable energy and Mexican power purchase contracts. By 1154 GMT, shares in the firm which is based in Spain’s Basque Country were down 3.7 percent at 5.92 euros, their lowest in a year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to 7.32 billion euros, hurt by drought in Spain and sterling’s depreciation against the euro. Hydroelectric production in Spain has plunged because of low rainfall in 2017 that has left rivers and reservoirs dry. Revenue in Iberdrola’s networks business in Britain, where it owns Scottish Power, fell 7.4 percent on lower demand and margins. Net profit rose 3.7 percent to 2.8 billion euros, compared with a Reuters forecast of 2.59 billion euros, buoyed by capital gains from a U.S. tax reform. The company booked a one-off capital gain of 1.28 billion euros in 2017 from the U.S. tax reform, but most of this was used as provisions to adjust values of some assets, it said.

2018-02-21,"ROME, Feb 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - European cities in the second half of the century may face significantly worse heatwaves, deepening drought, and more river floods if global temperatures continue to rise - something they need to begin preparing for now, researchers said on Wednesday. Global temperatures are already 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and are projected to rise to 3 degrees or more this century unless emissions are rapidly curbed, according to the United Nations. If that rise happens, central European cities will see the greatest increase in temperature during heatwaves - of between 2 degrees and 14 degrees Celsius, depending on the rise in global temperatures - researchers from Britain’s Newcastle University said. The researchers, who studied the impact of global temperature hikes of between 2.6 degrees and 4.8 degrees Celsius, said southern European cities will see the biggest increases in the number of heatwave days, however. Droughts also will become longer and drier and - in the worst-case scenario - will reach northern Europe, they said. “We are already starting to see an increase in heatwaves and drought and flooding, so cities need to start thinking about adapting now, or even yesterday,” said Selma Guerreiro, lead author of a study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Much of southern Europe experienced lengthy droughts last year, which caused widespread fires and decimated crops. Rome turned off its public fountains and only narrowly avoided rationing water supplies to homes. Britain and Germany have experienced severe flooding in recent years, and Paris was forced to evacuate 1,500 people when the Seine flooded last month. “There is an awful lot of extreme weather hitting us,” said co-author Richard Dawson. The drought now threatening water supplies in Cape Town is a stark example of how cities need to adapt long before a drought or flood hits. Once a drought kicks in and the water starts to run dry, it may be too late to build another reservoir or desalination plant, Dawson said. Heatwaves and floods pose similar problems. “So you have to really start thinking longterm in terms of preparing and adapting cities for any sort of climate event,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Cities can build large infrastructure such as reservoirs or flood barriers, or can make smaller incremental changes repeatedly, he said. Buildings also could be designed to be naturally cooler, use less water, or be more resilient to flooding. People, too, can change their behaviour to use less water, he said. “A combination of all of those things is probably the best way to (adapt),” Dawson said. If a city can reduce its need for water, or its exposure to climate risks - by cutting the number of people living in flood plains, for example - then its overall vulnerability goes down, he said. ""And if we make buildings more resilient to floods and heat, and more effective at using water resources, then we can create more headroom for adaptation to more extreme events,"" he said.

2018-02-21,"BEIRUT, Feb 21 (Reuters) - A senior U.S. diplomat met Lebanon’s foreign minister on Wednesday in Beirut as part of a U.S. shuttle diplomacy effort to resolve a worsening dispute between Israel and Lebanon over a border wall and energy drilling in disputed waters. Disputes over Israeli construction of the border wall, Lebanon’s start of oil and gas exploration at sea and the growing arsenal of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Shi’ite group Hezbollah have caused a spike in tensions between Lebanon and Israel, both friends of the United States that regard each other as enemies. Lebanon this month signed its first offshore energy exploration and production agreements with a consortium of France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek. One of two blocks given to the consortium, Block 9, contains waters claimed by Israel. David Satterfield, the acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, has been shuttling back and forth between Israel and Lebanon in a bid to resolve the disputes. He met Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil on Wednesday in Beirut. The two had last met last Friday, after which Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reiterated the Lebanese state’s rejection of U.S. proposals to resolve the maritime dispute as “unacceptable”. This was an apparent reference to a maritime demarcation line proposed by U.S. diplomat Frederic Hof in 2012, which would give Lebanon around two thirds and Israel around one third of a disputed triangular area of sea of around 860 sq km (330 square miles). Satterfield left both meetings without making any public comments. The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon said Satterfield “continues to engage” on regional issues and on helping Lebanon develop its resources in agreement with its neighbours.

2018-02-21,"* Commodities fall on stronger dollar * World stocks fall for third day * U.S. 2-year Treasury yield at highest since Sept. 2008 * Euro zone bond yields dip on lower PMIs (Updates throughout) By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest level in a week on Wednesday and world stocks fell for the third day as investors braced for minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting to see if they would herald more rises in interest rates and global bond yields. Wall Street looked set for a weaker session, with equity futures down around 0.2 percent and the VIX volatility gauge up for the third day in a row. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, rose 0.2 percent. The index has bounced almost 1 percent so far this week, after slumping 1.5 percent the previous week to its lowest level in three years . MSCI’s world index of stocks was down 0.1 percent, set for its third straight decline this week, as a down day in Europe offset earlier gains in Asia. Investor attention is on the minutes of the Fed’s last policy meeting in late January, due at 1900 GMT. The last readings of U.S. wages and inflation came in higher than expected, with some blaming the numbers for a violent sell-off in stocks earlier this month. “Markets are particularly sensitive to inflation, and we think the odds that the minutes reinforce the narrative of firming inflation are high,” said Elsa Lignos, RBC’s global head of FX strategy. “We think there is a high probability that the Fed moves the dots to four hikes in 2018 (from three) near-term, and that the minutes could be another step in that direction.” The U.S. currency has been weighed down this year by concerns that Washington might pursue a weak-dollar strategy, and by the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easy-money strategies. Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit. But the greenback appeared finally to be benefiting from rising U.S. bond yields, especially as the Treasury Department is issuing more debt in anticipation of a higher deficit from last year’s tax overhaul and plans to increase federal spending. As markets braced for the next wave of this week’s $258 billion deluge of new debt, two-year and 10-year yields eased a touch, with the former retreating from nine-year highs of 2.282 percent, hit on Tuesday. German bond yields, the benchmark for Europe, fell to two-week lows after weaker-than-expected business activity data in the two biggest euro zone economies . The data dampened expectations of a speedy end to the European Central Bank’s ultra-easy monetary policies. “It might well be the case that people in the market were getting carried away about strength of recovery and what that means for the ECB,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. In Britain, an unexpected jump in the jobless rate weighed on the pound.. While emerging Asian shares had shrugged off Wall Street’s Tuesday weakness to rise 0.7 percent, and Japan’s Nikkei firmed 0.2 percent, the momentum failed to carry into Europe. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.6 percent and Germany’s DAX lost 0.8 percent, still spooked by the recent rises in bond yields. There were some bright spots, however, such as bank Lloyds , telecommunications firm Orange and commodities trader Glencore. Analysts noted that more than half of MSCI Europe firms have either met or beaten analysts’ earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. “The underlying earnings season has been quietly delivering the goods,” UBS equity strategists told clients, adding that they remained bullish on European equities for 2018. On commodity markets, dollar strength fuelled a half percent fall in Brent crude futures to $64.61 per barrel. U.S. crude oil futures slipped 1 percent to $61.16.

2018-02-21,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text) By Anthony Boadle BRASILIA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - President Michel Temer’s decision to throw in the towel on reforming Brazil’s loss-making pension system leaves the unpopular measure as a campaign issue for October’s elections and a major headache for his successor. Monday’s announcement that Temer was abandoning an overhaul of the social security system - billed as the centerpiece of his efforts at fiscal reform - sparked immediate concern from credit rating agencies that Latin America’s largest economy was failing to put its financial house in order. Brazil’s generous pension system is at the heart of budget deficit that ballooned from 3 percent of GDP in 2013 to a massive 10 percent in 2015, before edging back to 8 percent last year as the $1.8 trillion economy emerged from recession. The official reason for dropping the pension bill was a military intervention in crime-plagued Rio de Janeiro state, decreed on Friday after unprecedented violence during Carnival. Constitutional amendments such as the pension bill are blocked during federal intervention of a state. Deploying the army in Rio will go down well with voters in a nation where polls show public safety is the top concern. Brazil has 60,000 murders a year and its cities are among the world’s most dangerous. Temer’s critics, however, said he merely found a pretext to avoid acknowledging an embarrassing defeat. While Temer, 77, came close to the super majority needed to pass the bill last year, he lost political capital fighting off corruption charges and the government soon discovered it had run out of time, as lawmakers seeking re-election this year refused to back the unpopular legislation. “Now the government does not have to admit it lost the battle for pension reform,” said Fabio Sousa, a congressman for the centrist Brazilian Social Democratic Party, which backed the reform. “The next president will have to do the fiscal adjustment, which is fine, because he will have a mandate from voters to do something about it,” Sousa said in an interview. “The good thing is that pension reform will now be an election campaign issue.” Temer, a former vice president, replaced impeached leftist Dilma Rousseff in 2016. But he has single-digit approval ratings that rule out a presidential bid of his own. Brazilian markets were stable on Tuesday, with Sao Paulo’s BOVESPA stock index gaining 1.2 percent in mid-afternoon as investors had largely expected an already watered-down pension reform to sink in Congress. In an effort to reassure investors, Temer’s cabinet on Monday announced plans to accelerate 15 other policies - ranging from tax breaks to privatizing Brazil’s largest utility and strengthening the central bank’s autonomy. Yet Moody’s Investors Service promptly warned on Tuesday that the government’s pension decision was credit negative and would restrict its ability to comply with a spending ceiling approved last year. The government is expected to meet its 2018 deficit target but it is doubtful it can do so in 2019, as a sluggish recovery from Brazil’s worst recession on record has left tax revenues struggling. According to the main industry lobby, the CNI, the reform would have saved government coffers about 1 trillion reais ($308 billion) over the next decade. Brazil’s gross public debt already stands at 4.9 trillion reais ($1.5 trillion) or 75 percent of GDP - relatively high for an emerging economy. Without steps to reduce heavy mandatory spending, it will continue climbing, said Felipe Salto, head of the Independent Fiscal Institute, a bipartisan Senate office that aims at transparency in government accounts. Government projections have the debt stabilizing in 2020 at 80 percent of GDP, but without pension reform that is in doubt. “You have to show investors it will stabilize. If there is no horizon of stabilization, the market will see a risk of insolvency and higher interest rates will be needed to finance a snowballing debt,” Salto said. $1 = 3.2455 reais

2018-02-21,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - A tough water-saving regime and the generosity of farmers have given South Africa’s main tourist hub welcome respite from a severe drought and helped push back a dreaded “Day Zero” when Cape Town’s taps are expected to run dry. On Tuesday, the city of four million moved its estimate for “Day Zero” to July 9 from June 4 due to a decline in water usage, and after the Groenland farmers association also released 10 billion liters of water from their private reservoirs into the Steenbras storage dam.  South Africa has declared a national disaster over the drought afflicted southern and western regions, including Cape Town, which means the government could spend more money and resources to deal with the crisis. Cape Town, which attracts about two million visitors each year, wants to become more resilient as the effects of climate change are felt, similar to other dry cities including Melbourne and California. “We know that while we are going through a challenging time, we are building a world-class green economy that will be a beacon of hope for many places around,” said Tim Harris, chief executive for Wesgro, a regional trade and tourism agency. The chronic drought is hurting visitor numbers and knocking a rare economic bright spot, officials said previously. According to the South African Weather Service, two of the driest seasons ever recorded for the city since observations started in 1921 happened in the last three years: In 2015 when 549 mm (21 inches) fell and last year - the driest year on record - when annual rainfall totalled 499 mm. But, faced with severe water restrictions and punitive levies, residents of Cape Town have cut collective consumption by more than half in the last three years, as the city targets a daily consumption rate of no more than 450 million liters. At the moment, restrictions make it compulsory for residents to use no more than 50 liters per person per day, as city officials look to see out the hot summer months into winter, when Cape Town usually gets rain. “We must all keep doing absolutely everything in our power to reach the target set by the national department to reduce our urban usage by 45 percent,” said Ian Neilson, the deputy mayor. Already hundreds of Cape Town residents are being forced to line up overnight to stock up on water in South Africa’s second largest economic hub and tourism attraction. However, several desalination plants are planned and together with underground water reserves, are expected to help augment water sources well into the future.

South Africa’s chief prosecutor declared Ajay Gupta, one of the three Gupta brothers accused of corrupt links to former president Jacob Zuma, a “fugitive from justice” last week while India’s Bank of Baroda, which counts the family’s operations as clients, has pulled the plug on its South African business. “Our members are concerned that they might not get paid this Friday because the Bank of Baroda was handling their payments,” said NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu. South Africa’s main commercial banks have cut all ties with the Guptas, citing reputational risk. Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied any wrong-doing. Mammburu said NUM members at the coal mine east of Johannesburg, which supplies state-run power utility Eskom, were also anxious about the future of the mine and were wondering if it had been sold or not. The Business Day newspaper reported this week that the mine could be shut down over its failure to operate a community water desalination plant, which is a requirement for its mining licence. South African mining companies are required to meet social and labour obligations to maintain their permits.

2018-02-21,"MUMBAI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp is set to hire international oil service giants for the first time to boost output from domestic oil fields in response to a government push to increase local supplies and cut expensive imports. ONGC, India’s biggest explorer, has short-listed U.S. oil service companies Halliburton, Schlumberger and GE subsidiary Baker Hughes to submit proposals on boosting production from two onshore fields, according to a document seen by Reuters. The three companies have until May to submit their proposals for what ONGC is calling a “production enhancement contract” for an oilfield in Assam state and another in Gujarat. “The shortlist is ready. We will now share our data on the two fields with these companies,” an ONGC executive said. The executive - who did not wish to be named as ONGC has yet to make an official announcement - said the final contract is likely to be awarded by May. Emails to Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes requesting comment on their participation were unanswered outside of U.S. business hours. The government last September proposed selling a 60 percent stake in ONGC’s producing fields to foreign companies to ramp up domestic oil and gas output and meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s target of cutting oil imports 10 percent by 2022. India’s oil production has stalled below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent years, even as oil demand has surged. That has resulted in its crude oil imports soaring, making it the world’s third-biggest importer, behind China and the United States. In January, India’s imports hit a record of almost 5 million bpd. ONGC, which the government hopes to eventually build into a global giant like Exxon Mobil or a state-owned oil major like PetroChina, has often been criticized by analysts and New Delhi for failing to increase its production. ONGC’s output - most of it from fields that have been operating for more than 30 years - is declining at the rate of 7 to 8 percent a year. A major part of the company’s capital expenditure is spent in efforts to pump more oil and gas to set off the yearly decline. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, ONGC’s standalone crude oil production stood at 20.855 million metric tonnes (417,000 bpd), a one percent fall from the previous year. Once the final contractor is chosen in May, the winning service company will be responsible for maintaining production at current levels, and also for boosting output incrementally from the two mature fields, the ONGC executive said. “We will reimburse the operational expenses incurred and share some pre-determined amount on each barrel of incremental crude that the contractor will produce,” the executive said. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes will get access to ONGC’s data rooms pertaining to its Kalol field in Gujarat and the Geleki field in Assam before submitting a final bid, according to the bidding document. ONGC might replicate the model for other fields if this pilot exercise is a success, the executive said. ONGC explored a similar move in 2016 and had signed agreements with Halliburton and Schlumberger aimed at enhancing production, but the agreements were later cancelled, according to reports in local media.

2018-02-21,"SHIKHARPUR, Nepal, Feb 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In the village of Shikharpur in Nepal’s remote Himalayan foothills, the faint sound of water can be heard trickling through a large metal pump. Standing in golden mustard fields, a huge solar panel powers the pump that provides some 40,000 litres of water daily to families still recovering from Nepal’s devastating 2015 earthquake. “Before (the pump) we used to walk two or three hours a day to collect water,” said Daley Sarki, a vegetable farmer whose mud home still bears the cracked scars of the disaster. A massive earthquake struck impoverished Nepal - home to famed Mount Everest - in April 2015, killing nearly 9,000 people and disrupting the lives of more than 8 million. Helping families recover has proved harder than expected, for reasons ranging from aid funding delays to a fuel blockade. In Shikharpur, located about 50 km (31 miles) from the capital, the 7.8-magnitude earthquake left most households without access to drinking water, said Ram Prasad Bolakhe, a community leader. “There were many problems,” he said, listing destroyed homes, contaminated water and frequent power outages. To improve access to clean water, a project led by British charity Renewable World set up a solar-powered pump that collects underground water and transfers it up 72 metres (236 ft) to the Himalayan village, where it is stored in tanks. The system serves about 120 households and a school, said Bolakhe, with each family paying for their own use based on water meter readings. The climate-smart technology has significantly improved people’s health, Bolakhe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that better sanitation and access to drinking water have limited the spread of water-borne diseases. Residents say it has boosted incomes, too. Sarki, a 54-year-old widow, said the time she has saved by no longer having to walk far to fetch water has allowed her and other women farmers to take up second jobs - in her case as a labourer on a dairy farm. The additional water also means she can grow more produce not just to feed herself, but to sell at the market. “My income has doubled,” she said, noting proudly that she can now grow crops, including tomatoes and cauliflowers, for two seasons a year. The project also trains farmers to use water more efficiently, grow off-season vegetables such as sweet peppers under plastic sheets that serve as makeshift greenhouses, and promote their produce to local markets and traders. One unintended consequence, said Bolakhe, has been bringing the community closer together as neighbours have to interact to manage the water system. It allows for equal distribution of water among all castes, including lower-caste Dalits like Sarki, and encourages villagers to meet and collaborate, he said. Rabindra Karki from International Development Enterprises (iDE) Nepal, a partner of the project that helps poor farmers, said the initiative had united villagers over a shared resource. “They’re aware of the system as theirs - they perceive that it’s for them, to fulfil their needs,” he said. Karki, whose organisation has set up other solar-powered water systems in Nepal as part of the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) programme, funded by the British government, said access to water is crucial for villagers to get back on their feet after the quake. Solar irrigation is more reliable and efficient than traditional water systems as it is less vulnerable to erratic rainfall and high altitudes, he said. The technology should be rolled out to more remote parts of the country to help disadvantaged communities, he added. (Reporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Zoe Tabary and Megan Rowling.

2018-02-21,"* Commodities fall on stronger dollar * World stocks fall for third day * U.S. 2-year Treasury yield at highest since September 2008 * Euro zone bond yields dip on lower PMIs By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest level in a week against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, as investor focus shifted to the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting. World stocks looked set to fall for a third straight day. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, was up 0.2 percent. The index has bounced almost 1 percent so far this week, after slumping 1.5 percent the previous week to its lowest level in three years . MSCI’s world index of stocks was down 0.1 percent, set for its third straight decline this week, as a down day in Europe offset earlier gains in Asia. Investor attention is on the minutes of the Fed’s last policy meeting in late January, due later in the day. The last readings of U.S. wages and inflation came in higher than expected, with some blaming the numbers for prompting a violent selloff in stocks earlier this month. “Markets are particularly sensitive to inflation, and we think the odds that the minutes reinforce the narrative of firming inflation are high,” said Elsa Lignos, RBC’s global head of FX strategy. “We think there is a high probability that the Fed moves the dots to four hikes in 2018 (from three) near-term and that the minutes could be another step in that direction.” The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easy-money strategies. Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit. U.S. Treasury yields helped to strengthen the dollar, rising as the bond market braced for this week’s $258 billion deluge of new government debt. The two-year Treasury yield touched 2.282 percent, the highest since September 2008. Increased government borrowing has put upward pressure on Treasury yields. The Treasury Department has issued more debt in anticipation of a higher deficit from last year’s major tax overhaul and a budget deal that will increase federal spending over the next two years. The stronger dollar weighed on commodities, with Brent crude futures losing 1 percent to $64.61 per barrel and U.S. crude oil futures also slipping 1 percent to $61.16. U.S. crude hit a near two-week high the previous day on news of inventory declines at a key storage hub and from expectations that top OPEC producers could extend cooperation beyond 2018.. Spot gold touched a one-week low of $1,329.42 an ounce, having declined 1.4 percent so far this week. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent after slipping earlier in the session following the U.S. market losses, which snapped a six-session winning streak. Chinese financial markets will resume trading on Thursday after being shut for the past week for the Lunar New Year. Japan’s Nikkei trimmed earlier gains but still ended the day 0.2 percent higher. Australian stocks were nearly flat and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.55 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.2 percent. European shares retreated in early trading, under pressure from a continued rise in bond yields, with pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.6 percent and Germany’s DAX falling 0.2 percent. Bond yields did not rise across the board however - lower- than-expected readings of purchasing manager surveys in France, Germany and the euro zone all came in lower than expected, stabilizing euro zone bond markets .

2018-02-21,"(Repeats yesterday’s story with no changes to text) By Stine Jacobsen COPENHAGEN, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Prospects for the offshore oil drilling market are improving but profits for drillers are still under pressure and rates will not rise before 2019, the head of A.P. Moller-Maersk’s energy business said. Oil firms have seen cash flow climb in 2017 a high since a three-year slump in crude prices, lifted by their cost-cutting plans and a crude price recovery. Although this has spurred new investment, it has yet to benefit suppliers, such as Maersk, which sold its North Sea-focused oil and gas business to France’s Total last year and now focuses on providing transport and logistics. “You see from the oil companies’ 2016 and 2017 earnings that they’ve performed really well. You also see that they have started increasing capital expenditure,” Claus Hemmingsen told Reuters on the sidelines of Maersk’s capital markets day. “But one of the reasons that they’re faring better is also because they’ve put an enormous pressure on their suppliers,” the CEO of the energy unit said, adding “profitability is still low and under pressure” for suppliers. Hemmingsen said the industry could see a “small uptick” in business this year, with increased demand for jack-up rigs for shallow waters, although there was still little sign of a boost in demand for deepwater rigs. “We believe the market in 2018 will still be under pressure,” he said. “I think day rates will start increasing in 2019 and 2020 but we don’t expect the offshore services market to come back to the level before the oil price crashed.” Oil prices plunged from above $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 at the start of 2016. They are now at about $65. Hemmingsen said Maersk was still seeking a buyer or partner for its offshore drilling and supply service unit, but did not indicate how far the search had progressed. Danish business daily Borsen reported in January that Maersk might be looking to peers Norwegian peers Aker, Odfjell Drilling and Borr Drilling to sell the unit. Hemmingsen declined to comment on the report.

But spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow Wall Street’s lead and open lower, with Britain’s FTSE slipping 0.3 percent and Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC losing 0.6 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent after slipping earlier in the session following the U.S. market losses, which snapped a six-session winning streak. “Some investors in (Asia) are returning from the Lunar New Year break and trying to catch up after seeing the U.S. share markets make gains during their absence,” said Kota Hirayama, senior market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “If Chinese shares rise when trading resumes tomorrow, that could lift the region further.” Trading in Chinese financial markets will resume on Thursday after being shut for the past week for the Lunar New Year. Japan’s Nikkei trimmed earlier gains but held on to end the day 0.2 percent higher. Australian stocks were nearly flat and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.55 percent.

The two-year bill yield touched 2.282 percent, the highest since September 2008. Increased government borrowing has applied steady upward pressure on Treasury yields. The Treasury Department has issued more debt in anticipation of a higher deficit from last year’s major tax overhaul and a budget deal that will increase federal spending over the next two years. The dollar benefited from the higher yields, with its index against a basket of six major currencies edging up to a one-week high of 89.904.

The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easy money strategies. Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit. But the greenback managed to find bids once the dust began to settle after last week’s tumble. “We are seeing the dollar being bought back after last week’s slide. The steady U.S. economy and the possibility of the Fed accelerating its rate increases will likely keep fuelling the dollar’s rebound, particularly against the euro and yen,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. Later on Wednesday, investors will turn their attention to the minutes of Fed’s last policy meeting in late January. Analysts said a hawkish tone to the minutes could prompt markets to price in the risk of a faster U.S. interest rate hikes and help lift the dollar further.

2018-02-21,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Japan donated over 10,000 ballot boxes for Cambodia’s 2018 election on Wednesday, the first international aid for the vote after European Union and the United States withdrew their support following the dissolution of the main opposition party. Rights groups and members of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) have urged foreign backers, including Japan, to halt funding for Cambodia’s National Election Committee (NEC)following a Supreme Court decision to dissolve the CNRP at the government’s request. But last month Japan, which is among the largest funders of Cambodia’s elections, said it would continue to provide electoral aid in the lead up to Senate elections this month and a general election in July. At a ceremony on Wednesday, Japan’s ambassador to Cambodia, Hidehisa Horinouchi, said the NEC was in need of new ballot boxes to replace the ones given by Tokyo 20 years ago. “These ballot boxes are a symbol of Japan’s aid for democracy in Cambodia and I hope these ballot boxes will provide lasting benefits for holding future election smoothly,” Horinouchi said. “I hope Cambodia ... achieves an election that reflects the true will of the people.” The Japanese ballot boxes were worth $7.5 million (5.36 million pounds).  “Our Japanese friends have never abandoned us,” NEC’s Chairman Sik Bun Hok told reporters on Wednesday. The daughter of CNRP opposition leader Kem Sokha, who has been jailed on treason charges, urged Japan to explain its support for the July election. “Japan has to explain to at least half of the entire Cambodian population why it is supporting an artificial election,” Kem Monovithya told Reuters.    Cambodia needs 30,000 ballot boxes, said Sik Bun Hok, adding that Chinese equipment for the general election, including ballot boxes and booths, was due to arrive in March. China is Cambodia’s biggest aid donor and its backing has bolstered veteran Prime Minister Hun Sen in the face of criticism of over what his opponents say amounts to his destruction of democracy. Hun Sen is expected to extend his 33-year rule at the elections.

2018-02-21,"* Annual profit rockets to $336 mln, misses forecasts * In better position to revive dividend * LNG joint venture with ENN to tap China demand growth * Shares fall 2.7 pct (Adds CEO comments) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Santos Ltd, Australia’s No. 2 independent gas producer,  reported a more-than-fivefold rise in annual underlying profit on Wednesday, and flagged it may soon be in a position to revive its dividend and embark on growth. Two years of deep cost cuts and a rebound in oil and gas prices have helped Santos escape from a massive debt overhang and put it in a better position to fend off predators, like private equity-backed Harbour Energy. Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher said the company has had no further contact with Harbour since it rebuffed a A$9.5 billion offer last year, and noted that its share price was now above the tentative A$4.55 a share offer. “We can’t shrink our way to success,” Gallagher told analysts on a conference call, pointing to opportunities to develop its existing assets in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Santos is also looking to beef up ties with its top shareholder, China’s ENN Group, and is in talks to set up a trading joint venture to sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China, the world’s fastest growing gas market. “With an end user like ENN, we see that as a marriage made in heaven,” Gallagher said. Santos is hoping to use its relationship with ENN to tap other end users in China, which last year overtook South Korea to become the world’s no.2 LNG importer. Santos’ underlying profit for 2017 rose to $336 million from $63 million a year earlier, thanks to cost cuts, higher sales volumes and higher oil and gas prices. The result was below analysts’ forecasts around $349 million that analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UBS put the miss down to bigger than expected foreign exchange losses. Santos shares fell 2.2 percent to A$5.065, underperforming a small gain in the broader market. Tribeca Investment Partners analyst James Eginton said the fall was due partly to the earnings miss and possibly because Gallagher said there had been no contact with Harbour. For predators eyeing Santos, the big prize would be its stake in the PNG LNG project, run by ExxonMobil Corp, in Papua New Guinea, which is set to double exports under a plan broadly agreed by the project partners. Gallagher said Santos is looking to buy into one of the gas fields, P’nyang, that is set to supply the PNG LNG expansion to match its 13.5 percent equity stake in the project. Santos could also revive its dividend this year, given net debt is on track to fall below $2 billion by end-2018, a year ahead of target, but the company would stay disciplined. “I don’t think we want to be jumping ahead of ourselves and drinking our own Kool-Aid until we get there,” he said.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan took early cues from overnight losses on Wall Street and lost 0.1 percent before rising 0.5 percent. Australian stocks added 0.1 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei recovered from an early slip to rise 0.65 percent. The Nikkei has gained in five out of the past 10 sessions, recovering from a four-month low amid turmoil in global markets. U.S. equities pulled back sharply from record highs earlier this month as a steady rise in Treasury yields raised worries that the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates more frequently this year than initially expected. “Market instability is likely to persist until the Fed’s policy meeting in March,” said Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief market analyst at Saxo Bank Securities in Tokyo. The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday to snap a six-session winning streak as a sharp decline in Walmart weighed heavily. Gains in Amazon and chip stocks helped the Nasdaq hold near the unchanged mark. Treasury yields rose overnight with the benchmark 10-year yield crawling back to near a four-year peak as investors made room for this week’s $258 billion deluge of new government debt. Treasury yields have risen in the wake of increased government borrowing. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued more debt in anticipation of a higher deficit from last year’s major tax overhaul and a budget deal that will increase federal spending over the next two years.

2018-02-21,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - An oil and gas worker on a Talos Energy TALO.UL platform in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was killed on Saturday while replacing piping, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said on Tuesday. The worker was injured while removing out-of-service fire suppression equipment and later died as a result of the injuries. The company has not publicly identified the deceased worker. No other personnel were injured and there was no fire or release as a result of the accident, Talos said in a statement.  The Houston-based company said it has initiated an investigation and was working with regulators in its review of the accident, which occurred about 64 miles (103 km) south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. The platform was being operated by Energy Resource Technology GOM LLC, a Talos subsidiary.  Offshore drilling accidents claimed 29 lives between 2009 and 2016, according to the latest data available from federal regulator BSEE, including 11 offshore workers in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion.  The Trump administration has proposed rolling back some regulations initiated following that accident, such as requirements for operators to get third parties to certify that safety devices work under extreme conditions. Talos’s Energy Resource Technology reported a fatality on a production platform in October 2013, according to BSEE. That accident occurred just a few months after federal regulators placed the operator on a performance improvement plan. In 2016, Energy Resource Technology (ERT) was ordered to pay $4.2 million and put on three years of probation for felony violations tied to its offshore activities. ERT pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to comply with regulations covering hot work and blowout preventer testing. It also pleaded guilty to violations of the Clean Water Act by dumping pollutants into the Gulf of Mexico and for tampering with methods for collecting water discharge samples, U.S. prosecutor’s said. ERT did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its safety record.

2018-02-21,"CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday that Venezuela had received $735 million in the first day of a pre-sale of the country’s “petro” cryptocurrency, aimed at pulling the country out of an economic tailspin. Maduro is hoping the petro will allow the ailing OPEC member to skirt U.S. sanctions as the bolivar currency plunges to record lows and it struggles with hyperinflation and a collapsing socialist economy.  Blockchain experts have warned the petro is unlikely to attract significant investment. Opposition leaders have said the sale constitutes an illegal debt issuance that circumvents Venezuela’s majority-opposition legislature, and the U.S. Treasury Department has warned it may violate sanctions levied last year.  Maduro did not give details about the initial investors and there was no evidence presented for his figure. He added that tourism, some gasoline sales and some oil transactions could be made in petro. “Today, a cryptocurrency is being born that can take on Superman,” said Maduro, using the comic character to refer to the United States, as he was flanked by mining rigs in a state television address. The official website for the petro on Tuesday published a guide to setting up a virtual wallet to hold the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency goes public next month. Venezuelan Cryptocurrency Superintendent Carlos Vargas last week said the government was expecting to draw investment from investors in Turkey, Qatar, the United States and Europe. The value of the entire petro issuance of 100 million tokens would be just over $6 billion, according to details given by Maduro in recent months, though no new price information was provided on Tuesday. The tokens will each be valued at and backed by a barrel of Venezuelan crude oil, Maduro has said.  Advisers working for the government have in the past recommended that 38.4 percent of the petros should be sold in a private auction at a discount of 60 percent. Maduro says his government is the victim of an “economic war” led by opposition politicians with the help of the government of U.S. President Donald Trump. Sanctions levied last year by Washington block U.S. banks and investors from acquiring newly issued Venezuelan debt, effectively preventing the nation from borrowing abroad to bring in new hard currency or refinance existing debt. The petro will not be a token on the Ethereum network, as was previously disclosed in a whitepaper provided by the government.

2018-02-21,"SINGAPORE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, weighed down as the U.S. dollar moved further away from three-year lows hit last week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.37 a barrel at 0144 GMT, down 42 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures had dropped 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close to $64.89 per barrel. Wang Tao, Reuters technical commodity analyst, said Brent could fall into a range of $63.92-$64.41 per barrel, as suggested by its wave pattern and a projection analysis. Traders said the declines were driven by a recovery in the dollar, which potentially hits fuel demand as it makes greenback-denominated oil imports more expensive for countries using other currencies at home. The dollar steadied against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, having pulled up from three-year lows set last week as traders shaved off some of the bearish bets against the U.S. currency. “The U.S. dollar continues to find firmer footing,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. Overall, however, oil markets remain well supported due to healthy demand-growth and supply restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started last year to draw down excess global inventories.

2018-02-21,"(Repeats with no changes.  (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2C9rZZC By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline consumption has levelled off as the stimulus provided by low and falling oil prices between 2014 and 2016 has faded, so refiners are increasingly turning to diesel and customers in emerging markets. U.S. gasoline consumption is forecast to rise by just 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, after remaining essentially unchanged last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Slower consumption growth stands in contrast to the earlier surge when usage rose by almost 260,000 bpd in 2015 and another 140,000 bpd in 2016 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, February 2018). Traffic volumes are also growing more slowly, after rising sharply during most of 2015 and 2016, according to separate estimates from the Federal Highway Administration. Traffic on U.S. roads was up by less than 1 percent in the three months to November compared with the same period a year earlier (“Traffic volume trends”, FHWA, January 2018). Traffic growth has slowed from a peak of well over 3 percent per year in the early part of 2016, shortly after oil prices hit their lowest point in the current cycle. Oil prices have been trending higher for more than two years and are now within $10 per barrel of their average real level over the entire of the last cycle (tmsnrt.rs/2C9rZZC). So while the cost of fuel is not expensive, it is no longer especially cheap, and the steady increase in prices has started to moderate consumption growth. The nationwide weighted-average retail price of gasoline was $2.67 per gallon in January, an increase of more than 60 cents per gallon compared with two years previously. If oil prices continue to climb through the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 as the price cycle matures, U.S. gasoline consumption growth will likely slow even further. After two years in 2015/16 when the U.S. motorists provided a significant boost to global oil demand, the main drivers of demand growth are rotating towards diesel and the emerging economies of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Freight volumes are rising at some of the fastest rates this decade in the United States and around the rest of the world. Since almost all cargo is moved by high-powered engines on ships, trucks and railroads that use diesel fuel, freight growth is providing a major stimulus for diesel consumption. In geographical terms, the fastest growth in consumption will come from outside the United States and the other advanced industrial economies. Developing economies accounted for most of the growth in oil consumption between 2004 and 2014 but were hit hard by the slump in commodity prices during 2015 and 2016. The economic downturn in commodity-dependent developing countries and associated slowdown in their own oil demand growth was one of the factors that worsened the oil price slump in 2015 and 2016. As commodity prices rise again, however, economic growth across emerging markets is accelerating and propelling faster increases in fuel demand and adding to the upward pressure on oil prices. U.S. refiners exported more than 1.1 billion barrels of finished petroleum products in the first 11 months of 2017, an increase of almost 12 percent compared with the same period in 2016. Finished product exports have accelerated significantly over the last two years and the trend is set to continue in 2018. With the focus for demand growth shifting from gasoline to diesel and emerging markets, fuel exports will become steadily more important for U.S. refiners.

2018-02-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude hit a near two-week high in a choppy session on Tuesday amid inventory declines at a key storage hub and on expectations that top producers could extend cooperation beyond 2018, while Brent fell under pressure from a stronger dollar. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC oil producers, including Russia, will discuss extending their cooperation for many more years when they meet in June as they seek to avoid major market shocks, United Arab Emirates’ energy minister and OPEC President Suhail al-Mazroui told Reuters. Data from market intelligence firm Genscape showed that inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, fell 2.1 million barrels in the week to Feb. 16, according to traders who saw the data. The combination of a new pipeline running from the hub to Memphis, along with reduced flows from TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline, have sent stockpiles in Cushing to the lowest in about three years.  Flows on Keystone pipeline were decreased after a leak in November.  A strengthening dollar .DXY, which hit a six-day high, however, weighed on oil prices. A more robust dollar makes oil and other dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 ended the session 42 cents, or 0.6 percent, lower at $65.25 a barrel after trading between  $65.81 and $64.78 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled up 22 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $61.90 a barrel, as the March contract expired. Prices rallied to a high of $62.74 a barrel early in the session, the highest since Feb. 7.   The most active U.S. crude futures contract for delivery in April CLc2 settled up 24 cents at $61.79 a barrel. Front month U.S. crude’s discount to the second month CLc1-CLc2 flipped to a discount ahead of the March contract’s expiration, falling to a low of a discount of 10 cents per barrel, the widest since Dec. 11.   Monday’s U.S. holiday for Presidents Day supported WTI’s performance compared with Brent as the U.S. markets caught up with Monday’s gains, said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany. The divergence in prices kept U.S. crude’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 near a six-month low after widening to more than $7 in December.  A narrower premium of Brent to WTI means it is less attractive for consumers in northwest Europe to import U.S. crude, especially with refiners conducting maintenance. Premiums for local North Sea grades are at multi-month lows. [CRU/E] “(Brent’s) premium has been narrowing. It’s more so that WTI has been rising and Brent’s kind of stayed flat ... it doesn’t make the exporting of oil out of the U.S. as attractive,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment manager Tortoise Capital in Leawood, Kansas.  Overall, oil markets remain supported by supply restraint on the part of OPEC, which started last year to draw down excess global inventories. Ayed Al Qahtani, OPEC’s head of research, said the excess of oil held in storage has fallen in the past year to stand 74 million barrels above the five-year average. This compares with a surplus of around 340 million barrels in January 2017, he said. “The latest discussions of the Joint Technical Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC nations concluded that the oil stocks are dissipating at a faster pace and the market will now rebalance between 2Q and 3Q,” Goldman Sachs said in a daily note.  U.S. crude inventories, however, likely saw a build for the fourth consecutive week, according to a preliminary Reuters poll. Weekly inventory reports have been delayed to Wednesday and Thursday because of the Presidents Day.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.15 percent. Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.2 percent. Australian stocks were down 0.05 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.4 percent. The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday to snap a six-session winning streak as a sharp decline in Walmart weighed heavily. Gains in Amazon and chip stocks helped the Nasdaq hold near the unchanged mark. U.S. equities pulled back sharply from record highs earlier this month as a steady rise in Treasury yields raised worries that the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates more frequently this year than initially expected. Treasury yields rose overnight with the benchmark 10-year yield crawling back to near a four-year peak as investors made room for this week’s $258 billion deluge of new government debt. Treasury yields have risen in the wake of increased government borrowing. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued more debt in anticipation of a higher deficit from last year’s major tax overhaul and a budget deal that will increase federal spending over the next two years. The dollar benefited from the higher yields, with its index against a basket of six major currencies rising to a one-week high of 89.802. The index has bounced 0.7 percent so far this week after slumping 1.5 percent the previous week to a three-year low. The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back easy monetary policy. Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit. But the greenback managed to find bids once the dust began to settle after last week’s tumble. “We are seeing the dollar being bought back after last week’s slide. The steady U.S. economy and the possibility of the Fed accelerating its rate increases will likely keep fuelling the dollar’s rebound, particularly against the euro and yen,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. The dollar was steady at 107.365 yen after gaining 0.7 percent overnight. The euro was 0.05 percent lower at $1.2331 following losses of 0.55 percent the previous day. The Australian dollar was flat at $0.7877 and the New Zealand dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.7340. The stronger dollar weighed on commodities, with U.S. crude oil futures slipping 0.25 percent to $61.63 per barrel. U.S. crude hit a near two-week high the previous day on news of inventory declines at a key storage hub and from expectations that top OPEC producers could extend cooperation beyond 2018.
