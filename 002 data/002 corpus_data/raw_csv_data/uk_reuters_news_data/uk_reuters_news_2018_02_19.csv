2018-02-19,"(Adds Egyptian petroleum minister’s comments) By Tova Cohen and Ari Rabinovitch TEL AVIV, Feb 19 (Reuters) - An Egyptian company will buy $15 billion of Israeli natural gas in two 10-year agreements announced on Monday, a major deal that Israel hopes will strengthen diplomatic ties. The partners in Israel’s Tamar and Leviathan offshore gas fields said they would supply the private Egyptian firm Dolphinus Holdings with around 64 billion cubic metres of gas over a decade - with half coming from each field, and the proceeds shared equally. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the agreements would “strengthen our economy (and) strengthen regional ties”. His energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, called it the most significant export deal with Egypt since the neighbours signed their historic peace treaty in 1979. Israel’s Delek Group Ltd and Texas-based Noble Energy Inc have led both gas projects. “Egypt is becoming a real gas hub,” Yossi Abu, CEO of Delek subsidiary Delek Drilling LP, told Reuters. “This deal is the first deal of potentially more to come.” The partners have also been trying to finalise a long-term deal to supply a Royal Dutch Shell Plc plant in Egypt. Egyptian Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told the private Egyptian television channel ON E that outstanding disputes would have to be resolved for the deal to go through. Molla’s comments refer to Egypt’s challenge to a 2015 ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce ordering Egypt to pay $2 billion in compensation after a deal to export gas to Israel via pipeline collapsed in 2012 due to months of attacks by insurgents in Egypt’s Sinai peninsula. “We don’t mind importing gas from Israel, but we have terms in order (to allow) something like this to happen ... most importantly, the settlement of ongoing arbitration,” Molla said. An Egyptian government official who declined to be identified said the deal did not mean Egypt itself would import any gas from abroad. “International private companies will import gas from abroad in the framework of their own needs, and will liquefy and export them again,” the official said, without elaborating. Shares in Delek Drilling were up 28 percent on the news and Delek Group shares were up 19 percent. Gary W. Willingham, Noble Energy’s executive vice president of operations, said the deals provided “further clarity and confidence in our expected cash flow profile for 2018 and beyond”. Noble Energy, which plans to sell its U.S. offshore exploration business, said the prices under the agreements were linked to the Brent oil benchmark, and promised more details when it releases results on Tuesday. Barclays analyst Tavy Rosner said weakness seen in Israeli gas shares over the past several months was due to investors’ doubts that gas exports would ever take place. “We believe today’s announcement will pave the way to a re-rating of the shares,” he said. Leviathan, located about 80 miles (130 km) west of Haifa, was discovered in December 2010 and is scheduled to start producing by the end of 2019. Exports from Tamar, which began production in 2013, are expected to start under the deal sometime between the second half of 2020 and the end of 2021. Delek said Dolphinus was a natural gas trading company that plans to supply large industrial and commercial consumers in Egypt. It added that Egypt had amended regulations last week to allow private groups to import gas. The companies did not specify when supplies to Egypt would start, and the delivery method has yet to be settled. One export option, Delek said in a statement, was to use the pipeline built by East Mediterranean Gas (EMG) to send gas in the other direction in the deal that collapsed. Another option would be to use a pipeline being built as part of a separate deal to sell gas from Leviathan to Jordan. The export agreements are conditional upon receipt of regulatory and government approvals in Israel and in Egypt. Noble and Delek Drilling together control 85 percent of Leviathan, with the rest held by Ratio Oil. They are joined in Tamar by Isramco Negev, Tamar Petroleum - a spin-off of Delek - and two other smaller partners.

2018-02-19,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - British Columbia said on Monday that it will formally challenge a ban of its wine by Alberta under Canada’s national free-trade pact, as a battle between the two provinces over a crude oil pipeline expansion project rages on. British Columbia (B.C.), a top Canadian wine producer, said it had notified oil-rich Alberta it was seeking consultation under Canadian Free Trade Agreement’s (CFTA) dispute settlement process as it looks to end Alberta’s ban of B.C. wine. Alberta halted purchases of wine from its western neighbor earlier this month, after B.C. proposed new rules to block increased oil shipments through the province, potentially holding up Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s (KML.TO) planned C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Alberta, Canada’s energy heartland province, is a major supporter of the project, while British Columbia is fiercely opposed. It was approved by Canada in 2016, though construction has been delayed by permitting issues. British Columbia has defended its proposed rules, saying it has every right to take steps to protect its land and waters, while Alberta says the rules are outside of the province’s jurisdiction as the pipeline is federally regulated. The spat has led to Alberta forming a task force to find new ways to strike back at B.C., while British Columbia has proclaimed April as B.C. Wine Month and has ramped up the promotion of its wine within its borders and abroad.

2018-02-19,"(Refiles to add full name and title of Venezuelan president in para 3) By Gabriel Stargardter MEXICO CITY, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s political situation could well be on the agenda during a trip by Mexico’s foreign minister to Jamaica next month during which Mexican oil sales are likely to be discussed, Jamaica’s foreign minister told Reuters on Monday. Last week, Reuters reported that Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray will travel to Jamaica and other Caribbean nations in March, as part of efforts to erode Venezuela’s oil-based influence in the Caribbean. Mexico has been looking at the possibility of replacing Venezuela’s Petrocaribe program that provided cheap loans for oil to Caribbean nations and has helped Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro retain diplomatic support in the region. “Jamaica buys (Mexican crude) ... on the spot market, so in terms of Jamaica having an energy relationship with Mexico, that exists, of course, and probably there will be discussions around that,” Foreign Minister Kamina Johnson Smith said in a phone interview on Monday, when asked about Mexico’s commitment to help improve energy security in the Caribbean. Johnson Smith said she had invited Videgaray to Jamaica last October and they decided his visit should coincide with a regional conference of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), due to be held in Jamaica on March 5-8. Videgaray’s visit represents the latest development in U.S.-led pressure on Maduro, who retains loyalty from some Caribbean nations that have long benefited from Caracas’ oil largesse and have been unwilling to shun the country in regional diplomatic efforts. “It could be,” Johnson Smith said, when asked if Venezuela would be on the agenda with Videgaray. “Hemispherical matters will, of course, be on the agenda.” “But the focus is very much on our bilateral cooperation, deepening trade and investment,” she added. Videgaray’s trip follows a visit to Latin America and the Caribbean earlier this month by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who announced plans to study how possible oil sanctions against Venezuela could be mitigated in the Caribbean. Mexico’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Mexican official told Reuters last week that Videgaray has sought to engage more with the Caribbean in the wake of a June meeting in which foreign ministers from the 34-nation Organization of American States (OAS) failed to reach agreement on a resolution criticizing Venezuela.

2018-02-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices hit their highest level in nearly two weeks on Monday, lifted by a global equity market recovery and tensions in the Middle East, although concerns of rising U.S. production tempered gains. European shares rose for a fourth straight session, with global stocks set for a sixth session of gains, following a sell-off triggered by fears of creeping inflation and higher borrowing costs. Brent crude LCOc1 was up 89 cents at $65.73 a barrel at 1802 GMT, after rising to an 11-day high of $65.75 a barrel earlier in the session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery CLc1 was up 82 cents at $62.50 a barrel, after earlier gaining as much as 1.44 percent to its highest since Feb. 7. “Benign stock markets are providing ... as are geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,” Commerzbank said in a note. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel could act against Iran itself, not just its allies in the Middle East, after border incidents in Syria brought the Middle East foes closer to direct confrontation. Trading is expected to be slower than usual on Monday due to market holidays in the United States and Greater China. The U.S. oil rig count, an indicator of future production, rose by seven to 798, its highest since April 2015, according to a weekly report from General Electric’s Baker Hughes unit. [RIG/U] That marked the first time since June that drillers added rigs for four consecutive weeks, and the figure was well up on the 597 rigs that were active a year earlier as energy companies have boosted spending since mid-2016 when crude prices began recovering from a two-year crash.  Surging U.S. production is offsetting efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers including Russia to curb production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of 2018.     Money managers slashed their bullish bets on Brent crude  futures by the most in nearly eight months in the week to Feb. 13, InterContinental Exchange data showed.

2018-02-19,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudanese rebels have released two Kenyan pilots they were holding after receiving compensation for the family of a civilian killed when their plane crashed last month, a rebel spokesman said on Monday. A Kenyan foreign ministry spokesman said in a text message the pilots had arrived in Juba. Their plane came down in Akobo, in the Greater Upper Nile region in early January, and the rebels asked for compensation for the family of a woman who was killed, and for others who lost livestock. Lam Paul Gabriel, deputy spokesman of the rebel SPLA-IO told Reuters that $107,700 had been paid. “I have just confirmed now that pilots have been released by the local leaders of Akobo after they received a full compensation from the Kenya delegates,” Lam said. “That is not a ransom. It is just a compensation requested not by the SPLA-IO but by the families of the deceased and the owners of the properties. All we did as SPLM-IO is just to facilitate the exchange and provide security for the pilots.”  A South Sudan army spokesman declined to comment.  Oil-rich South Sudan has been in the throes of civil war since 2013, months after President Salva Kiir fired his then-deputy Riek Machar. The conflict has displaced a third of the population, shut down most of the oil production and strangled the economy. Machar, who fled to Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 after fierce fighting broke out in Juba, is now being held in South Africa to keep him from fomenting trouble, diplomatic and political sources say.

2018-02-19,"KIEV (Reuters) - For the first time in Ukraine’s history, U.S. anthracite is helping to keep the lights on and the heating going this winter following a deal that has also helped to warm Kiev’s relations with President Donald Trump. The Ukrainian state-owned company that imported the coal told Reuters that the deal made commercial sense. But it was also politically expedient, according to a person involved in the talks on the agreement and power industry insiders. On Trump’s side it provided much-needed orders for a coal-producing region of the United States which was a vital constituency in his 2016 presidential election victory. On the Ukrainian side the deal helped to win favor with the White House, whose support Kiev needs in its conflict with Russia, as well as opening up a new source of coal at a time when its traditional supplies are disrupted. Trump’s campaign call to improve relations with the Kremlin alarmed the pro-Western leadership in Ukraine, which lost Crimea to Russia in 2014 and is still fighting pro-Moscow separatists. However, things looked up when President Petro Poroshenko visited the White House on June 20 last year. “The meeting with Trump was a key point, a milestone,” a Ukrainian government source told Reuters, requesting anonymity. The Americans had set particular store by supplying coal to Ukraine. “I felt that for them it is important,” said the source, who was present at the talks that also included a session with Vice President Mike Pence.  Despite Trump’s incentives, U.S. utilities are shutting coal-fired plants and shifting to gas, wind and solar power. Ailing U.S. mining companies are therefore boosting exports to Asia and seeking new buyers among eastern European countries trying to diversify from Russian supplies. Trump, who championed U.S. coal producers on the campaign trail, pressed the message after meeting Poroshenko. “Ukraine already tells us they need millions and millions of metric tons right now,” he said in a speech nine days later. “We want to sell it to them, and to everyone else all over the globe who need it.” The deal with Kiev was sealed the following month, after which U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said: “As promised during the campaign, President Trump is unshackling American energy with each day on the job.”  The deal helped to “bolster a key strategic partner against regional pressures that seek to undermine U.S. interests”, Ross added, referring to past Russian attempts to restrict natural gas flows to its western neighbors.  Ukraine was once a major producer of anthracite, a coal used in power generation, but it has faced a shortage in recent winters as it lost control of almost all its mines in eastern areas to the separatists. Along with South Africa, Ukrainian-owned mines in Russia have been the main source of anthracite imports but this is fraught with uncertainty. In the past Moscow has cut off gas supplies to the country over disputes with Kiev, while the Ukrainian government considered forbidding anthracite imports from Russia in 2017 although no ban has yet been imposed. Overall anthracite imports shot up to 3.05 million tonnes in the first 11 months of 2017 from just 0.05 million in all of 2013 - the year before the rebellion erupted. Neighboring Poland, which Trump visited in July, is also turning increasingly to U.S. coal. Its imports from the United States jumped five-fold last year to 839,000 tonnes, data from the state-run ARP agency showed.  In July Ukrainian state-owned energy company Centrenergo announced the deal with U.S. company Xcoal for the supply of up to 700,000 tonnes of anthracite.      Centrenergo initially said it would pay $113 per tonne for the first shipment, a price industry experts and traders told Reuters was expensive compared with alternatives.     However, chief executive Oleg Kozemko said the cost varied according to the quality of the coal delivered, so Centrenergo had paid around $100 per tonne on average for the 410,000 tonnes supplied by the end of 2017.     Kozemko said in an interview that the U.S. deal was Centrenergo’s only viable option after three tenders it launched earlier last year had failed.     “The idea to sign a contract with Xcoal was a matter of necessity,” he said. “We had agreements but they didn’t work out, because the pricing that they discussed with us and that we signed an agreement on didn’t work out.”     Data on the state tenders registry and documents seen by Reuters show that two of the tenders failed due to a lack of bids, while the results of the third were canceled.     If that contract had worked out, Centrenergo would have paid around $96 per tonne, according to Reuters calculations based on the exchange rate at the time of the tender in April. Energy expert Andriy Gerus told Reuters the Xcoal deal “probably helps Ukraine to build some good political connections with the USA and that is quite important right now”. The anthracite for Centrenergo is mined in Pennsylvania, which backed Trump in 2016. This marked the first time a Republican presidential candidate had won the state since 1988, and followed Trump’s pledge to reverse the coal industry’s history of plant closures and lay-offs in recent years.  Centrenergo says it and Xcoal agreed the contract independently of their governments and without any political pressure. However, Kozemko said: “If talks between the heads of our countries helped in this, then we can only say thank you... It was a mutual desire.” For the Ukrainian authorities, the diplomatic benefit is clear. When the first shipment of U.S. anthracite arrived in September, Poroshenko tweeted a photo of himself shaking hands with Trump in Washington. “As agreed with @realDonaldTrump, first American coal has reached Ukraine,” he wrote. Poroshenko’s press service said the deal “is an exact example of when the friendly and warm atmosphere of one conversation helps strengthen the foundations of a strategic partnership in the interests of both sides for the future”. The Washington meeting also discussed U.S.-Ukrainian military and technical cooperation. Soon after, the Trump administration said it was considering supplying defensive weapons to Ukraine to counter the Russian-backed separatists.     In late December the U.S. State Department announced that the provision of “enhanced defensive capabilities” had been approved.  Kozemko said the Xcoal deal was likely to be only the beginning of Centrenergo’s trade relations with the United States as it is currently holding talks on supplies of bituminous coal, a poorer quality variety.      “It’s good that we studied the U.S. market because we had never looked at it before. We see big prospects for bituminous coal,” he said, adding that other Ukrainian firms were thinking similarly. “We showed how to bring coal from America and they are following our lead.” Additional reporting by Natalia Zinets and Pavel Polityuk in Kiev and Agnieszka Barteczko in Warsaw; editing by David Stamp",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ukraine-usa-coal/how-a-u-s-coal-deal-warmed-ukraines-ties-with-trump-idUKL8N1Q34Y8,19 Feb 2018,"For the first time in Ukraine's

In a day of relatively quiet trading owing to market holidays in the United States and China, losses in Europe weighed on stocks globally, which had earlier been propped up by gains in Japan. European markets had opened positive, setting up the MSCI world index for its sixth day of gains but, by afternoon, the pan-European STOXX index had slipped over half a percent. [.EU] A poor update from Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) hit the consumer staples sector, outweighing gains among financials and strength in steel makers after the U.S. outlined proposals for hefty import curbs. Shares in Tenaris (TENR.MI), Outokumpu (OUT1V.HE) and Arcelor Mittal (MT.AS) - which have facilities in the United States - were the biggest gainers in Europe, up between 1 and 4 percent. The MSCI world index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent .MIWD00000PUS. The index has recovered nearly half what it lost between late January and last week’s low. The 4.3 percent gain it ultimately posted last week was its best weekly performance since December 2011. January’s two-week rout, triggered by worries about a rise in U.S. inflation, had wiped more than $6 trillion off the value of global stock markets. The sell-off took place despite global growth was helping to improve the corporate earnings outlook. Just before the plunge, world shares were trading at 16.66 times expected earnings, the highest levels since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. They are currently at 15.33 times. “Investors knew market volatility would be low as the U.S. and Canada celebrate public holidays, and that weighed on enthusiasm in this part of the world,” said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets. “Dealers decided to lock in their profits from week.” Equity investors have drawn some reassurance from a fall in the VIX .VIX - a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”. The index has remained below 20 for three days, last reading at 19.46. It spiked to a 2-1/2-year high of 50.3 two weeks ago, a jump that caused massive losses among investors who had bet equity markets would stay stable on a combination of solid economic growth and moderate inflation.

2018-02-19,"TIRANA (Reuters) - Some 200 Italian companies exploring deals in infrastructure, energy, and agriculture in Albania were told on Monday their poor neighbour offered lower taxes and less red tape than at home. Italy is Albania’s biggest trade partner and investor, but its businesses have missed out on the big privatisation deals across the Adriatic Sea, and its industrial presence is small. Italian businesses have invested over 3.5 billion euros (3.10 billion pounds), but its biggest internationally-renowned companies have preferred other Balkan countries because of a number of factors including corruption, unclear property titles and perceptions that the judiciary is inefficient, Italy’s ambassador said on Saturday. Eager to widen the scope of Italian brands beyond furniture, fashion and food, Ivan Scalfarotto, Italy’s deputy economic development minister, said Italian firms could supply advanced technologies in energy, railways and road-building. “What we have achieved so far is good but not enough for us,” Scalfarotto told reporters after a business forum in the Albanian capital.  “Our business could play a bigger game in the industrial sector,” added Vincenzo Boccia, the head of Italy’s powerful Confindustria association of companies. Albania is embarking on an ambitious $1 billion road-building programme to bring its road network up to European levels. Addressing the visitors in fluent Italian, Prime Minister Edi Rama told them to “see Albania as the Italy of their grandparents”, with “lower taxes and less bureaucracy”. Most Albanians speak very good Italian and half a million of them live and work in Italy. Corporate tax is 10 percentage points lower in Albania while VAT is four percentage points lower. “I hope a little part of the 20 billion euros in the hall stays in Albania, not only because Albania is growing but also because Italians feel at home,” Rama said, referring to the net worth of businesses present. “We would like Albania to be a little, efficient, Italy,” said Rama. “Our ambition is to industrialize Albania in the Italian style,” his economy minister, Arben Ahmetaj, said. Fabrizio Maggioni, sales manager for specialist electric train and tram maker Mont-Ele, said the sprawling Albanian capital Tirana of 800,000 people might need its services. Albania wants to build a train line to Tirana airport and to its biggest port, Durres, around 40km west of the capital. “The kind of traffic we saw last night means this city would need a tram over time,” Maggioni told Reuters.     Italian butcher Raffaele Tonon told the gathering he was sceptical about grandiose plans for investment, saying the country that abandoned communism 25 years ago needed a more practical focus. “We have to teach the youth the skills of trades, be it in meat and milk processing or whatever,” Tonon said. “I have seen businesses who left because of this.” Reporting By Benet Koleka, Editing by Jon Boyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/albania-italy-investment/albania-courts-italian-industry-with-low-taxes-idUKL8N1Q9386,19 Feb 2018,"Some 200 Italian companies

2018-02-19,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - France asked the World Court on Monday to throw out a case launched by Equatorial Guinea, saying the African country was wrongly using the court to shield the son of its ruler from prosecution in France following a corruption investigation.        The case before the United Nation’s highest court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, is seen as an important test of the limits of diplomatic immunity. Equatorial Guinea launched the case in 2016 after France raided the Paris residence of Teodorin Obiang as part of a corruption investigation that eventually resulted in his conviction for embezzlement in October 2017. Equatorial Guinea argued that Obiang was the country’s “Second Vice-President” when the 2012 raid took place and that his Paris residence therefore was part of its diplomatic mission.  The French “criminal proceedings against the Second Vice-President constitute a violation of the immunity to which he is entitled under international law,” it said in its complaint, invoking the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. But at the start of jurisdictional hearings on Monday, France argued that Guinea only sought to add the residence to its diplomatic residence after the raid had taken place. France’s representative Alain Pellet told the court to disregard the “wholly unbelievable circumstances under which the apartment on Avenue Foch suddenly became a part of the embassy.”  “How ever many positions ... he holds, Mr. Obiang is no diplomat,” Pellet said. Equatorial Guinea is due to respond on Tuesday. A French court found Obiang guilty of embezzlement in October during a trial in absentia and ordered the confiscation of more than 100 million euros worth of his assets. The residence at the centre of the Guinean dispute is a luxury residence on Avenue Foch in Paris — a grand, sweeping road near the Arc de Triomphe often favoured by wealthy African expatriates and politicians. The property, bought for 25 million euros in 2005, had 101 rooms, a gym, hair-dressing studio and disco with cinema screen. Pellet said French investigators found 18 luxury cars on the premises when they searched it the first time.  Obiang is the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has ruled the former Spanish colony for more than three decades. Rights groups have labelled his administration as one of the world’s most corrupt. If judges decide the international court has jurisdiction, then they would then move to hear Equatorial Guinea’s claim on its merits, a process likely to take more than a year.

2018-02-19,"(Adds background) KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia increased its crude oil exports slightly in December to 7.045 million barrels per day (bpd), official data showed on Monday. OPEC’s biggest producer, which has cut output since last year under an agreement between OPEC and other producers to ease a supply glut, pumped 9.980 million bpd of oil in December, according to the data from the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI). That was up from 9.891 million bpd in November but still below Saudi’s output limit of 10.058 million bpd agreed under the supply pact. Saudi Arabia told OPEC that it pumped 9.983 million bpd in January. Saudi exports in December rose from 7.016 million bpd in November, as a seasonal drop in domestic crude demand is freeing up more oil for export during the winter months. In December, use of crude oil in Saudi Arabia to generate power fell to 260,000 bpd from 304,000 in November, the JODI data showed, as cooling temperatures reduced demand for air conditioning. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia have extended their output curb agreement until the end of 2018. Saudi energy ministry Khalid al-Falih said last week that production by state oil company Aramco in March will be 100,000 bpd below February’s level, suggesting Saudi Arabia will continue to pump less than its OPEC target. Saudi crude inventories dropped by 4.709 million barrels in December to 245.009 million barrels. Its domestic refineries processed 2.828 million bpd in December, up from 2.778 million bpd in November. Oil products exports fell to 1.506 million in December while domestic demand rose to 2.294 million bpd. JODI publishes oil and gas data of producers and consumers.

2018-02-19,"JUBA, Feb 19 (Reuters) - South Sudanese rebels have released two Kenyan pilots they were holding after receiving compensation for the family of a civilian killed when their plane crashed last month, a rebel spokesman said on Monday. The plane came down in Akobo, in the Greater Upper Nile region in early January, and the rebels asked for compensation for the family of a woman who was killed, and for others who lost livestock. Lam Paul Gabriel, deputy spokesman of the rebel SPLA-IO told Reuters that $107,700 had been paid. “I have just confirmed now that pilots have been released by the local leaders of Akobo after they received a full compensation from the Kenya delegates,” Lam said. “That is not a ransom. It is just a compensation requested not by the SPLA-IO but by the families of the deceased and the owners of the properties. All we did as SPLM-IO is just to facilitate the exchange and provide security for the pilots.” A South Sudan army spokesman declined to comment. A Kenyan foreign ministry spokesman said they would issue a statement. Oil-rich South Sudan has been in the throes of civil war since 2013 months after President Salva Kiir fired his then deputy Riek Machar. The conflict has displaced a third of the population, shut down most of the oil production and strangled the economy. Machar, who fled to Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 after fierce fighting broke out in Juba, is now being held in South Africa to stop him fomenting trouble, diplomatic and political sources say.

2018-02-19,"LISBON (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday he was worried about the possibility of a direct confrontation between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement. Guterres said the latest signals from Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah showed the will to not let this happen  but “sometimes a spark is enough to unleash this kind of a conflict”. Hezbollah said last week it could act against Israeli oil facilities if necessary in an Lebanon-Israel offshore energy dispute. U.S. diplomats have been mediating between the two countries after a rise in tensions also involving a dispute over a border wall and Hezbollah’s growing arsenal. “I am deeply worried about hard-to-foresee escalations in the whole region,” Guterres told reporters in his native Lisbon, also referring to Israel’s concerns about various militia groups in Syria approaching its borders. “The worst nightmare would be if there is a direct confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah...the level of destruction in Lebanon would be absolutely devastating, so there are major points of concern around this situation.” The powerful Shi’ite movement is part of Lebanon’s coalition government. Israel sees Hezbollah as the biggest security threat on its borders. Hezbollah was formed in the 1980s as a resistance movement against Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon. The two remain bitter enemies but there has been no major conflict between them since a month-long war in 2006.

2018-02-19,"ZAGREB, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Croatia’s plans for a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk require a final investment decision by June if it is to hit a 2020 start target, the managing director of project manager LNG Hrvatska said on Monday. The project, part of European Union efforts to diversify away from Russian energy imports, is opposed by some environmentalists and residents. “The end of June is a definite deadline for the final investment decision if the terminal is to be completed by the end of 2019 and start operating in early 2020,” LNG Hrvatska boss Goran Francic told Reuters. The EU has said it would invest 101.4 million euros or 28 percent of the project’s assessed value and the United States has also expressed strong support for the terminal which could be used to import U.S. gas. The terminal’s initial annual capacity is planned at 2.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) which is roughly Croatia’s annual consumption. Croatia produces around a half of its gas consumption and the terminal would also supply central and eastern European countries. “By the end of May we should have agreements on using the terminal’s capacity. The number of non-binding offers from last year, mostly from foreign firms, bodes well for the ongoing binding tender,” Francic said. He said land and construction permits are expected in April and June, respectively, pending confirmation by the energy minister that the project poses no threat for the environment. An expert commission is likely to give its opinion on the terminal’s environmental impact next month. Francic said an environmental study, provided by LNG Hrvatska, had properly addressed all concerns about protection of the environment. However, environmentalists and local communities on Krk island have raised concerns about the impact on sea life and tourism and suggest the terminal be built on land instead, which is more expensive. “The problem for us is the use of sea water in the process of converting liquefied gas which will cool the water and is damaging in a small bay, as well as the plan to use chlorine for protection of the pipes from algae and shells,” said Vjeran Pirsic from Krk-based environmentalist group Eko Kvarner. The government has recently announced a special law to speed up the construction of the terminal which Pirsic also finds inappropriate. “It’s a restriction of democracy if the government goes against the will of the local communities by imposing a special law,” said Pirsic, adding that the project does not have to be scrapped but rather substantially improved. Environmentalists and Krk local municipalities have announced a protest against the terminal for March 3 in the nearby port of Rijeka. Pirsic said all legal means and methods of civil disobedience will be used to stop the terminal as it is currently planned. Marija Mileta from ecology group Zelena Akcija said Croatia should scrap the LNG terminal altogether and focus on renewables as non-carbon emitting energy sources.

2018-02-19," LONDON (Reuters) - Petroleum markets were hit by a heavy bout of profit-taking in the second week of February as hedge funds liquidated some of the record long positions they accumulated over the previous seven months. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by the equivalent of 152 million barrels in the week to Feb. 13. Fund managers have now cut the combined net long position in Brent, NYMEX and ICE, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil by a total of 215 million barrels over the three most recent weeks. Even so, the combined net long position is still 959 million barrels higher than at the end of June 2017, when fund managers began to turn bullish (For a chartbook, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2BCCBz1) The most recent week saw large reductions in net long positions in Brent (-32 million barrels) and WTI (-31 million barrels). But in proportionate terms, there were even larger reductions in European gasoil (-38 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-32 million barrels) and U.S. gasoline (-20 million barrels). Refined fuels accounted for 15 percent of hedge fund managers’ net long position in the petroleum complex but almost 60 percent of the liquidation in the week to Feb. 13. The reduction in net long positions across the complex was the largest pull for nine months, according to position records published by exchanges and regulators. In every contract, the liquidation of long positions far outstripped the creation of new short ones, indicating fund managers were realising some profits after the strong rally in oil prices, rather than turning outright bearish. Portfolio managers’ positioning remains very lopsided across the complex, with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of more than 10:1, down from almost 12:1 at the end of January, but still exceptionally high. The near-record imbalance remains a significant source of downside risk and could lead to a further sharp drop in oil prices if anything triggers further profit-taking. Fund managers still hold more than 1,400 million barrels of long positions in petroleum futures and options, a scale that was unprecedented until two months ago. There are fewer than 140 million barrels of hedge fund short positions, which is close to the lowest level since prices started falling in 2014, and means there will be little support from short-covering should prices fall. But the fundamental backdrop remains strong, with oil consumption growing rapidly, reported inventories declining and OPEC signalling production cuts will be extended through the end of 2018. Strong fundamentals have discouraged aggressive short-selling and convinced many fund managers to retain (most of) their existing long positions despite the recent pull back in crude prices.  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

2018-02-19,"* West European leg of SGC on track to open in 2020 * Project faced protests in Italy, but will not delay project * Could be expanded as Azerbaijan looks to develop more fields By Margarita Antidze BAKU, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The first phase of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) pipeline from Azerbaijan to Europe will open in July and could be expanded after it becomes fully operational in 2020, Azeri state energy company SOCAR said. SGC’s three pipelines - the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), the South Caucasus Pipeline through Georgia and the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) through Turkey - will provide the first direct route for carrying gas from Azerbaijan’s giant Shah Deniz field to markets in Europe. “We will start first commercial supplies of gas to Turkey (through TANAP) in early July this year,” Vitaly Baylarbayov, SOCAR deputy vice president, said in an interview with Reuters. TAP, the 870-kilometre (541-mille) end piece of the $40 billion corridor, has been more challenging, due to protests against it by environmentalists in Italy. The European Investment Bank approved a 1.5 billion euro ($1.9 billion) loan for TAP earlier this month and Baylarbayov said that the operating consortium would continue to seek funds for the project. “We can say now that the (SGC) pipeline will be put into operation on time, in 2020,” Baylarbayov said. The Shah Deniz I field, which has been pumping gas since 2006, has a production capacity of 8 billion cubic metres (bcm), and output from Shah Deniz II is expected to reach 16 bcm of natural gas per year, with 10 bcm earmarked for Europe and 6 bcm for Turkey. Baylarbayov said SGC could be expanded if promising new gas fields in Azerbaijan can be developed. He mentioned the Absheron gas field, where SOCAR is drilling in partnership with French oil company Total, and the Karabakh field which it is due to explore with Norway’s Statoil. Azerbaijan’s Umid and Babek fields could also be developed as could the next stage of Shah Deniz, he said. “Many foreign companies are also expressing interest in development of Umid and Babek fields together with SOCAR and we are in talks with them,” he said without elaborating on details of talks. The next drilling stage on the Absheron field area, which has estimated reserves of at least 350 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas and 45 million tonnes of condensate, is due to start this month with production planned for 2020. Baylarbayov said that the agreement between SOCAR and Statoil on the Karabakh offshore oil and gas field could be signed this year. $1 = 0.8052 euros

2018-02-19,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore said its sales tax will rise to 9 percent from 7 percent, but the change will only come “sometime” between 2021 and 2025, making it likely that the increase would kick in after the city-state’s next general election. Instead of getting a GST hike soon, Singaporeans aged 21 and above will get a “hong bao”, or Lunar New Year red packet, as Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced a “one-off” bonus in 2018 of up to S$300 ($228.50), depending on their income.   The bonus comes after Singapore’s trade-reliant economy grew 3.6 percent in 2017, its best pace in three years. Global economic growth, plus comments by policymakers on the importance of raising revenue to meet future spending needs for Singapore’s ageing population, led many analysts to expect that the Goods and Services Tax, kept at 7 percent since 2007, would increase as early as the coming fiscal year. “The surprise for us was that the planned increase was for a much later period,” said Jeff Ng, chief economist Asia for Continuum Economics. “This eases the need for a future government or administration to announce the GST,” Ng said. Singapore’s next general election is due to be held by January 2021. In the last one in 2015, the ruling People’s Action Party won 70 percent of the vote, a strong improvement from the 60 percent garnered in 2011. After announcing the planned GST hike, the finance minister said “the exact timing will depend on the state of the economy, how much our expenditures grow, and how buoyant our existing taxes are. But I expect that we will need to do so earlier rather than later in the period.” Singapore introduced a GST in 1994, with a 3 percent rate. This was raised to 4 percent in 2003 and 5 percent in 2004, then to 7 percent in 2007. The current rate is among the world’s lowest for a consumption tax. Besides the plan for raising GST, Heng unveiled other tax measures. These include increasing the top marginal buyer’s stamp duty on residential property worth more than S$1 million effective from Tuesday, raising the excise duty on tobacco products and introducing GST on imported services from 2020.  Coming in 2019 is a carbon tax, which will be S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions until 2023. The plan is to increase it to between S$10-S$15 per tonne by 2030.     Heng said spending needs will rise across various sectors in coming years, including in healthcare, infrastructure and security. The government expects average annual healthcare spending to rise from 2.2 percent of GDP currently, to almost 3 percent of GDP over the next decade, he added.  “With an ageing population and an increasing chronic disease burden, the demands on families and Government will rise,” the finance minister said. “We will need to spend even more on healthcare.”     Heng, one of several cabinet ministers considered a possible successor to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said in the speech “We must anchor Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.”  Song Seng Wun, an economist for CIMB private banking, said the one-off “hong bao” bonus was a product of Singapore’s economy having a “better than expected outcome” in the last year.

2018-02-19,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 19 (Reuters) - What do the moves by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to boost its share of the country’s cobalt bounty have in common with the former Thai government’s attempts to control the global market for rice exports? Both are examples of dominant producers of a commodity trying to extract more wealth from that position. It’s also likely that similar to the ultimate disaster that befell ousted Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the DRC’s attempts to extract more from cobalt will unleash a wave of unintended consequences, none of which will be positive for the government in Kinshasa. Cobalt has gone from a minor metal with an almost non-existent public profile to the major threat to the future of the switch to electric vehicles and battery storage for electricity. This is because cobalt is a key ingredient in the current technology lithium-ion batteries essential for both cars and electricity storage, and the DRC produces more than half of the world’s supply. The DRC is hardly a paragon of stable government, with President Joseph Kabila still refusing to hold elections even though his term expired two years ago. Much of the country remains beyond the control of the central government and its recent history has seen numerous conflicts that involved several neighbouring countries and various armed factions. However, Kabila’s government has made it clear that it now wants a greater share of the revenue from its vast reserves of cobalt, with the country producing 73,940 tonnes of the metal last year, a jump of 15.5 percent from 2016. Parliament has approved a new mining code that increases royalties five-fold to 10 percent, and removes a stability clause in the current law that protects miners from changes to the fiscal and customs regime for 10 years. The code still has to be signed into law by Kabila, and miners active in the country, including Glencore and Ivanhoe Mines, are lobbying for changes and talks about future taxation arrangements. The DRC’s state-owned miner Gecamines also wants to re-negotiate contracts with international partners to secure a bigger share of revenues. The DRC situation occupied much of the recent Investing in African Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town, with miners in attendance privately expressing fears that the DRC would ultimately move down the road to full nationalisation of the industry. What does this have in common with Yingluck’s policy of subsidising Thai rice farmers, a policy she introduced to win the support of the rural population who helped her to election victory in July 2011? Yingluck’s government saw what they thought was an opportunity to make global rice consumers pay more for the staple grain, which would allow them to pay generous subsidies to rural farmers. At the time, Thailand was the world’s largest exporter of rice, with a market share above 50 percent, and there was real market concern not only of rising prices, but also of shortages, much like today with cobalt. But what happened was that as soon as the new Thai government tried to raise export prices, the country became the supplier of last resort and buyers moved increasingly to competitors such as Vietnam and India. Ultimately the Thai government spent billions of dollars buying rice it couldn’t sell, forcing it to stockpile millions of tonnes of the grain, leading to fiscal pressure and allegations of mismanagement that helped spur the military takeover that removed Yingluck in May 2014. This isn’t suggesting that the DRC is heading toward a military coup, but there are similar dynamics starting to play out. The first is that the hunt for cobalt outside the DRC is going to be massively stepped up, with the United States and Sweden among those countries that have already said they are targeting new deposits of the metal. Secondly, huge amounts of capital are about to flow into finding alternatives to using cobalt in batteries, or at least reducing the amount of cobalt used for each unit. Thirdly, the DRC is likely to suffer an investment boycott if it goes ahead and implements terms that punish the mining companies that have taken a risk and put their money into developing the central African nation’s resources. Numerous commentators have pointed out that there is still a cobalt supply crunch on the horizon, as new mines, improved battery technologies and extensive recycling of used batteries is likely to still leave a shortfall of cobalt, assuming the forecasts for electric cars and power-storage batteries are accurate. This may be the case, but past experience has shown that when the price signal is strong enough, the response tends to happen far more quickly than anticipated. Right now, the price signal is flashing red, with London cobalt futures ending at $81,500 a tonne on Feb. 16, up 8.3 percent so far this year, but also up an astonishing 275 percent since the low of $21,750 from February, 2016. The DRC is in pole position to benefit from the expected surge in demand for cobalt, but only if it decides to pursue polices that don’t alienate mining companies and encourage the rapid development of alternatives.

2018-02-19,"NAIROBI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - State-run Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) plans to add 1,745 megawatts (MW) of electricity from geothermal sources by 2025, part of a government push to end power generation from fossil fuels. “You are aware that going forward, the government policy which all generators including KenGen and including independent power producers, is to eliminate generation from fossil fuels,” Moses Wekesa, Business Development Director, said during a visit to KenGen’s geothermal plants last week. Kenya has an installed generating capacity of 2,370 MW and peak demand of about 1,770 MW. Of this, KenGen, which is 70 percent owned by the government, has an installed capacity of 1,631 MW, with 533 MW from geothermal. Demand for electricity is growing at about 8 percent per year until 2020, and will rise to 9 percent in 2021, after which it will stabilise at 7 percent, according to the government’s transmission and generation plan. “First as a rule of thumb, your supply must always be ahead of demand. The reason being, that it takes a while to put up a power plant,” Wekesa said. The East African nation is ramping up electricity production and investing in its grid to keep up with growing demand for power and to reduce frequent blackouts. It relies heavily on renewables such as geothermal and hydro power. Kenya is ranked at No.37 worldwide by Ernst and Young’s latest Renewable energy country attractiveness index, issued in October. The Geothermal Resources Council ranks Kenya at no.8 worldwide in terms of installed capacity from geothermal.

2018-02-19,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke’s Aker Energy plans “significant” oil exploration and production in Ghana after a $100 million deal to buy Hess Corporation’s (HES.N) business there. Aker Energy said the proposed transaction, which is subject to approval from Ghanaian authorities, gives it a 50-percent stake in the ultra deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block which holds an estimated 550 million barrels of oil equivalent and has the potential for a further 400 million barrels. Aker (AKER.OL), Roekke’s main listed investment vehicle, owns 50 percent of Aker Energy, while TRG, his privately held holding company, owns the remainder.  Aker Energy plans to present a development plan for the block this year, with production from the West African country expected to start in 2021. “Ghana is still in the early days of developing its oil and gas resources, so for us, it means we can quickly build up there at a very exciting price,” Aker CEO Oeyvind Eriksen told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation. Eriksen likened the Ghanaian field to the Johan Castberg field in the Norwegian Arctic as both have a break even price lower than $35 per barrel. Brent crude LCOc1 was trading at around $65 on Monday. Roekke’s TRG is also involved in a separate block in the area, which may provide additional resources to the development, Aker said, adding that the plan is to use a floating production, storage and offloading vessel. Ghana is seeking to develop its oil and gas resources beyond its flagship Jubilee field. Overall it was expected to produce an average of 200,000 barrels of oil per day in 2017, the country’s deputy oil minister told Reuters in June.

2018-02-19,"(Adds more detail) AMSTERDAM, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The operator of the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands sees no need for further measures aimed at reducing the risk of tremors, it said on Monday, following a series of small quakes. Earlier this month, the Dutch government ordered production at the field to be cut by 44 percent as quickly as possible, and the immediate shutdown of five production points. That was in response to a magnitude 3.4 tremor, the largest in years, that hit the Groningen region in January. But both the operator, NAM, and gas sector regulator SodM warned further quakes, caused by decades of gas extraction, couldn’t be ruled out completely. This was underlined by three tremors with magnitudes of 1.7 to 2.2 between Feb. 8 and Feb. 11, which prompted SodM to demand a new review on production levels. In its report, NAM said the latest tremors did not merit additional measures, as the closing of the production points in the Loppersum cluster and the overall output reduction were expected to dampen earthquake risks within six months. NAM expects the latest measures to reduce production by 0.5 to 2 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year ending October 2018, compared with the original target for that year of 21.6 bcm. The government will present by the end of March a full overview of possible measures to cut production towards its ultimate goal of 12 bcm, and will also decide on the production cap for the year through October 2019.

2018-02-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - The owner of British budget airline Jet2.com said annual profit would be “materially ahead” of current expectations as pricing in the holiday market strengthened, lifting its shares.  Parent company Dart (DTG.L) said on Monday its profit for the twelve months ending March 31, 2018, would be boosted by “a more normalised pricing environment” for flights and holidays following a previous period of heavy discounting.   Its shares were up 14 percent to 740 pence at 0950 GMT. Jet2.com, which last summer was Britain’s fourth largest airline by passenger numbers and also sells holidays, would have benefited from the collapse of rival travel firm Monarch last year. Monarch’s demise came partly as a result of tough competition in the Spain, where a price war among airlines and tour operators coincided with hotels raising prices.  Monarch’s collapse removed capacity from the market, easing pressure on prices, which has also recently boosted Jet2.com’s bigger rivals easyJet and Thomas Cook. Analysts had expected Dart to post pretax profit of around 95 million pounds ($133 million) this financial year, before raising those estimates to about 113 million pounds on Monday.  Dart, however, said it was cautious on pricing for the coming summer holiday period and it expected its performance for its next financial year to be in line with the current one. Dart also runs a food distribution business in the United Kingdom, which it said was focused on growing its revenue pipeline.

2018-02-19,"WARSAW, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Poland’s coal imports from the United States jumped five-fold last year to 839,000 tonnes due to shortages on the domestic market, data from the state-run ARP agency, which monitors the Polish coal market, showed. Poland, which generates most of its electricity from coal, faced coal shortages last year mostly because mining giant PGG failed to meet its original output targets. That is why state-run coal trader Weglokoks, which mostly exports coal, has received two imported cargoes from the United States since November and is awaiting one more, a source familiar with the firm said. The cargoes will be mixed with Polish coal and exported and sold to local power plants. Coal imported from the United States accounted for 6.3 percent of total coal imports in 2017. Over sixty percent of the U.S. coal was coking coal used in steel making, but unlike in 2016, Poland also bought thermal coal overseas. Most of the coal imported last year came from Russia and Poland also significantly increased purchases in Colombia. The Polish unit of steelmaker ArcelorMittal also said it had imported coking coal from suppliers including in North America. “Due to the shortfall in domestic supplies of coking coal last year ArcelorMittal Poland was forced to import the missing volumes,” a spokeswoman for the Polish unit said in an email. “The increase of high sea imports in 2017 versus 2016 amounted to around 30 percent. The main import directions included: Australia, Africa, and Northern America,” she added. According to the energy ministry, Poland will remain dependant on coal for decades, with its share in electricity production seen falling to 60 percent by 2030 from around 80 percent now. Coal output at Polish mines fell 6.5 percent in 2017 to around 66 million tonnes.

2018-02-19,"(Reuters) - EnQuest Plc (ENQ.L) expects higher production in 2018, helped by its flagship Kraken oilfield and its acquisition of a 25 percent stake in BP’s (BP.L) Magnus oil field, the North Sea-focused oil producer said on Monday. The London-listed company’s shares rose as much as 9.1 percent in early trade. The positive comments on Kraken came after EnQuest struggled with operational issues and delays at the oilfield, which dragged its shares down in the second half of 2017. Gross production from Kraken averaged 35,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in January and delivered the targeted 50,000 bopd, EnQuest said. Total average production is expected to grow by between 33 percent and 55 percent to about 50,000-58,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) this year, EnQuest said. Production averaged 37,405 boepd in 2017. The company estimates total unit operating expenditure to fall about 6 percent to $24 per boe in 2018 and cash capital expenditure to be about 32 percent lower at about $250 million.  EnQuest expects to begin reducing its debt of about $2 billion, helped by the higher operating cash flow and lower capital expenditure. Spending on Kraken was also further reduced by about $100 million and the project’s cost is now expected to be about $2.3 billion, 25 percent lower than its original budget in 2013. Reuters reported in January that EnQuest hired investment bank Jefferies to advise on a sale of a 20 percent stake in Kraken.

2018-02-19,"* Cheaper valuations, reduced volatility boost sentiment * Dollar weak; some cite U.S. trade, budget deficits as factors * U.S. bonds potentially undermined by cut in Fed’s reinvestment * European shares seen opening 0.2-0.8 pct higher By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Asian shares gained on Monday, joining a global recovery for equity markets as sentiment improved gradually from a recent shakeout that was sparked by fears of creeping inflation and higher borrowing costs. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, having recovered more than 40 percent of its losses from late January to last week’s low. Trading was slower than usual due to market holidays in the United States as well as Greater China. Japan’s Nikkei gained 2.0 percent while U.S. stock futures climbed gained 0.4 percent in Asia on Monday. European share are also seen rising, with spread-betters expecting advances of up to 0.8 percent in Germany’s Dax , 0.5 percent in France’s Cac and 0.2 percent in Britain’s FTSE. MSCI’s index of stock markets across the globe gained 4.3 percent last week, the best weekly performance since December 2011. The rebound came after a two-week rout that wiped off more than 10 percent of value at one point, triggered by worries a rise in U.S. inflation may boost dollar funding costs. The sell-off took place even as the corporate earning outlook improved on the back of strong global growth, bringing down equity valuations off highs hit earlier this year. Just before the market ructions in late January, world shares were traded at 16.66 times their expected earnings, the highest levels since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. They are currently at 15.33 times. “The stocks’ valuation has become cheaper to levels that are on par with the assumption that long-term U.S. bond yields will shoot up to 3.15-3.20 percent,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield rose to a four-year high of 2.944 percent last week, compared to 2.411 percent at the end of last year. The two-year U.S. yield hit its highest level since 2008 last week as investors bet the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in March. The U.S. cash bond market is shut on Monday for a holiday. “What’s been told less about rising U.S. yields is the fact that this could reflect the impact of the Fed’s balance sheet reduction and the likely increase in U.S. debt issues following Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure spending,” said Hiroaki Hayashi, director of Fukokushinrai Life Insurance. “The 10-year U.S. Treasuries could test the 3 percent level,” he added. In October, the Fed started trimming reinvestments in Treasuries and agency bonds. As the Fed plans to gradually reduce reinvestments, the impact is expected to get bigger this year. While the Fed scales back its bond purchases, the U.S. government is expected to increase its debt issuance after Congress reached a deal earlier this month to raise spending by almost $300 billion over the next two years. The minutes of the Fed’s last policy meeting, held amid the equities tumble on Jan. 30-31, are due on Wednesday. Besides the outlook on rates, markets will be keen to see what, if anything, the Fed makes of the gyrations in markets. A fall in the Vix index, a gauge of expected volatilities in U.S. stocks, also helped underpin improving sentiment. The recent sell-off is believed to have been amplified by a jump in the Vix as many players are thought to have adjusted their portfolio in line with the change in volatilities. “The latest rout was driven more by forced selling of such players as risk parity strategies and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs). Their selling appears to be over,” said Mizuho’s Kuramochi. In the currency market, the dollar stabilised off its three-year lows against a basket of currencies. The euro stood at $1.2426, backing down from Friday’s three-year high of $1.2556. The dollar traded at 106.24 yen, bouncing back from its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16. The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a barrage of factors, including worries about widening U.S. trade and budget deficits and speculation Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy. There is also talk that foreign central banks may be reallocating their reserves out of the dollar. The weaker dollar propped up commodities. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.1 percent in Monday Asian trade to $62.37 per barrel, extending their rebound from a 1-1/2-month low of $58.07 set on Feb. 9.

2018-02-19,"(Repeats story with no changes) * Kingdom wants long-dated oil price ideally at $70/b -sources * Views prices in 1-2 years as important for valuation -sources * Many experts have focused on current level of oil prices * Current and long-dated prices often do not move together By Dmitry Zhdannikov LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - It’s the burning question in the oil industry: when will Saudi Arabia pull the trigger on the Aramco stock market listing? Many industry experts are focusing on the current level of oil prices. However another key consideration for Saudi officials in floating up to 5 percent of the state oil producer is where they see prices in one to two years’ time, two sources close to the IPO said. The Riyadh government is carefully analysing the future price curve structure in oil markets because it regards prices further out as an important element in achieving a high valuation in what could be the biggest initial public offering in history, the sources told Reuters. Ideally, so-called long-dated prices for one and two years ahead need to move at least $10 higher - to around $70 per barrel - for the government to be happy to launch the listing, said the sources, who declined to be named as the information is confidential. “When will the ideal moment come?” said one of the sources. “Maybe you should also look at the forward curve for oil ... as the forward curve will be key for investors valuing Aramco.” The Saudi energy ministry and Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Many considerations are likely to influence the IPO timing, and the final decision may rest with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But if long-dated prices at around $70 are an important factor, this could indicate a listing may be some way away. Brent oil futures for March 2019 are valued now at $60.60, about a $4 discount to the $64.50 current - spot - price, and for two years away at $57.70. Saudi officials have given few clues about the IPO, with energy minister Khalid al-Falih and finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan saying only that the government will proceed when “the time is right”. Spot and long-dated prices often do not move together. Immediate prices are more influenced by developments such as politically driven supply outages or natural disasters, while prices further down the curve are more affected by broader expectations of supply and demand, factoring in issues such as OPEC output policy and the rise of electric vehicles. Spot prices rose to a three-year high above $70 in January but have since slid nearly 15 percent together with a broader decline in the stock markets due to fears about global inflation as well as renewed concerns about rising U.S. oil production. The concern about long-dated prices could also cast OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia’s oil-supply policies in a new light. The kingdom has orchestrated a global oil output cut deal to support prices, a move which Reuters has previously reported was partly driven by a desire to maximise Aramco’s valuation for the IPO. Falih has repeatedly said he sees OPEC cuts lasting until the end of 2018 and even then that the exit would be very gradual - comments that helped support not only near-term but also longer-dated prices. The Saudi government says Aramco is worth $2 trillion and aims to list on one or more foreign stock exchanges in addition to Riyadh. Saudi sources have said the listing on a local bourse could happen before the international listing. It is not clear if the forward oil price indicator will be a key consideration for the timing of a local listing. The IPO is a central part of the crown prince’s reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom’s economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. The prince is also one of the architects of the output production pact between OPEC and Russia. While Saudi officials think $60 per barrel is a reasonable price for oil in the long term, the rally at the start of 2018 has provided an incentive to bump up the Aramco valuation, according to a third source close to the IPO. “$60 is a sweet spot. But now they are making hay while the sun shines,” the source said. He added however that, inside Aramco, concerns were also rising that a prolonged rally could again spur U.S. shale production too much and lead to a loss of Saudi market share. “A rally to the $70s carries the seeds of its own destruction,” the source said.

2018-02-19,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 19 (Reuters) - What do the moves by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to boost its share of the country’s cobalt bounty have in common with the former Thai government’s attempts to control the global market for rice exports? Both are examples of dominant producers of a commodity trying to extract more wealth from that position. It’s also likely that similar to the ultimate disaster that befell ousted Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the DRC’s attempts to extract more from cobalt will unleash a wave of unintended consequences, none of which will be positive for the government in Kinshasa. Cobalt has gone from a minor metal with an almost non-existent public profile to the major threat to the future of the switch to electric vehicles and battery storage for electricity. This is because cobalt is a key ingredient in the current technology lithium-ion batteries essential for both cars and electricity storage, and the DRC produces more than half of the world’s supply. The DRC is hardly a paragon of stable government, with President Joseph Kabila still refusing to hold elections even though his term expired two years ago. Much of the country remains beyond the control of the central government and its recent history has seen numerous conflicts that involved several neighbouring countries and various armed factions. However, Kabila’s government has made it clear that it now wants a greater share of the revenue from its vast reserves of cobalt, with the country producing 73,940 tonnes of the metal last year, a jump of 15.5 percent from 2016. Parliament has approved a new mining code that increases royalties five-fold to 10 percent, and removes a stability clause in the current law that protects miners from changes to the fiscal and customs regime for 10 years. The code still has to be signed into law by Kabila, and miners active in the country, including Glencore and Ivanhoe Mines, are lobbying for changes and talks about future taxation arrangements. The DRC’s state-owned miner Gecamines also wants to re-negotiate contracts with international partners to secure a bigger share of revenues. The DRC situation occupied much of the recent Investing in African Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town, with miners in attendance privately expressing fears that the DRC would ultimately move down the road to full nationalisation of the industry. What does this have in common with Yingluck’s policy of subsidising Thai rice farmers, a policy she introduced to win the support of the rural population who helped her to election victory in July 2011? Yingluck’s government saw what they thought was an opportunity to make global rice consumers pay more for the staple grain, which would allow them to pay generous subsidies to rural farmers. At the time, Thailand was the world’s largest exporter of rice, with a market share above 50 percent, and there was real market concern not only of rising prices, but also of shortages, much like today with cobalt. But what happened was that as soon as the new Thai government tried to raise export prices, the country became the supplier of last resort and buyers moved increasingly to competitors such as Vietnam and India. Ultimately the Thai government spent billions of dollars buying rice it couldn’t sell, forcing it to stockpile millions of tonnes of the grain, leading to fiscal pressure and allegations of mismanagement that helped spur the military takeover that removed Yingluck in May 2014. This isn’t suggesting that the DRC is heading toward a military coup, but there are similar dynamics starting to play out. The first is that the hunt for cobalt outside the DRC is going to be massively stepped up, with the United States and Sweden among those countries that have already said they are targeting new deposits of the metal. Secondly, huge amounts of capital are about to flow into finding alternatives to using cobalt in batteries, or at least reducing the amount of cobalt used for each unit. Thirdly, the DRC is likely to suffer an investment boycott if it goes ahead and implements terms that punish the mining companies that have taken a risk and put their money into developing the central African nation’s resources. Numerous commentators have pointed out that there is still a cobalt supply crunch on the horizon, as new mines, improved battery technologies and extensive recycling of used batteries is likely to still leave a shortfall of cobalt, assuming the forecasts for electric cars and power-storage batteries are accurate. This may be the case, but past experience has shown that when the price signal is strong enough, the response tends to happen far more quickly than anticipated. Right now, the price signal is flashing red, with London cobalt futures ending at $81,500 a tonne on Feb. 16, up 8.3 percent so far this year, but also up an astonishing 275 percent since the low of $21,750 from February, 2016. The DRC is in pole position to benefit from the expected surge in demand for cobalt, but only if it decides to pursue polices that don’t alienate mining companies and encourage the rapid development of alternatives.

2018-02-19,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Jonathan Saul and Maiya Keidan LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Forced to abandon ship after mistiming their investments five years ago, hedge funds are venturing back in a bid to profit from growing global trade flows. Around 90 percent of traded goods by volume are transported by sea and global shipping sectors, including dry bulk, are on course for a recovery this year after a near-decade long crisis, ratings agency S&P said in a report last week. The IMF has forecast GDP growth at 3.9 percent for 2018 and 2019 versus 3.7 percent last year, which analysts say is boosting sentiment for shipping. As a result, many hedge funds are loading hundreds of millions of dollars into the sector, putting behind them losses suffered in 2013 when, based on forecasts of improved world economic growth, they piled in to shipping debt and equity. That strategy hit the rocks for many investors when the shipping companies they had put their faith in over-ordered new vessels and saw their shares fall by as much as 80 percent. “They all came in too early,” Tor Svelland, chief investment officer at hedge fund Svelland Capital, said, adding that the market is different this time around as capacity is shrinking. “It looks like the new building market will not be able to ‘kill’ the positive demand story. This is a dream scenario.” This time round it is not only shipping stocks, but also freight forward agreements (FFA), which allow investors to take positions on freight rates at a point in the future, that are more widely used to get into what is still a niche sector. For Demetris Polemis, a portfolio manager at $250 million Guernsey based hedge fund Paralos Fund, the tide is turning and with less chance of a shipping glut there are now “some interesting opportunities for investors”. Another new feature are exchange traded funds which U.S. filings show are being set up to focus on shipping investments. These would allow hedge funds and retail investors to access FFAs, Polemis said. “A lot of people have been talking about shipping recently. Last year, a few funds were setting up bespoke products,” said a London-based hedge fund investor. One example is Tufton Ocean, a hedge fund and private equity firm, which started a long-only strategy run solely for a U.S.-based investor in January. The wave of new money is clear from data last week which showed that hedge funds bet at least $675 million on shipping stocks in the fourth quarter of 2017. Hedge fund participation in 14 of the top shipping stocks reached 29 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 23 percent in the previous three months, data from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings compiled by Symmetric showed. And activists, who buy up shares in undervalued companies and agitate for change to drive up the share price, have also been increasingly moving into shipping stocks. Activist hedge funds made public demands of five shipping companies in the 12 months to Jan. 31, the highest number of campaigns in more than five years, with three in the previous year and two between Feb. 1, 2013 and Jan. 31, 2014, according to research group Activist Insight. Duncan Dunn, senior director with leading FFA broker SSY Futures Ltd, said a number of investment funds started betting on dry bulk FFAs when the sector downturn started to bite at the end of 2008. He said there had been an increase in the estimated underlying transaction value of dry bulk FFAs to $16.5 billion in 2017 from around $9 billion in 2016 and hopes that the underlying value could reach $24 billion if both volume and values grow by 20 percent this year. “Last year’s improvement in time charter rates was such that not only will there be more hedging opportunity for dry FFA traders, but also a compelling case for renewed investment.” Elsewhere, the London-run Baltic Exchange, founded in 1744, is creating the possibility of its globally tracked main sea freight index, which gauges the cost of shipping dry bulk commodities including iron ore, grain and coal, becoming a tradeable instrument. The Baltic is also looking into launching a freight index for LNG (liquefied natural gas), creating further scope for trading plays. Such developments are likely to be a boost for those who caution against stocks as a way of gaining shipping exposure. Nicholas Tsevdos, managing director of Ocean Way Navigation, a London-based shipping investor and asset manager, said shipping stocks are a particularly poor way in. “This is due to the exorbitant combined G&A (general and administrative expenses) and management fees, which on average are around three times the market standard,” Tsevdos said, adding that the correlation between underlying asset values and the share price is often not as expected. “You can watch a company achieve a phenomenal price for a vessel or fleet sale, and watch the stock tank as the market views it as a retraction,” Tsevdos said. Others, such as Jens Rohweder, managing partner with German-based investment and asset manager Notos Group, say some markets such as dry bulk, which accounts for an estimated 18 percent of the world’s cargo fleet, may already be past their peak, leading him to prefer counter-cyclical investments such as LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) stocks. “This will be the third time round for them (hedge funds), let’s hope they get the timing right,” one shipping industry source said.

2018-02-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - It’s the burning question in the oil industry: when will Saudi Arabia pull the trigger on the Aramco stock market listing? Many industry experts are focusing on the current level of oil prices. However another key consideration for Saudi officials in floating up to 5 percent of the state oil producer is where they see prices in one to two years’ time, two sources close to the IPO said.  The Riyadh government is carefully analyzing the future price curve structure in oil markets because it regards prices further out as an important element in achieving a high valuation in what could be the biggest initial public offering in history, the sources told Reuters. Ideally, so-called long-dated prices for one and two years ahead need to move at least $10 higher - to around $70 per barrel - for the government to be happy to launch the listing, said the sources, who declined to be named as the information is confidential. “When will the ideal moment come?” said one of the sources. “Maybe you should also look at the forward curve for oil ... as the forward curve will be key for investors valuing Aramco.” The Saudi energy ministry and Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Many considerations are likely to influence the IPO timing, and the final decision may rest with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But if long-dated prices at around $70 are an important factor, this could indicate a listing may be some way away.    Brent oil futures for March 2019 are valued now at $60.60, about a $4 discount to the $64.50 current - spot - price, and for two years away at $57.70.   Saudi officials have given few clues about the IPO, with energy minister Khalid al-Falih and finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan saying only that the government will proceed when “the time is right”. Spot and long-dated prices often do not move together. Immediate prices are more influenced by developments such as politically driven supply outages or natural disasters, while prices further down the curve are more affected by broader expectations of supply and demand, factoring in issues such as OPEC output policy and the rise of electric vehicles.     Spot prices rose to a three-year high above $70 in January but have since slid nearly 15 percent together with a broader decline in the stock markets due to fears about global inflation as well as renewed concerns about rising U.S. oil production. The concern about long-dated prices could also cast OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia’s oil-supply policies in a new light. The kingdom has orchestrated a global oil output cut deal to support prices, a move which Reuters has previously reported was partly driven by a desire to maximize Aramco’s valuation for the IPO. Falih has repeatedly said he sees OPEC cuts lasting until the end of 2018 and even then that the exit would be very gradual - comments that helped support not only near-term but also longer-dated prices. The Saudi government says Aramco is worth $2 trillion and aims to list on one or more foreign stock exchanges in addition to Riyadh. Saudi sources have said the listing on a local bourse could happen before the international listing. It is not clear if the forward oil price indicator will be a key consideration for the timing of a local listing.  The IPO is a central part of the crown prince’s reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom’s economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. The prince is also one of the architects of the output production pact between OPEC and Russia.     While Saudi officials think $60 per barrel is a reasonable price for oil in the long term, the rally at the start of 2018 has provided an incentive to bump up the Aramco valuation, according to a third source close to the IPO. “$60 is a sweet spot. But now they are making hay while the sun shines,” the source said. He added however that, inside Aramco, concerns were also rising that a prolonged rally could again spur U.S. shale production too much and lead to a loss of Saudi market share.  “A rally to the $70s carries the seeds of its own destruction,” the source said.

2018-02-19,"* Cheaper valuations, calmer volatilities boost sentiment * Dollar weak; some cite U.S. trade, budget deficits as factors By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Asian shares gained on Monday, joining a global recovery for equity markets as sentiment improved gradually from a recent shakeout that stemmed from fears of creeping inflation and higher borrowing costs. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, having recovered more than 40 percent of their losses from late last month to last week’s low. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.3 percent. Trading is expected to be slower than usual due to market holidays in the United States as well as Greater China. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose marginally on Friday to mark its biggest weekly increase in five years, although earlier gains evaporated after a 37-page indictment filed by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian companies for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. MSCI’s index of stock markets across the globe gained 4.3 percent last week, the best weekly performance since December 2011. The rebound came after a two-week rout that wiped off more than 10 percent of value at one point, triggered by worries a rise in U.S. inflation may boost dollar funding costs. The sell-off came as the corporate earning outlook improved on the back of strong global growth, bringing down equity valuations off their highs hit earlier this year. Just before the market ructions in late January world shares were traded at 16.66 times the expected earnings, the highest levels since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. They are currently at 15.33. “The stocks’ valuation has become cheaper to levels that are on par with the assumption that long-term U.S. bond yields will shoot up to 3.15-3.20 percent,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield rose to four-year high of 2.944 percent last week, compared to 2.411 percent at the end of last year. The two-year U.S. yield hit its highest level since 2008 last week as investors bet the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in March. The minutes of the Fed’s last policy meeting, held amid the equities tumble on Jan. 30-31, are due on Wednesday. Besides the outlook on rates, markets will be keen to see what if anything the Fed makes of the gyrations in markets. A fall in the Vix index, a gauge of expected volatilities in U.S. stocks, also helped underpin improving sentiment. The recent sell-off is believed to have been amplified by a jump in the Vix as many players are thought to have adjusted their portfolio in line with the change in volatilities. “The latest rout was driven more by forced selling of such players as risk parity strategies and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs). Their selling appears to be over,” said Mizuho’s Kuramochi. In the currency market, the dollar stabilised off its three-year lows against a basket of currencies. The euro stood at $1.2426, backing down from Friday’s three-year high of $1.2556. The dollar traded at 106.24 yen, bouncing back from its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16. The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a barrage of factors, including worries about widening U.S. trade and budget deficits and speculation Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy. There is also talk that foreign central banks may be reallocating their reserves out of the dollar. The weaker dollar propped up commodities.

2018-02-19,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) TOKYO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices extended gains on Monday, but the increases were limited as the dollar recaptured some ground after touching its lowest level in more than three years on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery was up 5 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $61.73 a barrel by 2348 GMT, after rising 4.2 percent last week. London Brent crude was up 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $64.99 after rising more than 3 percent last week. The U.S. oil rig count, an indicator of future production, rose by seven to 798, its highest since April 2015, according to a weekly report from General Electric’s Baker Hughes unit. That marked the first time since June that drillers added rigs for four consecutive weeks, and the figure was well up on the 597 rigs that were active a year earlier as energy companies have boosted spending since mid-2016 when crude prices began recovering from a two-year crash. Surging U.S. production is offsetting efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers including Russia to curb production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) till the end of 2018. Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Saturday that Iran hoped to continue to export 2.1 to 2.2 million barrels per day beginning around April and to sell 500,000 bpd to India in the next fiscal year.

Around 90 percent of traded goods by volume are transported by sea and global shipping sectors, including dry bulk, are on course for a recovery this year after a near-decade long crisis, ratings agency S&P said in a report last week.

2018-02-19,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - A court will decide on Thursday whether German cities can ban heavily polluting cars, potentially wiping hundreds of millions of euros off the value of diesel cars on the country’s roads. Environmental group DUH has sued Stuttgart in Germany’s carmaking heartland, and Duesseldorf over levels of particulate matter exceeding European Union limits after Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) 2015 admission to cheating diesel exhaust tests. The scandal led politicians across the world to scrutinise diesel emissions, which contain the matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx) and are known to cause respiratory disease.  There are around 15 million diesel vehicles on German streets and environmental groups say levels of particulates exceed the EU threshold in at least 90 German towns and cities. Local courts ordered them to bar diesel cars which did not conform to the latest standards on days when pollution is heavy, startling German carmakers because an outright ban could trigger a fall in vehicle resale prices, and a rise in the cost of leasing contracts, which are priced on assumed residual values. The German states concerned, where the carmakers and their suppliers have a strong influence, appealed against the decisions, leaving Germany’s federal administrative court - the court of last resort for such matters - to rule on whether such bans can legally be imposed at local level. “The key question is whether bans can already be considered to be legal instruments,” said Remo Klinger, a lawyer for DUH. “It’s a completely open question of law.” Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. France and Britain will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 in a shift to electric vehicles. Evercore ISI forecasts a 5 percent fall in diesel residual values could result in a drop of 1.6 billion euros (£1.42 billion) in operating profit across eight European and U.S. carmakers. Analysts at Bernstein Research have said that diesel bans in Europe would hit French carmaker Peugeot (PEUP.PA) hardest, followed by Renault (RENA.PA). Among German carmakers, Daimler’s (DAIGn.DE) global fleet exposure to diesel is around 38 percent, BMW’s (BMWG.DE) 35 percent and VW’s (VOWG_p.DE) 26 percent, Bernstein said in a report from 2016. Carmakers have sought to avert total bans by updating engine management systems to improve exhaust-treatment filters, a step only possible on vehicles equipped with software-based engine-management systems. Environmental groups have called software updates insufficient and have lobbied for cars with Euro-6 and Euro-5 emissions standards to receive hardware updates of their exhaust treatment systems, costing at least 1,500 euros per vehicle. Europe’s love affair with diesel is already fading, with its market share in the European Union falling from 53.6 percent at the end of 2014 to 49.9 percent at the end of 2016, European automotive association ACEA’s most recent data shows.

2018-02-19,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Malaysian palm planters hit by EU decision * Najib faces pressure from millions of planters and families * Government could face backlash from rural voters in election By Emily Chow and Praveen Menon KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 (Reuters) - An EU decision to curb palm oil imports was the last thing Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak needed ahead of a coming election, with rural voters already aggrieved over financial scandals at state-owned palm oil agency Felda. Around 10 percent of Malaysia’s 30 million people belong to families who own smallholdings dedicated to harvesting palm oil, and they account for the majority of voters in nearly a quarter of the national assembly’s 222 seats. Girding for a general election due by August, Najib was given a taste of the discontent rife in the countryside when hundreds of farmers flocked to Kuala Lumpur last month to protest a pending EU move to phase out the use of palm oil in biofuel. “I will not support the government if they don’t resolve this issue,” said Abdul Rahman, a farmer who runs a smallholding in Negeri Sembilan, a state an hour’s drive south of the capital. “The failure and inexperience of the government led to the EU’s boycott of our palm oil,” hen told Reuters. Najib can ill-afford to lose votes from Malays in rural areas that have hitherto been a rock-solid votebank for the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the party that has led every multi-ethnic coalition since Malaysia emerged from British colonial rule in 1957. Aged 92, and having stood down in 2003 as Malaysia’s longest serving premier, Mahathir Mohamad has come out of retirement to lead the campaign against his one-time protege Najib, having forged an unlikely alliance with jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. Malays’ loyalty to UMNO has been tested by the steady flow of stories over the past three years about 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), a state investment firm whose funds, critics say, were used by Najib to boost his campaign for the 2013 election, which he narrowly won  while losing the popular vote to an opposition bloc led by Anwar. Najib, who chaired 1MDB’s advisory board until it was dissolved in 2016, has consistently denied any wrongdoing over the billions of dollars lost by the fund, but an ongoing kleptocracy investigation into 1MDB in the United States - the biggest mounted by Department of Justice - has kept on the frontburner. To cement authority and protect himself, analysts say Najib needs to lead UMNO to a convincing victory. The 1MDB controversy has damaged Najib’s standing more among urban Malays, but over the past year rural Malays have found their own reasons to be upset. Malaysia’s 650,000 smallholders, who cultivate 40 percent of acreage dedicated to palm, fear they will bear the brunt of the EU ban, which William Simadiputra, an analyst at DBS Vickers, reckons could cost Malaysia about $500 million annually in export revenue. Malaysia’s plantations minister Mah Siew Keong told Reuters the government is working on expanding export markets to other non-traditonal palm buyers like Iran, Vietnam and Japan in a bid to shore up demand. But the government’s threat of retaliatory trade measures against the EU has been scorned by critics, who say it will lead to further loss of palm oil business to competitors. “By saying you will ban EU imports you are just pushing away the palm oil business to Indonesia,” said Wong Chen, a lawmaker with the opposition Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) party. Malaysia hasn’t given up trying to persuade the EU to think again, raising its objections with a visiting French defence minister last month. France is hoping to sell Malaysia fighter jets worth about $2 billion. Smallholders have seen monthly incomes drop as low as 1,000-2,000 ringgit ($256.81-$513.61) when palm prices were low, forcing many into debt over the years. And when allegations of corruption surfaced last year at the Federal Land Development Authority (Felda), a state plantation agency founded to alleviate rural poverty, the government came under fire in the small towns and villages that make up the Malay heartland. Many of Felda’s 112,000 settlers took loans to invest in Felda Global Ventures, a listed unit of Felda that raised $3 bln when it was launched in 2012 and has since seen its share price plunge by 60 percent. FGV’s chairman was forced to quit last year, and its chief executive was suspended for four months during a government probe into suspicious transactions at a subsidiary. He later resumed his role. Najib moved to appease Felda settlers last July with cash handouts, subsidies and debt waivers totalling nearly 1.5 billion ringgit ($383 million). “The game is to constantly keep the palm planters happy,” said PKR’s Wong Chen. But they are far from happy. The controversies at FGV have barely abated. Critics say it overpaid buying assets, notably the $505 million purchase of a 37 percent stake in an Indonesian palm oil firm. Questions have also been raised last month over a Felda land deal in Kuala Lumpur, which allegedly points to criminal fraud. Felda did not reply to a request for comment. But, on this most recent land deal scandal, Najib said in a blog post that the government would “ensure the interests of Felda and the settlers are not compromised”. However, this core constituency’s patience with the government may have run out. “These issues have raised anger among the settlers,” said Mazlan Aliman, president of the National Felda Settlers’ Children Society (ANAK). “They see the government is not serious in addressing these issues, but instead try to cover up.” “The damage that has been done is too big. It will influence the mood of voters in the upcoming elections, especially in Felda areas,” said Mazlan.
