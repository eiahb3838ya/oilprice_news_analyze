2018-08-08,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion (£12.4 billion) worth of U.S. imports from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the Chinese commerce ministry said, as the world’s largest economies escalated their trade dispute. The tariffs will be activated on Aug. 23, the ministry said, the same day that the United States plans to begin collecting 25 percent extra in tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods. The United States published its final list of goods subject to the new tariffs on Tuesday. China’s final list announced on Wednesday differs from an earlier draft it published in June, which included crude oil. The number of categories of goods subject to tariffs rose to 333 from 114 in the June draft, although the total value is unchanged. The U.S. action that prompted the Chinese retaliation was the latest by President Donald Trump to put pressure on China to negotiate trade concessions, after Washington imposed tariffs on $34 billion in goods last month. China has vowed to retaliate with equivalent tariffs against any U.S. action. “This is a very unreasonable practise,” the Chinese commerce ministry said of the U.S. action on Wednesday as it rolled out China’s counter-tariffs. To compensate for the gap on its tariff list caused by the exclusion of crude oil, China added fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, and various types of bicycles and cars, among other products. Last week, China proposed additional tariffs on another $60 billion of U.S. goods after Trump raised planned tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent. So far, China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of its annual imports of American products. Big-ticket U.S. items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office could not immediately be reached for comment on China’s retaliation announcement or whether this would trigger Trump’s next round of threatened tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.  USTR is conducting a public comment period for those tariffs, which could reach 25 percent, due to end Sept. 5. It would take a few more weeks to revise the list and make programming changes at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting the duties. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said he expected that there would be little to stop further escalation of the U.S.-China tariff war as both sides dig into entrenched positions. “My expectation is that U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of imports from China will be in effect about a month prior to the November U.S. elections. That’s soon enough to be used by Trump as a rallying argument, but late enough so that adverse effects will not occur before January 2019. Of course, China will retaliate, probably dollar for dollar,” Hufbauer said. China, however, would run out of U.S. imports to levy, as it bought only $130 billion worth of American goods last year. It would likely have to impose penalties on U.S. companies doing business in China to make up the difference.

2018-08-08,"ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s lira weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, hit by concern about President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and uncertainty about whether a meeting between Turkish and U.S. officials could heal a wide diplomatic rift. A Turkish delegation will meet with top officials from the U.S. State Department on Wednesday, part of a visit to Washington this week to address friction caused by Ankara’s trial of an American evangelical pastor. The delegation, headed by Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal, will meet U.S. officials led by Deputy U.S. State Deputy Secretary John Sullivan, the State Department said. The delegation is also due to meet with officials from the U.S. Treasury. The row has heightened investor concern over Turkey, where investors are most worried by what they see as Erdogan’s influence over the central bank, which has not been as aggressive in raising interest rates as investors have hoped.   The president, a self-described “enemy of interest rates”, wants to see borrowing costs lowered to fuel credit, new construction and growth. The appointment of his son-in-law as finance minister has deepened the concern. “The central bank is behind the curve; it remains behind the curve,” said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at Credit Agricole. “The lira keeps depreciating and we are seeing that the central bank is not ready to act.” The lira stood at 5.2880 against the dollar at 1223 GMT, more than 1 percent weaker on the day. It had gained on Tuesday on reports the delegation would visit Washington. The currency has fallen some 27 percent this year and plunged as much as 5.5 percent on Monday to 5.4250 per dollar, an all-time low and its biggest intraday drop in nearly a decade. That decline came after Washington said it was reviewing access to the U.S. market for Turkey’s exports. Relations between Turkey and the United States have been strained by differences over Syria and by the trial in Turkey of Andrew Brunson, the pastor, for supporting a group Ankara blames for a 2016 abortive putsch. Brunson denies the charge. The United States is also seeking the release from detention of three locally employed embassy staff. Washington last week imposed sanctions on Erdogan’s justice minister and interior ministers, saying they played leading roles in organisations responsible for Brunson’s arrest. Erdogan has said Turkey would retaliate against the sanctions. While the rift between the NATO allies has hammered the lira, dollar debt issues by Turkish banks continued to slip further, reflecting investor concern that the currency deterioration would erode capital buffers at banks. On Wednesday, some Yapi Kredi and Halkbank paper hit record lows, while other Turkish banks, such as Akbank, were also sold off, according to Tradeweb data. The cost of insuring exposure to Turkish bank debt rose on Wednesday, with five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for Yapi Kredi up 1 basis point (bp) from Tuesday’s close to 460 bps, according to IHS Markit, a record high.  Turkish stocks were up 1 percent. The BIST index of blue-chip stocks is down around 40 percent in dollar terms this year, according to Thomson Reuters data — second only to Venezuela as the worst performer among some 30 emerging market stock indices.

2018-08-08,"* Strong U.S. earnings, China policy support hopes lift shares * Trade disputes, politics, waning US impact a risk * Sterling under cosh on no-deal Brexit concerns * European, Chinese shares weak; Wall Street set for flat open (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Robust U.S. earnings and expectations of additional stimulus from Beijing supported world shares at one-week highs on Wednesday but a selloff in Britain’s pound gathered steam over mounting concerns for the country’s outlook. Equity futures suggested a modestly weaker open on Wall Street where the S&P 500 index closed Tuesday less than half a percent off record highs hit in January. That testifies to the strength of its economy and corporate sector, with average earnings expanding more than 23 percent in the second quarter. The picture in the rest of the world is less rosy, given slower economic momentum and the greater vulnerability of other big economies - from China to Germany - to U.S. trade levies. Washington is preparing to start collecting tariffs on an additional $16 billion in Chinese goods. While markets across Asia were broadly supported by the U.S. tech rally, MSCI’s index of stocks from 47 countries was just above flat. “Everyone is just focusing on U.S. earnings...and feeling the U.S. market will remain robust despite trade uncertainties, and that’s the main driver right now,” said Christophe Barraud, a strategist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. But Barraud said autumn could bring a reality check in the form of slower U.S. growth indicators, Italian politics, Britain’s Brexit talks, U.S. mid-term elections and - above all - the risk of a trade war escalation. “Support from U.S. earnings could last until the end of August and when people are back in September they will focus more on other events,” he said. Indeed, support from company earnings is less evident elsewhere — European shares slipped a touch and while average European second quarter earnings growth is at a relatively healthy 9.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the rate significantly lags Wall Street. In other markets, Chinese equities  fell 1.3 percent as news of the additional U.S. tariffs overshadowed strong trade data that showed exports rose more than expected in July. A rise in imports also suggested Chinese domestic demand remains resilient. Trade fears were tempered somewhat by signs Beijing is unveiling further measures to support growth. That’s lifted the yuan off recent 15-month lows to the dollar though the currency weakened 0.3 percent on the day. However, the biggest currency market moves of the day came on the British pound which tumbled to 11-month lows against the dollar and yen and a nine-month low against the euro. Its woes stem from mounting concerns that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a trade deal in place, raising fears of a serious hit to the economy. That prompted the Bank of England last week to signal an extremely cautious trajectory for interest rate rises in the coming years. Market players said investors were moving to hedge sterling risks. “A lot of companies can’t wait until the (Brexit) outcome is clear ... Many of them are trying to hedge against a drop in sterling,” Barraud of Market Securities said. Options markets indicated the currency heading for further weakness over nine-to-12 months - beyond the March 2019 date when the country is scheduled to leave the EU. Elsewhere the Turkish lira, the biggest mover in recent days, fell another 1.5 percent to the dollar on fears of an economic crisis triggered by galloping inflation and worsening ties with the United States. The lira stayed off recent record lows however. On oil markets, Brent futures held firm around $75 a barrel as U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns of looming crude supply shortages.

2018-08-08,"Aug 8 (Reuters) - New U.S. sanctions against Iran took effect on Tuesday and President Donald Trump, who defied Washington’s allies to impose them, pledged that companies doing business with Tehran would be barred from doing business with the United States. Following are comments and responses from companies in Europe which last year did far more business with Tehran than U.S. firms did: (Entries are listed with most recent first) Danish engineering company Haldor Topsoe, one of the world’s leading industrial catalyst producers, on Aug. 8 said it would cut around 200 jobs from its workforce of 2,700 due to the sanctions. Swiss railway company Stadler Rail has put the brakes on plans for an underground railway system in Tehran. “As part of an international tender, Stadler submitted an offer to the Iranian Industrial Development and Renovation Organization (IDRO) and signed a letter of intent in February this year,” Stadler Rail said on Aug. 7. “These negotiations have now been frozen and the project put on hold.” According to reports, the group had signed a letter of intent to deliver 960 subway cars in what amounted to a $1.4 billion deal. German car and truck manufacturer Daimler has dropped plans to expand its Iran business. “We have ceased our already restricted activities in Iran in accordance with the applicable sanctions”, Daimler said on Aug. 7. In early 2016, Daimler established a joint venture with vehicle manufacturer and dealer Iran Khodro Co to make and distribute Mercedes-Benz trucks in the country. PSA and RENAULT Peugeot manufacturer PSA began taking steps in June to suspend its joint venture activities in Iran while rival Renault has said it will adhere to the U.S. sanctions regime. Both had until Aug 6 to wind down their operations. A Renault spokesman said the company had no comment to make beyond what Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore said in July, when he told analysts:  “As we comply fully with U.S. sanctions, it’s likely that our development would be put on hold.” After the nuclear accord was agreed in 2015 both PSA and Renault moved swiftly to sign new production deals to upgrade their pre-sanctions partnerships in Iran. PSA signed production deals worth 700 million euros, while Renault announced a new plant investment to increase production capacity to 350,000 vehicles a year. Total has said it will quit the multibillion-dollar South Pars gas project if it cannot secure a waiver from the U.S. sanctions – a request French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last month had been rejected along with others by French corporations. [nL5N1SN5HZ ] Total signed a contract in 2017 to develop Phase II of the South Pars field with an initial investment of $1 billion and has not yet said what it will do with its 30 percent stake should it pull out. It has until Nov 4 to wind down its Iran operations, barring any surprise exemption. Turboprop aircraft maker ATR on Aug 6 confirmed it had delivered five more planes to IranAir shortly before Washington imposed new sanctions but still faces difficulties obtaining U.S. permission to hand over another seven on order. Drugmaker Sanofi said it was premature to say if there will be any impact on its operations in Iran. Sanofi announced in early 2016 that it had signed an MoU with Tehran aimed at bolstering its presence in Iran. Medicines were exempted from the original nuclear sanctions although shipping drugs into the country was difficult. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely, assess the impact of the recently reintroduced economic sanctions and continue to work to ensure that patients in Iran can be provided with our innovative medicines, diagnostics and diabetes products,” the Swiss drugs company said. Nestle sees no direct fallout from renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. Nestle Iran has its headquarters in Tehran and two factories: one in Qazvin that produces infant cereals and infant formula, and a bottled water factory in Polour. The company has 818 employees and imports a limited range of Nestle products from abroad, it said.

2018-08-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Glencore (GLEN.L) said on Wednesday the sale of the bulk of its stake in Russia’s Rosneft to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund is due to close in the second half of this year, as the Swiss company loses its spot as the world’s second-largest oil trader. Glencore reported a slump in its traded oil volumes for the first half, pushing it into third place behind rivals Vitol and Trafigura.  Qatar’s fund QIA initially bought 19.5 percent in Rosneft together with Glencore in a consortium named QHG for 10.2 billion euros ($12.2 billion) during the Russian firm’s partial privatization in 2016. From that stake, QHG last year agreed to sell a 14.16 percent holding to CEFC China Energy but the deal fell through after CEFC’s founder was put under investigation by Chinese authorities over suspected economic crimes. QIA then said it would buy the holding instead of CEFC, leaving Glencore with 0.57 percent. “In April 2018, QHG concluded an agreement with QIA to dispose the majority of its shares held in Rosneft, representing a 14.16 percent stake. The transaction, subject to customary regulatory approvals, is expected to complete in H2 2018,” Glencore said.  Glencore’s crude trading volumes in the first half fell 24 percent to about 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) and refined products were down 23 percent at 2.1 million bpd compared to the same period in 2017. Vitol traded over 7 million bpd of crude and products last year, while Trafigura reported a 16 percent increase in the first half to 5.8 million bpd.   Glencore reported a 23 percent rise in first-half core earnings on Wednesday, just below analyst forecasts, as higher costs and lower prices for cobalt and other products ate into profits. Other big miners have said inflationary pressures are mounting, including from energy prices, as crude prices LCOc1 have risen nearly 13 percent this year, while metals markets are mostly weaker.

2018-08-08,"ISLAMABAD, Aug 8 (Reuters) - China is exploring building a spur from Pakistan’s territory once the multi-country TAPI natural gas pipeline project begins operating, a Pakistani official said, with the financial close of the project’s first phase expected next month. Originating at the giant Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan, the $9.6 billion TAPI (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India) pipeline involves the four countries’ own energy companies, and would carry 33 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year. Turkmenistan is building the TAPI pipeline to diversify its gas exports, which have mostly gone to China. But the project has suffered lengthy delays due to difficulties obtaining financing and the security risks of building a pipeline through war-torn Afghanistan. Mobin Saulat, the chief executive officer of Pakistan’s state-owned Inter State Gas Systems (ISGS), told Reuters that Chinese officials have shown growing interest in building a spur from Pakistan and the line could act as an alternative to Beijing’s plans to build a fourth China-to-Turkmenistan pipeline. “With this channel, there is a possibility they don’t have to do another line and they can off-take from this pipeline which is passing through Pakistan,” Saulat said. A China-to-Turkmenistan line has to cross several Central Asian mountain ranges and Saulat said it would be cheaper and easier for China to built a line from inside Pakistan’s territory to cross the Karakoram range to its Western border. China’s ties to Islamabad have deepened in recent years as Beijing has pledged to fund $57 billion in infrastructure as part of its Belt and Road initiative, including power stations and transport links. Facing more delays, TAPI countries have changed tack to attract financing and make progress in the past two years. The project is now due to be done in two phases, with the pipeline built without compressors in the first phase, which would cut gas volume but would reduce prohibitive project costs. Once gas starts flowing, and the pipeline begins generating cash flow, financing would be raised for the second phase that would see 11 compressors installed along the 1,814 km (1,127 mile) pipeline project. “With this introduction of the phased approach, it has gained momentum with the Chinese,” said Saulat. The financial close for the first phase is due by the end of September, Saulat said, with the Asian Development Bank promising $1 billion to $1.5 billion and the Islamic Development Bank giving assurances of $1 billion in loans.

2018-08-08,"FRANKFURT/DUBAI (Reuters) - Germany’s Lanxess (LXSG.DE) is selling its 50 percent stake in synthetic-rubber maker Arlanxeo to partner Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE for around 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in cash in a deal it said will give it more flexibility to grow. The deal marks an early exit for Lanxess from the world’s largest provider of synthetic rubber for tyres, while the Saudi state oil giant said it would “accelerate the development of growth opportunities in the kingdom, leveraging the strong feedstock position of Saudi Aramco”. Aramco, which is planning to go public and looking to buy a stake in petrochemicals maker SABIC 2010.SE, plays a key role in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitions to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond oil. “The proposed purchase underscores Saudi Aramco’s strategy to further diversify our downstream portfolio and strengthen our capabilities across the entire petroleum and chemicals value chain,” Aramco’s Senior Vice President of Downstream, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi said in a statement on Wednesday. For Lanxess chief executive Matthias Zachert the sale will allow him to focus on more deals to strengthen its specialty chemicals activities. Lanxess has previously said it would keep the remaining half of Arlanxeo until at least 2021. The German chemicals group expects to receive about 1.4 billion euros in cash from the deal, which is expected to complete by end of 2018, valuing all of Arlanxeo at 3.0 billion euros including debt and liabilities. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets and sees growth in chemicals as central to cut the risk of an oil demand slowdown. The sale in 2015 of the first 50 percent of Arlanxeo to Saudi Aramco had valued the business at 2.75 billion euros, and was pushed by Zachert at the time to make the company less volatile amid signs of increasing global rubber oversupply.     “We increase the resilience of our business, strengthen our financial basis and gain additional strategic flexibility for further growth,” Zachert said in a statement. Zachert has pursued deals to grow in smaller but more profitable specialty markets and vowed last year he would change the company further. Sources familiar with the company have said the CEO could consider another takeover the size of Chemtura. Lanxess bought the U.S. maker of additives for lubricants and flame retardants for 2.4 billion euros including debt last year.

2018-08-08,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Salvador Rodriguez and Nichola Groom SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s production of solar roof tiles has been delayed by assembly-line problems at its new publicly subsidized factory and difficulties producing a product that satisfies the aesthetic demands of CEO Elon Musk, eight former and current employees of both companies told Reuters. Repeated hold-ups since the Buffalo, New York plant opened last year have forced Tesla’s partner in the joint venture, Panasonic, to seek other buyers for the components it had built to sell to Tesla, according to a Panasonic employee, a former Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. The issues have also rattled the faith of state officials in Tesla’s ability to deliver on investment and employment promises it made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies. The production challenges add to doubts over Tesla’s cash-strapped solar operations as it focuses on boosting production of its better-known electric vehicles, which have also seen repeated production delays. Tesla acquired the solar business in 2016 in a controversial $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two of Musk’s cousins - but the business has been shrinking ever since. (For a graphic showing the decline in Tesla's solar business, see: tmsnrt.rs/2KjWlYU ) The “Solar Roof” produced at the New York factory is designed to look like a normal roof while generating electricity, a combination that has proved challenging. “Aesthetic look is the key point that Elon is always not satisfied with,” said another former Tesla employee, who works in Fremont, California. “That’s the big issue.” In a call with Tesla investors last week, Musk said “hundreds” of homes already had solar roofs, but the company clarified the estimate in its statement to Reuters, saying it included systems that had been partially installed or were “being scheduled for install.” In California, the nation’s leading solar market, there were twelve Tesla roof systems connected to the grid as of May 31, all in Northern California, according to records from the state’s three investor-owned utilities. The cost per watt for those systems was listed at nearly $6, according to the records. That’s about double the national average for solar systems. Tesla began accepting $1,000 deposits from customers for the Solar Roofs in May 2017, seven months after it unveiled a prototype. Tesla confirmed in a statement to Reuters that it has been seeking to improve on its production process for the solar roof at the New York plant. “We are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process,” the company said in the statement. “We plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018.” The company did not detail its current production and did not comment on its component purchases from partner Panasonic, which shares space in the factory and plans to produce Tesla solar panels and photovoltaic cells for the roofs. Panasonic has been selling some of the solar panels it produces in Buffalo under its own brand instead of selling them to Tesla, Panasonic said in a statement. It has also been shipping a large volume of the photovoltaic cells it produces in Buffalo as samples to prospective buyers because of low demand from Tesla, according to the Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. Panasonic declined to comment on the shipments of cell samples to other customers but said in a statement that it has not yet completed sales to buyers other than Tesla or signed alternate supply deals. “We believe Tesla will use Panasonic cells when it mass-markets the Solar Roof,” the company said in a statement. Some New York state lawmakers worry Tesla may fail to hold up its end of the bargain. The state provided $350 million to build the factory, along with $274.7 million for equipment and $125.3 million “for additional specified scope costs,” according to a Tesla filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The subsidy package requires Tesla to employ 1,460 people in Buffalo, including 500 at the plant, within two years of the facility’s completion, and to spend $5 billion in the state over a decade. Empire State Development, the state’s economic development arm, is overseeing the agreement. The agency believes Tesla is currently meeting its obligations, said spokeswoman Pamm Lent, adding that the company would face penalties of $41.2 million a year if it falters. Republican New York state Assemblyman Ray Walter, who represents a district near the factory, said it concerned him that only a small portion of the plant appeared functional when he toured it in March. “After investing $750 million of taxpayer money, we want it to work out,” he said. “It just does not look like it’s heading down that path.” Tesla said in its statement that the facility now employs about 600 people and is on track to meet all of its commitments. None of the Tesla sources could provide a production figure for the solar roof, saying only that output was low and frequently interrupted. They said only the textured black version of the solar roof had been produced so far, one of four varieties Tesla is marketing. Several of the sources at the plant said Musk had never visited the site; Tesla declined to comment. Panasonic recently produced about 1,900 conventional 325-watt solar panels per day at the plant, meant to be sold under the Tesla brand, and about 2,000 5.5-watt photovoltaic cells per day that were intended for the solar roof, according to two Panasonic sources, one who recently left the company. That would put annualized production at about a quarter of Tesla’s target for the plant, which is 1 gigawatt per year by 2019. And Tesla isn’t buying most of the cells being produced, according to the Panasonic employee. “We have been entertaining outside customers,” the employee said. Tesla is also turning to other suppliers to deal with the aesthetic concerns, using cells from JA Solar because they reflect light differently, said a current Tesla employee and a former Tesla employee. The current employee said a similar Panasonic cell was now undergoing testing and would be used in future versions of the solar roof. JA Solar declined to comment. Panasonic started cell production at the factory in February, but recently shut down manufacturing to install new equipment on its production lines, the Panasonic employee said. Full production will restart in September, the employee said. For now, wooden crates filled with unused equipment are sitting around the factory, according to the Panasonic employee and three other employees with knowledge of the plant operations. Some of that equipment has become obsolete over the past couple of years as technology has changed, two of the workers said. One of the few customers that has taken delivery of the Solar Roof is Tri Huynh, 39, who works in business development in Silicon Valley. Huynh said he paid about $100,000 for the system, which included three Tesla Powerwall home batteries to store the power produced. It took two weeks and a dozen workers to install, compared to a day for most traditional panel systems. “It’s fantastic. I love it,” he said, adding he was saving hundreds of dollars a month in power costs. “I’m a tech guy, so I kind of wanted the latest technology.” Warren Jason, a retired technology entrepreneur who is building an 11,000-square-foot house in the Hollywood Hills, is not so pleased. He put down $1,000 to reserve a roof in early 2017 but it has not yet arrived, and he has been unable to get details to give to his architect and engineers. “We’ve been begging Tesla for information,” he said. “It’s been extremely frustrating.” (Additional reporting by Makiko Yamazaki and Ritsuko Ando in Tokyo; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/tesla-solar/rpt-insight-inside-teslas-troubled-new-york-solar-factory-idUKL1N1UZ029,08 Aug 2018,"Tesla Inc’s

2018-08-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Centrica (CNA.L) will raise its standard energy prices for British Gas customers for the second time this year, it said on Wednesday, blaming rising wholesale costs. Around 3.5 million customers, on its dual fuel standard variable tariff, will be hit with a 3.8 percent price increase from Oct. 1. The rise comes as energy regulator Ofgem prepares to implement a price cap on standard tariffs by the end of the year to combat what the government has called “rip off” energy prices. The rise also comes on top of a 5.5 percent increase in British Gas’ standard prices on May 29. Centrica said it needed to implement the latest increase to a near 20 percent rise in wholesale costs since April. “Until now, we have been able to shield customer bills from the full impact of the increase in the wholesale costs because of the way we buy energy in advance,” Mark Hodges, CEO of Centrica Consumer said in a statement. Ofgem on Tuesday said the cap on its safeguard tariff for the most vulnerable customers would also increase in October due to higher wholesale costs. Analysts have warned Ofgem’s price caps will do little to stop energy bill increases. “Household energy prices are set to continue to rise despite Ofgem’s safeguard tariff or the government’s default price cap, which is set to replace it later this year,” Gareth Miller, chief executive of consultancy Cornwall Insight, said on its website. “Only if wholesale costs fall sharply will the pressure abate,” he said. All of Britain’s “big six” energy suppliers have announced price increases this year.  The other five big six supplier are SSE (SSE.L), E.ON (EONGn.DE), EDF Energy (EDF.PA), Innogy’s (IGY.DE) Npower and Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power.

2018-08-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slid about 3 percent on Wednesday as a trade dispute between the United States and China escalated further and after Chinese import data showed a slowdown in energy demand. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $2.37 to settle at $72.28 a barrel, a 3.17 percent loss. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $2.23 to settle at $66.94 a barrel, a 3.22 percent loss. The session low of $66.32 was the lowest since June 22. China is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports, from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment. The escalating trade war has rattled global markets. Investors fear a potential slowdown of the world’s two largest economies would slash demand for commodities. “The U.S.-China trade war is set to worsen, and its impact on oil prices will be gradual as the situation develops,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. “Crude oil and refined products affected by additional duties will reduce their competitiveness in the Chinese market.”  China’s crude imports recovered slightly in July after two straight monthly declines, but remained low due to a drop-off in demand from smaller independent refineries. Shipments into the world’s biggest importer of crude last month rose to 8.48 million barrels per day from 8.18 million bpd a year earlier and June’s 8.36 million bpd, customs data showed. However, July imports were still the third lowest so far this year. Also weighing on prices, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell just 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than half the 3.3 million-barrel draw analysts had expected. Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI notched a surprise rise of 2.9 million barrels, not the 1.7 million-barrel drop analysts had predicted in a Reuters poll.  “Overbearing product builds are weighing on the entire energy complex,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at brokerage firm CHS Hedging LLC. Prices drew some support from U.S. sanctions against Iran, introduced Tuesday in a range of sectors. From November, Washington will target the petroleum sector in Iran, the No. 3 producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. An Iranian newspaper reported that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said a U.S. plan to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero will not succeed.

2018-08-08,"Aug 8 (Reuters) - Plains All American Pipeline LP said two West Texas crude pipeline projects would begin partial operations slightly ahead of their original schedules as bottlenecks in the region depress prices to the weakest level in four years. One of the two, the Sunrise expansion project, is expected to go into partial service in the fourth quarter this year while the Cactus II line will begin partial service in the third quarter of 2019, the company said on a conference call late on Tuesday. The Sunrise extension will add about 500,000 bpd of capacity from Midland to Colorado City and Wichita Falls, Texas, and provide connections to the oil-storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma. Full service on the 670,000 barrels per day (bpd) Cactus II line from the Permian basin to Corpus Christi is targeted for April 2020. By late this year, a portion of the line, from Wink, to McCamey, Texas, will begin partial service, the company said. “We expect continued growth across our gathering and intrabasin pipeline systems (in the Permian) and to operate at or near capacity on our takeaway pipelines throughout the second half of the year,” said Greg Armstrong, Plains chief executive. The company also is developing projects in Canada that would increase oil gathering for existing systems and boost utilization on its Rainbow pipeline system that serves western Canada. It also is considering a project that could add volumes to its Wascana system. These projects are in the early phases of development and would likely take 12 to 24 months to bring into service, Plains said. The Permian basin in West Texas and western Canada has been grappling with takeaway constraints as oil production in the region has outpaced pipeline capacity. Prices in Midland, Texas, sank to a $17 discount to benchmark futures WTC-WTM last week while Western Canada Select oil last week traded at $34.15 per barrel lower than West Texas Intermediate light oil, the biggest differential since November 2013. Plains said it is evaluating increasing takeaway capacity out of Cushing, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, by expanding capacity on existing pipelines. Inventories at the storage hub have plunged, dropping to the lowest since October 2014 last week. Plains said its joint venture Diamond pipeline out of Cushing could be expanded upto 200,000 bpd and the company could expand capacity on its Midway pipeline system as well.

2018-08-08,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, said the country has nothing to be concerned about, a report on his official website said on Wednesday in an apparent reference to the imposition of strict U.S. sanctions this week. The sanctions imposed on Tehran this week have already led banks and many companies around the world to scale back dealings with Iran. Companies doing business with Iran will be barred from the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday. “With regard to our situation do not be worried at all. Nobody can do anything,” Khamenei said recently, the website reported.  “They can be sure. There is no doubt about this,” Khamenei was quoted as saying in comments that appeared only a day after the new U.S. sanctions took effect. U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that they aim to pressure countries to stop buying oil from Iran in a bid to force Tehran to halt its nuclear and missile programmes and involvement in regional conflicts in Syria and Iraq. “These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. Separately, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Wednesday that a U.S. plan to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero will not succeed, according to the Iran newspaper. “If the Americans want to keep this simplistic and impossible idea in their minds they should also know its consequences,” Zarif told the Iran newspaper. “They can’t think that Iran won’t export oil and others will export.” President Hassan Rouhani hinted last month that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, if the U.S. attempted to stop the Islamic Republic’s oil exports. U.S. President Donald Trump responded by noting that Iran could face serious consequences if it threatened the United States. “The Americans have assembled a war room against Iran,” Zarif said. “We can’t get drawn into a confrontation with America by falling into this war room trap and playing on a battlefield.” Last month, Trump offered to meet Iran’s leaders. Zarif said that Oman and Switzerland have acted as mediators in talks with America in the past but that there are currently no direct or indirect talks being held with the United States. Rouhani, speaking in a meeting with North Korea’s foreign minister on Wednesday, said that America cannot be trusted, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). “Today, America is identified as an unreliable and untrustworthy country in the world which does not adhere to any of its obligations,” Rouhani said.

2018-08-08,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya’s sovereign wealth fund has decided to move from its main office in Tripoli due to security breaches after a number of staff were threatened or abducted, it said in statement on Wednesday. The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which holds about $66 billion-worth of mostly frozen assets, has long been at the centre of leadership disputes and power struggles that reflect Libya’s political splits. These have sometimes played out at the LIA’s main offices in the Tripoli Tower office block, where the head of the fund appointed two years ago by Libya’s internationally recognised government, Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, had managed to install himself following a dispute with a rival claimant.  Tripoli is largely controlled by a handful of powerful armed groups claiming official status that have expanded their economic interests, penetrated key institutions and frequently abduct rivals with impunity. “The Libyan Investment Authority is faced with a series of violations and abuses due to blatant interference by armed members of the battalion charged with protecting the tower,” the LIA said. “The authority rejects these actions and announces the transfer of its headquarters from Tripoli Tower as a result of security breaches.”  The LIA said staff had been threatened, intimidated and had their movements restricted, and that some employees were abducted and held at a nearby base. Heads of departments were told not to comply with instructions from management.  “The IT manager was forced to suspend the e-mail of the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and the operations manager,” the LIA statement said. The LIA was created to invest oil revenues earned before a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled long-serving ruler Muammar Gaddafi and divided Libya into territory controlled by rival factions. The fund has been involved in several high profile international lawsuits over investments made prior to 2011.

2018-08-08,"(Reuters) - U.S. coal companies lobbied Congress to allow a drop in their payments to help miners with black lung disease by arguing the incurable ailment was in decline and a victims’ trust fund was financially healthy, assertions contradicted by government findings, according to documents seen by Reuters.   Coal companies are currently required to pay a tax of $1.10 per ton on underground production to finance the federal Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which pays medical and living expenses for some 25,000 eligible miners and their families. That excise tax is scheduled to revert to the 1977 level of 50 cents per ton at the start of 2019. A bipartisan effort earlier this year to extend the higher rate failed, though lawmakers may raise the issue again in the coming months. “Changing the schedule now would effectively impose a tax increase on an industry struggling to recover from the regulatory excesses of the past administration,” National Mining Association President Hal Quinn wrote in a June 14 letter to U.S. Representatives Kevin Brady of Texas and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, both Republicans.   Brady is the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee and Foxx heads the Education and the Workforce Committee. An accompanying “one-pager” on the issue, which was also seen by Reuters, included the assertion that black lung was in decline and that the trust fund would be in good stead without an extension of the excise tax. “Despite a decline in medical black lung disease, claim approvals have skyrocketed,” the NMA said in the pamphlet. It also stated: “The tax, even at the reduced rate that will go into effect on January 1, 2019, is more than sufficient to provide monthly disability benefits” for the trust fund. At the time the NMA sent the documents, government research showed incidents of black lung disease, which was nearly eradicated in the 1990s, rising rather than falling.  In February, for example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health confirmed 416 cases of advanced black lung disease in three clinics in rural Virginia from 2013 to 2017 - the highest concentration ever seen. It also confirmed many hundreds of other cases in southwestern Virginia, southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky. The Labor Department also found that nearly half the 4,679 benefits claims from miners with the worst form of black lung disease had been made since 2000, according to Kirsten Almberg, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Illinois at Chicago who analyzed the data in a study earlier this year. Last month, the NIOSH issued a more comprehensive report showing more than 10 percent of America’s coal miners with 25 or more years of experience have black lung disease, the highest rate recorded in roughly two decades.   NMA spokeswoman Ashley Burke said the letter and one-page pamphlet accompanying it were sent to lawmakers before the latest NIOSH report, and that previous studies had been unconvincing. “Prior data showed the heightened incidence of disease was localized to a small geographic region, not national,” she wrote to Reuters in an email. She said the NMA was “concerned” by the latest NIOSH report but did not say whether the group had updated its lobbying materials. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to revive the ailing U.S. coal industry, which has been shrinking for years under pressure from cheaper natural gas and advances in solar and wind energy.  The assertion that the black lung trust fund would have more than enough money if the excise tax reverted to the lower level also clashes with government research. The U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a June report that the fund would need a multi-billion dollar taxpayer bailout if the coal production tax was not extended. “With the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease, our moderate case simulation suggests that expected revenue will likely be insufficient to cover combined black lung benefit payments and administrative costs, as well as debt repayment expenditures,” according to the report from the non-partisan GAO.  NMA’s Burke said the group had relied on its own calculations to conclude otherwise in the materials sent to lawmakers: “Our calculations were based on current actuals/production vs. GAO future modeling.” The fund, which was established in the 1970s, is already roughly $6 billion in debt because revenues have failed to keep up with outflows.  The NMA has repeatedly argued the fund is mismanaged, and covers victims of lung disease caused by smoking not mining - though medical experts have countered that it is easy to identify lung damage caused by coal dust in an x-ray. The National Coalition of Black Lung and Respiratory Disease Clinics and the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center called the NMA’s lobbying materials misleading. “While NMA, or any trade association, has the right to defend the interests of the industry it represents, it is unacceptable to attempt to mislead Members of Congress and their staff,” they said in a joint statement.

2018-08-08,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will continue to buy natural gas from Iran in line with its long-term supply contract, Turkey’s energy minister said on Wednesday, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened that anyone trading with Iran will not do business with America. NATO member Turkey is dependent on imports for almost all of its energy needs and Iran is a key supplier of Ankara’s natural gas and oil purchases. While the Turkish refiner Tupras has already cut back on oil shipments from Tehran, a complete halt of energy imports would be near impossible. Energy Minister Fatih Donmez told A Haber broadcaster that he expected Ankara’s talks with Washington on the issue to yield a positive outcome. “A delegation of ours is in the United States right now and negotiations are being held on a series of matters including the sanctions issue,” Donmez told broadcaster A Haber. “I think a good outcome will emerge from this dialogue.”  A Turkish delegation is visiting Washington this week to discuss growing friction between the NATO allies, according to reports on Tuesday, while Washington said the two countries remained at odds on its core demand that Ankara free American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson. Donmez said Turkey’s long-term supply contract with the Islamic Republic was valid until 2026 and Ankara was set to buy the 9.5 billion cubic meter of the contract amount. “We will be continuing this trade as we can’t possibly leave our citizens in dark,” he said. Nearly 40 percent of Turkey’s electricity production is sourced with natural gas. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program and said firms doing business with Tehran would be barred from the United States, as new U.S. sanctions against Iran took effect on Tuesday. The sanctions target Iran’s purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and the auto sector and did not include Iran’s oil exports, but global oil prices rose on Tuesday in anticipation. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector are set to be re-imposed after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. Turkey’s biggest oil importer Tupras has cut back purchases of Iranian crude since May, and analysts say Tupras is likely to stick to lower volumes in coming months. Donmez described the sanctions as “unilateral”.  “Even European Union (EU) is extremely annoyed by this. We are conducting legitimate trade here,” he said. “And this is important for us in terms of supply security as well.” Pulling out of the 2015 Iran agreement, Trump has ignored pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington’s main European allies Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China. European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out. But that has proven difficult: European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business.

2018-08-08,"ABUJA (Reuters) - The leader of Nigeria’s Senate on Wednesday called for an investigation into a blockade of parliament by security forces and said it was an attempt to secure his impeachment but stopped short of saying he would run for president next February. Senate President Bukola Saraki, Nigeria’s third most senior elected official, last week defected from President Muhammadu Buhari’s ruling party to the main opposition and is fast becoming a leading critic of the president.  He is the most high profile of the some 50 lawmakers who have left Buhari’s party in the last few weeks, presenting a challenge for the president’s bid to secure a second term at the helm of Africa’s top oil producer. The blockade by armed members of the Department of State Security (DSS) on Tuesday was the first such incident since the transition to civilian rule in 1999 and coincides with rising tension between lawmakers and the executive. “We call for an investigation, and we demand that all perpetrators are brought to book,” said Saraki during a news conference in the capital, Abuja.  He said the blockade was “an act of cowardice by those seeking to carry out an illegal impeachment of the leadership of the Senate in flagrant disregard of the law”.  Saraki said the aim was to bar members of the opposition PDP so that a vote of lawmakers could be convened at which the two-thirds majority needed to impeach and replace him could be secured.  Defections have cost the ruling APC its majority in the Senate, parliament’s upper house, presenting a challenge to Buhari’s re-election bid by closing access to key patronage networks. Saraki, when asked, refused to rule out running for president next year: “When the time is right, I will talk on that issue.” Yemi Osinbajo, usually vice president who is acting president while Buhari is in Britain on holiday, said the action by the DSS officers was “completely unacceptable” and was taken without the presidency’s knowledge. He fired the DSS chief within hours of the blockade.  But, in an emailed statement issued on Wednesday, the APC appeared to row back from Osinbajo’s criticism. It accused Saraki of plotting to “foment violence in the legislative chamber all in a bid to stop his impeachment”. “We are now aware that the timely intervention of the security operatives forestalled the planned violence,” it said.

2018-08-08,"ISLAMABAD, Aug 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Pakistan’s newly-elected government, which is expected to be sworn in within days with cricket legend Imran Khan as prime minister, will plant billions of trees to tackle the effects of climate change. Malik Amin Aslam, who is tipped to become environment minister, said the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme would see trees planted nationwide, including in the four provincial capitals. That follows a vast tree-planting project in recent years in Khyber Pukhtunkwa province by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. “PTI is a party with a green promise,” Aslam said, adding that the combination of environmental degradation and damage due to climate issues was costing 3-4 percent of Pakistan’s near-$300 billion economy annually. Aslam said the country was spending one billion rupees ($8.1 million) a day “on issues arising from environmental neglect”. “Climate change is only making it worse,” Aslam told attendees at a discussion on the environment and climate change at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), a thinktank, in Islamabad on July 31. Aslam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that Khan believed climate change was an enormous challenge that had to be tackled head on. And, Aslam added, Khan felt the PTI’s green promise was central to how the party views a sustainable future for Pakistan - with cleaner air, cleaner water and a country prepared to face up to and combat climate change. Khan’s party won 116 seats of the 272 seats in parliament in the July 25 poll, while the party of ousted and jailed premier Nawaz Sharif trailed in second with 64 seats. In 2013, Khan’s PTI won enough seats in Khyber Pukhtunkwa’s assembly to form the provincial government. It introduced a green-growth initiative to tackle deforestation, build more small-scale hydroelectric projects and overhaul national parks. The Billion Tree Tsunami project was part of that initiative. Aslam, the project’s architect, said it had changed the province’s landscape. He said Pakistan needs to do more. “Pakistan’s green cover is going down. Our cities have become concrete jungles and there is increasing air pollution. Our mode of development is wrong,” Aslam said. At the PTI’s launch of its ‘First 100 Days Agenda’, held a month before the July 25 ballot, Khan told the audience of party members and media that global warming “is a reality”. “We will be badly affected... We can counter it with trees. Growing trees is not a luxury - it is for our survival.” Khan lauded his provincial government’s tree-planting project, which he said had met its targets - 40 percent from planting trees, and the remainder from assisting the natural regeneration of existing forests. Pakistani climate expert Adil Najam, who is dean of Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies, said the PTI had made the environment - “especially planting trees” - its issue. “And (it has) demonstrated that you can get political mileage from environmental issues,” he said, describing that as a major step forward. “This also comes at a time when the public awareness of these issues – especially water and climate concerns – are on the rise. So, there is certainly the potential of momentum.” He said the key test would be keeping the political focus on the policy, and ensuring action. Experts say Pakistan is facing enormous environmental challenges. A survey conducted by the SDPI ahead of the 2018 poll found that respondents prioritized three key environmental issues: rising temperatures, water shortages and air pollution. Aslam said PTI’s experience in delivering on the green agenda for Khyber Pukhtunkwa province had put it in good stead to do so nationally. “We set out targets in clean energy, forests, clean water, and we met them,” he said, adding that the province’s tree-planting project had been the largest eco-investment in the country’s history, and had met its targets using just half the allocated budget. The PTI’s 100 Days Agenda document also stated it would establish a task force to draft green legislation and devise more projects. Kashmala Kakakhel, a climate finance expert who helped with the 100 Days Agenda document, said thinking on climate change needed to evolve from “piecemeal, project-based interventions to a guiding principle for Pakistan’s development agenda”. “We need to recognise it as an economic opportunity, with an immense potential for job creation,” she said. “This government plans to review (or develop new) targets for our renewable energy mix, for increasing our forest cover, for developing along a climate resilient pathway.” She pointed out that once targets were set nationally, specific interventions could be designed. “This will also aid in identifying which interventions we can fund ourselves, and for which ones we will need to tap into international climate finance funding opportunities.” Aslam also said the new government wanted to green the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a multi-billion-dollar Chinese-funded infrastructure project. He said that while visiting China in his capacity as the vice-president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a non-profit, he had been amazed at the “astronomical changes” underway as China cleans up its environment. “We would like to strive for a green charter for CPEC,” he said. Despite the PTI’s green focus, Pakistan remains committed under CPEC to developing its lignite coal reserves in the Thar Desert, with two coal power plants already functional, according to CPEC’s website. “Coal is an issue,” Aslam admitted, adding that Pakistan could look to counter pollution by introducing “state-of-the-art environmental controls”. The head of the SDPI’s Pak-China Study Centre, Shakeel Ramay, said coal’s share of the country’s energy mix is less than 10 percent. “For the time being coal is an option and Pakistan should benefit from it as others have,” he said. ""However, in the long run Pakistan must look for renewable sources of energy,"" he said. (Reporting by Rina Saeed Khan. Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2018-08-08,"(Adds quote, OPEC sources, background) DUBAI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Iran’s oil minister said OPEC may need to hold an extraordinary meeting should the organisation of oil producers fail to prevent member countries from adjusting their crude production without approval, the Shana news agency reported on Wednesday. After months of underproduction, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies to raise output from July by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously decided cuts. That would mean an output increase of roughly 1 million barrels per day. Minister Bijan Zanganeh sent a “letter of complaint” to his United Arab Emirates counterpart after noticing that some OPEC members were trying to adjust output, the Iranian agency said. Zanganeh told UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei, who holds the OPEC presidency in 2018, that an OPEC/non-OPEC committee that monitors output compliance, known as the JMMC, should not distribute output increases among other producers. “In case the JMMC does not fulfil its mandate ... and has a different understanding from the decision of the (OPEC) conference, the issue should be raised at an extraordinary meeting of the OPEC conference for decision-making,” Zanganeh wrote. OPEC sources, however, played down the possibility of an extraordinary meeting. “There is no need,” one OPEC source said. Zanganeh’s comments underline the still-simmering tensions after OPEC’s June meeting. Saudi Arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more to meet the group’s overall conformity level, meaning some members, such as itself, could make up for shortfalls elsewhere. Iran, which faces U.S. sanctions, disagreed and criticised Saudi plans to boost output above targeted levels. The JMMC is chaired by Saudi Arabia and is due to meet next on Sept. 23 in Algeria. Iran is not on the committee, which also includes Russia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Algeria and Venezuela. Last month, Zanganeh told his Saudi counterpart that the OPEC supply pact does not give member countries the right to raise oil production above their targets.

2018-08-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The shift in oil market power away from OPEC towards a bilateral relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia is the culmination of structural changes in oil production over the last 20 years. These shifts are deeply structural and have little to do with the personality or negotiating skills of individual oil ministers, which arguably attract far too much attention from commentators and journalists. Most of these changes can be traced back for 20 years or more, though some of them have recently accelerated, such as the recent slump in output from Venezuela and Libya. To the extent that production is an important component of market power, the very different fortunes of OPEC countries have significantly redistributed power within the organisation. The result is that the focus of decision-making has shifted from intra-OPEC negotiations to extra-OPEC negotiations with Russia (“Oil market enters post-OPEC era”, Reuters, Aug. 7). INTRA-OPEC COMPETITION OPEC was founded in 1960 to reduce harmful competition over taxes, royalties and oil ownership between its original members as they tried to attract investment from the international oil companies. “The principal aim of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shall be the coordination and unification of the petroleum policies of Member Countries”, according to OPEC’s founding statute. The five founding members (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela) accounted for a significant share of the world’s undeveloped oil reserves and were among the fastest-growing producers. OPEC’s initial focus was on creating a united front in negotiations with the international oil companies to secure a greater share of revenues from the sale of oil. The addition of Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969) and Nigeria (1971) added other major reserve holders and rapidly growing producers to cement OPEC’s negotiating power. OPEC’s practical focus has shifted over time from taxes and royalty rates (1960s) to equity ownership of reserves (1970s), prices (1970s onwards) and production allocations (1980s onwards). The organisation’s market power arguably peaked in 1973, when members accounted for just over half of all oil production worldwide, before sliding to around a quarter in 1985, and partially recovering in the years since then. In the early years, OPEC was dominated by an internal balance of power between Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela, with other countries playing a more peripheral though occasionally disruptive role. In 1970, these three countries were producing roughly the same amount, about 3.8 million barrels per day each (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2018). By 1973, Saudi Arabia had already pulled significantly ahead (7.7 million bpd) of both Iran (5.9 million bpd) and Venezuela (3.5 million bpd), a gap that has widened in the subsequent decades. OPEC members can be broadly divided into winners and losers since 1973, based on whether they increased output by 2017. (Table: tmsnrt.rs/2MdHoNg) The biggest winners have been Saudi Arabia (+4.3 million bpd), Iraq (+2.5 million bpd), United Arab Emirates (+2.4 million bpd), Angola (+1.5 million bpd) and Qatar (+1.3 million bpd). The biggest losers have been Libya (-1.3 million bpd), Venezuela (-1.3 million bpd) and Iran (-0.9 million bpd) with other members occupying an intermediate position. The winners have mostly benefited from stable government, significant investment, some of it foreign, and technical expertise. The losers have been hit by conflict, sanctions, unrest, corruption and mismanagement. Some countries have bounced back from earlier setbacks, notably Iraq, which experienced severe production losses during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s as a result of war and sanctions. Some have suffered more recent problems, such as Libya’s descent into tribal conflict, from which they may recover in time. Others have experienced a patchy production history throughout the last few decades, such as Venezuela and Nigeria - which has recently taken a sharp turn for the worse in the case of Venezuela. As a result, Saudi Arabia and to some extent the United Arab Emirates have become much more powerful while Iran and Venezuela have been relegated to a more peripheral status. Moreover, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are the only members with significant production flexibility and contributed most of the voluntary output cuts under the December 2016 production agreement. Other members of the organisation generally produce as much as they are technically able because their immediate revenue needs are enormous. To the extent countries such as Nigeria, Libya and Venezuela have cut production, the loss of output has been forced upon them by unrest and mismanagement. EXTRA-OPEC NEGOTIATIONS Between the 1970s and the 1990s, most intense negotiations occurred within OPEC, as members tried to reach a common position among themselves, and only then negotiate with producers outside the organisation. But the shifting balance of production and power has made intra-OPEC negotiations much less important and put much more emphasis on extra-OPEC negotiations, especially with a resurgent Russia. Sanctions and unrest have sidelined Iran, Libya, Venezuela and to some extent Nigeria, largely relegating them to bystanders within OPEC negotiations. Of the remaining OPEC members, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have coordinated their production policies closely with Saudi Arabia for the last two decades. The changing balance of power has left Saudi Arabia as the undisputed leader of OPEC and free to concentrate on negotiations with outside countries, principally Russia. Instead of negotiating production allocations around a conference table at OPEC headquarters in Vienna, which was the focus for decision-making between the 1980s and 2000s, the most important negotiations are now bilateral between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The shift should not come as a surprise to long-term observers of OPEC. The balance of power and the content of negotiations has changed repeatedly in the last six decades. It may not be the last shift. If Iraq’s production continues to climb it will become harder to ignore and the balance of power will shift again. Output in Iran, Venezuela and Libya could eventually recover, or Nigeria could return to growth, also challenging Saudi Arabia’s control. For the time being, however, Saudi Arabia’s leadership is undisputed and the negotiations that matter are with Russia. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.

2018-08-08,"(Adds information about Tellurian pipelines and background on U.S. LNG) Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas company Tellurian Inc said on Wednesday it remains on track to begin construction of its Driftwood LNG export terminal in Louisiana in the first half of 2019 and begin operations in 2023. Tellurian is on schedule to announce its partners in the $27.5 billion project in the third or fourth quarter, Tellurian President and CEO Meg Gentle said in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. Driftwood is one of more than two dozen LNG export projects under development in the United States and seeking customers so they can start construction and enter service in the next decade. U.S. LNG exports have almost quadrupled from 183.9 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas in 2016 to 706.4 bcf in 2017, worth about $3.3 billion, and are on track to rise to over 1,000 bcf in 2018, making the country one of the world’s biggest exporters of the super-cooled form of natural gas. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about five million U.S. homes for a day. Tellurian said it has about 25 customers interested in partnering with and buying gas from the project. The company estimated the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will approve construction of Driftwood in January 2019, enabling Tellurian to make a final investment decision to build the project in the first half of 2019. Tellurian also said it closed open seasons on two proposed pipelines - Permian Global Access and Haynesville Global Access - that are designed to transport gas from shale formations in Texas and Louisiana to LNG terminals and other Gulf Coast customers. Interest in both pipelines exceeded available capacity, the company said. Unlike most other proposed U.S. LNG export projects that will liquefy gas for a fee, Tellurian is offering customers the opportunity to meet their gas needs by investing in a full range of services from production to pipelines and liquefaction. Current partners include Total SA, General Electric Co and Bechtel, which has a $15.2 billion contract to build the liquefaction facility at the center of the project. Pipelines, reserves and other costs make up the rest of the $27.5 billion price tag of the project. Driftwood will have capacity to produce 27.6 million tonnes per annum of LNG or about 4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-08-08,"* Abu Dhabi touches highest since 2014 * Banks climb in UAE capital * Saudi index falls amid Canada row * Qatar Industries drags down Qatar index By Tom Arnold DUBAI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi’s stockmarket touched four-year highs on Wednesday, helped by bank stocks, while Saudi Arabia’s dipped amid a diplomatic row with Canada. First Abu Dhabi Bank climbed by 0.7 percent. Other banks also rose, with Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank up 1.8 percent and Union National Bank rising by 2.8 percent. Banks are expected to be among the beneficiaries of a 50 billion dirham ($13.6 billion) plan announced by Abu Dhabi in June to revitalise the economy. The Abu Dhabi index closed 0.3 percent up, after hitting its highest level since late 2014 in earlier trading. In Saudi Arabia, PetroRabigh, a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical, tumbled by 8.2 percent after it announced a 25.6 percent fall in second-quarter net profit on Tuesday. The Saudi index ended 0.4 percent lower as investors worried about the fallout from a diplomatic dispute between Saudi Arabia and Canada. The dispute, over Canadian support for jailed rights activists, threatens to hurt bilateral trade which largely consists of Saudi exports of petrochemicals, plastics and other products. Dubai’s index was weighed down by Emirates NBD, which fell by 1.0 percent. Deyaar Development was down by 5.8 percent. Drake & Scull was down by 9.9 percent. The company has been lagging because of concerns about its financial position, business outlook and the outcome of an investigation by United Arab Emirates authorities into financial violations by previous management. The Dubai main index ended 0.1 percent lower. In Qatar, Industries Qatar was the main drag on the index, falling by 1.6 percent. After the market closed, the company - the Middle East’s second-biggest petrochemicals firm - reported a rise in profit to 2.51 billion riyals ($689.5 million) for the first half of 2018, up from 1.61 billion riyals in the same period a year earlier.

2018-08-08,"* OGE has RAB of 3 bln eur, may be valued at 4.5 bln euros-sources * Macquarie to discuss potential OGE sale next month -source * Co-investors expected to hold on to their stakes -source (Adds details, background) By Arno Schuetze and Christoph Steitz FRANKFURT, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Macquarie is considering strategic options for its stake in Open Grid Europe (OGE), Germany’s top gas transmission system operator, three people familiar with the matter said. OGE could be valued at about 4.5 billion euros ($5.22 billion) in a potential sale. The deliberations are at an early stage and could result in a stake sale or in Macquarie keeping its shareholding, the people said. One of the sources said that the investment committee of the Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 4 (MEIF4) would meet next month to discuss the investment and likely take a decision on its future. OGE was MEIF4’s first investment, which was followed by acquisitions of gas grids in the Czech Republic and Italy, European wind farms and broadcasting towers as well as hydro power plants and utilities. No sellside advisers for OGE - which operates a gas network of about 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles) - have been mandated, the people said, adding that Macquarie may still decide to launch an auction later this year. German utility E.ON sold OGE in 2012 to a consortium of investors. MEIF4 and the Halifax Regional Municipality Master Trust jointly took a 24.13 percent stake, with MEIF4 holding the vast majority of that (97.7 pct). Canadian pension fund manager British Columbia Investment Management (32.15 percent), sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (24.99 percent), and German reinsurer Munich Re (18.73 percent) acquired the remaining shares. At the time, OGE changed hands for 3.2 billion euros. But growing demand for regulated infrastructure assets may result in a much higher price in a potential sale. In times of ultra-low interest rates and large cash reserves, infrastructure and pension funds have eagerly snapped up power and gas grids, attracted by their mid-to-high single digit percentage returns that are set by national regulators. Last month, bidders were prepared to put about 1 billion euros on the table for a 20 percent stake in German power network operator 50Hertz, more than former owner Vattenfall received for the complete asset in 2010. In 2016, Macquarie sold smaller gas network operator Thyssengas at about 1.5 times its regulated asset base (RAB), a key measure to value power and gas grids. OGE has a RAB of 2.97 billion euros, according to most recent figures on the group’s website, suggesting a potential valuation of around 4.5 billion euros, with Macquarie’s share alone being worth 1.1 billion. GRTgaz, a French natural gas transmission system operator owned by Engie, has been seen as a potential suitor in the past, the people said, adding that Macquarie would likely also target infrastructure investors, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds if it decides to divest its stake. One of the people said that OGE’s remaining owners were currently not considering selling their stakes. Macquarie, British Columbia Investment Management, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Munich Re and Engie declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.

2018-08-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful typhoon was approaching Tokyo on Wednesday evening, threatening Pacific coastal regions to the northeast of the capital with heavy rains and high winds, leading to flight cancellations and evacuation advisories in some areas. The centre of typhoon “Shanshan”, a Chinese girl’s name, was located 200 km (125 miles) southeast of Tokyo as of 9:00 p.m. (1200 GMT), and is expected to move north along the east coast of Japan’s main island on Thursday, possibly snarling the morning rush hour. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned that Tokyo and surrounding areas could get as much as 300 mm (12 inches) of rain in the 24 hours to 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, with winds gusting as high as 180 kmph (111 mph). Shanshan is expected to move slowly, meaning heavy rain may fall in one area for an extended period, the agency said. The city of Mobara, east of Tokyo, issued an evacuation advisory for its entire population of about 90,000 people. Several other municipalities near Tokyo also issued evacuation advisories for some residents, bringing the total number of people affected to more than 100,000, according to public broadcaster NHK.  NHK also said airlines had cancelled more than 160 flights. The western Japan regions hit by deadly floods in July look set to be spared any damage from the typhoon as it winds its way up the northeastern coast. Japan has experienced one weather disaster after another since the start of July, including a record-breaking heatwave that saw temperatures surge to 41.1 Celsius (106 Fahrenheit) and had killed at least 132 people as of August 5.

2018-08-08,"MOSCOW, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Russian car-sharing company Yandex.Drive, owned by Russia’s largest internet group Yandex , has bought startup fuel delivery service Toplivo v Bak, Yandex and the founder of the startup said on Wednesday. Toplivo v Bak, which translates as “Fuel to the Tank”, will help Yandex.Drive improve the fuelling of its growing car fleet, the company said in a statement. The size of the deal was not disclosed. Toplivo v Bak and rival company Pump deliver fuel direct to parked cars on behalf of car-sharing companies and private clients. They fill up fuel tanks at the kerbside on receipt of an order via a smartphone app, even if the owner is not there. The companies are riding the trend for on-demand delivery of goods pioneered by U.S. companies such as Uber and Amazon via smartphone technology, which is taking off in Russian cities. Yandex said Toplivo v Bak would stop servicing private and corporate clients after the acquisition, in order to focus on improving Yandex.Drive.

2018-08-08,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion (£12.4 billion) worth of U.S. imports from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the Chinese commerce ministry said, as the world’s largest economies escalated their trade dispute. The tariffs will be activated on Aug. 23, the ministry said, the same day that the United States plans to begin collecting 25 percent extra in tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods. The United States published its final list of goods subject to the new tariffs on Tuesday. China’s final list announced on Wednesday differs from an earlier draft it published in June, which included crude oil. The number of categories of goods subject to tariffs rose to 333 from 114 in the June draft, although the total value is unchanged. The U.S. action that prompted the Chinese retaliation was the latest by President Donald Trump to put pressure on China to negotiate trade concessions, after Washington imposed tariffs on $34 billion in goods last month. China has vowed to retaliate with equivalent tariffs against any U.S. action. “This is a very unreasonable practise,” the Chinese commerce ministry said of the U.S. action on Wednesday as it rolled out China’s counter-tariffs. To compensate for the gap on its tariff list caused by the exclusion of crude oil, China added fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, and various types of bicycles and cars, among other products. Last week, China proposed additional tariffs on another $60 billion of U.S. goods after Trump raised planned tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent. So far, China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of its annual imports of American products. Big-ticket U.S. items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office could not immediately be reached for comment on China’s retaliation announcement or whether this would trigger Trump’s next round of threatened tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.  USTR is conducting a public comment period for those tariffs, which could reach 25 percent, due to end Sept. 5. It would take a few more weeks to revise the list and make programming changes at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting the duties. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said he expected that there would be little to stop further escalation of the U.S.-China tariff war as both sides dig into entrenched positions. “My expectation is that U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of imports from China will be in effect about a month prior to the November U.S. elections. That’s soon enough to be used by Trump as a rallying argument, but late enough so that adverse effects will not occur before January 2019. Of course, China will retaliate, probably dollar for dollar,” Hufbauer said. China, however, would run out of U.S. imports to levy, as it bought only $130 billion worth of American goods last year. It would likely have to impose penalties on U.S. companies doing business in China to make up the difference.

2018-08-08,"ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s lira weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, hit by concern about President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and uncertainty about whether a meeting between Turkish and U.S. officials could heal a wide diplomatic rift. A Turkish delegation will meet with top officials from the U.S. State Department on Wednesday, part of a visit to Washington this week to address friction caused by Ankara’s trial of an American evangelical pastor. The delegation, headed by Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal, will meet U.S. officials led by Deputy U.S. State Deputy Secretary John Sullivan, the State Department said. The delegation is also due to meet with officials from the U.S. Treasury. The row has heightened investor concern over Turkey, where investors are most worried by what they see as Erdogan’s influence over the central bank, which has not been as aggressive in raising interest rates as investors have hoped.   The president, a self-described “enemy of interest rates”, wants to see borrowing costs lowered to fuel credit, new construction and growth. The appointment of his son-in-law as finance minister has deepened the concern. “The central bank is behind the curve; it remains behind the curve,” said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at Credit Agricole. “The lira keeps depreciating and we are seeing that the central bank is not ready to act.” The lira stood at 5.2880 against the dollar at 1223 GMT, more than 1 percent weaker on the day. It had gained on Tuesday on reports the delegation would visit Washington. The currency has fallen some 27 percent this year and plunged as much as 5.5 percent on Monday to 5.4250 per dollar, an all-time low and its biggest intraday drop in nearly a decade. That decline came after Washington said it was reviewing access to the U.S. market for Turkey’s exports. Relations between Turkey and the United States have been strained by differences over Syria and by the trial in Turkey of Andrew Brunson, the pastor, for supporting a group Ankara blames for a 2016 abortive putsch. Brunson denies the charge. The United States is also seeking the release from detention of three locally employed embassy staff. Washington last week imposed sanctions on Erdogan’s justice minister and interior ministers, saying they played leading roles in organisations responsible for Brunson’s arrest. Erdogan has said Turkey would retaliate against the sanctions. While the rift between the NATO allies has hammered the lira, dollar debt issues by Turkish banks continued to slip further, reflecting investor concern that the currency deterioration would erode capital buffers at banks. On Wednesday, some Yapi Kredi and Halkbank paper hit record lows, while other Turkish banks, such as Akbank, were also sold off, according to Tradeweb data. The cost of insuring exposure to Turkish bank debt rose on Wednesday, with five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for Yapi Kredi up 1 basis point (bp) from Tuesday’s close to 460 bps, according to IHS Markit, a record high.  Turkish stocks were up 1 percent. The BIST index of blue-chip stocks is down around 40 percent in dollar terms this year, according to Thomson Reuters data — second only to Venezuela as the worst performer among some 30 emerging market stock indices.

2018-08-08,"* Strong U.S. earnings, China policy support hopes lift shares * Trade disputes, politics, waning US impact a risk * Sterling under cosh on no-deal Brexit concerns * European, Chinese shares weak; Wall Street set for flat open (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Robust U.S. earnings and expectations of additional stimulus from Beijing supported world shares at one-week highs on Wednesday but a selloff in Britain’s pound gathered steam over mounting concerns for the country’s outlook. Equity futures suggested a modestly weaker open on Wall Street where the S&P 500 index closed Tuesday less than half a percent off record highs hit in January. That testifies to the strength of its economy and corporate sector, with average earnings expanding more than 23 percent in the second quarter. The picture in the rest of the world is less rosy, given slower economic momentum and the greater vulnerability of other big economies - from China to Germany - to U.S. trade levies. Washington is preparing to start collecting tariffs on an additional $16 billion in Chinese goods. While markets across Asia were broadly supported by the U.S. tech rally, MSCI’s index of stocks from 47 countries was just above flat. “Everyone is just focusing on U.S. earnings...and feeling the U.S. market will remain robust despite trade uncertainties, and that’s the main driver right now,” said Christophe Barraud, a strategist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. But Barraud said autumn could bring a reality check in the form of slower U.S. growth indicators, Italian politics, Britain’s Brexit talks, U.S. mid-term elections and - above all - the risk of a trade war escalation. “Support from U.S. earnings could last until the end of August and when people are back in September they will focus more on other events,” he said. Indeed, support from company earnings is less evident elsewhere — European shares slipped a touch and while average European second quarter earnings growth is at a relatively healthy 9.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the rate significantly lags Wall Street. In other markets, Chinese equities  fell 1.3 percent as news of the additional U.S. tariffs overshadowed strong trade data that showed exports rose more than expected in July. A rise in imports also suggested Chinese domestic demand remains resilient. Trade fears were tempered somewhat by signs Beijing is unveiling further measures to support growth. That’s lifted the yuan off recent 15-month lows to the dollar though the currency weakened 0.3 percent on the day. However, the biggest currency market moves of the day came on the British pound which tumbled to 11-month lows against the dollar and yen and a nine-month low against the euro. Its woes stem from mounting concerns that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a trade deal in place, raising fears of a serious hit to the economy. That prompted the Bank of England last week to signal an extremely cautious trajectory for interest rate rises in the coming years. Market players said investors were moving to hedge sterling risks. “A lot of companies can’t wait until the (Brexit) outcome is clear ... Many of them are trying to hedge against a drop in sterling,” Barraud of Market Securities said. Options markets indicated the currency heading for further weakness over nine-to-12 months - beyond the March 2019 date when the country is scheduled to leave the EU. Elsewhere the Turkish lira, the biggest mover in recent days, fell another 1.5 percent to the dollar on fears of an economic crisis triggered by galloping inflation and worsening ties with the United States. The lira stayed off recent record lows however. On oil markets, Brent futures held firm around $75 a barrel as U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns of looming crude supply shortages.

2018-08-08,"Aug 8 (Reuters) - New U.S. sanctions against Iran took effect on Tuesday and President Donald Trump, who defied Washington’s allies to impose them, pledged that companies doing business with Tehran would be barred from doing business with the United States. Following are comments and responses from companies in Europe which last year did far more business with Tehran than U.S. firms did: (Entries are listed with most recent first) Danish engineering company Haldor Topsoe, one of the world’s leading industrial catalyst producers, on Aug. 8 said it would cut around 200 jobs from its workforce of 2,700 due to the sanctions. Swiss railway company Stadler Rail has put the brakes on plans for an underground railway system in Tehran. “As part of an international tender, Stadler submitted an offer to the Iranian Industrial Development and Renovation Organization (IDRO) and signed a letter of intent in February this year,” Stadler Rail said on Aug. 7. “These negotiations have now been frozen and the project put on hold.” According to reports, the group had signed a letter of intent to deliver 960 subway cars in what amounted to a $1.4 billion deal. German car and truck manufacturer Daimler has dropped plans to expand its Iran business. “We have ceased our already restricted activities in Iran in accordance with the applicable sanctions”, Daimler said on Aug. 7. In early 2016, Daimler established a joint venture with vehicle manufacturer and dealer Iran Khodro Co to make and distribute Mercedes-Benz trucks in the country. PSA and RENAULT Peugeot manufacturer PSA began taking steps in June to suspend its joint venture activities in Iran while rival Renault has said it will adhere to the U.S. sanctions regime. Both had until Aug 6 to wind down their operations. A Renault spokesman said the company had no comment to make beyond what Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore said in July, when he told analysts:  “As we comply fully with U.S. sanctions, it’s likely that our development would be put on hold.” After the nuclear accord was agreed in 2015 both PSA and Renault moved swiftly to sign new production deals to upgrade their pre-sanctions partnerships in Iran. PSA signed production deals worth 700 million euros, while Renault announced a new plant investment to increase production capacity to 350,000 vehicles a year. Total has said it will quit the multibillion-dollar South Pars gas project if it cannot secure a waiver from the U.S. sanctions – a request French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last month had been rejected along with others by French corporations. [nL5N1SN5HZ ] Total signed a contract in 2017 to develop Phase II of the South Pars field with an initial investment of $1 billion and has not yet said what it will do with its 30 percent stake should it pull out. It has until Nov 4 to wind down its Iran operations, barring any surprise exemption. Turboprop aircraft maker ATR on Aug 6 confirmed it had delivered five more planes to IranAir shortly before Washington imposed new sanctions but still faces difficulties obtaining U.S. permission to hand over another seven on order. Drugmaker Sanofi said it was premature to say if there will be any impact on its operations in Iran. Sanofi announced in early 2016 that it had signed an MoU with Tehran aimed at bolstering its presence in Iran. Medicines were exempted from the original nuclear sanctions although shipping drugs into the country was difficult. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely, assess the impact of the recently reintroduced economic sanctions and continue to work to ensure that patients in Iran can be provided with our innovative medicines, diagnostics and diabetes products,” the Swiss drugs company said. Nestle sees no direct fallout from renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. Nestle Iran has its headquarters in Tehran and two factories: one in Qazvin that produces infant cereals and infant formula, and a bottled water factory in Polour. The company has 818 employees and imports a limited range of Nestle products from abroad, it said.

2018-08-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Glencore (GLEN.L) said on Wednesday the sale of the bulk of its stake in Russia’s Rosneft to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund is due to close in the second half of this year, as the Swiss company loses its spot as the world’s second-largest oil trader. Glencore reported a slump in its traded oil volumes for the first half, pushing it into third place behind rivals Vitol and Trafigura.  Qatar’s fund QIA initially bought 19.5 percent in Rosneft together with Glencore in a consortium named QHG for 10.2 billion euros ($12.2 billion) during the Russian firm’s partial privatization in 2016. From that stake, QHG last year agreed to sell a 14.16 percent holding to CEFC China Energy but the deal fell through after CEFC’s founder was put under investigation by Chinese authorities over suspected economic crimes. QIA then said it would buy the holding instead of CEFC, leaving Glencore with 0.57 percent. “In April 2018, QHG concluded an agreement with QIA to dispose the majority of its shares held in Rosneft, representing a 14.16 percent stake. The transaction, subject to customary regulatory approvals, is expected to complete in H2 2018,” Glencore said.  Glencore’s crude trading volumes in the first half fell 24 percent to about 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) and refined products were down 23 percent at 2.1 million bpd compared to the same period in 2017. Vitol traded over 7 million bpd of crude and products last year, while Trafigura reported a 16 percent increase in the first half to 5.8 million bpd.   Glencore reported a 23 percent rise in first-half core earnings on Wednesday, just below analyst forecasts, as higher costs and lower prices for cobalt and other products ate into profits. Other big miners have said inflationary pressures are mounting, including from energy prices, as crude prices LCOc1 have risen nearly 13 percent this year, while metals markets are mostly weaker.

2018-08-08,"ISLAMABAD, Aug 8 (Reuters) - China is exploring building a spur from Pakistan’s territory once the multi-country TAPI natural gas pipeline project begins operating, a Pakistani official said, with the financial close of the project’s first phase expected next month. Originating at the giant Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan, the $9.6 billion TAPI (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India) pipeline involves the four countries’ own energy companies, and would carry 33 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year. Turkmenistan is building the TAPI pipeline to diversify its gas exports, which have mostly gone to China. But the project has suffered lengthy delays due to difficulties obtaining financing and the security risks of building a pipeline through war-torn Afghanistan. Mobin Saulat, the chief executive officer of Pakistan’s state-owned Inter State Gas Systems (ISGS), told Reuters that Chinese officials have shown growing interest in building a spur from Pakistan and the line could act as an alternative to Beijing’s plans to build a fourth China-to-Turkmenistan pipeline. “With this channel, there is a possibility they don’t have to do another line and they can off-take from this pipeline which is passing through Pakistan,” Saulat said. A China-to-Turkmenistan line has to cross several Central Asian mountain ranges and Saulat said it would be cheaper and easier for China to built a line from inside Pakistan’s territory to cross the Karakoram range to its Western border. China’s ties to Islamabad have deepened in recent years as Beijing has pledged to fund $57 billion in infrastructure as part of its Belt and Road initiative, including power stations and transport links. Facing more delays, TAPI countries have changed tack to attract financing and make progress in the past two years. The project is now due to be done in two phases, with the pipeline built without compressors in the first phase, which would cut gas volume but would reduce prohibitive project costs. Once gas starts flowing, and the pipeline begins generating cash flow, financing would be raised for the second phase that would see 11 compressors installed along the 1,814 km (1,127 mile) pipeline project. “With this introduction of the phased approach, it has gained momentum with the Chinese,” said Saulat. The financial close for the first phase is due by the end of September, Saulat said, with the Asian Development Bank promising $1 billion to $1.5 billion and the Islamic Development Bank giving assurances of $1 billion in loans.

2018-08-08,"FRANKFURT/DUBAI (Reuters) - Germany’s Lanxess (LXSG.DE) is selling its 50 percent stake in synthetic-rubber maker Arlanxeo to partner Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE for around 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in cash in a deal it said will give it more flexibility to grow. The deal marks an early exit for Lanxess from the world’s largest provider of synthetic rubber for tyres, while the Saudi state oil giant said it would “accelerate the development of growth opportunities in the kingdom, leveraging the strong feedstock position of Saudi Aramco”. Aramco, which is planning to go public and looking to buy a stake in petrochemicals maker SABIC 2010.SE, plays a key role in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitions to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond oil. “The proposed purchase underscores Saudi Aramco’s strategy to further diversify our downstream portfolio and strengthen our capabilities across the entire petroleum and chemicals value chain,” Aramco’s Senior Vice President of Downstream, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi said in a statement on Wednesday. For Lanxess chief executive Matthias Zachert the sale will allow him to focus on more deals to strengthen its specialty chemicals activities. Lanxess has previously said it would keep the remaining half of Arlanxeo until at least 2021. The German chemicals group expects to receive about 1.4 billion euros in cash from the deal, which is expected to complete by end of 2018, valuing all of Arlanxeo at 3.0 billion euros including debt and liabilities. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets and sees growth in chemicals as central to cut the risk of an oil demand slowdown. The sale in 2015 of the first 50 percent of Arlanxeo to Saudi Aramco had valued the business at 2.75 billion euros, and was pushed by Zachert at the time to make the company less volatile amid signs of increasing global rubber oversupply.     “We increase the resilience of our business, strengthen our financial basis and gain additional strategic flexibility for further growth,” Zachert said in a statement. Zachert has pursued deals to grow in smaller but more profitable specialty markets and vowed last year he would change the company further. Sources familiar with the company have said the CEO could consider another takeover the size of Chemtura.

2018-08-08,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Salvador Rodriguez and Nichola Groom SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s production of solar roof tiles has been delayed by assembly-line problems at its new publicly subsidized factory and difficulties producing a product that satisfies the aesthetic demands of CEO Elon Musk, eight former and current employees of both companies told Reuters. Repeated hold-ups since the Buffalo, New York plant opened last year have forced Tesla’s partner in the joint venture, Panasonic, to seek other buyers for the components it had built to sell to Tesla, according to a Panasonic employee, a former Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. The issues have also rattled the faith of state officials in Tesla’s ability to deliver on investment and employment promises it made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies. The production challenges add to doubts over Tesla’s cash-strapped solar operations as it focuses on boosting production of its better-known electric vehicles, which have also seen repeated production delays. Tesla acquired the solar business in 2016 in a controversial $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two of Musk’s cousins - but the business has been shrinking ever since. (For a graphic showing the decline in Tesla's solar business, see: tmsnrt.rs/2KjWlYU ) The “Solar Roof” produced at the New York factory is designed to look like a normal roof while generating electricity, a combination that has proved challenging. “Aesthetic look is the key point that Elon is always not satisfied with,” said another former Tesla employee, who works in Fremont, California. “That’s the big issue.” In a call with Tesla investors last week, Musk said “hundreds” of homes already had solar roofs, but the company clarified the estimate in its statement to Reuters, saying it included systems that had been partially installed or were “being scheduled for install.” In California, the nation’s leading solar market, there were twelve Tesla roof systems connected to the grid as of May 31, all in Northern California, according to records from the state’s three investor-owned utilities. The cost per watt for those systems was listed at nearly $6, according to the records. That’s about double the national average for solar systems. Tesla began accepting $1,000 deposits from customers for the Solar Roofs in May 2017, seven months after it unveiled a prototype. Tesla confirmed in a statement to Reuters that it has been seeking to improve on its production process for the solar roof at the New York plant. “We are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process,” the company said in the statement. “We plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018.” The company did not detail its current production and did not comment on its component purchases from partner Panasonic, which shares space in the factory and plans to produce Tesla solar panels and photovoltaic cells for the roofs. Panasonic has been selling some of the solar panels it produces in Buffalo under its own brand instead of selling them to Tesla, Panasonic said in a statement. It has also been shipping a large volume of the photovoltaic cells it produces in Buffalo as samples to prospective buyers because of low demand from Tesla, according to the Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. Panasonic declined to comment on the shipments of cell samples to other customers but said in a statement that it has not yet completed sales to buyers other than Tesla or signed alternate supply deals. “We believe Tesla will use Panasonic cells when it mass-markets the Solar Roof,” the company said in a statement. Some New York state lawmakers worry Tesla may fail to hold up its end of the bargain. The state provided $350 million to build the factory, along with $274.7 million for equipment and $125.3 million “for additional specified scope costs,” according to a Tesla filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The subsidy package requires Tesla to employ 1,460 people in Buffalo, including 500 at the plant, within two years of the facility’s completion, and to spend $5 billion in the state over a decade. Empire State Development, the state’s economic development arm, is overseeing the agreement. The agency believes Tesla is currently meeting its obligations, said spokeswoman Pamm Lent, adding that the company would face penalties of $41.2 million a year if it falters. Republican New York state Assemblyman Ray Walter, who represents a district near the factory, said it concerned him that only a small portion of the plant appeared functional when he toured it in March. “After investing $750 million of taxpayer money, we want it to work out,” he said. “It just does not look like it’s heading down that path.” Tesla said in its statement that the facility now employs about 600 people and is on track to meet all of its commitments. None of the Tesla sources could provide a production figure for the solar roof, saying only that output was low and frequently interrupted. They said only the textured black version of the solar roof had been produced so far, one of four varieties Tesla is marketing. Several of the sources at the plant said Musk had never visited the site; Tesla declined to comment. Panasonic recently produced about 1,900 conventional 325-watt solar panels per day at the plant, meant to be sold under the Tesla brand, and about 2,000 5.5-watt photovoltaic cells per day that were intended for the solar roof, according to two Panasonic sources, one who recently left the company. That would put annualized production at about a quarter of Tesla’s target for the plant, which is 1 gigawatt per year by 2019. And Tesla isn’t buying most of the cells being produced, according to the Panasonic employee. “We have been entertaining outside customers,” the employee said. Tesla is also turning to other suppliers to deal with the aesthetic concerns, using cells from JA Solar because they reflect light differently, said a current Tesla employee and a former Tesla employee. The current employee said a similar Panasonic cell was now undergoing testing and would be used in future versions of the solar roof. JA Solar declined to comment. Panasonic started cell production at the factory in February, but recently shut down manufacturing to install new equipment on its production lines, the Panasonic employee said. Full production will restart in September, the employee said. For now, wooden crates filled with unused equipment are sitting around the factory, according to the Panasonic employee and three other employees with knowledge of the plant operations. Some of that equipment has become obsolete over the past couple of years as technology has changed, two of the workers said. One of the few customers that has taken delivery of the Solar Roof is Tri Huynh, 39, who works in business development in Silicon Valley. Huynh said he paid about $100,000 for the system, which included three Tesla Powerwall home batteries to store the power produced. It took two weeks and a dozen workers to install, compared to a day for most traditional panel systems. “It’s fantastic. I love it,” he said, adding he was saving hundreds of dollars a month in power costs. “I’m a tech guy, so I kind of wanted the latest technology.” Warren Jason, a retired technology entrepreneur who is building an 11,000-square-foot house in the Hollywood Hills, is not so pleased. He put down $1,000 to reserve a roof in early 2017 but it has not yet arrived, and he has been unable to get details to give to his architect and engineers. “We’ve been begging Tesla for information,” he said. “It’s been extremely frustrating.” (Additional reporting by Makiko Yamazaki and Ritsuko Ando in Tokyo; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/tesla-solar/rpt-insight-inside-teslas-troubled-new-york-solar-factory-idUKL1N1UZ029,08 Aug 2018,"Tesla Inc’s

2018-08-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Centrica (CNA.L) will raise its standard energy prices for British Gas customers for the second time this year, it said on Wednesday, blaming rising wholesale costs. Around 3.5 million customers, on its dual fuel standard variable tariff, will be hit with a 3.8 percent price increase from Oct. 1. The rise comes as energy regulator Ofgem prepares to implement a price cap on standard tariffs by the end of the year to combat what the government has called “rip off” energy prices. The rise also comes on top of a 5.5 percent increase in British Gas’ standard prices on May 29. Centrica said it needed to implement the latest increase to a near 20 percent rise in wholesale costs since April. “Until now, we have been able to shield customer bills from the full impact of the increase in the wholesale costs because of the way we buy energy in advance,” Mark Hodges, CEO of Centrica Consumer said in a statement. Ofgem on Tuesday said the cap on its safeguard tariff for the most vulnerable customers would also increase in October due to higher wholesale costs. Analysts have warned Ofgem’s price caps will do little to stop energy bill increases. “Household energy prices are set to continue to rise despite Ofgem’s safeguard tariff or the government’s default price cap, which is set to replace it later this year,” Gareth Miller, chief executive of consultancy Cornwall Insight, said on its website. “Only if wholesale costs fall sharply will the pressure abate,” he said. All of Britain’s “big six” energy suppliers have announced price increases this year.  The other five big six supplier are SSE (SSE.L), E.ON (EONGn.DE), EDF Energy (EDF.PA), Innogy’s (IGY.DE) Npower and Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power.

Adjusted operating profit (EBIT) rose to 1.9 billion euros (1.7 billion pounds), in line with forecasts from banks and brokerages in a Reuters poll. “Our core business — Energy Networks, Customer Solutions, and Renewables — delivered good results, even though we continue to face fierce competition, primarily in our customer solutions business,” Chief Financial Officer Marc Spieker said. Shares in the company were down 1.4 percent by 0930 GMT as some investors had hoped for an upgrade of the group’s outlook. Spieker noted competition for residential and commercial electricity clients in Germany and a looming price cap for retail prices in Britain, where it is one of the ‘big six’ providers. Yet E.ON still added 100,000 household clients, taking its total above 20 million, Spieker said. E.ON’s Customer Solutions business posted an 8 percent rise in adjusted EBIT to 477 million euros versus 474 million expected by analysts. Competition for retail clients across Europe is forcing utilities to lower prices and offer bonuses to users switching providers. “In the UK, E.ON has been the only large player with domestic customer gains over last 12 months ... and is now the second largest player in the B2C segment in the UK, which we see as encouraging,” analysts at Jefferies, who rate the stock a “buy”, wrote in a note. In March E.ON announced plans to split up peer Innogy with rival RWE (RWEG.DE) and take on Innogy’s customer business. It secured a stake of 86.2 percent in Innogy as part of a takeover bid completed last month. The deal will make E.ON one of Europe’s largest retail energy players with about 50 million customers.

U.S. equities now stand less than half a percent off record highs hit in January, testifying to the strength of the world’s biggest economy and corporate sector, which has seen average earnings grow 23 percent in the second quarter. The picture in the rest of the world is less rosy, given slower economic momentum and the greater vulnerability of other big economies - from China to Germany - to U.S. trade levies. Washington is preparing to start collecting tariffs on an additional $16 billion in Chinese goods. But for now many markets, especially in Asia, are supported by the U.S. tech rally that recently saw iPhone maker Apple become the world’s first $1 trillion company. MSCI’s index of stocks from 47 countries was marginally higher while Asian equities rose 0.3 percent, led by tech-heavy Taiwan. Japan’s Nikkei ticked up 0.4 percent. “Everyone is just focusing on U.S. earnings... and feeling the U.S. market will remain robust despite trade uncertainties, and that’s the main driver right now,” said Christophe Barraud, a strategist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. Barraud said autumn could bring a reality check in the form of slower U.S. growth indicators, Italian politics, Britain’s Brexit negotiations with the European Union, U.S. mid-term elections and - above all - the risk of trade war escalation. “Support from U.S. earnings could last until the end of August and when people are back in September they will focus more on other events....(The trade war) is not a short-term conflict about a trade deficit but a longer-term story.” Indeed, support from company earnings is less evident elsewhere — a raft of weak results pushed European shares to trade just below flat. Average European second quarter earnings growth is running at 9.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, healthy but significantly lagging Wall Street. Chinese equities  meanwhile fell 0.4 percent as news of the additional U.S. tariffs overshadowed strong trade data that showed exports rose more than expected in July. A rise in imports also suggested Chinese domestic demand remains resilient. Trade fears were tempered somewhat by signs Beijing is unveiling further measures to support growth, such as increasing infrastructure spending and tweaking its monetary policy stance. . That lifted the yuan further off recent 15-month lows to the dollar. Chotaro Morita, a strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said Beijing’s policy support was “starting to give some support to other major markets”. But he predicted the impact would be limited. “The reason they have to do so is escalating trade tensions so you can’t expect much upside.” S&P500 equity futures indicated a flat Wall Street opening. While most currency markets were relatively calm, sterling came under renewed pressure, falling to 11-month lows against the euro, dollar and yen. Its woes stem from mounting concerns that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a trade deal in place, raising fears of a serious hit to the economy. With the government still far off agreeing an exit deal with Brussels, currency traders are increasingly edgy. Market players said they were seeing increasing moves by investors to hedge sterling risks. “A lot of companies can’t wait until the (Brexit) outcome is clear... Many of them are trying to hedge against a drop in sterling,” Barraud of Market Securities said. Elsewhere the dollar’s recent mini-rally appeared to have run out of steam, offering some respite to most emerging currencies including the yuan. The Turkish lira, the biggest mover in recent days, fell another 0.7 percent, though it stayed well off recent record lows On oil markets, Brent futures held firm around $75 a barrel as U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns of looming crude supply shortages.

2018-08-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s business ties with Iran are open, transparent and lawful, its foreign ministry said on Wednesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump said companies doing business with Iran would be barred from the United States. New U.S. sanctions on Iran have taken effect despite pleas from Washington’s allies. Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from the Trump administration for talks, saying it could not negotiate while Washington had reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Trump decided this year to pull out of the agreement, ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington’s main European allies, Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China. Beijing has cultivated close commercial links with Tehran, especially in the energy sector. “China has consistently opposed unilateral sanctions and long-armed jurisdiction,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in a faxed statement to Reuters, responding to questions on the new U.S. sanctions and Trump’s threats on firms doing business with Iran. “China’s commercial cooperation with Iran is open and transparent, reasonable, fair and lawful, not violating any United Nations Security Council resolutions,” it added. “China’s lawful rights should be protected.” China, Iran’s top oil customer, buys roughly 650,000 barrels a day of crude oil from Tehran, or 7 percent of China’s total crude oil imports. At current market rates, the imports are worth some $15 billion (£11.6 billion) a year.  State energy firms CNPC and Sinopec have invested billions of dollars in key Iranian oil fields such as Yadavaran and North Azadegan and have been sending oil to China.  European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the nuclear deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out.  But that has proven difficult, and European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business. Few American companies do much business in Iran so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from Washington’s ability to block European and Asian firms from trading there. Among large European companies that have suspended plans to invest in Iran are France’s oil major Total and its big carmakers, PSA and Renault.

U.S. President Donald Trump responded by noting that Iran could face serious consequences if it threatened the United States. “The Americans have assembled a war room against Iran,” Zarif said. “We can’t get drawn into a confrontation with America by falling into this war room trap and playing on a battlefield.” Last month, Trump offered to meet with Iran’s leaders.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A Munich-based start-up has taken advantage of the strong Bavarian sun this summer to test the final development of the charging system of its Sion car, an all-electric solar vehicle that lets you charge as you drive. Germany will likely miss its target of putting 1 million electric cars on the road by 2020 but the government said in April it was ready to offer support to companies that make batteries for electric vehicles. Sono Motors, founded in 2016, is developing the Sion, a fully-electric vehicle that has solar cells integrated into its bodywork. It can be charged via solar power or from conventional power outlets. Production will start in the second half of 2019 and the company has more than 6,500 orders which it aims to start selling at 16,000 euros (£14,357.96) next year. Sion will have 330 solar cells attached to the vehicle’s roof, bonnet and sides and its battery system will offer a range of around 250 km (155 miles) before it needs recharging. “We have a seat heater, there is air conditioning, there is a large infotainment system where I can also connect my phone interactively, which means I really have a full vehicle which is very simple, has no frills,” Laurin Hahn, co-founder and chief executive of the startup told Reuters.

2018-08-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft said on Tuesday its second-quarter net profit more than tripled to 228 billion rubles ($3.6 billion) on higher production and prices, pushing its shares to an all-time peak.  Rosneft, in which Qatar is set to become the third-largest shareholder after the Russian state and BP, said its profit was also supported by a one-off gain from a share acquisition in an upstream joint venture and the revaluation of a stake in another joint venture. Headed by Igor Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Rosneft said its revenue in the second quarter was 2.07 trillion rubles, up 48 percent year-on-year. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were 565 billion rubles, up 85 percent. “The second quarter was mainly a reflection of the management’s efforts to improve the efficiency of the company,” Sechin said in a statement.  Under Sechin, who took over the company in 2012, Rosneft has made huge acquisitions in Russia and abroad, including the $55 billion takeover of local peer TNK-BP in 2013. That deal made Rosneft the world’s biggest listed oil firm by output.  “The key strategic acquisitions made in the period of low oil prices have been completed. The company is focusing on organic growth and the monetization of synergies from the acquisitions,” Sechin said.   According to the Aton brokerage, Rosneft’s net debt, excluding prepayments for oil supplies, was 3.3 trillion rubles at the end of the second quarter, equivalent to 1.8 times net debt/EBITDA.  That was 101 billion rubles less than the first quarter.  In May, Rosneft announced a plan to cut its debt and trading liabilities by a minimum of 500 billion rubles this year, partly by selling non-core assets.  “We are actively working on the initiatives we set to enhance shareholders’ returns. In the first half-year, the company more than halved its short-term financial liabilities,” Sechin said on Tuesday.  “The management is continuing to work intensively with the intention of meeting the goals set for the year.”  Rosneft also said on Tuesday that Venezuela owed it $3.6 billion in the second quarter of this year, down from $4 billion at the end of the previous quarter. On Monday, Rosneft said its daily liquids production in the second quarter rose 0.8 percent year-on-year to 4.6 million barrels and that it had the capacity to raise third-quarter oil production by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd). The firm added on Tuesday that by the end of 2018 it would be able to raise oil output by 250,000 bpd from a quota level agreed as part of an oil production deal between OPEC and non-OPEC countries. It said it planned to put its new Russkoye oilfield in the northern Yamal Nenets region onstream by the end of the year. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last month Russia planned to increase its production by 200,000-250,000 bpd in July. Following an initial deal in 2016 between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to curb oil output, Rosneft said it could delay the start of production at some new fields, including eastern Siberia’s Uyrubcheno-Tokhomskoye and Russkoye. Rosneft also said on Monday that its board of directors had approved the structure and parameters of a share buyback program worth up to $2 billion. The program would run until the end of 2020 and Rosneft said it may partially cancel its treasury shares if needed. The maximum amount of shares and depositary receipts to be repurchased would not exceed 340 million shares, it said.  Rosneft Chief Financial Officer Pavel Fyodorov said on a conference call the firm was considering using the share price on April 10-11 as a potential target for its buyback program. Rosneft shares were trading at 309 rubles on April 10 and at 324 rubles on April 11.  Rosneft said on Tuesday that its first-half dividend might be higher than its 2017 full-year payout. That, together with strong results and the earlier approved buyback, pushed its shares to an all-time high of 425.5 rubles apiece on Tuesday.

2018-08-08,"* LNG export volumes fall to 4-year low in July * Petronas yet to resume ops at gas pipeline after leak - source * Petronas says no disruption to cargo deliveries By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell to a four-year low in July as domestic gas pipeline issues plaguing the country since January took their toll, according to industry sources and Thomson Reuters data. Natural gas supply from the Sabah Oil and Gas terminal to the Petronas LNG Complex in Bintulu was cut in January following a gas leak in the 500 kilometre pipeline which transports gas from Kimanis in Sabah to the Bintulu plant in Sarawak for processing. While the pipeline has been repaired, Petronas is still awaiting the necessary approval from authorities to resume operations at the pipeline, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Petronas did not comment on the pipeline issue but a spokeswoman said that there is no disruption to cargo deliveries from the Petronas LNG complex in Bintulu and that operations at the complex are being carried out as scheduled. The Petronas LNG Complex, which has a capacity of 24 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), comprises three LNG plants owned and operated by Petronas and joint venture companies. It is supplied with gas from several facilities off Sarawak, according to the company website. Malaysia’s LNG exports fell to about 1.5 million tonnes in July, the data showed, the lowest since July 2014 when it was about 1.43 million tonnes. Petronas has purchased replacement cargoes to meet some of its contractual obligations to term customers, one source said, which would reduce spot exports as a result. The drop in export volumes comes at a time when demand from Japan, the world’s biggest importer of LNG, has been robust amid sweltering heat. “Overall, the market is quite tight in terms of supply but new supply from Australia should help going forward,” a Singapore-based trader said. Revenue from LNG, which accounted for 3.5 percent of Malaysia’s total exports, decreased to 2.7 billion ringgit ($663 million) in June, down 1.2 billion ringgit or about 31 percent from a year ago as export volumes fell, official statistics show. Petronas also operates the 1.2 mtpa Petronas floating LNG facility off the coast of Sarawak.

2018-08-08,"* Strong U.S. earnings, hopes of China policy support lift shares * Wall Street volatility gauge hits 7-month low * Trade disputes, waning impact of US tax cuts cast shadow * European shares seen dipping 0.2-0.3 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Asian shares extended their recovery into a fourth day on Wednesday, buoyed by strong U.S. earnings and expectations that Beijing will ramp up fiscal stimulus to cushion the impact of its worsening trade dispute with Washington. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3 percent, led by Taiwan , while Japan’s Nikkei ticked down 0.1 percent. Bucking the trend were Chinese shares , which slipped more than 1 percent after the United States said it would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on an additional $16 billion worth of Chinese goods this month, the second leg of its first China-targetted tariffs on $50 billion goods. European shares also expected to fall, with futures contracts pointing to a 0.2 percent decline in Britain’s FTSE and France’s CAC  and 0.3 percent drop in Germany’s DAX . News that the fresh duties will go into effect from Aug. 23 overshadowed strong Chinese trade data, which showed exports rose more than expected in July despite U.S. tariffs imposed early last month. Imports also rose more than forecast, suggesting its domestic demand remains resilient despite trade war fears. But losses in China markets were tempered by signs Beijing is unveiling further measures to support growth, such as increasing infrastructure spending and tweaking its monetary policy stance. “China’s apparent policy shift from structural reforms to short-term policy support appears to be starting to give some support to other major markets,” said Chotaro Morita, chief fixed income strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “Yet the reason they have to do so is escalating trade tensions so you can’t expect much upside. On the other hand, a boost to the U.S. economy from tax cuts is peaking out soon. In coming months, the focus will be how markets will price in this peak out,” he added. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.28 percent to 2,858, which is just 14 points, or about 0.5 percent, below its record high marked in January. A strong second-quarter earnings season has fuelled optimism about U.S. economic strength. S&P 500 firms saw a 23.5 percent rise in their April-June profits, according to Thomson Reuters data. Against this backdrop, the CBOE volatility index, a measure of investors’ expectation on U.S. share price volatilities and often viewed as a gauge of anxiety in financial markets, fell to a seven-month low of 10.93. Tesla jumped 11 percent after Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was considering taking the electric car maker private. In the foreign exchange market, major currencies kept to tight ranges. The euro was at $1.1610, off Monday’s five-week low of $1.1530. The yen stood little changed at 111.19 per dollar while worries about a hard Brexit kept the sterling at $1.2938 , just above its 11-month trough of $1.2920 set on Monday. The Chinese yuan was little changed, fetching 6.8261 per dollar in onshore trade, though it kept some distance from its 15-month lows hit last week as the central bank on Friday took steps to curb bets against the currency by raising the cost for investors to short the yuan. But pressure on the Chinese currency remained strong. “The Chinese authorities do not seem to be aiming to push up the yuan. Considering that U.S. is likely to impose another tariff on $200 billion imports from China, speculators are betting on further falls in the yuan,” said Naoki Tashiro, president of TS China Research. “The U.S. is raising rates while China is easing its monetary policy. For speculators, dollar buying is the obvious trade,” he added. The Turkish lira, the biggest mover in recent days, kept some distance from Monday’s record low, trading at 5.2600 per dollar, versus Monday’s low of 5.425, Still, it is down almost 7 percent so far this month on deepening concerns about a rift with the United States and on President Tayyip Erdogan’s influence over the central bank. Oil prices held firm after U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns that sanctions on Iranian oil, expected in November, could cause supply shortages. Brent futures stood at $74.59 a barrel, flat on the day but maintaining gains of about 2 percent so far this week.

2018-08-08,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd (KML.TO) documents filed on Tuesday suggest expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline will cost more than current estimates and could take longer than expected to complete. In a report filed with U.S. regulators as part of Kinder Morgan’s sale of the Trans Mountain assets to the Canadian government, the company’s financial adviser contemplated possible capital cost increases of C$1 billion to C$1.9 billion  ($766,000 to $1.5 billion), and a delay of up to one year to December 2021. Kinder Morgan has not provided a cost update since March 2017 despite numerous project delays to the C$7.4 billion project. It said the figures, produced by TD Securities, “should not be taken as forecasts.” Canada agreed in May to buy the Trans Mountain assets for C$4.5 billion to save the controversial expansion, which will nearly triple capacity on the line from oil-rich Alberta to British Columbia’s coast. The deal is now expected to close late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to a proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It was previously expected to close this summer. Canada’s Finance Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Work on the Trans Mountain expansion has been repeatedly delayed by permitting issues and political opposition. Kinder Morgan halted all non-essential work in April, citing project risks. Canada will fund the resumption of construction work on the expansion under a covered credit facility until the deal closes, the company said.  The proxy documents included a report prepared by TD Securities, the company’s financial adviser, which analyzed asset value based on three possible outcomes for the Trans Mountain expansion project. These scenarios included a final pricetag of C$8.4 billion with on-time delivery of December 2020, a C$9.3 billion pricetag and a delay to December 2021, or an outright cancellation. Both cost estimate scenarios are higher than the current estimate. The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple the capacity of the existing line to 890,000 barrels per day, providing much needed access for Alberta producers to offshore markets. It is opposed by the province of British Columbia, environmental groups and some aboriginal communities. Kinder Morgan Canada shareholders will vote on the proposed takeover on Aug. 30, the company said in a July 27, 2018 letter to shareholders posted in the proxy.

2018-08-08,"(Repeats Aug. 7 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2M7dhH5 By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Russia started to raise their oil production several weeks before the formal decision to increase output was taken by OPEC and its allies towards the end of June. Saudi Arabia increased its production to 10.49 million barrels per day (bpd) in June from 10.03 million in May and 9.87 million bpd in April, according to government data submitted to OPEC (tmsnrt.rs/2M7dhH5). Russia’s Rosneft also started to raise output from late May, anticipating a relaxation of the supply curbs, according to an investor presentation released with the company’s second-quarter results on Tuesday. The two largest suppliers within OPEC+ adjusted production first and then invited other members to ratify the decision that had already been taken when OPEC and non-OPEC producers met in Vienna on June 22 and 23. The sequence of events confirms the locus of decision-making and power has shifted decisively away from OPEC and OPEC+ to Saudi Arabia and Russia. OPEC has been marginalised as a decision-making group; the oil market has moved into a post-OPEC era where management is undertaken by Riyadh and Moscow with some political input from Washington. The implication that the decision to increase production was taken and started to be implemented well before the OPEC+ meeting is consistent with movements in hedge fund positioning, spot prices and spreads. Hedge fund managers began to reduce their bullish position in Brent and WTI crudes and options weeks before the decision was formally taken and announced. Net long positions in Brent and WTI were cut from a peak of 1.093 billion barrels in mid-April to 790 million barrels by the end of the first week in June, and have changed relatively little since then. Front-month Brent futures peaked around $80 per barrel on May 22-23 and slid through most of June ahead of the OPEC meeting. Brent calendar spreads have also been sliding since late April as traders anticipated greater availability of crude in the second half of the year. The fact that the decision to raise output, and probably by how much, had already been taken helps explain much of what transpired in Vienna. Iran’s oil minister, who initially appeared to oppose any rise in output, eventually consented to a statement that signalled an increase but without numbers or country allocations. Because the output increase had already been agreed between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and was in fact underway, Iran had little choice. The same is true for a number of other OPEC members that opposed an output increase. The Iranian minister could have refused to agree to the statement, in which the output increase would have continued anyway, or agreed to a consensus statement that omitted contentious allocations. Unsurprisingly, the minister opted for the latter, since it provided a modicum of face-saving, but it shows the extent to which other members of OPEC now have minimal bargaining power. Russia and especially Saudi Arabia have strong reasons to want to keep OPEC and OPEC+ formally involved in decision-making. OPEC provides a convenient political shield against criticism from consumer countries, especially the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump’s twitter messages have blamed rising oil prices on OPEC rather than Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, specifically. Saudi Arabia will probably want to ensure that output decisions remain attributed to OPEC or OPEC+ rather than assume sole responsibility or joint accountability with Russia, which is not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC allows Saudi Arabia to deflect criticism of its production decisions and helps separate oil policy from other aspects of the bilateral relationship such as security and policy towards Iran. But the fact that decisions are taken in the name of OPEC should not obscure the fact real decision-making has moved elsewhere. The real negotiations now take place between Riyadh and Moscow, behind closed doors and far away from OPEC headquarters in Vienna, reflecting their market calculations, and relationships with the United States.

2018-08-08,"* Strong U.S. earnings, hopes of China policy support lift shares * Wall Street volatility gauge hits 7-month low * Trade disputes, waning impact of US tax cuts cast shadow By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Wednesday on the back of firmer Wall Street earnings while expectations for increased Chinese stimulus helped take the edge off wider concerns about the worsening Sino-U.S. trade dispute. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.22 percent while Japan’s Nikkei ticked up 0.05 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.28 percent to 2,858, which is just 14 points, or about 0.5 percent, below its record high marked in January. A strong second-quarter earnings season fuelled optimism about U.S. economic strength. S&P 500 firms saw a 23.5 percent rise in their April-June profits, according to Thomson Reuters data. Against this backdrop, the CBOE volatility index, a measure of investors’ expectation on U.S. share price volatilities and often viewed as a gauge of anxiety in financial markets, fell to a seven-month low of 10.93. Tesla jumped 11 percent after Chief Executive Elon Musk said he was considering taking the electric car maker private. In China, share prices rebounded on Tuesday following a heavy four-day selloff partly as infrastructure firms were bolstered by expectations of increased spending on public works projects. “China’s apparent policy shift from structural reforms to short-term policy support appears to be starting to give some support to other major markets,” said Chotaro Morita, chief fixed income strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “Yet the reason they have to do so is escalating trade tensions so you can’t expect much upside. On the other hand, a boost to the U.S. economy from tax cuts is peaking out soon. In coming months, the focus will be how markets will price in this peak out,” he added. In a stark reminder that the Sino-U.S. trade dispute has worsened, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said on Tuesday Washington will begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23. In the foreign exchange market, major currencies kept to tight ranges. The euro was at $1.1599, off Monday’s five-week low of $1.1530. The yen stood little changed at 111.38 per dollar while worries about a hard Brexit kept the sterling at $1.2938 , just above its 11-month trough of $1.2920 set on Monday. The Chinese yuan held firm near one-week high in the offshore trade, extending its rebound after the central bank on Friday took steps to curb bets against the currency by raising the cost for investors to short the yuan. The Turkish lira, the biggest mover in recent days, kept some distance from Monday’s record low, trading at 5.2600 per dollar, versus Monday’s low of 5.425. Still, it is down almost 7 percent so far this month. Oil prices held firm after U.S. sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns that sanctions on Iranian oil, expected in November, could cause supply shortages. Brent futures stood at $74.63 a barrel, flat on the day but maintaining gains of about 2 percent so far this week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded at $69.25 per barrel, up 0.1 percent on the day for a gain of 1.1 percent this week.

2018-08-08,"SINGAPORE, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices held steady on Wednesday, supported by a report of rising U.S. crude inventories as well as the introduction of sanctions against Iran. Front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.21 per barrel at 0012 GMT, up 4 cents from their last settlement. Brent crude oil futures were at $74.63 per barrel, down two cents after a 90 cent gain in the previous session. “Crude oil prices rose as the reality of U.S. sanctions on Iran weighed on sentiment. News from key buyers suggests the market is already adjusting to the new regime,” ANZ bank said in a note on Wednesday. The U.S. government introduced a raft a new sanctions against Iran on Tuesday, targetting Iran’s purchases of U.S. dollars - in which oil is traded - metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector. From November, Washington will also target Iran’s petroleum sector. Iran is a major exporter of crude oil, shipping out almost 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in September, equivalent to around 3 percent of global demand. Beyond the sanctions, the oil market was focusing on the U.S. market, where the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday that crude inventories fell by 6 million barrels in the week to Aug. 3 to 407.2 million. Official U.S. fuel storage data is due to be released later on Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In terms of production, the EIA on Tuesday slightly cut its 2018 expectation for average 2018 U.S. crude output to 10.69 million bpd, down from its previous estimate of 10.79 million bpd.
