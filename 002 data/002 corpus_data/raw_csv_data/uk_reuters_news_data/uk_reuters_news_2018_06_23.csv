2018-06-23,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Islamic State militants have kidnapped six members of Iraq’s security forces and threatened to kill them in three days unless the government releases Sunni Muslim female prisoners, the group said on Saturday. In a video posted by the group’s Amaq news agency, six men with visible injuries on their faces appear sitting on the floor with two masked gunmen, pointing assault rifles at them, standing behind. Islamic State’s black banner hangs in the background. Iraq’s military spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. In the video, the men identify themselves as members of Iraq’s police or the Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella grouping of mostly Shi’ite Iran-backed militias that fought with government forces against Islamic State and nominally report to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. “I implore the central government of Haider al-Abadi and the Anbar provincial government, we are now with the Islamic State, and we have three days. If the demand to release Sunni women from prisons is not met, we will all be killed,” said one of the hostages. Abadi declared final victory over the hardline Sunni militants in December but the group still operates from pockets along the border with Syria and has continued to carry out ambushes, assassinations and bombings across Iraq. There has been an uptick in attacks by the group in recent weeks, especially on a highway connecting the capital Baghdad with the country’s north where Amaq said the men in the video had been taken. “We give the Rafidi government three days to release all Sunni detainees from prisons in exchange for releasing these apostates, or else their fate will be that of their predecessors,” said one of the gunmen, using a slur for Shi’ites regularly employed by Islamic State.

2018-06-23,"NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said on Saturday their political blocs would enter into an alliance, bringing Iraq one step closer to forming a new government after an election marred by low turnout and fraud allegations. The alliance between Abadi’s Victory Alliance, which came third in a May parliamentary election, and Sadr’s Saeroon list, which won the largest number of seats, increases the chances of forming a government after weeks of political tensions. “We announce a cross-sectarian, cross-ethnic alliance to speed up forming the next government and to agree on common points that guarantee the interests of the Iraqi people,” Sadr said at a news conference in the Shi’ite holy city of Najaf. He called for a wider alliance consisting of all components of Iraqi society that would form an inclusive government. Sadr presents himself as a non-sectarian nationalist opposed to both the United States and Iran’s influence over his country. Saeroon is an electoral alliance between Sadrist politicians, the Iraqi Communist Party, and other secular candidates.  Yet earlier in June Sadr went into an alliance with Hadi al-Amiri, a Shi’ite militia commander with close ties to Iran whose Fatih coalition came second in the election. There was no immediate reaction from al Amiri’s camp, but the prime minister said his pact with Sadr would not compromise the cleric’s other alliance. “I affirm that this alliance is not in contrast to any other alliances either of the two lists have previously entered into with other blocs, rather, it flows in the same direction and same principles,” said Abadi. The top three winning blocs, all Shi’ite-led, have upwards of 140 seats between them. At least 165 seats are needed to form a government although traditionally the ruling bloc in parliament tends to be larger so as to include Sunni Arab and Kurdish lawmakers. A coalition between Sadr, Amiri, and Abadi could see internal divisions. Abadi had balanced U.S. and Iranian interests during his term and was backed by the West. Sadr says he opposes both, and Amiri is Iran’s biggest Iraqi ally. Despite coming in third, Abadi is hoping to win a second term as a compromise candidate for the premiership. Analysts and diplomats say he would be weakened and beholden to Sadr and Amiri even if he manages to stay on, however. Abadi and Sadr both called on the leaders of other blocs to meet and “agree on the coming steps” in order to speed up the formation of an inclusive Iraqi government. Political leaders in Iraq traditionally hold such meetings after elections as part of the lengthy and often complicated process of forming a coalition government, as no one party ever wins enough seats to form a government on its own. The process is further complicated this time round because the next parliament is born of an election marred by historically low turnout and allegations of fraud.  The outgoing parliament has mandated a nationwide manual recount of votes and Iraq’s top court upheld that move, which faced legal challenges. A fire at a storage site housing half of Baghdad’s ballot boxes had raised tensions. Security forces said it was deliberate and made arrests but said most ballots were saved. No party has been identified as responsible yet. The recount will slow down the process as the new parliament and government cannot be formed until the results are officially ratified by Iraq’s Supreme Federal Court.  Political leaders need to meet soon in order to end that “crisis” and speed up the process, Abadi said.

2018-06-23,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq has launched an air attack on a gathering of Islamic State leaders inside neighbouring Syria, killing 45 members of the hardline militant group, its military said on Saturday. F-16 fighter jets destroyed three houses on Friday which were connected by a trench in the town of Hajin, where the leaders were meeting. Those killed included high profile targets such as the group’s “deputy war minister”, one of its “media emirs”, its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s personal courier and its chief of police, the military said in a statement. Islamic State, which once occupied a third of Iraq’s territory, has been largely defeated in the country but still poses a threat along the border with Syria. “Iraqi F-16 jets carried out a successful air strike that targeted a meeting of Daesh leaders ... in the Hajin area within Syrian territory. The operation resulted in the complete destruction of the targets, and the killing of around 45 terrorists,” the military’s Joint Operations Command said. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. The Iraqi military has carried out several air strikes against Islamic State in Syria since last year, with the approval of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militants. Separately, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said one of its senior officers was killed in the Syrian town of Albu Ahmed near the Iraqi border. Second Brigadier General Shahrokh Daeipour, a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, was killed during “advisory operations”, the Guards’ website Sepahnews said, without giving further details.  Iran denies having any conventional armed forces in Syria, but has acknowledged military advisers and volunteers from the Revolutionary Guards are there to help Assad’s forces. Iraq has good relations with Iran and Russia, Assad’s main backers in the Syrian war, and also enjoys strong support from the U.S.-led coalition. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared final victory over Islamic State in December but it still operates from pockets along the border with Syria and has continued to carry out ambushes, assassinations and bombings across Iraq. The group has resorted to guerrilla tactics since it abandoned its goal of holding territory and creating a self-sufficient caliphate that straddles Iraq and Syria.

2018-06-23,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran said on Saturday the world will see little extra oil reaching the market if OPEC and its partners adhere properly to a supply pact, underlining a disagreement with top exporter Saudi Arabia.  OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries agreed on Saturday that they would return to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed oil output cuts, after months of underproduction by OPEC countries including Venezuela and Angola. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said this implied an indirect reallocation of extra production from countries unable to produce more oil to those, such as his own and the other Gulf OPEC members, that are able to do so. But Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, told Reuters that no reallocation was agreed at Saturday’s joint OPEC and non-OPEC meeting or the OPEC-only talks a day earlier. “There is no such thing,” Kazempour said. “Some people may do, but they are in breach of the agreement.” The comments underline that disagreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, longtime rivals in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, persists despite extensive talks in Vienna this week aimed at resolving differences.  Venezuela has been pumping more than 500,000 barrels per day below its OPEC target because of natural declines in its oil output, but in Iran’s view other countries should not step in to cover the shortfall. “They cannot go and say Venezuela has 500,000 bpd on the table and there is no cat to eat this meat, I’m the cat and I will jump on it,” Kazempour said. If countries stick to their allocations, output would rise by 300,000 bpd in the first three months and up to 500,000 bpd by the end of the year, he said - less than the 1 million bpd mentioned by Falih and some other ministers. “This will come up naturally, some is additional barrels, some is restraint barrels, because nobody can turn up tomorrow,” Kazempour said. Iran had demanded OPEC reject calls from U.S. President Donald Trump for an increase in oil supply, arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. According to Kazempour, Venezuela had said its output would partially recover in the next three to four months, another reason why other producers should not step in to compensate.    “Venezuela told us that 300,000 bpd will come back,” he said.

2018-06-23,"ALGIERS, June 23 (Reuters) - Algeria’s foreign exchange reserves fell by $7.3 billion in the first five months of this year and are expected to decline by $5 billion from now until the end of the year, Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said on Saturday. “Reserves stood at $90 billion at the end of May and should decline to $85 billion by the end of 2018,” Ouyahia said after a meeting with members of his National Rally for Democracy (RND) party on television. Reserves were $97.3 billion in December 2017, down from $114.1 billion the previous year, $144.1 billion in 2015 and $178 billion in 2014, when crude oil prices started falling, until partly recovering this year. Oil and gas earnings, which account for 95 percent of total exports and 60 percent of the state budget, fell to $33.6 billion in 2017 from $63 billion in 2014.

2018-06-23,"VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies on Saturday to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had announced an OPEC-only production agreement on Friday, also without clear output targets. Benchmark Brent oil rose by $2.5 or 3.4 percent on the day to $75.55 a barrel. On Saturday, non-OPEC oil producers agreed to participate in the pact but a communique issued after their talks with the Vienna-based group provided no concrete numbers amid deep disagreements between OPEC arch-rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump was among those wondering how much more oil OPEC would deliver. “Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!” Trump wrote on Twitter after OPEC announced its Friday decision. The United States, China and India had urged oil producers to release more supply to prevent an oil deficit that could undermine global economic growth.  OPEC and non-OPEC said in their statement that they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and non-OPEC combined would pump roughly an extra 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in coming months, equal to 1 percent of global supply. Top global exporter Saudi Arabia will increase output by hundreds of thousands of barrels, he said, with exact figures to be decided later.  “We already mobilised the Aramco machinery, before coming to Vienna, pre-empting this meeting,” Falih said, referring to the Saudi state oil company. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said his country would add 200,000 bpd in the second half of this year. Asked to what extent the decision to increase supply had been driven by pressure from Trump, Novak said: “It is obvious that we are not being driven by tweets but base our actions on deep market analysis.” Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, had demanded OPEC reject calls from Trump for an increase in oil supply, arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on Iran and fellow member Venezuela. Trump slapped fresh sanctions on Tehran in May and market watchers expect Iran’s output to drop by a third by the end of 2018. That means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise output, unlike Saudi Arabia. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said the real increase could amount to as little as 500,000 bpd because Saudi Arabia would not be allowed to pump more on behalf of Venezuela, where output has collapsed in recent months. “Each country which has produced less (than its allocation) can produce more. Those which cannot, will not... This means that Saudi Arabia can increase its production by less than 100,000 bpd,” Zanganeh told Argus Media. But Falih said pro-rata quota reallocations did not have to be strict, meaning Saudi wanted to fill the gaps left by others. “Some of the countries ... are not going to be able to produce, so the others will. And that implies there will be indirectly a reallocation,” Falih said. He also said OPEC could hold an extraordinary meeting before its next formal talks due on Dec. 3 or adjust deliveries in September, when its monitoring committee meets, if global oil supply fell further because of sanctions on Iran. OPEC and its allies have since last year been participating in a pact to cut output by 1.8 million bpd. The measure had helped rebalance the market in the past 18 months and lifted oil to around $75 per barrel from as low as $27 in 2016. But unexpected outages in Venezuela, Libya and Angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around 2.8 million bpd in recent months.  Falih has warned the world could face a supply deficit of up to 1.8 million bpd in the second half of 2018.  (For a graphic on 'OPEC compliance in May - Reuters Survey' click reut.rs/2JRWnw1) “Both Saudi and Iran can show that they won,” an OPEC delegate said.  “Zanganeh can go back to his country and say ‘I won’, because we are keeping the original agreement unchanged. Falih can go back and say ‘we will be able to raise production to meet market needs’.” The United States, which rivals Russia and Saudi Arabia for the position of world No.1 oil producer, is not participating in the supply pact.

2018-06-23,"MEXICO CITY, June 23 (Reuters) - Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the favorite to win Mexico’s July 1 presidential election, has asked prominent businessman Alfonso Romo to be his chief of staff, the candidate’s campaign said late on Friday. Lopez Obrador’s team made the announcement in a statement as the election campaign draws to a close. Romo, a tycoon with a business empire based in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, has been a top economic adviser to Lopez Obrador for several years. Opinion polls give the former Mexico City mayor a commanding lead in the race to become the next president, with some showing he has twice the support of his nearest rival. Romo, a two-time Olympic showjumper who runs a major brokerage, has backed the energy reform at the heart of the current government’s economic agenda, in spite of opposition to it from many of Lopez Obrador’s supporters on the left. Outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto, who is barred constitutionally from seeking re-election, pushed through legislation in 2013-14 that opened up Mexico’s long-shuttered oil and gas industry to more private and foreign investment. Lopez Obrador, a longstanding opponent of the reform, has said he wants to review the contracts awarded under the liberalization for any signs of corruption, and he could freeze further auctions of oil and gas blocks in Mexico. Romo said in April, however, the reform would not be reversed. The government says billions of dollars worth of contracts have been awarded under the energy reform to oil majors including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Representatives for Lopez Obrador and Romo did not immediately say if Romo had accepted the invitation. Mexico’s next president is scheduled to take office on Dec. 1 after a five-month transition period.

2018-06-23,"* OPEC’s deal on Friday gave no specific output targets * Iraq sees real output increase by 770,000 bpd * Iran says Saudi cannot compensate for Venezuela output loss * Trump says hopes OPEC will increase “substantially” By Ahmad Ghaddar and Vladimir Soldatkin VIENNA, June 23 (Reuters) - OPEC meets Russia and other allies on Saturday to clinch a new deal raising oil output, a day after agreeing a production hike within the group itself but confusing the market as to how much more oil it will pump. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced its OPEC-only agreement on Friday, but gave no clear output targets. Russia and other non-OPEC oil producers will now meet OPEC in a bid to secure their participation in the pact. Benchmark Brent oil rose by $2.5 or 3.4 percent on Friday to $75.55 a barrel. U.S. President Donald Trump was among those wondering how much more oil OPEC will deliver. “Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!” Trump wrote on Twitter after OPEC announced its decision. The United States, China and India had urged oil producers to release more supply to prevent an oil deficit that could undermine global economic growth. OPEC said in a statement that it would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, but gave no concrete figures. Saudi Arabia said the move would translate into a nominal output rise of around 1 million barrels per day (bpd), or 1 percent of global supply, for OPEC and non-OPEC producers. Iraq said the real increase would be around 770,000 bpd because several countries that had suffered production declines would struggle to reach full quotas. Iran said the real increase could amount to as little as 500,000 bpd. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Saturday he was happy with the decision even though he had previously pushed OPEC and non-OPEC to raise output by as much as 1.5 million bpd. “At this stage the 1 million is quite rational,” he told reporters after arriving in Vienna, where OPEC is headquartered. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, had demanded OPEC reject calls from Trump for an increase in oil supply, arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on Iran and fellow member Venezuela. Trump slapped fresh sanctions on Tehran in May and market watchers expect Iran’s output to drop by a third by the end of 2018. That means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise OPEC output, unlike top oil exporter Saudi Arabia. By not setting individual targets, the OPEC deal appeared to give Saudi Arabia the leeway to produce more than its previous OPEC quota and fill the gap left by those such as Venezuela who cannot pump enough to meet their official allocation. But Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said that was not the case: “Each country which has produced less (than its allocation) can produce more. Those which cannot, will not.” “This means that Saudi Arabia can increase its production by less than 100,000 bpd, Qatar can produce an additional 70,000 bpd,” Zanganeh told Argus Media. “But this does not mean that Venezuela’s production should be produced by some other. Venezuela will raise its production when it can. And if it cannot, others cannot come in and produce on their behalf,” Zanganeh said. OPEC and its allies have since last year been participating in a pact to cut output by 1.8 million bpd.

2018-06-23,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s gasoline exports in May surged from a year earlier, as  state refiners sought to profit from good export margins and additional quota, customs data showed on Saturday. Gasoline exports in May rose 134 percent from a year earlier to 1.47 million tonnes, and up from 1.21 million tonnes in April.

The month’s fuel exports were still lower than the record numbers recorded in March however. Meanwhile liquefied natural gas imports rose 42.8 percent to 4.15 million tonnes in May, driven by strong consumption from chemical plants and reduced domestic production. China’s refinery runs eased from a record high in April as state-run refiners began regular maintenance and some independents cut output ahead of a regional summit.

2018-06-23,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German utility RWE (RWEG.DE) is earmarking 1.5 billion euros (1.3 billion pounds) a year for investments in green energy following a deal to break up its Innogy (IGY.DE) unit, its chief executive told a German newspaper. “After completion of the transaction we want to invest, and financially we can do so. We have 1.5 billion euros a year available for green energy then,” Rheinische Post on Saturday quoted Rolf Martin Schmitz as saying. RWE and E.ON (EONGn.DE) in March unveiled comprehensive plans to break up Innogy and divide its assets, turning RWE into Europe’s second-largest wind utility and E.ON into Europe’s largest operator of gas and power networks. The Innogy deal, which will take place in several steps due to its complex structure, is progressing well, Schmitz said. “We are in touch with the antitrust regulators of various countries and are fully on track. I expect that E.ON and RWE will receive all approvals in 2019 and the deal can be completed,” he told the paper. At the same time, RWE is looking at opportunities to build or buy power plants, he said, but added that RWE was not interested in any of local utility Steag’s plants. Commenting on German government efforts to decide on the timetable for a withdrawal from coal as an energy source, Schmitz warned against trying to exit by 2030. “That cannot be done, even if renewable energy could cover 65 percent of power needs by then,” he said, saying that the investments necessary for such an early exit would be immense, and thousands of jobs could be at risk. “Our staff planning is geared toward maintaining open pit mining until the middle of the century,” he said. If the government does push for an earlier exit from coal, RWE is prepared to claim damages, he said.
