2018-04-07,"(Reuters) - The Keystone crude oil pipeline leak in November in rural South Dakota was nearly double the original estimate, making it one of the largest U.S. inland spills since 2010, a newspaper report on Saturday said. Robynn Tysver, a spokeswoman for Calgary-based TransCanada Corp, which owns the pipeline, told the Aberdeen American News some 9,700 barrels of oil leaked in the Nov. 16 spill, the South Dakota paper reported. The original estimate was 5,000 barrels. The spill gave further ammunition to environmental groups and other U.S. opponents of another pipeline the company has proposed, the long-delayed Keystone XL. TransCanada had shut down the 590,000 barrel-per-day pipeline, one of Canada’s main crude export routes linking Alberta’s oil fields to U.S. refineries, immediately following the spill. Operations were restarted less than two weeks later. TransCanada officials were not immediately available for comment. The TransCanada spokeswoman told the newspaper repairs have been made on the pipeline and a clean-up conducted. “We have replaced the last of the topsoil and have seeded the impacted area,” Tysver said in an email sent to the American News late Friday evening, the paper said. Keystone has leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the United States than the company indicated to regulators in risk assessments before operations began in 2010, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.

2018-04-07,"WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel is investigating Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt’s use of a condominium tied to an energy lobbyist, a House Republican aide said on Saturday. The House of Representatives Oversight Committee, chaired by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, has begun looking into Pruitt’s housing arrangements, according to the aide, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The EPA had no immediate comment. The panel’s probe adds to the pressure on Pruitt, a vocal critic of mainstream climate change science who sued the EPA more than a dozen times when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general. Many Democrats and even a few Republicans have said should resign or be fired. Lawmakers have been scrutinizing Pruitt for renting a room in a high-end townhouse co-owned by the wife of energy industry lobbyist Steven Hart for $50 a night, an arrangement that has drawn fire from ethics experts. Media reports say the payment is less than one-third the price of similar properties. Hart lobbies for companies regulated by the EPA. Pruitt is also under fire for frequent first-class air travel and for purchasing costly items for his office, including a soundproof telephone booth. “I don’t have a lot of patience with that kind of stuff,” Gowdy said of Pruitt in a video released by the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “You’ve just got to be a good steward of public services.” As part of the committee’s investigation, the EPA has produced documents, including a memo from the EPA ethics office that initially cleared Pruitt of accepting a gift from a lobbyist but did not address whether he broke other federal ethics regulations. An administration official said Pruitt met with President Donald Trump on Friday morning, a week after White House Chief of Staff John Kelly advocated for Trump to fire him. Trump told reporters on Thursday that he would take a look into ethics allegations against Pruitt but added the official was doing a “fantastic job.” (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Sandra Maler)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-pruitt/u-s-house-panel-investigating-pruitts-condo-rental-idUKL1N1RK09Y,07 Apr 2018,"A U.S. congressional panel

2018-04-07,"(Corrects spelling of interviewee’s name in 10th paragraph) By Gwladys Fouche OSLO, April 7 (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund should be allowed to invest in unlisted renewable projects such as solar parks and wind farms, the ruling Conservative party voted on Saturday. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, which invests Norway’s oil and gas revenues in stocks, bonds and real estate, has for many years sought permission to invest in unlisted infrastructure assets. “Let the fund invest in unlisted infrastructure for renewable energy with the same demand for profitability as for other investments,” said the motion. The decision strengthens the possibility the fund could invest in the new asset class as the Conservatives are the leading party in Norway’s minority coalition government. The other parties are the right-wing Progress Party and the centrist, pro-green Liberals. “Opening for infrastructure gives the fund the possibility to diversify, which will be good for the fund, Tina Bru, a Conservative lawmaker who voted in favour, told Reuters. “In addition it is a good bonus that it will contribute towards a shift to a low-carbon society, which must happen globally if we are to achieve climate targets.” Bru said the Conservatives had also voted in favour of a motion that said the government “should consider whether to let the fund invest in unlisted infrastructure and unlisted firms, with the same demand for transparency, return and risk as for other investments.” The fund’s management is allowed to invest in unlisted firms that are imminently seeking stock exchange listing. It has complained in the past that it was missing good opportunities because it could not invest in them at an earlier stage. “This move by the ruling Conservatives will act as a strong signal to other investors and sovereign funds, from London and New York to Tokyo and Seoul,” Paul Fisher, a former director of the Bank of England who is Senior Associate at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, told Reuters. “This prudent Conservative Party decision is a major turning point which should now pave the way for the Parliament to instruct the fund to enter and profit from the trillion dollar unlisted renewable infrastructure market,” said Tom Sanzillo, Director of Finance for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Finance Minister Siv Jensen will present a white paper on the fund on Tuesday. She has in the past rejected the possibility to allow the fund to invest in unlisted infrastructure as a whole, not just for renewables, citing political risk. “Now Parliament needs to follow up. I can’t see any good reasons why the (finance) ministry should come to a different conclusion,” Martin Norman, the head of Greenpeace Nordic’s Sustainable Finance Campaign, told Reuters.

2018-04-07,"(Fixes typo in lead, changes to “been” from “by”) By Gopal Sharma KATHMANDU, April 7 (Reuters) - India agreed on Saturday to construct a rail link to Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, and to open up inland waterways in the landlocked Himalayan nation that has also been courted by China with transport deals. The agreement emerged at the end of talks in New Delhi between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Nepali counterpart K.P. Sharma Oli, making his first foreign visit to India after returning to power earlier this year. During his earlier tenure, Oli sealed deals with Beijing in 2016 to use Chinese roads and ports, seeking to reduce Nepal’s dependence on India for trade and transit. The planned railway line from the border town of Raxaul to Kathmandu would be the mountainous nation’s most ambitious railway project. Nepal currently only has rail links on its southern plains. “As a first step...India would carry out preparatory survey work within one year,” a joint statement after the talks said, to finalise the details of the line. Nepali officials say they are already in talks with China over an extension of the Chinese railway network into Nepal from Tibet as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative that Nepal joined last year. Analysts said the latest Indian move was spurred by China’s expansive infrastructure projects in Nepal as both Asian giants jostle for influence. The plan to develop inland waterways will give Nepali cargo additional access to sea and boost its trade, officials said.

2018-04-07,"(Adds data on Surgutneftegaz) MOSCOW, April 7 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed major sanctions against 24 Russians, striking at allies of President Vladimir Putin over Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity”. Below are the most prominent businessmen targeted along with their main assets and connections as well as extracts from the U.S. Treasury statement. OLEG DERIPASKA, main owner of En+, co-owner of Rusal and Norilsk Nickel Deripaska is ranked by Forbes magazine as Russia’s 19th richest businessman with a net worth of $6.7 billion. Deripaska holds regular meetings with Putin, invested heavily in Russia’s 2014 Sochi winter Olympics, and has said his own interests are indivisible from the state’s. En+ has a 48 percent stake in Rusal, one of the world’s largest aluminium producers. Rusal is listed in Hong Kong and counts Glencore among its shareholders. Rusal has assets in Italy, Ireland, Sweden, as well as Nigeria, Guyana, Guinea, and a stake in Australian QAL, the world’s top alumina refinery. Over 10 percent of Rusal’s total sales go to the United States. “Oleg Deripaska is being designated ... for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as ... for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.” VIKTOR VEKSELBERG, key owner of Renova holding group Forbes magazine ranks Vekselberg as Russia’s ninth richest businessman with a net worth of $14.4 billion. He is famous for bringing back a collection of Faberge eggs to Russia. Apart from Russia, Renova has assets in the United States and Europe, of which the most notable are stakes in the Swiss companies Sulzer, Schmolz+Bickenbach and Oerlikon. They are not under sanctions. Vekselberg and his partners also have a stake in Rusal , which supplies aluminium to the United States and other countries. “Viktor Vekselberg is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Vekselberg is the founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Renova Group.” KIRILL SHAMALOV, minority shareholder with petrochemical company Sibur Shamalov married Putin’s youngest daughter Katerina in February 2013, multiple sources who were at the wedding told Reuters. After the marriage, he swiftly grew his wealth through investments in Russia’s biggest petrochemical company Sibur. Unconfirmed media reports say Shamalov and Putin’s daughter have since split. Forbes magazine says Shamalov is Russia’s 72nd richest businessman with a net worth of $1.4 billion. Shamalov now owns 3.9 pct in Sibur. Gennady Timchenko, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin, holds a stake in the company as well. Sibur is not under sanctions. “Kirill Shamalov is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Shamalov married Putin’s daughter Katerina Tikhonova in February 2013 and his fortunes drastically improved following the marriage.” ANDREI SKOCH, a deputy in the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament Forbes magazine says Skoch is Russia’s 23rd wealthiest businessman with a net worth of $4.9 billion. Skoch’s father, Vladimir, owns a stake in USM holding. Businessman Alisher Usmanov is a key shareholder in USM. Neither Usmanov nor USM are under sanctions. Via USM, Skoch’s father co-owns Metalloinvest, Russia’s largest and the world’s second-largest mining company by the size of iron ore reserves, with units in Ireland, Switzerland and Guinea. USM also has stakes in Megafon, Russia’s second largest mobile operator, in MAIL.RU Group, one of Russia’s largest internet companies, and in Russian social networks VKontakte and Odnoklassniki. USM also has stakes in Alibaba, JD.com, Xiaomi, Uber, Spotify, Airbnb, Zalando, Flipkart, Ola Cabs, Didi Chuxing, ZocDoc and Klarna. “Andrei Skoch is being designated for being an official of the Government of the Russian Federation. Skoch is a deputy of the Russian Federation’s State Duma.” SULEIMAN KERIMOV, member of the Russian upper house of parliament Kerimov is ranked by Forbes magazine as Russia’s 20th wealthiest businessman, with a net worth of $6.4 billion. Embroiled in a tax fraud investigation in France, the Kremlin has said it will do all it can to help him. Polyus, Russia’s largest gold producer, is controlled by Kerimov’s family.  Polyus is not under sanctions. “Suleiman Kerimov is being designated for being an official of the Government of the Russian Federation. Kerimov is a member of the Russian Federation Council.” VLADIMIR BOGDANOV, chief executive of oil company Surgutneftegaz Forbes magazine puts Bogdanov’s net worth at $1.8 billion, making him Russia’s 53rd wealthiest businessman. Siberia’s Surgut sits on Russia’s biggest corporate cash pile, with bank deposits and cash totalling 2.2 trillion roubles ($38 billion) in 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on its regulatory filings. The company is owned by its employees, according to official data. Gennady Timchenko, a friend of Putin who is under U.S. sanctions, said in a 2012 interview with Forbes magazine that Surgut was trading oil through Timchenko’s trading companies. Surgutneftegaz is already under sanctions. “Vladimir Bogdanov is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Bogdanov is the Director General and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Surgutneftegaz, a vertically integrated oil company operating in Russia.” IGOR ROTENBERG, son of Arkady Rotenberg, Putin’s former judo partner Forbes magazine says Igor Rotenberg is Russia’s 93rd richest businessman and worth $1.1 billion. Arkady Rotenberg and his brother Boris Rotenberg are already under sanctions due to their close connections to Putin whom they have known since they practised judo together in St Petersburg in Putin’s younger days. Arkady Rotenberg is now overseeing the construction of a bridge Putin has championed to Russia-annexed Crimea. “Igor Rotenberg is being designated for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Rotenberg acquired significant assets from his father, Arkady Rotenberg, after OFAC designated the latter in March 2014. Specifically Arkady Rotenberg sold Igor Rotenberg 79 percent of the Russian oil and gas drilling company Gazprom Burenie.” DESIGNATED OLIGARCH-OWNED COMPANIES Companies from Deripaska’s business empire: B-Finance Ltd, Basic Element, EN+ Group, EuroSibEnergo, Rusal, Russian Machines, GAZ Group, Agroholding Kuban Companies from Igor Rotenberg’s business empire: Gazprom Burenie, which provides oil and gas exploration services in Russia and NPV Engineering Shamalov’s Ladoga Menedzhment which is engaged in deposit banking Vekselberg’s Renova Group DESIGNATED RUSSIAN STATE-OWNED FIRMS Rosoboroneksport and the Russian Financial Corporation Bank which is owned by Rosoboroneksport Andrey Akimov, chairman of the board at Gazprombank Andrey Kostin, president of VTB bank *Alexey Miller, chief executive of Gazprom Mikhail Fradkov, president of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies Sergey Fursenko, member of the board of directors of Gazprom Neft Oleg Govorun, head of the Presidential Directorate for Social and Economic Cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States Member Countries Alexey Dyumin, the governor of the Tula region Vladimir Kolokoltsev, the minister of internal affairs Konstantin Kosachev, the chairperson of the council of the Federation Committee on Foreign Affairs Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council Vladislav Reznik, member of the Russian State Duma Evgeniy Shkolov, an aide to the President Vladimir Putin Alexander Torshin, deputy governor of the central bank Vladimir Ustinov, the plenipotentiary envoy to Russia’s Southern Federal District Timur Valiulin, the head of the General Administration for Combating Extremism within Russia’s Interior Ministry Alexander Zharov, the head of Roskomnadzor Viktor Zolotov, the director of the Federal Service of National Guard Troops and Commander of the National Guard Troops *Gazprom’s key European partners include OMV, Engie, Uniper, Royal Dutch Shell, BASF, E.ON, Eni, Gasunie, as well as Turkey’s Botas, China’s CNPC, Japan’s Mitsui and Mitsubishi, among others. **Data from OFAC, public interviews, companies information $1 = 58.1400 roubles

2018-04-07,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A powerful 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck the highlands of Papua New Guinea on Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, as the region struggles to recover from a massive 7.5 quake only two months ago. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury. The quake was 82 kms (51 miles) southwest of Porgera in Enga province and 47 kms (30 miles) deep, said the USGS. Earlier European quake monitor EMSC reported it at 6.5 magnitude and only two kms (1.2 miles) deep, but later scaled it down. The earthquake happened just two months after a 7.5 quake struck the same highlands area, killing 125 people and leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless. February’s quake also damaged mining and power infrastructure and led ExxonMobil Corp to shut its $19 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, the country’s biggest export earner. Miners Barrick Gold Corp and Ok Tedi Mining also reported damage to infrastructure. Some of the resource companies in the region, such as Oil Search, are still about eight weeks away from full operations. Oil production at the Gobe field had already returned to normal. The remote and mountainous region is struggling to recover from February’s quake, which caused landslides that buried homes and cuts roads. The United Nations estimates that some 270,000 people are in need of immediate assistance and 43,116 people remain displaced in 44 locations and care centers. The United Nations pulled out its aid workers just two days before the latest quake due to violence from residents. They have vowed to return once it is safe to do so. Quakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.

2018-04-07,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Saudi Aramco on Saturday is expected to disclose initial steps toward a multibillion-dollar chemical plant in Texas, according to sources familiar with the company’s U.S. operations. Saudi Aramco has been weighing an expansion of its U.S. subsidiary Motiva Enterprises LLC’s [MOTIV.UL] Port Arthur, Texas refinery, already the largest in the United States by capacity.  But Motiva wants to first move into petrochemicals, using abundant natural gas from U.S. shale fields to make the precursors for plastics, the sources said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott is expected to attend an event in Houston on Saturday where Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser are to discuss the plans, according to a Saudi Aramco representative. “Motiva is actively exploring a number of opportunities as part of its growth strategy,” the company said on Friday. “These opportunities include locations where we currently operate as well as new ones.” Saudi Aramco last year said it would invest $18 billion in Motiva’s Port Arthur refinery, which can process up to 603,000 barrels of crude oil per day (bpd). Motiva wants to add an ethane cracker near its refinery that could produce more than 1.5 million tons of ethylene a year, the sources said.  Saturday’s announcement will also include an agreement with TechnipFMC (FTI.N) for a study of producing materials used in gasoline and industrial solvents, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Motiva Chief Executive Brian Coffman last month said the company had yet to win approval for its major expansion projects. Other U.S. companies, including Chevron Phillips Chemical Co [CHEPH.UL] - a joint venture of Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) - and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), have recently have opened plants to process ethane into ethylene. Chevron Phillips is considering building a second ethane cracker on the Gulf Coast of Texas.  The price tag for a large ethane cracker is typically over $6 billion, according to Steve Lewandowski, vice president of Global Olefins at researcher IHS Markit.  “Ethane crackers make a lot of hydrogen which refiners can use in hydrocrackers and hydrotreaters” to make motor fuels, Lewandowski said. Exxon is separately proposing to build with another Aramco unit, Saudi Basic Industries Corp 2010.SE, a $9 billion petrochemical plant near Corpus Christi, that would process ethane. Refiners see petrochemicals as a new market as demand for motor fuels is expected to plateau later in the century, said Sandeep Sayal, vice president, downstream energy research at IHS Markit. “Refinery industry growth is fairly subdued,” Sayal added.

2018-04-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) has won a closely watched contest to supply 47 new 787 Dreamliner jets to American Airlines (AAL.O), beating European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) for the highly coveted order of widebody, long-haul aircraft. “This was a difficult decision between the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 and A330neo and we thank both manufacturers for their aggressive efforts to earn more of American’s business. In the end, our goal to simplify our fleet made the 787 a more compelling choice,” American Airlines President Robert Isom said in a statement. The deal, at a list price of more than $12 billion, is the latest in a series of blows to the Airbus A330neo. It comes just weeks after Hawaiian Airlines [HAII.UL] dropped an order for six Airbus A330-800neo jets in favor of the 787, leaving that variant of long-haul A330neo with no customers.  “This new order is a powerful endorsement of the 787 family’s unique passenger appeal and unmatched ability to help airlines open new routes and grow profitably,” Boeing Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a statement. Reuters had previously reported that Boeing was primed to emerge triumphant in the hard-fought widebody contest, bringing along in its victory engine maker General Electric (GE.N), whose engines are expected to power the Boeing aircraft. As part of the deal, American and Boeing have reached an agreement to defer the delivery of 40 737 narrowbody jets previously scheduled to arrive between 2020 and 2022 to “better align with planned retirements of other narrowbody aircraft.” Reporting by Alana Wise and Tim Hepher; editing by G Crosse and Rosalba O'Brien",https://uk.reuters.com/article/american-airline-boeing/update-2-boeing-wins-american-airlines-widebody-jet-order-idUKL2N1RJ277,07 Apr 2018,"Boeing Co has won a

2018-04-07,"SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Shares of Brazil’s biggest utility, Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6.SA), fell more than 8 percent in Sao Paulo on Friday after news of a shakeup at the Mines and Energy Ministry that could threaten a government plan to privatize the company. The decline in shares of Eletrobras, as the company is known, wiped nearly $1 billion off its market capitalization. Paulo Pedrosa, second in charge at the ministry, decided to step down from his post, a source familiar with the decision told Reuters, adding to upheaval on the day that Minister Fernando Coelho Filho is stepping down to run for the Congress. Pedrosa, an experienced technocrat, had been seen as a likely replacement for Coelho Filho, according to analysts. He has been leading efforts to overhaul electricity sector rules and played a key role in government plans to privatize state-controlled Eletrobras. Gustavo Miele, an analyst with the equity research team at investment bank Itau BBA, said Pedrosa’s departure was negative. “We believe that Mr. Pedrosa would be one of the best names to replace Mr. Coelho Filho in the Ministry of Mines and Energy,” he said in a note. “The announcement has a relevant impact on Eletrobras’ capitalization. We believe that this process strongly depends, among other points, on a pro-market name taking over the ministry,” Miele said in a note to clients. The ministry later confirmed that Pedrosa was leaving. Fernando Coelho Filho is one of a dozen cabinet ministers who are leaving the government to run in the October general election. Coelho Filho had brought Pedrosa and a team of officials with technical profiles to the ministry, many with experience in private-sector power companies, which improved investors’ outlook for the sector.  Another source told Reuters on Friday that Moreira Franco, the secretary of the presidency and a leading figure in the governing Brazilian Democratic Movement party, is a top candidate to take over the ministry. The Eletrobras privatization has faced opposition from several politicians, including members of the MDB, and the prospect of a person with a strong political profile taking over the energy post is seen as negative by investors.
