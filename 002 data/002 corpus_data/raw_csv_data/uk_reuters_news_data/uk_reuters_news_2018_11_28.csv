2018-11-28,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Far-right president-elect Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday that he pushed the Brazilian government to withdraw its offer to host the United Nations climate conference next year, maintaining that Brazil’s sovereignty over the Amazon was at stake. Bolsonaro, in Brasilia planning his government’s transition for when he takes power on Jan. 1, told reporters that “I participated in the decision” - announced earlier Wednesday by the Foreign Ministry, which cited high costs.  “I told my future foreign minister to avoid hosting this event here in Brazil,” Bolsonaro said. The next foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, has said climate change was part of a plot against western economic growth. Bolsonaro has threatened to follow the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump and yank Brazil out of the Paris climate agreement, which was the reason, along with high cost, Bolsonaro gave for not wanting to host the November 2019 conference. “The ‘Triple A’ is at play in that accord,” Bolsonaro said. “What is the ‘Triple A’? It’s a big strip between the Andes, Amazon and Atlantic ... that could result in our losing sovereignty over the area. The idea is to turn it into a ecological corridor.”  Last month, the Foreign Ministry announced Brazil’s offer to host the event in a press release, saying the meeting would work out final details of the Paris agreement and for signatory countries to fully implement its demands by 2020. Hosting the event would have confirmed Brazil’s “role as a world leader on sustainable development issues, especially in relation to climate change.”   Brazil, which has 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest within its borders, a biome scientists consider one of nature’s best defenses against global warming as it acts as a giant carbon sink, has made significant strides in the past 15 years to curtail destruction of the jungle.  However, Brazil’s government reported last week that annual deforestation levels had hit their highest level in a decade. The environmental group Observatorio da Clima said on its website that the decision to withdraw its offer to host the event is “not the first and will not be the last awful news from Jair Bolsonaro on this theme.”  Bolsonaro had also sought to combine the environmental and agricultural ministries but later retreated from that proposal.

2018-11-28,"LONDON, Nov 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rising heat and wilder weather linked to climate change make it “the biggest global health threat of the 21st century”, with hundreds of millions more people already suffering in the last two decades, medical officials warned Wednesday. In a hard-hitting report published by The Lancet medical journal, scientists and health experts said climate change impacts - from heatwaves to worsening storms, floods and fires - were surging and threatened to overwhelm health systems. “That’s the thing that really keeps me up at night,” said Nick Watts, executive director of The Lancet Countdown, an annual report tracking connections between public health and climate change. Storms and floods, for instance, do not only cause direct injuries but can also shut down hospitals, spur disease outbreaks and produce lingering mental health problems, as people lose their homes, he said. Wildfires, similarly, hurt and uproot people, but also dramatically worsen air pollution in broad areas. California’s recent wildfires, spurred by drought, have cost more than 80 lives but have also polluted air as far east as Massachusetts, said Gina McCarthy, a former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency now at Harvard University’s public health school. Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington, said multiple climate change-related health impacts were often hitting at once. “We see them coming at communities all at the same time,” she said. The Lancet report, produced by doctors, academics and policy experts from 27 organisations around the world, called for fast action to curb climate change and prepare global health systems for growing challenges. “A rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life, exposing vulnerable populations to extremes of weather, altering patterns of infectious disease and compromising food security, safe drinking water and clean air,” it warned. Already, 157 million more people worldwide were exposed to heatwaves last year than in 2000, according to the report. Hotter weather led to the loss of 153 billion hours of labour in 2017, a 60 percent jump from 2000, as workers in construction, farming and other industries downed tools, often squeezing family income. In India, heat caused the number of hours worked to fall by almost 7 percent in 2017, Watts said. Richer countries also are seeing the effects of heat, the report noted. Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, for instance, appear more vulnerable than Africa and Southeast Asia, it said. That is largely because so many older people - who are particularly at risk - live in cities which trap heat and can be hotter than surrounding areas, the report said. England and Wales, for instance, saw 700 more deaths than normal during a 15-day hot spell in June and July this year, Watts said. Renee Salas, an emergency room doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital in the United States and an author of the report, said she recently treated a 30-year-old man felled by heatstroke while trying to work two construction jobs. “Keep in mind that for every statistic there is a personal story,” she urged. Such medical cases are the “often hidden human cost of climate change”, she added. Warmer conditions linked to climate change are enlarging the potential range of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever as well as other health threats, the report said. Since 1950, the Baltic region has seen a 24-percent increase in coastal areas suitable for cholera outbreaks, while in sub-Saharan Africa’s highlands, zones where malaria-carrying mosquitoes can survive have expanded by 27 percent. Hotter conditions may also be giving some disease-causing microbes greater resistance to antibiotics, Salas said. And higher temperatures seem to be curbing the maximum harvest from farmland in all regions of the world, reversing an earlier trend toward ever-larger harvests, the report noted. Ebi, of the University of Washington, said rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are shrinking nutrients in cereal crops, hiking the risk of malnutrition even for those who get enough to eat. Mental health threats, meanwhile - from children worried about their future in an overheating world to families stressed by disaster losses - are on the rise, she said. Acting swiftly to curb climate change - whether by switching to clean energy, or getting more people to walk and use bicycles - would lower healthcare costs by the same amount of money needed to reduce emissions, Ebi said. ""Most mitigation policies are good for health - and they're good for health now,"" she said. (Reporting by Laurie Goering @lauriegoering and Lin Taylor; editing by Megan Rowling.

2018-11-28,"(Repeats item published earlier with no changes to text.) * Saudi may overtake Russia as China’s top supplier in 2019 * To post first market share growth in China since 2012 * Hengli, Rongsheng to get up to 300,000 bpd Saudi oil * Likely to divert more oil from U.S. to Asia By Florence Tan, Chen Aizhu and Rania El Gamal SINGAPORE/BEIJING/DUBAI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is set to expand its market share in China this year for the first time since 2012, with demand stirred up by new Chinese refiners pushing the kingdom back into contention with Russia as top supplier to the world’s largest oil buyer. Saudi Arabia, the biggest global oil exporter, has been surpassed by Russia as top crude supplier to China the past two years as private “teapot” refiners and a new pipeline drove up demand for Russian oil. Now fresh demand from new refineries starting up in 2019 could increase China’s Saudi oil imports by between 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 700,000 bpd, nudging the OPEC kingpin back towards the top, analysts say. Saudi Aramco said last week it will sign five crude supply agreements that will take its 2019 contract totals with Chinese buyers to 1.67 million bpd. “With the recent crude oil supply agreements and potential increase of refinery capacity, the Saudis could overtake the Russians and reclaim (the) crown as the biggest crude exporter to China,” Rystad Energy analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu said. Saudi Arabia has already gained ground this year. China imported 1.04 million bpd of Saudi crude in the first 10 months of 2018, China customs data showed. This is equivalent to 11.5 percent of total Chinese imports, up from 11 percent in 2017, Reuters calculations showed. Saudi’s market share in China could jump to nearly 17 percent next year, if buyers requested full contractual volumes, analysts from Rystad Energy and Refinitiv said, while growth in Russian oil supply to China could slow. China imported 1.39 million bpd of Russian crude in January-October this year, about 15 percent of total Chinese imports, customs data showed. Russia had a 14 percent share at 1.2 million bpd in 2017. “We expect Chinese imports of Russian crude to remain at a similar rate in 2019 as a large share of these Russian barrels are imported via pipeline,” Refinitiv analyst Mark Tay said. The biggest boost to Saudi exports to China comes from contracts inked with new refineries starting up this year and next, owned by companies other than state oil giants Sinopec or PetroChina. The contracts include 130,000 bpd to Dalian Hengli Petrochemical and up to 170,000 bpd to Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp, each of which has a 400,000-bpd refinery. Saudi Aramco has also agreed to increase Sinochem Corp’s supplies, which will be processed at its Quanzhou and Hongrun refineries. Sinopec, PetroChina and China National Offshore Oil Corp have all kept their term Saudi volumes for next year unchanged. Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy expects Saudi crude imports to rise by just 300,000 bpd in 2019, raising its market share to 13.7 percent, but leaving it behind Russia. “We expect lower Saudi crude demand from Hengli and Rongsheng as it is unlikely for them to run their refineries at full rate in 2019,” analyst Seng Yick Tee said. Zhejiang Petrochemical is majority-owned by Rongsheng Holdings. Still, a source familiar with Aramco’s export plans said there is tremendous appetite from China’s independents, and that it needed to be more aggressive in its marketing strategy. The state oil company did move more swiftly to seal the most recent deals than it used to in the past, industry sources said. Aramco’s first deal with Hengli was to supply 20 million barrels of crude, about 55,000 bpd, in 2018, said a senior source with direct knowledge of the deal. “Hengli executed the 2018 deal nicely, which helped build trust,” he said. Hengli is designed to process 90 percent Saudi crude, a mix of Arab Medium and Arab Heavy, while the remaining 10 percent is Brazilian Marlim crude. Rongsheng’s plant is identical to Hengli, the industry sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Aramco is also supplying PetroChina’s refinery in China’s southwestern Yunnan province with about 4 million barrels a month of crude via a pipeline from Myanmar between July and November, Eikon data showed, although sources said talks for Saudi Arabia to acquire a stake in the refinery have stalled. Saudi Aramco’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser said on Monday the company will push to expand its market share in China and is still looking for new refining deals there despite OPEC’s likely limits on output next year. Saudi Aramco will supply up to 70 percent of the oil required at its 300,000-bpd joint venture refinery in Malaysia with Petronas. Between China and Malaysia alone, Saudi Arabia will have to increase exports to Asia by more than 500,000 bpd next year. This comes as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is discussing production cuts of as much as 1.4 million bpd for next year to prop up oil prices. Between balancing global supplies and increasing market in Asia, Aramco may decide to “forgo market share in other markets like the United States, where the surge in domestic production will make it difficult for the Saudis to retain market share anyway,” Rystad’s Rodriguez-Masiu said. Saudi’s oil shipments to the United States have risen recently to above 1 mln bpd, but U.S. output is also increasing, said the source familiar with Saudi Aramco’s export plans. “You need to lessen the inventories in the U.S.,” the source said, adding that Aramco will likely divert oil supply from the United States to Asia to meet rising demand there. A Chinese oil executive said: “China is where the demand growth is. The Saudis are very wise to capture this market.” Reporting by Florence Tan in SINGAPORE, Chen Aizhu in BEIJING

2018-11-28,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday ordered the U.S. Justice Department and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) to hold new talks with a court-appointed settlement master to try to settle the government’s civil suit over the Italian-American automaker’s diesel vehicle emissions. The Justice Department is seeking “substantial” civil fines from Fiat Chrysler in a suit filed in May 2017 accusing the company of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014. A person briefed on the matter said the government and Fiat Chrysler have reached agreement on almost all aspects of a  settlement after months of lengthy talks but remain “hundreds of millions of dollars” apart on how big the fines will be. In a written order, Judge Edward Chen directed both sides to “fully cooperate and communicate” with settlement master Ken Feinberg “in light of the delay in resolving the United States’ case.” Feinberg was ordered “to engage directly with the parties and employ his best effort in facilitating settlement negotiations, including terms of any monetary relief.” Feinberg has scheduled a new round of talks with all sides for Dec. 3 in Washington, the person briefed on the matter said. Feinberg declined to comment, saying Chen’s order speaks for itself. Fiat Chrysler had no immediate comment. U.S. and California regulators stepped up scrutiny of diesel vehicles after Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to illegally installing software in U.S. vehicles for years to evade emissions standards. VW has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving. The company has denied any wrongdoing and said there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules. Last month, the company set aside 713 million euros ($810 million) to cover potential costs related to the case. Reuters reported in February that a settlement offer sent to Fiat Chrysler lawyers by the Justice Department on Jan. 27 would require the company to offset excess pollution and take steps to prevent future excess emissions. The letter included language that a settlement must include very substantial civil penalties. The Justice Department has a separate ongoing criminal investigation into the excess emissions.

2018-11-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that benchmark U.S. interest rates were “just below” neutral sparked a sharp rally on Wall Street on Wednesday, easing investor worries about the pace of rate hikes by the U.S. central bank next year.  Hopes that the United States and China could call a trade war ceasefire at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina also boosted stocks around the globe.  Meanwhile, the dollar retreated with potentially fewer rate increases on the horizon, and sterling rose after the Bank of England said the British economy could shrink by as much as 8 percent in about a year after a no-deal Brexit. Equity investors reacted favorably to Powell’s comments, which indicated there may not be as many rate hikes from the Fed in the future as initially anticipated. “It’s certainly a change of language and welcome news to investors,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. “It makes the value of risk aversion less attractive so it makes risk taking, such as stock investments, more attractive.”  U.S. President Donald Trump has recently been critical of the Fed for raising rates.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 617.7 points, or 2.5 percent, to 25,366.43, the S&P 500 gained 61.61 points, or 2.30 percent, to 2,743.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 208.89 points, or 2.95 percent, to 7,291.59. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.01  percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.08 percent. Earlier, hopes for a U.S.-China truce on trade had also helped lift equities. Despite Trump’s tough remarks on the trade dispute ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, markets focused on comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who indicated the two countries could call a truce. Still, lingering caution that the two sides would leave the summit without an agreement capped gains in Europe, where auto stocks were under pressure after a report Trump may soon impose new import tariffs.     A rapprochement between the United States and China is seen as crucial, given that world growth and trade are already showing signs of an alarming slowdown. Uncertainty over global trade as well as Brexit and Italy’s conflict with the European Union had supported the U.S. dollar, but the dollar index dipped 0.53 percent after Powell’s comments. Gold prices, which move inversely to the dollar, rose as much as 1 percent from two-week lows. The euro was up 0.7 percent to $1.1367. Sterling , meanwhile, gained 0.6 percent after the Bank of England warned about the economic risks from Britain exiting the European Union without a deal. It said Britain risks suffering an even bigger hit to its economy than during the global financial crisis 10 years ago if it leaves the EU in a worst-case Brexit scenario.  “Our job is not to hope for the best but to prepare for the worst,” BoE Governor Mark Carney said. Some market participants took the remarks as a good sign. “I think he’s assuaging fears, saying that they’re willing to do anything they need to do,” said Michael Skordeles, U.S. macro strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta, regarding the bank’s response to Brexit.  U.S. government bond prices were mixed following the Fed chair’s speech. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 3.0608 percent, from 3.057 percent late Tuesday. The 30-year bond last fell 17/32 in price to yield 3.3484 percent, from 3.32 percent. U.S. crude oil futures settled down $1.27, or 2.5 percent, at $50.29 a barrel, the lowest since Oct. 9, 2017 after U.S. crude inventories rose for a 10th straight week to the highest in a year.

2018-11-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 2.5 percent on Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories rose for the 10th straight week to the highest in a year, adding to worries about a worldwide supply glut. Selling picked up just prior to the market’s settlement, extending a sell-off that has cut prices by more than 30 percent since the beginning of October.  U.S. crude CLc1 settled down $1.27, or 2.5 percent, at $50.29 a barrel, its lowest since Oct. 9, 2017. Brent crude LCOc1 ended $1.45, or 2.4 percent, lower at $58.76 a barrel.  U.S. crude stockpiles USOILC=ECI rose 3.6 million barrels last week, exceeding expectations, to the most in year at 450 million barrels. After falling to 2-1/2-year lows in September, crude stocks have risen 14 percent with 10 straight weeks of increases. [EIA/S] The steady build in U.S. crude stocks is partly due to seasonal refining maintenance, but domestic production also has surged to a record 11.7 million barrels per day.  “It’s hard to get more bearish after this report after we wiped out more than 30 percent of our value in the last two months,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  The market briefly pared some losses after a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said risks to the U.S. economy are relatively balanced, suggesting the pace of interest-rate hikes may slow in coming months. That bolstered the stock market, but oil’s rally didn’t last. [.N]     “Oil tried to latch onto the stock market excitement but at the end of the day the selling pressure came in. What that tells you is that there are many people who are still bearish on oil,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Investors have sold oil over worries about slowing economic growth and Washington’s decision to grant several waivers to importers of Iranian oil after re-imposing sanctions on that nation. Crude’s drop since October is on a par with the 2008 price crash and steeper than that of 2014-2015, both of which prompted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree output curbs to support the market. The market remains nervous over whether OPEC-led producing countries, including Russia, will reach another deal when they meet on Dec. 6. Producers are discussing a supply cut of 1 million to 1.4 million bpd and possibly more, OPEC delegates have told Reuters..  Saudi Arabia said it would not cut output alone and Nigeria stopped short of committing to a new push to curb supplies.

2018-11-28,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s latest policy to boost biofuels use has improved the outlook for ethanol production and should attract new investment in plants, BP Plc’s (BP.L) chief executive for biofuels, Mario Lindenhayn, said on Wednesday. Brazil is advancing with additional regulation for the policy, called RenovaBio and expected to be enacted in 2020, Lindenhayn said, adding that he does not see signs that the government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, which kicks off in January, would put up obstacles. “We are very positive. This is a very important signal the country is giving, creating a stable regulatory environment that will allow companies to invest,” Lindenhayn told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy presentation at the company’s corporate office in Sao Paulo. RenovaBio will mandate fuel distributors to gradually increase the amount of biofuels they sell. The programme aims to double the use of ethanol by 2030 from around 26 billion litres currently. The programme also targets increases for other renewables such as biodiesel. BP has three ethanol mills in Brazil, crushing 10 million tonnes of sugar cane per year. It formed a venture last year with Brazil’s Copersucar, a leading global ethanol seller, to jointly operate one of the largest fuel terminals in the country located in Paulínia, in Sao Paulo state. Lindenhayn said the programme provides an opportunity for mills in Brazil, which have experienced stagnation caused by years of low sugar prices and a long period of subsidized gasoline prices that led to the closure of many firms.  “If the programme advances as planned, it will be a large opportunity. There are no greenfield projects around, and the country is a net fuel importer,” he said. Asked if BP would be interested in increasing ethanol capacity via acquisitions, since there are several assets being offered in Brazil by companies with financial difficulties, Lindenhayn said: “We will see, we will consider.”  On Wednesday, Brazilian oil and fuels regulator ANP published in the official gazette another part of RenovaBio complementary legislation, with rules for biofuel companies to obtain certification. With that, the plants will be able to issue and trade emissions reductions credits, called CBios, that fuel distributors could buy to comply with targets in case they fall short. It would be Brazil’s first emissions reductions market, although limited to the fuels industry.

2018-11-28,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru state oil company Petroperu said approximately 8,000 barrels of crude oil had spilled in the Amazon after vandals severed the pipeline and then impeded technicians seeking to repair the damaged pipe. The pipe began to spill oil on Tuesday night after sabotage by members of the Mayuriaga indigenous community in the Loreto region of the Amazon, Petroperu said in a statement. “The townspeople prevented us from securing the pipe to stop petroleum from spilling from the pipe,” said Beatriz Alva Hart, a Petroperu spokeswoman in an interview with local radio station RPP. Mayuriaga community leaders could not be immediately located for comment. The pipeline, which transports crude from oil fields in the Peruvian Amazon to Petroperu´s refinery on the Pacific coast, has suffered repeated attacks by vandals over the past two years. Petroperu said in the statement it had previously warned authorities that the community had threatened to attack that stretch of pipeline in protest of recent municipal election results in the district. “It’s an issue that has nothing to do with our company,” Alva Hart said later in the radio interview. Since 2016, more than 20,000 barrels of petroleum have spilled from the critical Peruvian oil pipeline in 15 attacks, and 5,600 barrels have sprung leaks because of corrosion or operative failures, data from environmental regulator OEFA showed.

Some market participants took the remarks as a good sign. “I think he’s assuaging fears, saying that they’re willing to do anything they need to do,” said Michael Skordeles, U.S. macro strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta, regarding the bank’s response to Brexit. “That’s helping global markets generally.” U.S. government bond prices were mixed following the Fed chair’s speech.

2018-11-28,"CHICAGO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Prices for U.S. ethanol fell to the lowest levels in 13 years on Wednesday, pressured by bigger-than-expected output and larger supplies of the corn-based biofuel, traders said. Weekly U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed that ethanol production last week was up 6,000 barrels per day, to an average of 1.048 million bpd while stockpiles increased 139,000 barrels to 22.93 million barrels. Some traders had anticipated a decline in output, as many producers were struggling to make money due to low ethanol prices and comparatively higher costs for the corn and natural gas necessary to make it. “With all the talks of slowdowns, the market expected to see continual drops in production but they haven’t materialized, and margins have taken a further beating,” an ethanol trader said. In the physical market, shipments in Chicago fetched $1.15 per gallon, the lowest since June of 2005, traders said. Chicago Board of Trade ethanol futures dropped to a low of $1.215 cents per gallon in midday trading on Wednesday, before trimming losses slightly to $1.218, a decline of 0.004 cent. Excessive supplies and heavy selling in the Chicago market have weighed on ethanol prices for much of 2018. Waivers issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for refiners to be exempt from federal laws mandating biofuel to be blended into the U.S. gasoline supply have also pressured ethanol makers. President Donald Trump’s administration has temporality halted the EPA waiver program, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, prompting ethanol fuel credits to rise on Wednesday.

2018-11-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is still committed to the NordStream 2 pipeline, which will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine in transporting gas to Europe, despite escalating tension in the region, a government spokesman in Berlin said on Wednesday. The United States and others have stepped up criticism of the project since Russia seized three Ukrainian ships near Crimea on Sunday. Critics say the pipeline will make Germany and Europe too dependent on Russia for its energy supplies. “I have taken note of the criticism but nothing has changed in the basic view of the economic project which is what NordStream is,” said German government spokesman Steffen Seibert. He added that Germany still wanted to ensure Ukraine would remain a transit country for gas from Russia to Europe. Earlier, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany had said NordStream 2 should be put on hold. Government officials later said that Chancellor Angela Merkel would discuss the latest tensions in Ukraine with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in meetings at the margins of this week’s G20 summit in Buenos Aires. The United States wants its European allies to consider further sanctions against Russia, the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations said on Wednesday. Several senior European politicians on Tuesday also raised the possibility of new sanctions against Russia to punish it for capturing the Ukrainian vessels, an incident the West fears could ignite a wider conflict.     But a spokesman for the German foreign ministry said the debate about further sanctions was premature.  “It’s a legal instrument that has consequences for those who are affected by the sanctions so that means you need to consider and discuss it carefully,” said the spokesman.

2018-11-28,"PARIS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - French steel pipe maker Vallourec plans to cut jobs in France and Germany to reduce costs and its heavy debt burden, French weekly business magazine Challenges said on Wednesday. The report said around 1,800 jobs, 1,200 at three sites in France, and 600 in Germany, could be affected by the cost-cutting measure. A spokesman for the company declined to comment. The company, which supplies the oil and gas industry, has struggled to recover since oil prices crashed in 2015. In its third quarter results on Nov. 15, the company said it was continuing its transformation plan and was generating significant cost reductions, but did not give details. S&P Global Ratings said on Nov. 21 that although it expected Vallourec’s performance to continue to improve in the coming quarters, it believed this will happen at a slower pace than previously anticipated. S&P lowered Vallourec’s rating to “B-“ from “B” with a negative outlook. “The negative outlook reflects that we may further lower the rating over the next three to 12 months if improvement in Vallourec’s quarterly profits stalls following setbacks in the company’s cost reduction programs,” it said. As of Sept. 30, the company had reported net debt of 2.1 billion euros ($2.37 billion), the ratings agency said, adding that Vallourec’s key weakness remains its high cost position, notably in European assets. Vallourec said after the rating announcement that its liquidity situation was sound. The company’s shares are down 56.6 percent year-to-date. $1 = 0.8861 euros

While President Donald Trump talked tough on the trade tariffs issue ahead of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, markets focused on comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who held open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal. A rapprochement is seen as crucial, given that world growth and trade are already showing signs of an alarming slowdown. Kudlow’s comments allowed Chinese and Japanese shares to rally 1 percent  while MSCI’s all-country equity index was up 0.15 percent and the pan-European benchmark rose 0.2 percent. Futures indicated a firm opening on Wall Street, with the S&P500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones tipped to rise between 0.3-0.5 percent  . There was some caution, however, especially in Europe, which was hit on Tuesday by a report that Trump may soon decide about new taxes on imported cars. Europe’s auto sector shares were 0.3 percent in the red. “An expectation is being priced into markets ahead of the G20 meeting that we will see some deal or at least a framework for a deal between Trump and Xi Jinping,” said Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Swiss-based Woodman Asset Management. “But if they come out with nothing this weekend, it’s going to be very bad.” The uncertainty over global trade as well as Brexit and Italy’s conflict with the European Union, are supporting the U.S. dollar, which is at a two-week high against a basket of currencies. While the main driver for the greenback is the U.S. interest rate path, Rodrigo Catril, senior strategist at National Australia Bank, said it was also benefiting from the uncertain mood. “Markets seem to be jumping at shadows at the moment and against this backdrop of uncertainty, the dollar remains the preferred option for weathering the storm,” Catril said. With the currency index approaching 1-1/2-year highs reached earlier this month, traders are focusing on a speech at 1700 GMT by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to see if he offers clues on how many more times the Fed could raise interest rates. While Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida took a less dovish stance on Tuesday than some had expected and backed more rate rises, Powell and his colleagues have in recent weeks alluded to global volatility, leading many to speculate the bank’s three-year-long rate rise campaign could pause in 2019. . However most reckon the Fed is on track to tighten policy in December and early-2019 at least. “My base case is the dollar will strengthen versus the euro and pound into year-end, as the euro zone and Britain are both struggling with their own problems — Brexit and Italy,” Woodman’s Berg said. Sterling climbed off two-week lows to rise 0.4 percent by 1215 GMT, having touched a session-high of $1.2806 after the opposition’s main finance spokesman John McDonnell said he could accept a second Brexit referendum. Against the euro it rose half a percent to touch a high of 88.105 pence McDonnell’s comments raise hopes that the Labour Party will more firmly back putting the Brexit issue to a second vote, should Prime Minister Theresa May fail to convince sceptical lawmakers of the benefits of her Brexit deal ahead of a December 11 parliamentary vote. Investors are monitoring developments in Italy’s row with the EU over its budget spending, with Germany’s Handelsblatt and Italy’s La Stampa quoting EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis as saying the draft budget needed “substantial correction”. Italian bond yields flatlined after sharp rallies that were triggered by what appeared to be a more conciliatory stance from the government over the issue. On other markets, cryptocurrency bitcoin jumped 6 percent to above $4,000, extending its rebound from a low of $3,475 touched on Sunday.

2018-11-28,"ABUJA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will not cut oil output on its own to stabilize the market, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday as Nigeria and Russia said it is too early to signal whether they would join any production curbs. Oil producer group OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, meet in Vienna next week against the backdrop of concerns over a slowing global economy and rising oil supplies from the United States, which is not involved in an existing agreement to restrain output. The negative economic outlook helped to push oil LCOc1 below $60 a barrel this week from as high as $85 in October, prompting Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), to suggest significant production cuts. Riyadh, however, has come under renewed pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who asked the kingdom to refrain from output reductions and help to lower oil prices further. Possibly complicating any decision on oil output is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh.  Falih was in Abuja to meet his Nigerian counterpart Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu. The Saudi minister said signals from fellow OPEC members Iraq, Nigeria and Libya were positive ahead of the group’s Dec. 6 talks because all ministers want to restore oil market stability. “We are going to ... do whatever is necessary, but only if we act together as a group of 25,” Falih told reporters, referring to OPEC and its allies. “As Saudi Arabia we cannot do it alone, we will not do it alone. “Everybody is longing (to) reach a decision that brings stability back to the market ... I think people know that leaving the market to its own devices with no clarity and no collective decision to balance the market is not helping.” Brent oil LCOc1 edged down towards $60 on Wednesday, erasing early gains of more than 1 percent, with the market unconvinced on the prospect of OPEC cuts next week. Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Crown Prince Mohammed in Argentina at this weekend’s G20 summit, which Trump will also attend. Moscow has so far resisted joining any new production cuts and Falih did not say whether he had heard of any change in Russia’s position. Speaking in Moscow, Putin said Russia was in touch with OPEC but Moscow would be satisfied with oil at $60 a barrel. Putin previously said Russia would be satisfied with a price of $70. “We are in contact with OPEC and we are ready to continue our joint efforts if needed,” Putin said.  Russian energy minister Alexander Novak met Russian oil producers this week to discuss cooperation with OPEC, two industry sources said without providing details. Nigeria’s Kachikwu told reporters it was too early to say whether OPEC member Nigeria would participate in any cuts but added that there was “absolute resolve” within the organization to stabilize the market. Falih this month said that the abundant supply of oil could require OPEC and its allies to reduce output in 2019. He said at the time that supply could exceed demand by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd), or 1 percent of global demand, suggesting that OPEC and its allies may try to reduce production by that amount. Asked on Wednesday whether cuts could be deeper than 1.4 million bpd, Falih declined to answer. Nigeria and Libya were excluded from the previous cuts because of production declines caused by unrest, though their output has now recovered. Iran was also largely exempt from cuts.

2018-11-28,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark’s Orsted will invest $30 billion in green energy up to 2025, it said on Wednesday, as it seeks to become one of a handful of future “renewable majors” leading a global transition from fossil fuels to green energy. While renewable energy technology is now able to compete with traditional power sources, the industry remains vulnerable to changing political winds as governments around the world scramble on how to address climate change.  Orsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer, said it would have 15 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power capacity by 2025, up from a previous target of 11-12 GW and plans to further double capacity by 2030 to more than 30 GW.  One of the key drivers will be expansion in the nascent U.S. market, where it recently made two acquisitions to gain a foothold in both onshore and offshore wind. U.S. President Donald Trump has blasted renewable energy as expensive, accused wind turbines of killing birds and ruining landscapes while vowing to revive the coal industry. While Trump this week rejected projections from his own government that climate change will cause severe economic harm, many states have set ambitious targets to source energy from carbon-free sources. However, so far the impact on Orsted’s business has not been negative, its U.S. chief told Reuters. “It has been quite positive under this administration,” Thomas Brostrom said, pointing to efforts to remove red tape around environmental approvals and new auctions for acreage.  He said the efforts were driven more by consideration for energy independency and job creation rather than reducing carbon emissions.  Orsted is also betting big on growing in Taiwan, which with a big push to attract investments in renewable technology, has become a key battleground for the world’s top offshore wind developers seeking a foothold in Asia. However, Orsted acknowledged that offshore wind projects in Taiwan could face delays after voters last week decided against a government plan to abolish nuclear power.  The vote prompted Taiwan to scrap its target of having no nuclear power by 2025 and to review its energy policy, which since 2011 has been driven by the Fukushima nuclear accident. Before the vote, the island’s offshore wind market was expected to expand to 5.5 GW by 2025, with government investments into onshore and offshore wind of $23 billion.  “It was not a vote to stop the nuclear phase-out,” senior vice president at Orsted, Thyge Boserup, said.  “I think it’s rather the speed of the phase-out that is up for discussion,” he said.

2018-11-28,"MEDIA, PENNSYLVANIA (Reuters) - Energy Transfer LP (ET.N) and its Sunoco pipeline subsidiary have racked up more than 800 state and federal permit violations while racing to build two of the nation’s largest natural gas pipelines, according to a Reuters analysis of government data and regulatory records. The pipelines, known as Energy Transfer Rover and Sunoco Mariner East 2, will carry natural gas and gas liquids from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, an area that now accounts for more than a third of U.S. gas production. Reuters analyzed four comparable pipeline projects and found they averaged 19 violations each during construction. The Rover and Mariner violations included spills of drilling fluid, a clay-and-water mixture that lubricates equipment for drilling under rivers and highways; sinkholes in backyards; and improper disposal of hazardous waste and other trash. Fines topped $15 million. Energy Transfer also raised the ire of federal regulators by tearing down a historic house along Rover’s route. The Appalachia region has become a hub for natural gas as it increasingly replaces coal for U.S. power generation, creating an urgent need for new pipelines. But the recent experience of residents and regulators with the two Energy Transfer pipelines has state officials vowing to tighten laws and scrutinize future projects. “Ohio’s negative experience with Rover has fundamentally changed how we will permit pipeline projects,”  said James Lee, a spokesman for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Problems with Mariner prompted Pennsylvania legislators to craft bills tightening construction regulations, which have drawn bipartisan support. “Any pipeline going through this area is going to face resistance which it would not have faced before,” said Pennsylvania State Senator Andy Dinniman, a Democrat. Energy Transfer spokeswoman Alexis Daniel said the firm remained committed to safe construction and operation and at times went “above and beyond” regulations for the two projects.  Construction of the 713-mile, $4.2 billion Rover started in March 2017 and was planned to proceed at about 89 miles a month, while work on the 350-mile, $2.5 billion Mariner East 2 started in February 2017 and was planned at 50 miles a month, according to company statements on construction schedules. Both were targeted for completion late last year. Regulators and industry experts said the pace of both projects far exceeded industry norms. The four other projects examined by Reuters were mostly completed at a pace averaging 17 miles per month. Reuters selected the projects for comparison because, like Rover and Mariner, they cost more than $1.5 billion, stretched at least 150 miles and were under construction at the same time.  Construction on both Energy Transfer pipelines was ultimately slowed when state and federal regulators ordered numerous work stoppages after permit violations. Energy Transfer completed the last two sections of Rover in November and said it expects to put Mariner East 2 in service soon. In February, Pennsylvania fined the company $12.6 million for environmental damage, including the discharge of drilling fluids into state waters without a permit. After further problems, including the sinkholes, a state judge in May ordered work halted on Mariner East 2. Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Barnes wrote that Energy Transfer’s Sunoco unit “made deliberate managerial decisions to proceed in what appears to be a rushed manner in an apparent prioritization of profit over the best engineering.”   While pipeline construction schedules vary, the planned timelines for Rover and Mariner were ambitious, said Fred Jauss, partner at Dorsey & Whitney in Washington and a former attorney with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates interstate gas pipelines. “They aren’t taking their time ... we’re all concerned about it,” said Pennsylvania State Senator John Rafferty, a Republican, referring to other state politicians, constituents and first responders.  Energy Transfer spokeswoman Lisa Dillinger told Reuters the schedules were “appropriate for the size, scope, and the number of contractors hired.” Other companies that planned slower construction of comparable projects have finished mostly on schedule with almost no violations. Canadian energy company Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), for instance, recently finished a $2.6 billion, 255-mile pipeline - following a path similar to Rover through Ohio and Michigan - with just seven violations. Enbridge did not respond to a request for comment. Energy Transfer, now one of the nation’s largest pipeline operators, encountered large protests led by Native American tribes and environmental activists over the route of its Dakota Access crude oil line in North Dakota in 2016 and has seen protests of Mariner East 2 in Pennsylvania, where opponents have highlighted its safety record on existing pipelines. The company has had a relatively high incidence of hazardous liquid spills and other problems, according to a Reuters review of data from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Energy Transfer’s Sunoco unit ranked third worst among all pipeline companies in average annual incidents between 2010 and 2017, according to the PHMSA data. In total, Energy Transfer and its affiliated companies released more than 41,000 barrels of hazardous liquids causing more than $100 million in property damage, PHMSA data shows. (For a graphic on PHMSA incidents by company, see: tmsnrt.rs/2EHd3E4 ) Bibianna Dussling of Media, Pennsylvania, joined a group of activists protesting Mariner East after learning the project’s route would pass near her daughter’s elementary school. “The violations are really meaningless to them,” she said. “You do so much to protect your children day-to-day, and to face something like this, that you feel is so much out of your hands.” Energy Transfer’s Dillinger said incidents have been sharply reduced since the merger of Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners into one company, Energy Transfer, in the spring of 2017. Incidents this year are “trending below industry average,” she said. The Rover pipeline attracted additional federal scrutiny when Energy Transfer demolished a historic house along its route. After Energy Transfer bought the 1843 Stoneman house in Ohio, FERC staff in February 2016 required the firm to come up with a plan to prevent adverse effects on the property, according to a staff’s environmental report.  Instead, the company tore down the house in May 2016 without notifying FERC or the Ohio State Historic Preservation Office.  That led FERC to deny Energy Transfer a so-called blanket certificate that would have allowed the company to construct Rover with less oversight, noting the demolition convinced regulators the company “cannot be trusted” to comply with environmental regulations. Energy Transfer did not comment on the denial but said in a statement that it had “resolved all outstanding issues” with the demolition and donated more than $4 million to the Ohio preservation office. Once Energy Transfer started building Rover, FERC and West Virginia regulators required the company to halt work on parts of the project after violations, including the release of an estimated 2 million gallons of drilling fluid into wetlands near the Tuscarawas River in Ohio in April 2017.  (For a breakdown of Rover’s 681 federal violations, see: tmsnrt.rs/2PUGmYr .) In Pennsylvania, Mariner East 2 has received more than 80 notices of violation from the state’s Department of Environmental Protection, mostly for accidental release of drilling fluids. Drilling fluids can impair the natural flow of streams and rivers and harm an area’s ecosystem, said Lynda Farrell, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Coalition.  The Ohio Attorney General filed a lawsuit in November 2017 seeking about $2.6 million from Rover and some of the construction companies building the pipeline for the alleged illegal discharge of millions of gallons of drilling fluids into state waters, among other things. That lawsuit is ongoing.  Energy Transfer’s Dillinger said the company was “disappointed” that the Ohio AG sued after the company tried to resolve issues amicably and that it would continue cooperating with regulators. “We continue to work closely with both state regulators to resolve any outstanding issues related to our construction,” she said.

2018-11-28,"NEW YORK, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The Trump Administration has temporarily frozen a program meant to exempt small oil refineries in financial distress from the U.S. biofuels law, as it reviews the scoring system to evaluate applications, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The review means changes are likely to the program, which has become a lightning rod of controversy between the rival oil and corn industries since the Environmental Protection Agency vastly increased the number of waivers for last year. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must increasingly blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do. The regulation was passed in 2005 to help farmers and cut fuel imports. But small oil refineries can be exempted from the standard if they prove that compliance would cause disproportionate hardship. The EPA granted 29 such waivers for the 2017 compliance year, up from 14 in 2015 and 20 in 2016. The biofuels industry and lawmakers representing farm states have argued that the expansion hurt farmers by eroding demand for ethanol and want the program halted. But refiners consider the program a lifeline to small facilities and have won lawsuits accusing the EPA of being too stingy with waivers. The two sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter, said over the past week that the Trump administration was delaying consideration of any new waivers while the Department of Energy reviews its scoring system for applications. The department evaluates waiver requests and provides recommendations to the EPA. That has placed on hold seven applications for the 2017 compliance year, and 15 applications for the 2018. Typically, the EPA waits until the latter half of the year to begin reviewing applications because applicants need to demonstrate financial hardship using hard figures for their facilities. An EPA official confirmed the review. “I think what DOE needs to do is tighten up their approach and we need to do the same,” said the official, who asked not to be named. “I honestly don’t know where they’ll end up and whether they’re going to make any changes at all.” Whatever the outcome, it could have a dramatic impact on the multi-billion-dollar credit trading market, which has been hard-hit by the waiver expansion. Credits, called Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs, have dropped in value from over $1 to 10 cents this week as reports emerged of the number of EPA waivers granted last year. Some of those went to facilities owned by big, profitable companies like Chevron Corp and Andeavor, which recently merged with Marathon Petroleum Corp, Reuters has reported. That cut in credit prices has saved merchant refiners that lack enough biofuel blending facilities, like Valero Energy Corp, PBF Energy Inc and Carl Icahn’s CVR Energy Inc hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs. The issue has placed President Donald Trump in a tough spot between two key constituencies, as he tries to support the agriculture industry slammed by the impact of his trade war with China, and keep costs down for the oil industry. Biofuel supporters had argued the expansion of the waiver program was politically driven by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, an Oklahoman considered an oil industry ally. Pruitt resigned in July in a flurry of ethical scandals, and has been replaced by Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist. “Under the last EPA chief, the waiver program became a cookie jar open to every well-connected refinery owner, and we’re seeing the results across rural America with biofuel plants closing their doors or idling production,” Brook Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said. The EPA has blamed the program’s expansion on recent federal court rulings, triggered by challenges filed by small refining companies Holly Frontier and Sinclair, which said the agency was using too strict of a test to determine disproportionate hardship. All hardship applications are first handled by the Energy Department, which determines whether compliance would lead to disproportionate impact, or threaten a refinery’s viability. The final decision on applications rests with the EPA.

2018-11-28,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Cassandra Garrison and Matt Spetalnick BUENOS AIRES/WASHINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Argentina and China are aiming to close a deal within days for the construction of the South American nation’s fourth nuclear power plant, a multi-billion dollar project that would cement Beijing’s deepening influence in a key regional U.S. ally. Argentina hopes to announce an agreement on the Chinese-financed construction of the Atucha III nuclear power plant during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit on Sunday following the summit of leaders of G20 industrialized nations in Buenos Aires, Juan Pablo Tripodi, head of Argentina’s national investment agency, told Reuters in an interview. The potential deal, reportedly worth up to $8 billion, is emblematic of China’s strengthening of economic, diplomatic and cultural ties with Argentina. It is part of a wider push by Beijing into Latin America that has alarmed the United States, which views the region as its backyard and is suspicious of China’s motives. The focus of this week’s meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of G20 will be on their two countries’ trade war, but the backdrop will be the competition between the powers for influence in Latin America. When Argentina negotiated a $56.3 billion financing deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rescue its troubled economy earlier this year, Trump voiced his support for the plan and President Mauricio Macri’s leadership. But it is China that has emerged as Argentina’s critical trading partner, investor and financier, a Reuters review of trade and investment data shows, with Beijing pumping billions into Argentina’s economy and positioning itself as a reliable lender for its crisis-stricken economy. China and Argentina are expected to seal a currency swap deal this weekend that doubles the original amount of the credit line to $18.7 billion. The deal will make China the biggest non-institutional lender to Argentina. China is the main importer of Argentine soybeans, the South American country’s biggest cash crop. In the last 10 years, it has also emerged as a major financier of Argentine projects, mainly infrastructure, worth a total of about $18 billion, offering low interest rates of between 3 and 4 percent, according to a Reuters review of Chinese state funding data compiled by the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based non-profit think-tank. (For more on China’s economic ties with Argentina see) The negotiations on Chinese financing of the Atucha III nuclear power plant are a key cause for concern for the U.S. government, a senior Trump administration official told Reuters. Atucha III would be one of the biggest projects financed by China in Argentina, according to the Reuters review of Chinese state funding data. Argentina’s national newspaper Clarin reported at the weekend that if the deal was signed, China would loan Argentina $6.5 billion to be repaid in 20 years, with eight years of grace and a 4.5 percent annual interest. Reuters was not able to independently confirm these details. “These are infrastructure projects where China is coming in and providing very low interest loans or they are just having Chinese companies do it,” the U.S. official said. “It’s creating an economic and political dependency on China that’s incredibly dangerous.” The message to Macri and other regional leaders is increasingly that “your sovereignty can be lost by being so ensnared in debt, you can lose your sovereignty to the person who holds your debt,” the U.S. official said. China’s foreign ministry strongly disputes that view. “China’s investment and financing in Latin America are in line with market rules and common international rules and practices, and do not have any political conditions attached,” the ministry said in a statement to Reuters. The involvement of Chinese companies in water, power and road projects has helped to drive Argentine economic and social development, it said. Defending Argentina’s relationship with China, an Argentine government official told Reuters that Beijing was an important investor and would only become more important in the future. However, the official acknowledged the U.S. concerns were not without merit. “Overall, I would say it’s a fair warning and it’s something countries should take into consideration. I think Argentina takes it into consideration very seriously,” the official said. China’s attraction to Argentina can be attributed to three factors: natural resources, weak institutions, and the country’s lack of other financing options, according to Juan Uriburu, an Argentine lawyer who has worked on two major Argentina-China joint ventures. “China can afford to have these competitive (interest) rates. In the meantime, what they create are new markets for Chinese companies abroad, which back home means Chinese companies will be working, making the products, making the locomotives, the cars, the rails, everything,” Uriburu said. Tripodi, the Argentine investment agency head, credited Macri’s more business-friendly policies for the uptick in Chinese investment. Interest from Chinese companies was growing “in an exponential way,” he said. As a presidential candidate, Macri pledged to recalibrate Argentina’s relationship with China. Under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez, Argentina had changed the law to enable Chinese companies to skip the bidding process if they were financing projects, according to Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at Inter-American Dialogue. When Macri took office in late 2015, he vowed to review deals the Fernandez government had made with China. Atucha III, a railway project and two hydropower dams in Santa Cruz province, which her late husband had governed, were among projects thrown into limbo. Cross-cancellation clauses, however, have made it difficult for Macri to terminate the largest projects, said Uriburu. Macri has instead renegotiated some terms, including bringing down the loan amount for the hydro dams from $4.7 billion to $4 billion. In Brazil, Latin America’s biggest economy, right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro also took a tough stance against China on the campaign trail, portraying it as a predator seeking to dominate key business sectors. But since winning election Bolsonaro has softened his position, saying China is welcome to invest in Brazil and that trade between the two countries could grow. China’s influence in Argentina extends beyond the numbers. For example, it has established Confucius institutes, cultural organizations, at Argentina’s largest university, the University of Buenos Aires, and a second college in Buenos Aires province. Some U.S. lawmakers have warned that the institutes, which number more than 100 around the world, are an attempt by China to further its political influence, which Beijing denies. In one of the most visible examples of Chinese soft power in Argentina, the government held a nationally televised event with the Chinese ambassador earlier this month to showcase armored vehicles and other security equipment that China has donated to help secure the G20 event. Argentine security officials told Reuters they would hold a separate event to highlight U.S. aid for the summit, which begins on Friday. That has yet to happen.

2018-11-28,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s climate chief called for the bloc to take the lead and aim for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in its climate strategy published on Wednesday, ahead of key U.N. talks on curbing global warming.   As President Donald Trump pulls the United States out of the Paris climate accord, European Commission climate chief Miguel Arias Canete said the bloc had to lead by example at next week’s climate talks in Poland.           The EU executive published its strategy on Wednesday, setting out eight pathways to reducing emissions - two of which chart a course for Europe to becoming climate neutral by absorbing as much greenhouse gas as it emits. “It’s worth becoming the first major economy to fully decarbonise, to fully reach net zero emissions,” Canete told Reuters on Tuesday. “It will require lots of effort, but it is doable.” Under a package of climate legislation adopted since the 2015 Paris Agreement on containing global warming, the EU is on track to overshoot its pledge to reduce emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030. New targets on energy saving, renewables and transport emissions have helped set the bloc on course to cut emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2050. “That’s okay, but we need to do more,” Canete said, arguing that investment in clean energy would help grow the economy and save money on fossil fuel imports. Upcoming U.N. talks are the most important since the Paris Agreement, with delegates from 195 nations set to haggle over the details of the pact, which Washington has said it will quit. The 2015 pact aims to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels and limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species. By publishing its ambitious plan, EU officials hope to pull more weight at what are expected to be tough talks amid division among world powers. “The role of the United States is less relevant and that puts more burden on our shoulders,” Canete said. “It will not be an easy conference, but the European Union arrives with lots of credibility.” While Trump rejects projections that climate change will cause severe economic harm, a U.N. report detailing the dangers last month has spurred ministers from some EU nations to call for emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. However, European governments are also divided over how to strike a balance between climate policy and protecting high-employment sectors such as automakers and coal mining. Some, including economic powerhouse Germany, are struggling to meet their targets. All of the pathways presented on Wednesday chart a rise in electricity consumption but some rely more heavily on storage while others more on alternative fuels like hydrogen. In five scenarios the EU, responsible for some 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, achieves reductions of about 85 percent by 2050 compared to 1990, Some sectors like agriculture still account for high emissions. To achieve net negative emissions, the bloc will have to invest more in carbon capture and sustainable advanced biofuels but also encourage consumers to change their habits, the EU’s modelling shows. The European Commission hopes that the publication of its long-term strategy will inspire national governments to greater ambition when they draft their own plans by the end of 2019 for meeting the bloc’s current climate goals.

2018-11-28,"BAGHDAD, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Gas exports from Iran to Iraq were halted late on Tuesday for several days, as Iranian authorities work to repair damages caused to the pipeline during a recent earthquake. The cuts deprive Iraq’s power grid of 2,500 megawatts (MW), Iraq’s electricity ministry said in a statement, as Iraq relies heavily on Iranian gas to feed its power stations. Iranian authorities informed the electricity ministry in Baghdad that the flow of gas exports will be resumed “during next few days” after maintenance on the pipeline inside Iranian territory are completed. The pipeline supplies several major power stations, including two in Eastern Baghdad and one in Eastern Diyala province near the Iranian border, the ministry said. The oil ministry will supply the power stations which have been affected by the halt with fuel to keep operations going, the ministry said. However, both provinces can expect power cuts as a result, the ministry said. Iran, which has large gas reserves alongside its oil resources, exports small amounts of gas to Turkey but production has struggled to keep pace with rising domestic consumption. The United States said earlier this month that Iraq can continue to import natural gas and energy supplies from Iran for a period of 45 days, as long as Iraq does not pay Iran in U.S. dollars. Sanctions on Tehran’s oil sector took effect on Nov. 5. Baghdad is seeking to renew and extend the exemption as it needs more time to find an alternative source, Iraqi officials said.

2018-11-28,"* Eskom makes $48 mln profit in H1 * But sees full-year pre-tax loss of over $800 mln * Asset sales, debt-to-equity swaps not seen helping * Other options include bailout, debt relief (Updates after comments by Eskom chairman) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Nov 28 (Reuters) - South African state-run power firm Eskom said on Wednesday that asset sales could not solve its problems and that a bailout or debt relief were preferable, as it flagged a loss before tax of more than 11.2 billion rand ($800 million) this financial year. Eskom, Africa’s largest public utility, is working on a turnaround plan to reverse a decade of steep decline, in which electricity sales fell while debt ballooned and the company became embroiled in corruption scandals. It supplies more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power, making it critical to the health of the $340 billion economy. “Eskom is in a state of severe financial difficulty, ... we are locked into a loss-making position,” Eskom Chairman Jabu Mabuza told a news conference. “All the assets which we could sell are the ones that no one could buy,” Mabuza said. “There are other ways, call them what you want. A bailout, an equity injection by the shareholder ... or some debt relief.” President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a new board at Eskom early this year, in one of his first moves since replacing Jacob Zuma as leader of the ruling African National Congress. But efforts to turn the company around have been hampered by severe fiscal constraints, labour unrest and fuel shortages affecting as much as two-thirds of its coal-fired power stations. On Wednesday, Eskom reported a 671 million rand profit in the six months to the end of September but said its performance in the next six months would be hurt by a wage deal with trade unions and greater maintenance costs. That compares with a 6.3 billion rand profit in the six months to the end of September 2017 and a full-year loss of 2.3 billion rand loss for the 2017/18 financial year. Eskom’s total debt rose to 419 billion rand at the end of September, from 367 billion a year earlier. Its cash levels rose from 8.5 billion rand to 17.3 billion rand over the same period but are expected to come under pressure in the second half of the 2018/19 financial year. Eskom’s Mabuza ruled out debt-to-equity swaps as a way to reduce indebtedness, saying converting debt held by state pension fund the Public Investment Corporation was a “dangerous route”. CEO Phakamani Hadebe said options for government support could be a cash injection or moving some of its debt to the government’s balance sheet. “Our debt levels have reached certain levels which are no longer sustainable,” he said. $1 = 13.9692 rand

2018-11-28," (This Nov. 27 story has been refiled to correct spelling of surname of Oil and Gas UK decommissioning manager.) By Shadia Nasralla LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish marine salvage group Ardent is adapting the tanksit used to refloat the Costa Concordia, the cruise ship wrecked off the Italian coast in 2012, to decommission North Sea oil platforms.     It is one of several companies trying new ideas to win business in the market for dismantling disused oil platforms. In Britain's aging oil fields alone, the opportunities could be worth up to 17 billion pounds ($21.85 billion) before 2025, according to industry body Oil and Gas UK. The ideas could then be deployed to other maturing fields such as in the Gulf of Mexico and southeast Asia.GRAPHIC: Offshore decommissioning - tmsnrt.rs/2OIThgl Ardent says it needs at least two companies to sign up for a project to get off the ground. Well-Safe, another company offering a new approach, also needs several operators to commit. So far, Ardent has found it challenging to persuade companies to be the first to sign up.   “Everyone is queuing to be second,” said Ardent’s Decommissioning Director Stuart Martin.   Oil companies are keen to reduce costs in a part of the market dominated by major global players such as TechnipFMC (FTI.N), Schlumberger, Saipem (SPMI.MI) and AllSeas.      Beyond the floating tanks, Ardent has also joined forces with oil services firm WorleyParsons (WOR.AX) and technology and shipping group Lloyd’s Register, to bring a one-stop-shop service.  This could save money by cutting out the need for lots of different contractors. Well-Safe proposes coordinating decommissioning work across companies to share equipment and staff.  “You got to give Well-Safe and the others a real tip of the hat. We all want them to win. It’s in the best interest of the industry,” said Jim House, CEO of Neptune Energy, which is  planning decommissioning for its Juliet and Minke fields in the North Sea.    Oil platforms are usually removed piece by piece and taken to the shore using complex vessels. The floating tanks that Ardent used to lift the Costa Concordia, are much cheaper to use, industry experts say.  “This technology could have significant potential cost efficiencies,” the Oil and Gas Technology Centre, which is funded by the British government, said in a report. But Ardent says it would need contracts for at least two buoyant tanks to go below current costs per tonne of steel removed and three to get below its target cost reduction of around a third. Britain’s industry regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority, has set a target of 35 percent cost cuts compared with 2015 levels. Well-Safe’s main lever for cost reduction also depends on several operators committing to contracts. Ardent is also proposing to oversee a project from production to scrapping the metal onshore. Worley Parsons would operate the platform and maintain the equipment and Lloyd’s Register would plug the wells. “It’s a lot about an emerging set of companies and we don’t yet know which is going to be the winning model,” said Boston Consulting Group’s Philip Whittaker. “One of the biggest sources of value is how to integrate the decom work with the final stages of the production work.” GRAPHIC: Cost of Ardent projects - tmsnrt.rs/2OIUVP3 GRAPHIC: UK North Sea Decommissioning Spending - tmsnrt.rs/2NZuZJr           With other fields maturing and drying up across the worldand some experts expecting demand for oil to peak in the 2030s,the North Sea is a test bed for new decommissioning projects.     If a company can plug oil wells without leaks and remove thousands of tonnes of steel platforms and pipelines, some 50years old, in the rough, deep seas between Scotland, England and Norway, they should be able to do it anywhere.      Industry body Oil and Gas UK, expects oil companies to spend17 billion pounds ($22.05 billion) on removing around 1,600wells, 100 platforms, and 5,500 km of pipelines in the next seven years. Some 840,000 tonnes of material will be returned to shore to meet environmental regulations.     “We’ve got a mature basin with a steady flow of work,” said Joe Leask, decommissioning manager at Oil and Gas UK.     “Those resources and expertise can be exportable globally.”     The Gulf of Mexico has had decommissioning projects in its warm, calm waters for years but Southeast Asia is a new hot spot, with more than 1,500 platforms and 7,000 subsea wells expected to be uneconomical by 2038, according to the BCG.      That is followed by Latin America, West Africa and the Middle East Gulf.GRAPHIC: Future decommissioning hotspots - tmsnrt.rs/2Rez5Qb With so much potential, more established players are also trying different approaches to make decommissioning cheaper.     Service vessel group Allseas is experimenting with new ideas. It specializes in subsea construction but is converting huge ships to lift structures as heavy as 48,000 tonnes in one haul.     “We lift in a matter of hours and we’re gone,” said Allseas President Edward Heerema.      The first job for Allseas’ Pioneering Spirit, the biggest construction vessel in the world, was in the Norwegian North Sea removing Repsol’s (REP.MC) 13,500 tonne Yme production unit.      Shell (RDSa.AS) also used it to remove its 24,000 tonne Brent Delta platform in 2017. “We have taken substantial costs out of our major decommissioning project, the Brent, and we will continue to do so,” said Steve Phimister, head of Shell’s North Sea upstream. “The whole industry needs to do that by innovating.” Editing by Anna Willard",https://uk.reuters.com/article/north-sea-oil-decommissioning/refile-analysis-dismantling-the-oil-industry-rough-north-sea-waters-test-new-ideas-idUKL8N1XX5DZ,28 Nov 2018,"* Offshore wells, huge platforms must be removed when oil

While President Donald Trump talked tough on the trade tariffs issue ahead of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, markets focused on comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who held open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal. Kudlow’s comments helped Wall Street close higher and allowed Chinese and Japanese shares to rally 1 percent . MSCI’s index of Asian shares outside Japan gained 0.7 percent. But the mood fizzled somewhat into the European session, with the pan-European index giving up opening gains to trade flat and Germany’s export-heavy bourse slipping 0.2 percent. A Tuesday report that Trump may soon decide about new taxes on imported cars, still weighed on sentiment, keeping Europe’s auto sector shares 0.6 percent in the red “An expectation is being priced into markets ahead of the G20 meeting that we will see some deal or at least a framework for a deal between Trump and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping,” said Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Switzerland-based Woodman Asset Management. “But if they come out with nothing this weekend, it’s going to be very bad.” Futures pointed to a marginally firmer open on Wall Street . The uncertainty over global trade as well as Brexit and Italy’s conflict with the European Union, have supported the U.S. dollar, which rose to a two-week high against a basket of currencies. While the main driver for the greenback is the U.S. interest rate path, Rodrigo Catril, senior strategist at National Australia Bank, said it was also benefiting from the uncertain mood. “Markets seem to be jumping at shadows at the moment and against this backdrop of uncertainty, the dollar remains the preferred option for weathering the storm,” Catril said. With the currency index approaching 1-1/2-year highs reached earlier this month, traders are focusing on a speech at 1700 GMT by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to see if he offers clues on how many more times the Fed could raise interest rates. While Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida took a less dovish stance on Tuesday than some had expected and backed more rate rises, Powell and his colleagues have in recent weeks alluded to global volatility, leading many to speculate the bank’s three-year-long rate rise campaign could pause in 2019. . Berg said there had been some repricing of rate-rise expectations but said the Fed remained on track to tighten policy in December and early-2019 at least. “My base case is the dollar will strengthen versus the euro and pound into year-end, as the euro zone and Britain are both struggling with their own problems — Brexit and Italy,” Berg said. Sterling was flat around $1.2754, just off two-week lows, as British Prime Minister Theresa May battles to convince sceptical voters, lawmakers and businesses of the benefits of her Brexit deal. May needs to win a Dec. 11 parliamentary vote on the deal she has negotiated with the EU to exit the bloc but with most parties opposed, that looks unlikely. The euro is languishing at $1.1286, also near two-week lows to the dollar. Investors are monitoring developments in Italy’s row with the EU over its budget spending, with Germany’s Handelsblatt and Italy’s La Stampa quoting EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis as saying the draft budget needed “substantial correction”. Italian bond yields flatlined after sharp rallies that were triggered by what appeared to be a more conciliatory stance from the government over the issue.

2018-11-28,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is set to expand its market share in China this year for the first time since 2012, with demand stirred up by new Chinese refiners pushing the kingdom back into contention with Russia as top supplier to the world’s largest oil buyer. Saudi Arabia, the biggest global oil exporter, has been surpassed by Russia as top crude supplier to China the past two years as private “teapot” refiners and a new pipeline drove up demand for Russian oil. Now fresh demand from new refineries starting up in 2019 could increase China’s Saudi oil imports by between 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 700,000 bpd, nudging the OPEC kingpin back towards the top, analysts say. Saudi Aramco said last week it will sign five crude supply agreements that will take its 2019 contract totals with Chinese buyers to 1.67 million bpd. “With the recent crude oil supply agreements and potential increase of refinery capacity, the Saudis could overtake the Russians and reclaim (the) crown as the biggest crude exporter to China,” Rystad Energy analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu said. Saudi Arabia has already gained ground this year. China imported 1.04 million bpd of Saudi crude in the first 10 months of 2018, China customs data showed. This is equivalent to 11.5 percent of total Chinese imports, up from 11 percent in 2017, Reuters calculations showed. Saudi’s market share in China could jump to nearly 17 percent next year, if buyers requested full contractual volumes, analysts from Rystad Energy and Refinitiv said, while growth in Russian oil supply to China could slow. China imported 1.39 million bpd of Russian crude in January-October this year, about 15 percent of total Chinese imports, customs data showed. Russia had a 14 percent share at 1.2 million bpd in 2017. “We expect Chinese imports of Russian crude to remain at a similar rate in 2019 as a large share of these Russian barrels are imported via pipeline,” Refinitiv analyst Mark Tay said.  The biggest boost to Saudi exports to China comes from contracts inked with new refineries starting up this year and next, owned by companies other than state oil giants Sinopec (600028.SS) or PetroChina (601857.SS). The contracts include 130,000 bpd to Dalian Hengli Petrochemical and up to 170,000 bpd to Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp, each of which has a 400,000-bpd refinery. Saudi Aramco has also agreed to increase Sinochem Corp’s [SASADA.UL] supplies, which will be processed at its Quanzhou and Hongrun refineries. Sinopec, PetroChina and China National Offshore Oil Corp [SASACY.UL] have all kept their term Saudi volumes for next year unchanged. Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy expects Saudi crude imports to rise by just 300,000 bpd in 2019, raising its market share to 13.7 percent, but leaving it behind Russia. “We expect lower Saudi crude demand from Hengli and Rongsheng as it is unlikely for them to run their refineries at full rate in 2019,” analyst Seng Yick Tee said. Zhejiang Petrochemical is majority-owned by Rongsheng Holdings. Still, a source familiar with Aramco’s export plans said there is tremendous appetite from China’s independents, and that it needed to be more aggressive in its marketing strategy. The state oil company did move more swiftly to seal the most recent deals than it used to in the past, industry sources said. Aramco’s first deal with Hengli was to supply 20 million barrels of crude, about 55,000 bpd, in 2018, said a senior source with direct knowledge of the deal. “Hengli executed the 2018 deal nicely, which helped build trust,” he said. Hengli is designed to process 90 percent Saudi crude, a mix of Arab Medium and Arab Heavy, while the remaining 10 percent is Brazilian Marlim crude. Rongsheng’s plant is identical to Hengli, the industry sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Aramco is also supplying PetroChina’s refinery in China’s southwestern Yunnan province with about 4 million barrels a month of crude via a pipeline from Myanmar between July and November, Eikon data showed, although sources said talks for Saudi Arabia to acquire a stake in the refinery have stalled. Saudi Aramco’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser said on Monday the company will push to expand its market share in China and is still looking for new refining deals there despite OPEC’s likely limits on output next year.  Saudi Aramco will supply up to 70 percent of the oil required at its 300,000-bpd joint venture refinery in Malaysia with Petronas [PETR.UL]. Between China and Malaysia alone, Saudi Arabia will have to increase exports to Asia by more than 500,000 bpd next year. This comes as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is discussing production cuts of as much as 1.4 million bpd for next year to prop up oil prices. Between balancing global supplies and increasing market in Asia, Aramco may decide to “forgo market share in other markets like the United States, where the surge in domestic production will make it difficult for the Saudis to retain market share anyway,” Rystad’s Rodriguez-Masiu said. Saudi’s oil shipments to the United States have risen recently to above 1 mln bpd, but U.S. output is also increasing, said the source familiar with Saudi Aramco’s export plans. “You need to lessen the inventories in the U.S.,” the source said, adding that Aramco will likely divert oil supply from the United States to Asia to meet rising demand there. A Chinese oil executive said: “China is where the demand growth is. The Saudis are very wise to capture this market.”  Reporting by Florence Tan in SINGAPORE, Chen Aizhu in BEIJING and Rania El Gamal in DUBAI; Editing by Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-china-oil/analysis-contender-saudi-arabia-nabs-new-china-oil-demand-challenges-russias-top-spot-idUKL4N1XQ3AB,28 Nov 2018,"Saudi Arabia is

2018-11-28,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A series of blasts during the delivery of a flammable gas at a chemical manufacturer in China on Wednesday killed 23 people and injured at least 22, the latest casualties in a series of industrial accidents that has angered the public. A video of the blast scene broadcast by state media showed billowing black smoke and flames, while photographs showed rows of burnt-out cars and trucks. An explosion during a delivery of acetylene set off a chain reaction among trucks parked along a road, leaving 50 vehicles damaged, the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing the city’s fire fighting department. The local government announced the casualty toll in a social media posting. The acetylene was being delivered to the Haipoer New Energy Technology Company in Zhangjiakou city, in the northern province of Hebei, Xinhua reported.  Reuters was unable to contact Haipoer for comment. All fires at the blast site had been extinguished, state media reported. Production at the nearby Hebei Shenghua Chemical Industry Co was operating normally, Xinhua reported. A woman who answered the plant’s telephone had earlier told Reuters that production had been suspended. Zhangjiakou, about 156 km (96 miles) northwest of Beijing, is set to host the 2022 Winter Olympics along with the capital. Public anger over safety standards has grown in China after three decades of swift economic growth has been marred by accidents ranging from mining disasters to factory fires. In August 2015, 165 people were killed in a chemical warehouse explosion in the port city of Tianjin. The government found that the disaster was causes by improperly or illegally stored hazardous materials. China has vowed to improve industrial standards, but environmentalists say they fear oversight weaknesses persist, including an opaque production process for hazardous chemicals.

2018-11-28,"JAKARTA, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s government will compensate state energy firm Pertamina up to $1.3 billion for fuel sales costs in 2017 in addition to subsidies, for keeping domestic prices steady, a senior Pertamina official said on Wednesday. Indonesian President Joko Widodo has promised to freeze some consumer fuel and electricity prices ahead of national elections in 2019, despite climbing global oil prices and the rupiah’s depreciation. Widodo raised subsidies for diesel fuel fourfold to 2,000 rupiah ($0.1377) a litre this year to keep prices unchanged, but made Pertamina shoulder the losses of keeping prices of RON 88 gasoline steady. Under the president’s order, Pertamina must also sell fuel at the same prices across the country, which meant more costs for the company. These state policies have dented Pertamina’s finances and cut its means of spending on much-needed infrastructure. Pertamina’s finance director Pahala Mansury said the government has promised to repay his company’s expenses for fuel sales under a presidential decree issued in May. The estimated costs Pertamina can claim from the government reached $1.2 billion-$1.3 billion from sales in 2017, on top of subsidies, Mansury said at a news conference. “Our costs are temporary, there will be repayment,” he said, adding that he is expecting the government to also cover Pertamina’s 2018 costs. The finance ministry’s director general of budgeting Askolani declined to immediately comment. Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s estimated Pertamina has to “absorb lost profits” of $1.5 billion-$2 billion this year due to government controls on pump prices. Southeast Asia’s largest economy spent 97.6 trillion rupiah on energy subsidies last year. The finance ministry expected that to increase to 163.5 trillion in 2018 and to slightly decline to 160 trillion in 2019.

2018-11-28,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Torrential rain and gale force winds lashed Australia’s biggest city of Sydney on Wednesday causing commuter chaos, flooding streets, railway stations and homes, grounding flights and leaving hundreds of people without electricity. Police called on motorists to stay off the roads. One person was killed in a car crash and two police seriously injured when a tree fell on them as they helped a stranded driver. Greg Transell, an office manager in Sydney’s north, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that strong winds caused widespread disruption to the tower block office where he works. “I started to go upstairs to see if there was any damage and next minute there was an almighty bang and it ripped panels off the roof in the warehouse,” said Transell. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) Sydney got more than 100 mm of rain in just a few hours, a level that the country’s most populous city would normally get through the whole of November. “That’s the sort of rainfall you’d expect to see once every 100 years,” said Ann Farrell, the bureau’s state manager, told reporters. The rain offered a welcomed respite to farmers ho have suffered through a sustained drought in recent months, but it caused major disruptions to transport. Sydney airport, the country’s busiest, said 130 flights had been cancelled or delayed after it was forced to close two of its three runways. “The storm is pretty intense in and around the airport,” Cait Kyann, an airport spokeswoman, told Reuters.  “We are operating from a single runway so that means that there are delays and likely some flights will be cancelled.”  Ausgrid, the nation’s biggest electricity network, said the storm had cut power to 8,100 customers in Sydney and the Central Coast area to its north. By late afternoon, 1,700 homes and businesses remained without power, Ausgrid said. The storm struck only hours before the main morning peak hour, transforming some streets into fast-flowing rivers and parks into lakes. Several stranded motorists were plucked from rising floodwaters. “We are asking all road users to reconsider the need to be on the roads throughout what will be a severe rain event,” said New South Wales state Assistant Police Commissioner Michael Corboy. In contrast, in Australia’s northern state of Queensland, soaring temperatures near 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and strong winds exacerbated major bushfires. Firefighters have been battling for nearly a week to contain more than 130 fires across Queensland, and 8,000 people were ordered to evacuate the city of Gracemere, about 600 km (370 miles) north of the state capital, Brisbane. “These are unprecedented conditions,” said state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. “We have not seen the likes of this.” Reporting by Colin Packham; additional reporting by Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye; Editing by Michael Perry and Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/australia-weather-floods/update-3-once-in-100-year-storm-triggers-sydney-chaos-as-heat-fans-queensland-fires-idUKL4N1Y25OP,28 Nov 2018,"* Record temperatures fan deadly Queensland bushfires

2018-11-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is still committed to the NordStream 2 pipeline, which will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine in transporting gas to Europe, despite escalating tension in the region, a government spokesman in Berlin said on Wednesday. The United States and others have stepped up criticism of the project since Russia seized three Ukrainian ships near Crimea on Sunday. Critics say the pipeline will make Germany and Europe too dependent on Russia for its energy supplies. “I have taken note of the criticism but nothing has changed in the basic view of the economic project which is what NordStream is,” said German government spokesman Steffen Seibert. He added that Germany still wanted to ensure Ukraine would remain a transit country for gas from Russia to Europe. Earlier, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany had said NordStream 2 should be put on hold. Government officials later said that Chancellor Angela Merkel would discuss the latest tensions in Ukraine with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in meetings at the margins of this week’s G20 summit in Buenos Aires. The United States wants its European allies to consider further sanctions against Russia, the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations said on Wednesday. Several senior European politicians on Tuesday also raised the possibility of new sanctions against Russia to punish it for capturing the Ukrainian vessels, an incident the West fears could ignite a wider conflict.     But a spokesman for the German foreign ministry said the debate about further sanctions was premature.  “It’s a legal instrument that has consequences for those who are affected by the sanctions so that means you need to consider and discuss it carefully,” said the spokesman.

2018-11-28,"PARIS (Reuters) - Steel pipe maker Vallourec (VLLP.PA) denied on Wednesday it was preparing a vast redundancy plan for France though it said it was working on an action plan to boost competitiveness its  German operations. Vallourec made the comments in a statement issued after French weekly business magazine Challenges said Vallourec planned to cut jobs in France and Germany to reduce costs and its heavy debt burden. The report had said around 1,800 jobs, 1,200 at three sites in France, and 600 in Germany, could be affected by the cost-cutting measure. “Vallourec formally refutes the information that it is preparing a vast redundancy plan for France. The plan currently being implemented at the boiler line in Saint-Saulve will be finalized at the end of December 2018,” the statement said. Vallourec said the action plan for Germany will be submitted “in due time” to consultation and negotiation to staff representatives. It did not give a figure for job cuts in Germany.  The company, which supplies the oil and gas industry, has struggled to recover since oil prices crashed in 2015. In its third quarter results on Nov. 15, the company said it was continuing its transformation plan and was generating significant cost reductions, but did not give details. S&P Global Ratings said on Nov. 21 that although it expected Vallourec’s performance to continue to improve in the coming quarters, it believed this will happen at a slower pace than previously anticipated. S&P lowered Vallourec’s rating to “B-“ from “B” with a negative outlook. “The negative outlook reflects that we may further lower the rating over the next three to 12 months if improvement in Vallourec’s quarterly profits stalls following setbacks in the company’s cost reduction programs,” it said. As of Sept. 30, the company had reported net debt of 2.1 billion euros ($2.37 billion), the ratings agency said, adding that Vallourec’s key weakness remains its high cost position, notably in European assets.

2018-11-28,"MUMBAI, Nov 28 (Reuters) - India’s Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance (ABSLI) plans to increase its holdings in oil marketing companies as crude prices come under pressure and valuations in the sector turn attractive ahead of general elections next year. “I think over the last five years we’ve seen a huge re-rating of these stocks and a very sharp correction as we approach the elections,” Deven Sangoi, chief investment officer for equities at ABSLI, the life insurance arm of Aditya Birla Capital, told Reuters. The S&P BSE Oil and Gas index has lost more than 20 percent of its value since it touched a record high of 16,727.41 in November last year. Oil prices have slumped by more than 30 percent since early October, pressured by concerns supply will exceed demand in 2019 as economic growth slows. With U.S. inventories rising, it slipped to below $60 a barrel on Wednesday. Sangoi said he expected oil prices to remain between $50-$60 a barrel. Oil might even drop to $40 a barrel, if there is a demand shock due to a global growth slump, he added, potentially giving a boost to oil marketing companies’ margins. “If this oil call goes right, then I think oil marketing companies are a value,” said Sangoi, who manages about 280 billion rupees ($4 billion) in equities out of ABSLI’s 390 billion rupees of assets under management. Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp are among the top oil marketing companies in India. Sangoi’s bet also hinges on the outcome of national elections due by May. He said the current government had let oil marketing companies maintain their margins during a period of rising crude prices by passing the cost to consumers. Opinion polls show Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the front runner to win another five-year term, but his Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered reverses in recent local elections that have energised the opposition. Markets are looking now for cues from five key state elections in the next few weeks. “If the Modi government comes back, then this sector will just go through the roof,” Sangoi said. He is also betting on power generating companies next year, as a pick up in economic growth boosts demand for energy. “I’m a very firm believer that there is going to be very high growth in energy consumption, if we continue to grow at 6-7 percent,” Sangoi said. An increase in tariffs by the regulator and better capacity utilisation at power plants should also help these firms, he said. Elsewhere, Sangoi said he expected private sector banks, especially those with corporate clients, to benefit next year as non-banking financial firms suffer from an ongoing credit crisis and bad loans, which have plagued lenders, continue to dwindle. $1 = 70.5800 Indian rupees

2018-11-28,"SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Brazil’s government has backed out of its offer to host the United Nations climate conference next year due to budget constraints and a presidential transition, Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday. The conference is slated to be held in November next year. Last month, the Foreign Ministry announced Brazil’s offer to host the event in a press release, saying the meeting would work out final details of the Paris climate agreement and for signatory countries to fully implement its demands by 2020. Hosting the event would have confirmed Brazil’s “role as a world leader on sustainable development issues, especially in relation to climate change.” But in its emailed statement on Wednesday, the ministry said that after it carried out a detailed analysis that focused “on the financial needs associated with the event,” it was decided that the cost would be too much for the country to bear. Brazil, which has 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest within its borders, a biome scientists consider one of nature’s best defenses against global warming as it acts as a giant carbon sink, has made significant strides in the past 15 years to curtail destruction of the jungle. However, Brazil’s government reported last week that annual deforestation levels had hit their highest level in a decade. Critics said the decision to not host the climate conference was related to the election in late October of right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who will take office on Jan. 1. “The reversal to host the meeting is likely because of the opposition of the incoming government, which has already declared war on sustainable development on multiple occasions,” the environmental group Observatorio da Clima said in a release on its website. “It’s not the first and will not be the last awful news from Jair Bolsonaro on this theme.” Aides to Bolsonaro did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Bolsonaro has antagonized environmentalists by threatening to pull Brazil out of the Paris climate accord, although he also said late in October that he was not set on such a move if elected. Bolsonaro, who has called conservation efforts a threat to Brazilian sovereignty, had also sought to combine the environmental and agricultural ministries but later retreated from that proposal as well.

2018-11-28,"(Adds data, quotes, oil prices) Nov 28 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose for a 10th week in a row last week even as refineries boosted output and exports increased, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories rose 3.6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 23, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 769,000 barrels. After falling to two-and-a-half-year lows in September, crude stocks have risen 14 percent with 10 straight weeks of increases. That is the longest run of builds since autumn 2015, according to EIA figures. “This report does not paint a supportive picture for the market,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “I think now we’ve added more than 50 million barrels to U.S. crude stocks in the last three months.” The U.S. stockpile now sits at 450 million barrels, most in a year, not including the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Stocks in the SPR fell 2 million barrels last week, though it is unclear whether those barrels moved to commercial storage or were processed by refiners. Crude stockpiles rose despite production holding steady at 11.7 million barrels per day, though the EIA rounds off its weekly production figures to the nearest 100,000 bpd. Crude exports increased 473,000 bpd to 2.4 million bpd, but that was more than offset by an increase in crude imports, which rose to 8.2 million bpd. As a result, net imports edged up 135,000 bpd. Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky, said the Thanksgiving holiday week can produce anomalies with weekly inventory figures. Refinery crude runs rose by 698,000 bpd as utilization rates jumped 2.9 percentage points to 95.6 percent of total capacity. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. futures rose by 1.2 million barrels, EIA said. Prices fell after the data, but later recovered. U.S. crude futures were up 5 cents to $51.59 as of 11:34 a.m. EST (1634 GMT), while Brent lost 21 cents to $60.02 a barrel. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose 2.6 million barrels, versus expectations for a 857,000-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. U.S. ultra low sulfur diesel futures dropped on the news, falling more than 2 percent. Gasoline stocks fell 764,000 barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 640,000-barrel gain.

2018-11-28,"* Wall St gains on hopes of trade truce, Powell’s speech in focus * Dollar steady before Powell speech * China, U.S. could reach trade deal - Trump adviser Kudlow * But tariff fears subdue European markets, especially autos (Adds more details, background) By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Rising hopes that the United States and China could call a trade war ceasefire at the upcoming G20 summit boosted global stocks on Wednesday, but gains were held in check as investors looked ahead to a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Meanwhile, safe-haven assets came under pressure with the gain in equities, and sterling rose before the Bank of England released its Brexit analysis. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s tough remarks on the trade dispute ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, markets focused on comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who indicated the two countries could call a truce. “Any hint that the China-U.S. trade dispute could be resolved could make a pick-up in global growth,” said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Wall Street opened higher on hopes for a thaw in U.S.-China relations, with industrial stocks, which have borne the brunt of the protracted trade war, becoming one of the biggest gainers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 197.19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 24,945.92, the S&P 500 gained 6.49 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,688.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.35 points, or 0.22 percent, to 7,098.05. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.04 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.08 percent. Still, lingering caution that the two sides would leave the summit without an agreement capped gains, especially in Europe, which was hit on Tuesday by a report that Trump may soon decide about new taxes on imported cars. “If they come out with nothing this weekend, it’s going to be very bad,” said Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Swiss-based Woodman Asset Management. A rapprochement is seen as crucial, given that world growth and trade are already showing signs of an alarming slowdown. Investors were also eyeing a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for insight into the path of interest rate hikes. Powell’s speech at 12 p.m. EST (1700 GMT) will be evaluated for any new indications of caution as global growth slows and as the U.S. central bank comes under renewed criticism from Trump for raising interest rates. Uncertainty over global trade as well as Brexit and Italy’s conflict with the European Union, have supported the U.S. dollar, which hit a two-week high against a basket of currencies.

2018-11-28,"OSLO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Finnish state-owned gas firm Gasum plans to expand the processing capacity of its biogas plant in the city of Turku, making it the second largest such facility in the country, the firm said on Wednesday. As a result of the expansion, which is scheduled to be completed by September 2019, the plant will be able to produce some 60 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of biogas annually, Gasum said, around double its current levels. Increasing the production of biogas for use in business and transport is one of Finland’s energy and climate policy goals as it seeks to gradually phase out the use of coal. Ari Suomilammi, Gasum’s biomas production director, told Reuters that the total expansion, including investment for a liquefaction facility, would cost about 30 million euros. The project will allow the Turku plant, which is currently processing waste and sewage, to produce a higher concentration of biogas, which generates power and heating when burned. The plant is currently able to process about 75,000 tonnes of organic waste. From September 2019, its capacity will be as high as 110,000 tonnes. “This is a big step forward towards our goal of a low-carbon society and nutrient recycling – a genuine circular economy solution,” Gasum said in a statement. Gasum owns twelve biogas plants across Finland and expanded production in Sweden with the acquisition of Swedish Biogas International a year ago, a move that made it the biggest biogas producer in the Nordics. In October, Gasum started delivering liquefied biogas (LBG), a renewable version of liquefied natural gas (LNG), to Finnish customers.

2018-11-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump Administration has temporarily frozen a program meant to exempt small oil refineries in financial distress from the U.S. biofuels law, as it reviews the scoring system to evaluate applications, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The review means changes are likely to the program, which has become a lightning rod of controversy between the rival oil and corn industries since the Environmental Protection Agency vastly increased the number of waivers for last year. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must increasingly blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do. The regulation was passed in 2005 to help farmers and cut fuel imports. But small oil refineries can be exempted from the standard if they prove that compliance would cause disproportionate hardship. The EPA granted 29 such waivers for the 2017 compliance year, up from 14 in 2015 and 20 in 2016. The biofuels industry and lawmakers representing farm states want the program halted, saying the expansion hurt farmers by eroding demand for ethanol. But refiners consider the program a lifeline to small facilities and have won lawsuits accusing the EPA of being too stingy with waivers. The two sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter, said over the past week that the Trump administration was delaying consideration of any new waivers while the Department of Energy reviews its scoring system for applications. The department evaluates waiver requests and provides recommendations to the EPA. That has placed on hold seven applications for the 2017 compliance year, and 15 applications for the 2018. Typically, the EPA waits until the latter half of the year to begin reviewing applications because applicants need to demonstrate financial hardship using hard figures for their facilities. An EPA official confirmed the review. “I think what DOE needs to do is tighten up their approach and we need to do the same,” said the official, who asked not to be named. “I honestly don’t know where they’ll end up and whether they’re going to make any changes at all.” Whatever the outcome, it could have a dramatic impact on the multibillion-dollar credit trading market, which has been hard-hit by the waiver expansion. “This is a promising and long overdue development that shows Acting Administrator (Andrew) Wheeler cares about righting the ship at EPA after the prior administrator’s mismanagement and poor leadership. There’s no good reason multibillion-dollar oil refineries making record profits should receive so-called ‘hardship’ waivers exempting them from following the law,” U.S. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said in a statement on Wednesday. Credits, called Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs, have plummeted in value from over $1 to 10 cents this week as reports emerged of the number of EPA waivers granted last year. Some of those went to facilities owned by big, profitable companies like Chevron Corp  and Andeavor, which recently merged with Marathon Petroleum Corp, Reuters has reported.   That cut in credit prices has saved hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs for merchant refiners that lack enough biofuel blending facilities, like Valero Energy Corp, PBF Energy Inc  and Carl Icahn’s CVR Energy Inc. The issue has placed President Donald Trump in a tough spot between two key constituencies, trying to support the agriculture industry slammed by the impact of his trade war with China while also keeping costs down for the oil industry. Biofuel supporters contended the expansion of the waiver program was politically driven by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, an Oklahoman considered an oil industry ally. Pruitt resigned in July in a flurry of ethical scandals, and has been replaced by Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist.  “Under the last EPA chief, the waiver program became a cookie jar open to every well-connected refinery owner, and we’re seeing the results across rural America with biofuel plants closing their doors or idling production,” said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council.  The EPA has blamed the program’s expansion on recent federal court rulings, triggered by challenges filed by small refining companies Holly Frontier and Sinclair, which said the agency was using too strict of a test to determine disproportionate hardship. All hardship applications are first handled by the Energy Department, which determines whether compliance would lead to disproportionate impact, or threaten a refinery’s viability. The final decision on applications rests with the EPA.

2018-11-28,"ONITSHA, Nigeria (Reuters) - The main challenger in Nigeria’s election next year aims to outflank President Muhammadu Buhari by campaigning in a sometimes neglected part of the country where the incumbent is deeply unpopular: the southeast. With a tight race in prospect, a strong showing there could give Atiku Abubakar the votes he needs to deny Buhari, a former military ruler, a second four-year term as the elected leader of one of Africa’s most powerful nations.       Abubakar is targeting regional voters - who are mostly members of the Igbo ethnic group - through his choice of a local running mate and policies designed to meet calls for autonomy.   The numbers are tempting. There were 7.5 million registered voters in the five states of the southeast out of 67.4 million nationwide at the last election, in 2015.  The number of new voters registered in the southeast has grown faster than in other regions, according to electoral commission figures seen by Reuters.  The opposition will still need to overcome voter apathy in the southeast, where people have long felt there is little point in voting since presidents tend to be northerners from the Hausa ethnic group or Yoruba people from the southwest. While presidential elections in Nigeria are usually cast as a fight between the mainly Muslim north and the predominantly Christian south, victory may depend on a candidate attracting votes from outside his ethnic and religious base. At this stage, most analysts expect a closely fought contest on Feb. 16, with some predicting a narrow victory for Abubakar.  Buhari is popular across the north, so it suits Abubakar to target a region where the president lacks support. Buhari’s unpopularity in the southeast stems from his decision to send troops on to the streets last year to crack down on secessionists. The issue is sensitive. For many, the deployment was a reminder of the 1967-70 war over Biafra, a short-lived breakaway nation that was predominantly Igbo. Around a million people died, mostly from starvation and disease, before central government forces prevailed, and many in the southeast feel Igbos have been marginalised ever since. An  Igbo has not been president or vice president since Nigeria’s most recent transition to civilian rule in 1999.  If there are votes for Abubakar in the southeast, he may also win support among the many Igbos living elsewhere in Nigeria.   Abubakar named Peter Obi, a former southeastern governor, as his running mate in October and proposed devolving more power to regions in a policy dubbed “restructuring” that promises to give states greater control over their finances. Advertising hoardings for the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) featuring Abubakar’s smiling face alongside that of Obi outnumber those for Buhari in the southeastern cities of Onitsha and Enugu. Chukwunonye Okereke, director general of Southeast Youths for Atiku, a PDP organisation, said: “The people in the southeast have not been treated fairly by this government. He (Buhari) has been a ruler of marginalisation.” Abubakar himself said in a tweet earlier this month: “I am 100% for 100% of Nigerians 100% of the time. Nigerians should never be divided by ethnic or religious lines. We must be united. We are ONE Nigeria.” The comment may have struck a chord in the southeast since it reflects criticism that Buhari has governed as a northern president concerned only with northern people. A group of influential Igbo traditional rulers earlier this month endorsed Abubakar - a move that gives them potential access to important patronage networks if he wins.   Buhari is unpopular among market stallholders and shoppers in Onitsha, the biggest city in Anambra State.    “I don’t want Buhari any longer in this country. We pray there will be a change,” said Ifeoma Eze, who runs a business selling plantains.  “In Nigeria everybody is crying - there is no money. The money is not circulating,” she said, complaining about the government’s handling of the economy, which experienced its first recession in 25 years in 2016, only emerging last year.  Eric Onyeka, who runs a toiletries stall, said: “We have had economic instability since 2015,” - the year Buhari took office.  Buhari’s supporters say much criticism is based on ethnic and religious prejudices rather than his policies.  “The current infrastructure that has been put in place surpasses what the People’s Democratic Party did in 16 years,” said Ebubeagu Okafor, a spokesman for Buhari’s All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu. He said Buhari’s administration had improved roads between the region’s major cities and was developing a railway line to link the southeast with the oil heartland and the northeast.  Okafor also cited the resumption of building work on the Second Niger Bridge, a major river crossing, as an example of Buhari’s commitment to the region. Abubakar is thought to be betting that Buhari’s largesse may not be enough to win the region. “Atiku is probably banking on a growing voter population in these traditional PDP strongholds, combined with a higher turnout of Igbo voters who want to see an Igbo vice president,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, West Africa analyst at Teneo, a consultancy. Liewerscheidt also said Abubakar’s courting of the Igbo vote could help him elsewhere.  “Igbo support could also prove decisive in other regions, particularly the southwest, as there are huge Igbo communities scattered across the country. In a key battleground state such as Lagos, this could swing the vote in Atiku’s favour,” he said.

2018-11-28,"PARIS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - French steel pipe maker Vallourec plans to cut jobs in France and Germany to reduce costs and its heavy debt burden, French weekly business magazine Challenges said on Wednesday. The report said around 1,800 jobs, 1,200 at three sites in France, and 600 in Germany, could be affected by the cost-cutting measure. A spokesman for the company declined to comment. The company, which supplies the oil and gas industry, has struggled to recover since oil prices crashed in 2015. In its third quarter results on Nov. 15, the company said it was continuing its transformation plan and was generating significant cost reductions, but did not give details. S&P Global Ratings said on Nov. 21 that although it expected Vallourec’s performance to continue to improve in the coming quarters, it believed this will happen at a slower pace than previously anticipated. S&P lowered Vallourec’s rating to “B-“ from “B” with a negative outlook. “The negative outlook reflects that we may further lower the rating over the next three to 12 months if improvement in Vallourec’s quarterly profits stalls following setbacks in the company’s cost reduction programs,” it said. As of Sept. 30, the company had reported net debt of 2.1 billion euros ($2.37 billion), the ratings agency said, adding that Vallourec’s key weakness remains its high cost position, notably in European assets. Vallourec said after the rating announcement that its liquidity situation was sound. The company’s shares are down 56.6 percent year-to-date. $1 = 0.8861 euros

While President Donald Trump talked tough on the trade tariffs issue ahead of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, markets focused on comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who held open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal. A rapprochement is seen as crucial, given that world growth and trade are already showing signs of an alarming slowdown. Kudlow’s comments allowed Chinese and Japanese shares to rally 1 percent  while MSCI’s all-country equity index was up 0.15 percent and the pan-European benchmark rose 0.2 percent. Futures indicated a firm opening on Wall Street, with the S&P500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones tipped to rise between 0.3-0.5 percent  . There was some caution, however, especially in Europe, which was hit on Tuesday by a report that Trump may soon decide about new taxes on imported cars. Europe’s auto sector shares were 0.3 percent in the red. “An expectation is being priced into markets ahead of the G20 meeting that we will see some deal or at least a framework for a deal between Trump and Xi Jinping,” said Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Swiss-based Woodman Asset Management. “But if they come out with nothing this weekend, it’s going to be very bad.” The uncertainty over global trade as well as Brexit and Italy’s conflict with the European Union, are supporting the U.S. dollar, which is at a two-week high against a basket of currencies. While the main driver for the greenback is the U.S. interest rate path, Rodrigo Catril, senior strategist at National Australia Bank, said it was also benefiting from the uncertain mood. “Markets seem to be jumping at shadows at the moment and against this backdrop of uncertainty, the dollar remains the preferred option for weathering the storm,” Catril said. With the currency index approaching 1-1/2-year highs reached earlier this month, traders are focusing on a speech at 1700 GMT by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to see if he offers clues on how many more times the Fed could raise interest rates. While Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida took a less dovish stance on Tuesday than some had expected and backed more rate rises, Powell and his colleagues have in recent weeks alluded to global volatility, leading many to speculate the bank’s three-year-long rate rise campaign could pause in 2019. . However most reckon the Fed is on track to tighten policy in December and early-2019 at least. “My base case is the dollar will strengthen versus the euro and pound into year-end, as the euro zone and Britain are both struggling with their own problems — Brexit and Italy,” Woodman’s Berg said. Sterling climbed off two-week lows to rise 0.4 percent by 1215 GMT, having touched a session-high of $1.2806 after the opposition’s main finance spokesman John McDonnell said he could accept a second Brexit referendum. Against the euro it rose half a percent to touch a high of 88.105 pence McDonnell’s comments raise hopes that the Labour Party will more firmly back putting the Brexit issue to a second vote, should Prime Minister Theresa May fail to convince sceptical lawmakers of the benefits of her Brexit deal ahead of a December 11 parliamentary vote. Investors are monitoring developments in Italy’s row with the EU over its budget spending, with Germany’s Handelsblatt and Italy’s La Stampa quoting EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis as saying the draft budget needed “substantial correction”. Italian bond yields flatlined after sharp rallies that were triggered by what appeared to be a more conciliatory stance from the government over the issue. On other markets, cryptocurrency bitcoin jumped 6 percent to above $4,000, extending its rebound from a low of $3,475 touched on Sunday.

2018-11-28,"ABUJA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will not cut oil output on its own to stabilize the market, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday as Nigeria and Russia said it is too early to signal whether they would join any production curbs. Oil producer group OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, meet in Vienna next week against the backdrop of concerns over a slowing global economy and rising oil supplies from the United States, which is not involved in an existing agreement to restrain output. The negative economic outlook helped to push oil LCOc1 below $60 a barrel this week from as high as $85 in October, prompting Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), to suggest significant production cuts. Riyadh, however, has come under renewed pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who asked the kingdom to refrain from output reductions and help to lower oil prices further. Possibly complicating any decision on oil output is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh.  Falih was in Abuja to meet his Nigerian counterpart Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu. The Saudi minister said signals from fellow OPEC members Iraq, Nigeria and Libya were positive ahead of the group’s Dec. 6 talks because all ministers want to restore oil market stability. “We are going to ... do whatever is necessary, but only if we act together as a group of 25,” Falih told reporters, referring to OPEC and its allies. “As Saudi Arabia we cannot do it alone, we will not do it alone. “Everybody is longing (to) reach a decision that brings stability back to the market ... I think people know that leaving the market to its own devices with no clarity and no collective decision to balance the market is not helping.” Brent oil LCOc1 edged down towards $60 on Wednesday, erasing early gains of more than 1 percent, with the market unconvinced on the prospect of OPEC cuts next week. Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Crown Prince Mohammed in Argentina at this weekend’s G20 summit, which Trump will also attend. Moscow has so far resisted joining any new production cuts and Falih did not say whether he had heard of any change in Russia’s position. Speaking in Moscow, Putin said Russia was in touch with OPEC but Moscow would be satisfied with oil at $60 a barrel. Putin previously said Russia would be satisfied with a price of $70. “We are in contact with OPEC and we are ready to continue our joint efforts if needed,” Putin said.  Russian energy minister Alexander Novak met Russian oil producers this week to discuss cooperation with OPEC, two industry sources said without providing details. Nigeria’s Kachikwu told reporters it was too early to say whether OPEC member Nigeria would participate in any cuts but added that there was “absolute resolve” within the organization to stabilize the market. Falih this month said that the abundant supply of oil could require OPEC and its allies to reduce output in 2019. He said at the time that supply could exceed demand by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd), or 1 percent of global demand, suggesting that OPEC and its allies may try to reduce production by that amount. Asked on Wednesday whether cuts could be deeper than 1.4 million bpd, Falih declined to answer. Nigeria and Libya were excluded from the previous cuts because of production declines caused by unrest, though their output has now recovered. Iran was also largely exempt from cuts.

2018-11-28,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark’s Orsted will invest $30 billion in green energy up to 2025, it said on Wednesday, as it seeks to become one of a handful of future “renewable majors” leading a global transition from fossil fuels to green energy. While renewable energy technology is now able to compete with traditional power sources, the industry remains vulnerable to changing political winds as governments around the world scramble on how to address climate change.  Orsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer, said it would have 15 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power capacity by 2025, up from a previous target of 11-12 GW and plans to further double capacity by 2030 to more than 30 GW.  One of the key drivers will be expansion in the nascent U.S. market, where it recently made two acquisitions to gain a foothold in both onshore and offshore wind. U.S. President Donald Trump has blasted renewable energy as expensive, accused wind turbines of killing birds and ruining landscapes while vowing to revive the coal industry. While Trump this week rejected projections from his own government that climate change will cause severe economic harm, many states have set ambitious targets to source energy from carbon-free sources. However, so far the impact on Orsted’s business has not been negative, its U.S. chief told Reuters. “It has been quite positive under this administration,” Thomas Brostrom said, pointing to efforts to remove red tape around environmental approvals and new auctions for acreage.  He said the efforts were driven more by consideration for energy independency and job creation rather than reducing carbon emissions.  Orsted is also betting big on growing in Taiwan, which with a big push to attract investments in renewable technology, has become a key battleground for the world’s top offshore wind developers seeking a foothold in Asia. However, Orsted acknowledged that offshore wind projects in Taiwan could face delays after voters last week decided against a government plan to abolish nuclear power.  The vote prompted Taiwan to scrap its target of having no nuclear power by 2025 and to review its energy policy, which since 2011 has been driven by the Fukushima nuclear accident. Before the vote, the island’s offshore wind market was expected to expand to 5.5 GW by 2025, with government investments into onshore and offshore wind of $23 billion.  “It was not a vote to stop the nuclear phase-out,” senior vice president at Orsted, Thyge Boserup, said.  “I think it’s rather the speed of the phase-out that is up for discussion,” he said.

2018-11-28,"MEDIA, PENNSYLVANIA (Reuters) - Energy Transfer LP (ET.N) and its Sunoco pipeline subsidiary have racked up more than 800 state and federal permit violations while racing to build two of the nation’s largest natural gas pipelines, according to a Reuters analysis of government data and regulatory records. The pipelines, known as Energy Transfer Rover and Sunoco Mariner East 2, will carry natural gas and gas liquids from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, an area that now accounts for more than a third of U.S. gas production. Reuters analyzed four comparable pipeline projects and found they averaged 19 violations each during construction. The Rover and Mariner violations included spills of drilling fluid, a clay-and-water mixture that lubricates equipment for drilling under rivers and highways; sinkholes in backyards; and improper disposal of hazardous waste and other trash. Fines topped $15 million. Energy Transfer also raised the ire of federal regulators by tearing down a historic house along Rover’s route. The Appalachia region has become a hub for natural gas as it increasingly replaces coal for U.S. power generation, creating an urgent need for new pipelines. But the recent experience of residents and regulators with the two Energy Transfer pipelines has state officials vowing to tighten laws and scrutinize future projects. “Ohio’s negative experience with Rover has fundamentally changed how we will permit pipeline projects,”  said James Lee, a spokesman for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Problems with Mariner prompted Pennsylvania legislators to craft bills tightening construction regulations, which have drawn bipartisan support. “Any pipeline going through this area is going to face resistance which it would not have faced before,” said Pennsylvania State Senator Andy Dinniman, a Democrat. Energy Transfer spokeswoman Alexis Daniel said the firm remained committed to safe construction and operation and at times went “above and beyond” regulations for the two projects.  Construction of the 713-mile, $4.2 billion Rover started in March 2017 and was planned to proceed at about 89 miles a month, while work on the 350-mile, $2.5 billion Mariner East 2 started in February 2017 and was planned at 50 miles a month, according to company statements on construction schedules. Both were targeted for completion late last year. Regulators and industry experts said the pace of both projects far exceeded industry norms. The four other projects examined by Reuters were mostly completed at a pace averaging 17 miles per month. Reuters selected the projects for comparison because, like Rover and Mariner, they cost more than $1.5 billion, stretched at least 150 miles and were under construction at the same time.  Construction on both Energy Transfer pipelines was ultimately slowed when state and federal regulators ordered numerous work stoppages after permit violations. Energy Transfer completed the last two sections of Rover in November and said it expects to put Mariner East 2 in service soon. In February, Pennsylvania fined the company $12.6 million for environmental damage, including the discharge of drilling fluids into state waters without a permit. After further problems, including the sinkholes, a state judge in May ordered work halted on Mariner East 2. Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Barnes wrote that Energy Transfer’s Sunoco unit “made deliberate managerial decisions to proceed in what appears to be a rushed manner in an apparent prioritization of profit over the best engineering.”   While pipeline construction schedules vary, the planned timelines for Rover and Mariner were ambitious, said Fred Jauss, partner at Dorsey & Whitney in Washington and a former attorney with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates interstate gas pipelines. “They aren’t taking their time ... we’re all concerned about it,” said Pennsylvania State Senator John Rafferty, a Republican, referring to other state politicians, constituents and first responders.  Energy Transfer spokeswoman Lisa Dillinger told Reuters the schedules were “appropriate for the size, scope, and the number of contractors hired.” Other companies that planned slower construction of comparable projects have finished mostly on schedule with almost no violations. Canadian energy company Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), for instance, recently finished a $2.6 billion, 255-mile pipeline - following a path similar to Rover through Ohio and Michigan - with just seven violations. Enbridge did not respond to a request for comment. Energy Transfer, now one of the nation’s largest pipeline operators, encountered large protests led by Native American tribes and environmental activists over the route of its Dakota Access crude oil line in North Dakota in 2016 and has seen protests of Mariner East 2 in Pennsylvania, where opponents have highlighted its safety record on existing pipelines. The company has had a relatively high incidence of hazardous liquid spills and other problems, according to a Reuters review of data from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Energy Transfer’s Sunoco unit ranked third worst among all pipeline companies in average annual incidents between 2010 and 2017, according to the PHMSA data. In total, Energy Transfer and its affiliated companies released more than 41,000 barrels of hazardous liquids causing more than $100 million in property damage, PHMSA data shows. (For a graphic on PHMSA incidents by company, see: tmsnrt.rs/2EHd3E4 ) Bibianna Dussling of Media, Pennsylvania, joined a group of activists protesting Mariner East after learning the project’s route would pass near her daughter’s elementary school. “The violations are really meaningless to them,” she said. “You do so much to protect your children day-to-day, and to face something like this, that you feel is so much out of your hands.” Energy Transfer’s Dillinger said incidents have been sharply reduced since the merger of Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners into one company, Energy Transfer, in the spring of 2017. Incidents this year are “trending below industry average,” she said. The Rover pipeline attracted additional federal scrutiny when Energy Transfer demolished a historic house along its route. After Energy Transfer bought the 1843 Stoneman house in Ohio, FERC staff in February 2016 required the firm to come up with a plan to prevent adverse effects on the property, according to a staff’s environmental report.  Instead, the company tore down the house in May 2016 without notifying FERC or the Ohio State Historic Preservation Office.  That led FERC to deny Energy Transfer a so-called blanket certificate that would have allowed the company to construct Rover with less oversight, noting the demolition convinced regulators the company “cannot be trusted” to comply with environmental regulations. Energy Transfer did not comment on the denial but said in a statement that it had “resolved all outstanding issues” with the demolition and donated more than $4 million to the Ohio preservation office. Once Energy Transfer started building Rover, FERC and West Virginia regulators required the company to halt work on parts of the project after violations, including the release of an estimated 2 million gallons of drilling fluid into wetlands near the Tuscarawas River in Ohio in April 2017.  (For a breakdown of Rover’s 681 federal violations, see: tmsnrt.rs/2PUGmYr .) In Pennsylvania, Mariner East 2 has received more than 80 notices of violation from the state’s Department of Environmental Protection, mostly for accidental release of drilling fluids. Drilling fluids can impair the natural flow of streams and rivers and harm an area’s ecosystem, said Lynda Farrell, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Coalition.  The Ohio Attorney General filed a lawsuit in November 2017 seeking about $2.6 million from Rover and some of the construction companies building the pipeline for the alleged illegal discharge of millions of gallons of drilling fluids into state waters, among other things. That lawsuit is ongoing.  Energy Transfer’s Dillinger said the company was “disappointed” that the Ohio AG sued after the company tried to resolve issues amicably and that it would continue cooperating with regulators. “We continue to work closely with both state regulators to resolve any outstanding issues related to our construction,” she said.

2018-11-28,"NEW YORK, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The Trump Administration has temporarily frozen a program meant to exempt small oil refineries in financial distress from the U.S. biofuels law, as it reviews the scoring system to evaluate applications, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The review means changes are likely to the program, which has become a lightning rod of controversy between the rival oil and corn industries since the Environmental Protection Agency vastly increased the number of waivers for last year. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must increasingly blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do. The regulation was passed in 2005 to help farmers and cut fuel imports. But small oil refineries can be exempted from the standard if they prove that compliance would cause disproportionate hardship. The EPA granted 29 such waivers for the 2017 compliance year, up from 14 in 2015 and 20 in 2016. The biofuels industry and lawmakers representing farm states have argued that the expansion hurt farmers by eroding demand for ethanol and want the program halted. But refiners consider the program a lifeline to small facilities and have won lawsuits accusing the EPA of being too stingy with waivers. The two sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter, said over the past week that the Trump administration was delaying consideration of any new waivers while the Department of Energy reviews its scoring system for applications. The department evaluates waiver requests and provides recommendations to the EPA. That has placed on hold seven applications for the 2017 compliance year, and 15 applications for the 2018. Typically, the EPA waits until the latter half of the year to begin reviewing applications because applicants need to demonstrate financial hardship using hard figures for their facilities. An EPA official confirmed the review. “I think what DOE needs to do is tighten up their approach and we need to do the same,” said the official, who asked not to be named. “I honestly don’t know where they’ll end up and whether they’re going to make any changes at all.” Whatever the outcome, it could have a dramatic impact on the multi-billion-dollar credit trading market, which has been hard-hit by the waiver expansion. Credits, called Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs, have dropped in value from over $1 to 10 cents this week as reports emerged of the number of EPA waivers granted last year. Some of those went to facilities owned by big, profitable companies like Chevron Corp and Andeavor, which recently merged with Marathon Petroleum Corp, Reuters has reported. That cut in credit prices has saved merchant refiners that lack enough biofuel blending facilities, like Valero Energy Corp, PBF Energy Inc and Carl Icahn’s CVR Energy Inc hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs. The issue has placed President Donald Trump in a tough spot between two key constituencies, as he tries to support the agriculture industry slammed by the impact of his trade war with China, and keep costs down for the oil industry. Biofuel supporters had argued the expansion of the waiver program was politically driven by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, an Oklahoman considered an oil industry ally. Pruitt resigned in July in a flurry of ethical scandals, and has been replaced by Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist. “Under the last EPA chief, the waiver program became a cookie jar open to every well-connected refinery owner, and we’re seeing the results across rural America with biofuel plants closing their doors or idling production,” Brook Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said. The EPA has blamed the program’s expansion on recent federal court rulings, triggered by challenges filed by small refining companies Holly Frontier and Sinclair, which said the agency was using too strict of a test to determine disproportionate hardship. All hardship applications are first handled by the Energy Department, which determines whether compliance would lead to disproportionate impact, or threaten a refinery’s viability. The final decision on applications rests with the EPA.

2018-11-28,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Cassandra Garrison and Matt Spetalnick BUENOS AIRES/WASHINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Argentina and China are aiming to close a deal within days for the construction of the South American nation’s fourth nuclear power plant, a multi-billion dollar project that would cement Beijing’s deepening influence in a key regional U.S. ally. Argentina hopes to announce an agreement on the Chinese-financed construction of the Atucha III nuclear power plant during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit on Sunday following the summit of leaders of G20 industrialized nations in Buenos Aires, Juan Pablo Tripodi, head of Argentina’s national investment agency, told Reuters in an interview. The potential deal, reportedly worth up to $8 billion, is emblematic of China’s strengthening of economic, diplomatic and cultural ties with Argentina. It is part of a wider push by Beijing into Latin America that has alarmed the United States, which views the region as its backyard and is suspicious of China’s motives. The focus of this week’s meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of G20 will be on their two countries’ trade war, but the backdrop will be the competition between the powers for influence in Latin America. When Argentina negotiated a $56.3 billion financing deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rescue its troubled economy earlier this year, Trump voiced his support for the plan and President Mauricio Macri’s leadership. But it is China that has emerged as Argentina’s critical trading partner, investor and financier, a Reuters review of trade and investment data shows, with Beijing pumping billions into Argentina’s economy and positioning itself as a reliable lender for its crisis-stricken economy. China and Argentina are expected to seal a currency swap deal this weekend that doubles the original amount of the credit line to $18.7 billion. The deal will make China the biggest non-institutional lender to Argentina. China is the main importer of Argentine soybeans, the South American country’s biggest cash crop. In the last 10 years, it has also emerged as a major financier of Argentine projects, mainly infrastructure, worth a total of about $18 billion, offering low interest rates of between 3 and 4 percent, according to a Reuters review of Chinese state funding data compiled by the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based non-profit think-tank. (For more on China’s economic ties with Argentina see) The negotiations on Chinese financing of the Atucha III nuclear power plant are a key cause for concern for the U.S. government, a senior Trump administration official told Reuters. Atucha III would be one of the biggest projects financed by China in Argentina, according to the Reuters review of Chinese state funding data. Argentina’s national newspaper Clarin reported at the weekend that if the deal was signed, China would loan Argentina $6.5 billion to be repaid in 20 years, with eight years of grace and a 4.5 percent annual interest. Reuters was not able to independently confirm these details. “These are infrastructure projects where China is coming in and providing very low interest loans or they are just having Chinese companies do it,” the U.S. official said. “It’s creating an economic and political dependency on China that’s incredibly dangerous.” The message to Macri and other regional leaders is increasingly that “your sovereignty can be lost by being so ensnared in debt, you can lose your sovereignty to the person who holds your debt,” the U.S. official said. China’s foreign ministry strongly disputes that view. “China’s investment and financing in Latin America are in line with market rules and common international rules and practices, and do not have any political conditions attached,” the ministry said in a statement to Reuters. The involvement of Chinese companies in water, power and road projects has helped to drive Argentine economic and social development, it said. Defending Argentina’s relationship with China, an Argentine government official told Reuters that Beijing was an important investor and would only become more important in the future. However, the official acknowledged the U.S. concerns were not without merit. “Overall, I would say it’s a fair warning and it’s something countries should take into consideration. I think Argentina takes it into consideration very seriously,” the official said. China’s attraction to Argentina can be attributed to three factors: natural resources, weak institutions, and the country’s lack of other financing options, according to Juan Uriburu, an Argentine lawyer who has worked on two major Argentina-China joint ventures. “China can afford to have these competitive (interest) rates. In the meantime, what they create are new markets for Chinese companies abroad, which back home means Chinese companies will be working, making the products, making the locomotives, the cars, the rails, everything,” Uriburu said. Tripodi, the Argentine investment agency head, credited Macri’s more business-friendly policies for the uptick in Chinese investment. Interest from Chinese companies was growing “in an exponential way,” he said. As a presidential candidate, Macri pledged to recalibrate Argentina’s relationship with China. Under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez, Argentina had changed the law to enable Chinese companies to skip the bidding process if they were financing projects, according to Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at Inter-American Dialogue. When Macri took office in late 2015, he vowed to review deals the Fernandez government had made with China. Atucha III, a railway project and two hydropower dams in Santa Cruz province, which her late husband had governed, were among projects thrown into limbo. Cross-cancellation clauses, however, have made it difficult for Macri to terminate the largest projects, said Uriburu. Macri has instead renegotiated some terms, including bringing down the loan amount for the hydro dams from $4.7 billion to $4 billion. In Brazil, Latin America’s biggest economy, right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro also took a tough stance against China on the campaign trail, portraying it as a predator seeking to dominate key business sectors. But since winning election Bolsonaro has softened his position, saying China is welcome to invest in Brazil and that trade between the two countries could grow. China’s influence in Argentina extends beyond the numbers. For example, it has established Confucius institutes, cultural organizations, at Argentina’s largest university, the University of Buenos Aires, and a second college in Buenos Aires province. Some U.S. lawmakers have warned that the institutes, which number more than 100 around the world, are an attempt by China to further its political influence, which Beijing denies. In one of the most visible examples of Chinese soft power in Argentina, the government held a nationally televised event with the Chinese ambassador earlier this month to showcase armored vehicles and other security equipment that China has donated to help secure the G20 event. Argentine security officials told Reuters they would hold a separate event to highlight U.S. aid for the summit, which begins on Friday. That has yet to happen.

2018-11-28,"ZURICH, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Four years of negotiations have failed to yield a breakthrough on a new treaty between Switzerland and the European Union, by far its biggest trading partner. The Swiss cabinet is due to address the situation on Friday. Leaders doubt that any proposed treaty could win the backing of parliament or from voters in a referendum under the Swiss system of direct democracy. Failure of the talks could send shock waves through Switzerland that go far beyond a diplomatic deep freeze. Brussels has threatened not to extend beyond this year recognition of Swiss exchange regulation that allows cross-border trading, depriving the SIX Swiss Exchange of EU-based business that generates more than half its volume. The Swiss government is preparing countermeasures designed to bring trading of Swiss stocks back to Switzerland from EU bourses. Bern would ban EU bourses from hosting trading of Swiss stocks, exposing EU bourse officials to punitive measures if they did not comply. The tit-for-tat escalation could disrupt financial flows, making it “significantly harder” to launch initial public offerings of shares in Switzerland given the absence of demand from the EU, one Swiss official said. Swiss Energy Minister Doris Leuthard has lobbied for a deal that would create an electricity union with the EU, fostering cross-border flows and ensuring power supplies to Switzerland in emergencies. But the EU has said the Swiss will get no new access to its single market without a new treaty, scuppering chances for a new power bloc. The 120 sectoral accords that now govern ties include a pact on mutual recognition of industrial standards that need to get updated as new rules take effect. Swiss officials have cited medical technology as an exposed sector. It employs around 58,500 people and generated sales of 15.8 billion Swiss francs ($15.8 billion) last year. “If the mutual recognition agreement or the equivalency fails, we in industry would have to deal with significant custom requirements again and all of the associated costs,” said Matthias Buerger, vice president for global regulatory affairs at Zimmer Biomet, which makes replacement joints and spinal implants in Winterthur. “It’s definitely not something we would want to happen, but it’s less of a reason to panic than a hard Brexit,” he told Reuters. Switzerland could lose access to the EU’s Horizon Europe programme, which starts in 2021 and funds research and innovation. Brussels temporarily blocked Switzerland from the current Horizon 2020 programme, hurting Swiss research, after Swiss voters in 2014 approved a referendum campaign to curb immigration from the EU despite accords ensuring the free movement of people. $1 = 0.9996 Swiss francs

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.7 percent, led by advance in Taiwan and China. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.0 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose as much as 1.4 percent to hit a more than seven-week high while mainland blue-chip shares climbed 1.3 percent. “The Chinese government would really not want to let share prices fall further given the problem of shares pledged as collateral by firms,” said Naoki Tashiro, president of TS China Research in Tokoname, Japan. European shares are expected to open higher, with financial spreadbetters pointing to gains of 0.4-0.5 percent in Britain’s FTSE, France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX. After President Donald Trump rattled investors by talking tough ahead of a highly-anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina on Saturday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow sought to brighten the mood by holding open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal. Beijing’s ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, told Reuters that China is going to the G-20 summit hoping for a deal to ease a damaging trade war with the United States, though he warned of dire consequences if U.S. hardliners try to separate the world’s two largest economies. Markets were shaken on Tuesday after Trump told the Wall Street Journal it was “highly unlikely” he would accept China’s request to hold off on a planned increase in tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent. All in all, it was still unclear whether the two sides had agreed on a formal agenda for the Trump-Xi meeting after the G20 summit and Kudlow said there were no scheduled talks on the ground for their advisers. Also on Tuesday, a German magazine published a report citing European Union sources saying Trump could impose tariffs on imported cars from next week, which sent European auto stocks sharply lower. “The market mood has turned cautious once again amid a flurry of trade headlines pointing to the prospect of a new round of trade tariffs ahead,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior strategist at National Australia Bank. “The market seems to be jumping at shadows at the moment and against this backdrop of uncertainty the USD remains the preferred option for weathering the storm.” The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, jumped overnight to 97.497 to edge towards a 1-1/2 year top of 97.661 earlier this month. It was last at 97.349. Investors will now turn attention to a speech on Wednesday by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for further clues on how many more times the U.S. central bank is likely to raise interest rates. The event has become more critical as signs of a global slowdown and nearly two months of market volatility have clouded an otherwise rosy U.S. picture, prompting speculation the Fed will go slow on rate hikes next year. Traders will watch the speech in light of Trump’s criticism of Powell in a newspaper interview in which the president said interest rates and other Fed policies were damaging the U.S. economy. In the foreign exchange market, the pound was among the worst performing major currencies overnight. It was last flat at $1.2748. British Prime Minister Theresa May will take her Brexit sales pitch to Scotland on Wednesday where she will likely face an uphill struggle to convince sceptical voters of the benefits of her deal for businesses. May needs to win a Dec. 11 parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal but that looks difficult with an apparent large majority of lawmakers - including the Scottish National Party with 35 of Scotland’s 59 seats in parliament - opposed to it. Elsewhere bitcoin jumped 6 percent to above $4,000, extending its rebound from a low of $3,475 touched on Sunday. In commodity markets, oil was cautiously higher ahead of an OPEC meeting next week at which the producer club is expected to decide on some form of supply cut to counter an emerging glut. The shutdown of Britain’s largest North Sea oilfield for repairs also supported prices. U.S. crude futures added 78 cents to $52.34 a barrel. Brent climbed 87 cents to $61.08. Despite a rise early Wednesday, oil prices have still fallen by almost one-third since early October, weighed down by the supply overhang and widespread weakness in financial markets.

2018-11-28,"* Expected surge in Chinese fuel shipments weighs on cracks * Despite the slump, margins remain seasonally high * Singapore gasoil margins: tmsnrt.rs/2DN7D8x By Koustav Samanta SINGAPORE, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Asian refining margins for gasoil slid to their lowest in four months on Wednesday, squeezed as traders brace for a flood of extra Chinese fuel hitting a region already awash in supplies at a time of unexpectedly lacklustre demand. Refining margins - known as ‘cracks’ - for gasoil with 10 parts per million (ppm) sulphur content fell to $14.52 a barrel over Dubai crude on Wednesday, their weakest since Aug. 2. The drop comes as the Chinese government gets set to release 2 million tonnes of additional fuel export quotas this year, taking total 2018 quotas to about 48 million tonnes. This fuel, mostly gasoline and diesel, follows the release of 2.93 million tonnes of additional fuel a month ago. China’s diesel exports in October jumped to 1.44 million tonnes, up 40 percent from 1.03 million tonnes the previous month, according to customs data. Adding to an already well supplied market, several Southeast Asian refineries came back on line in recent weeks after maintenance shutdowns. Worse, demand has been modest. “The refineries are exporting a lot of gasoil but cannot find a home for each cargo,” said one middle distillate trader, declining to be named as that was against company policy. “Normally during winter, we see a dramatic increase in gasoil demand, but this year we haven’t found out any such pattern yet,” she added. A mild start to North Asia’s winter has resulted in relatively low demand for heating fuels, including oil and gas. The benchmark gasoil margins have shed more than 20 percent in the last two weeks since hitting a four-year peak of $18.92 a barrel on Nov. 15. Still, they’re at their strongest levels for this time of the year since 2015. The slump may not last as arbitrage opportunities from Asia to Europe will likely offer support to Singapore’s gasoil cracks, traders said. Despite the recent fall, Singapore’s gasoil premium over Northwest Europe was around $32 per tonne on Wednesday, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. The arbitrage is usually profitable from a spread of around $18 a tonne. At current clean tanker rates, the spread should be over $20 per tonne, according to Reuters calculations based on Refinitiv data. “Continued shortage in the West will provide a floor from which the regional (Asian) crack can rebound,” a Seoul-based trade source said. Europe is currently undersupplied with gasoil, with inventories held in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub down by over 30 percent in the last 1-1/2 months. Reporting by Koustav Samanta

2018-11-28,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s stock market will post small gains by the end of this year in the absence of more Western sanctions, but the theme of penalties and global trade conflict are likely to dominate the mood next year, a Reuters poll found. Russian financial markets have proved vulnerable to U.S. sanctions and threats of more curbs to punish Moscow for what Washington calls “malign activities.”  Polled by Reuters before the latest tensions between Russia and Ukraine, analysts saw some upside for the Russian market, arguing that the inevitability of more sanctions being imposed this year had faded. The rouble-based MOEX stock index .IMOEX is seen ending this year at 2,440 points, according to the median forecast of eight analysts polled by Reuters. That is almost six percent above Monday’s close of 2,308.5, and closer to the upper boundary of the forecast range of 2,250 to 2,480 points. It is also above the year-end level of 2,230 predicted in the previous quarterly stock poll.     “We expect a slow rise, a New Year mini-rally,” said Dmitry Alexandrov, an analyst at Univer Capital. “The main risks are an inability of OPEC-plus allies to reach a deal at the Dec. 6 meeting and a further drop in Brent crude prices to $50 per barrel,” said Alexandrov. OPEC meets in Vienna on Dec. 6 to discuss output policy together with some non-OPEC producers, including Russia. Brent crude futures, a benchmark for Russia’s key exports, have fallen around 20 percent since the previous Reuters stocks poll in late August LCOc1. A summit of 20 members of the group of industrialized nations due in Argentina later this week is also in focus. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are set to meet there and are likely to discuss global trade. The trade war may continue, which will put pressure on the global economy, said Viktor Veselov, an analyst at Globex Bank. “This is the key theme for the rest of 2018,” he said. The dollar-based RTS index .IRTS was predicted at 1,160 points by the end of this year, the poll showed, with forecasts ranging from 1,050 to 1,215. RTS closed Monday at 1,084. Looking forward, analysts warn next year may bring respite to the market, given Russian economic growth is expected to slow to 1.2-1.7 percent in 2019 from 1.5-2.0 percent expected this year, according to the central bank’s forecast. “It is better to focus on companies’ shares that offer nice dividend yields and are less vulnerable to risks of a cooldown in the global economy and commodity markets, that can also partly hedge risks of a further rouble weakening,” said Eugeny Loktyukhov, an analyst at Promsvyazbank. Among such companies Loktykhov mentioned are giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM), diamond maker Alrosa (ALRS.MM) and shares in largest lenders Sberbank (SBER.MM) and VTB (VTBR.MM) that look undervalued compared with their global peers. Since the analysts were consulted, several European politicians have raised the possibility of sanctions over Russia’s capturing of three Ukrainian vessels, a move the West fears could ignite a wider conflict.

Argentina hopes to announce an agreement on the Chinese-financed construction of the Atucha III nuclear power plant during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit on Sunday following the summit of leaders of G20 industrialised nations in Buenos Aires, Juan Pablo Tripodi, head of Argentina’s national investment agency, told Reuters in an interview. The potential deal, reportedly worth up to $8 billion (6.28 billion pounds), is emblematic of China’s strengthening of economic, diplomatic and cultural ties with Argentina. It is part of a wider push by Beijing into Latin America that has alarmed the United States, which views the region as its backyard and is suspicious of China’s motives. The focus of this week’s meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of G20 will be on their two countries’ trade war, but the backdrop will be the competition between the powers for influence in Latin America.  When Argentina negotiated a $56.3 billion financing deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rescue its troubled economy earlier this year, Trump voiced his support for the plan and President Mauricio Macri’s leadership. But it is China that has emerged as Argentina’s critical trading partner, investor and financier, a Reuters review of trade and investment data shows, with Beijing pumping billions into Argentina’s economy and positioning itself as a reliable lender for its crisis-stricken economy. China and Argentina are expected to seal a currency swap deal this weekend that doubles the original amount of the credit line to $18.7 billion. The deal will make China the biggest non-institutional lender to Argentina.  China is the main importer of Argentine soybeans, the South American country’s biggest cash crop. In the last 10 years, it has also emerged as a major financier of Argentine projects, mainly infrastructure, worth a total of about $18 billion, offering low interest rates of between 3 and 4 percent, according to a Reuters review of Chinese state funding data compiled by the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based non-profit think-tank. The negotiations on Chinese financing of the Atucha III nuclear power plant are a key cause for concern for the U.S. government, a senior Trump administration official told Reuters. Atucha III would be one of the biggest projects financed by China in Argentina, according to the Reuters review of Chinese state funding data.  Argentina’s national newspaper Clarin reported at the weekend that if the deal was signed, China would loan Argentina $6.5 billion to be repaid in 20 years, with eight years of grace and a 4.5 percent annual interest. Reuters was not able to independently confirm these details. “These are infrastructure projects where China is coming in and providing very low interest loans or they are just having Chinese companies do it,” the U.S. official said. “It’s creating an economic and political dependency on China that’s incredibly dangerous.” The message to Macri and other regional leaders is increasingly that “your sovereignty can be lost by being so ensnared in debt, you can lose your sovereignty to the person who holds your debt,” the U.S. official said. China’s foreign ministry strongly disputes that view. “China’s investment and financing in Latin America are in line with market rules and common international rules and practices, and do not have any political conditions attached,” the ministry said in a statement to Reuters. The involvement of Chinese companies in water, power and road projects has helped to drive Argentine economic and social development, it said. Defending Argentina’s relationship with China, an Argentine government official told Reuters that Beijing was an important investor and would only become more important in the future. However, the official acknowledged the U.S. concerns were not without merit. “Overall, I would say it’s a fair warning and it’s something countries should take into consideration. I think Argentina takes it into consideration very seriously,” the official said. China’s attraction to Argentina can be attributed to three factors: natural resources, weak institutions, and the country’s lack of other financing options, according to Juan Uriburu, an Argentine lawyer who has worked on two major Argentina-China joint ventures.  “China can afford to have these competitive (interest) rates. In the meantime, what they create are new markets for Chinese companies abroad, which back home means Chinese companies will be working, making the products, making the locomotives, the cars, the rails, everything,” Uriburu said.        Tripodi, the Argentine investment agency head, credited Macri’s more business-friendly policies for the uptick in Chinese investment. Interest from Chinese companies was growing “in an exponential way,” he said. As a presidential candidate, Macri pledged to recalibrate Argentina’s relationship with China. Under his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez, Argentina had changed the law to enable Chinese companies to skip the bidding process if they were financing projects, according to Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American programme at Inter-American Dialogue.  When Macri took office in late 2015, he vowed to review deals the Fernandez government had made with China. Atucha III, a railway project and two hydropower dams in Santa Cruz province, which her late husband had governed, were among projects thrown into limbo.  Cross-cancellation clauses, however, have made it difficult for Macri to terminate the largest projects, said Uriburu. Macri has instead renegotiated some terms, including bringing down the loan amount for the hydro dams from $4.7 billion to $4 billion. In Brazil, Latin America’s biggest economy, right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro also took a tough stance against China on the campaign trail, portraying it as a predator seeking to dominate key business sectors. But since winning election Bolsonaro has softened his position, saying China is welcome to invest in Brazil and that trade between the two countries could grow. China’s influence in Argentina extends beyond the numbers. For example, it has established Confucius institutes, cultural organizations, at Argentina’s largest university, the University of Buenos Aires, and a second college in Buenos Aires province.  Some U.S. lawmakers have warned that the institutes, which number more than 100 around the world, are an attempt by China to further its political influence, which Beijing denies. In one of the most visible examples of Chinese soft power in Argentina, the government held a nationally televised event with the Chinese ambassador earlier this month to showcase armoured vehicles and other security equipment that China has donated to help secure the G20 event. Argentine security officials told Reuters they would hold a separate event to highlight U.S. aid for the summit, which begins on Friday. That has yet to happen.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan see-sawed between positive and negative territory and last was flat. Australian and South Korean stocks were both down 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.7 percent. Chinese indices shed small early gains.  The blue-chip index was flat. Asian markets had slipped on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal it was “highly unlikely” he would accept China’s request to hold off on a planned increase in tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent. However, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow sought to brighten the mood by confirming a dinner powwow between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at an coming G20 gathering in Argentina. He also held open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal. The news boosted Wall Street’s main indexes, which finished in positive territory after spending much of the session in the red. It was still unclear whether the two sides had agreed on a formal agenda for the leaders’ meeting after the G20 summit and Kudlow said there were no scheduled talks on the ground for their advisers. At the same time, a German magazine reported citing EU sources that Trump could impose tariffs on imported cars from next week, sending European auto stocks sharply lower. Also on Tuesday, a German magazine published a report citing European Union sources saying Trump could impose tariffs on imported cars from next week, which sent European auto stocks sharply lower. “The market mood has turned cautious once again amid a flurry of trade headlines pointing to the prospect of a new round of trade tariffs ahead,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior strategist at National Australia Bank. “The market seems to be jumping at shadows at the moment and against this backdrop of uncertainty the USD remains the preferred option for weathering the storm.” The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, jumped overnight to 97.497 to edge towards a 1-1/2 year top of 97.661 earlier this month. It was last at 97.412. Investors will now turn attention to a speech on Wednesday by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for further clues on how many more times the U.S. central bank is likely to raise interest rates. The event has become more critical as signs of a global slowdown and nearly two months of market volatility have clouded an otherwise rosy U.S. picture, prompting speculation the Fed will go slow on rate hikes next year. Traders will watch the speech in light of Trump’s criticism of Powell in a newspaper interview in which the president said interest rates and other Fed policies were damaging the U.S. economy. Elsewhere in the foreign exchange market, the pound was among the worst performing major currencies overnight. It was last down 0.1 percent at $1.2733. British Prime Minister Theresa May will take her Brexit sales pitch to Scotland on Wednesday where she will likely face an uphill struggle to convince sceptical voters of the benefits of her deal for businesses. May needs to win a Dec. 11 parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal but that looks difficult with an apparent large majority of lawmakers - including the Scottish National Party with 35 of Scotland’s 59 seats in parliament - opposed to it.

2018-11-28,"SINGAPORE, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday ahead of an OPEC meeting next week at which the producer club is expected to decide some form of supply cut to counter an emerging glut. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.00 per barrel at 0027 GMT, up 44 cents, or 0.9 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Despite Wednesday’s rise, oil prices have still lost almost a third of their value since early October, weighed down by an emerging supply overhang and by widespread weakness in financial markets. The crude oil price slump since October is so far on par with the 2008 price crash and steeper than that of 2014/2015. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will meet at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, on Dec. 6 to discuss output policy. The OPEC-meeting will follow a gathering by the Group of 20 (G20) nations, which includes the world’s biggest economies, in Argentina this weekend, at which the Sino-American trade dispute as well as oil policy are expected to be discussed. While most analysts expect some form of supply cut from the OPEC-meeting, sentiment in oil markets remains negative. “Options traders remain focused on downside risks following a 30 percent slide in WTI,” Erik Norland, senior economist at commodities exchange CME Group wrote in a note, referring to the higher number of traders who have placed positions that would profit from a further fall in crude prices than those placing bets on a rising market. Portfolio managers have slashed their combined net long position in crude futures by a total of 607 million barrels over the last eight weeks, the largest reduction over a comparable period since at least 2013, when the current data series began, exchange data showed.

2018-11-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain plans to help develop the country’s first large-scale project to capture, store and use carbon dioxide emissions by the mid-2020s, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said on Wednesday. Carbon capture, storage and use (CCSU) involves the capture of emissions from power plants and industry to allow them to be compressed and stored to be used for industrial applications such as making drinks fizzy. The technology is also likely to be needed to help limit a rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to a recent U.N. report. “The UK’s first carbon capture usage and storage project will be up and running by the mid-2020s under government plans unveiled today,” BEIS said in a statement. Under the plans, Britain will commit to setting out more details next year on how to develop the country’s first large scale CCSU project and invest 315 million pounds ($402 million)in decarbonising industrial sites. “The UK is setting a world-leading ambition for developing and deploying carbon capture and storage technology to cut emissions,” Britain’s Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry will say later on Wednesday at a CCSU conference in Edinburgh, according to the BEIS statement. British power company Drax earlier this week announced a pilot CCSU scheme at its biomass power plant in North Yorkshire but Britain has yet to develop a large-scale, economically viable project.    Britain had previously viewed carbon capture and storage as a vital tool to help it meet its legally binding target to cut emissions by 80 percent on 1990 levels by 2050. In 2012 the government launched a 1 billion pound competition to help fund a large-scale project to capture CO2 emissions from a gas or coal-fired power plant and store them underground. Despite several interested companies such as Shell and SSE, it then made a shock decision in 2015 to pull funding from the scheme, leaving the projects in limbo. There are fewer than 20 large-scale CCSU projects in operation globally, but many more will be needed to meet the challenge of climate change, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). “Without CCUS as part of the solution, reaching our international climate goals is practically impossible,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a separate statement, issued ahead of the Edinburgh conference.  The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a goal of limiting warming to “well below” a rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for the tougher goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius.

2018-11-28,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Six major oil and gas companies announced plans on Wednesday to study the development of a Britain’s first commercial carbon capture, storage and use facility around an industrial zone. The feasibility study comes under the investment arm of the the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), which seeks to develop low-carbon solutions for the industry, one of the world’s biggers polluters. To advance the project, BP, Italy’s Eni, Norway’s Equinor, Houston-based Occidental Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell and France’s Total formed a strategic partnership, the OGCI Climate Investments said in a statement. The Clean Gas Project in Teeside, in northeast England, will capture carbon dioxide emitted from a power plant fired by natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel. Industrial complexes in the area will also be able to capture and store CO2 they emitted.  The compressed CO2 will then be transported by pipeline for storage in a formation under the southern North Sea. The clean CO2 could also be used by companies requiring CO2 for their production, according to the OGCI. The statement did not include a timeline or cost estimate for the project.     Carbon capture, storage and use (CCSU) is seen as a key technology to reach the U.N.-backed goals to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century to fight climate change. CCSU is particularly important for energy companies that say natural gas will play a major role in any low-carbon future.
