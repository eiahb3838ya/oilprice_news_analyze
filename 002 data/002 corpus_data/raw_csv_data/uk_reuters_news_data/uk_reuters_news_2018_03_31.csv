2018-03-31,"ADEN (Reuters) - A fire broke out at the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeidah early on Saturday, destroying warehouses filled with cooking fuel and foodstuffs, port workers said. They told Reuters that, as of 1100 GMT, fire trucks had not been able to put out the blaze in the warehousing area, which they said appeared to have been caused by an electrical short circuit. Reuters television footage showed thick plumes of smoke rising into the air and fire fighters dousing flames. Hodeidah port, on the Red Sea, handles the bulk of Yemen’s imports, including critically-needed food and aid supplies. The three-year war in the country, which was already the Arab world’s poorest, has pushed it to the verge of famine. “The fire destroyed huge amounts of fuel and humanitarian aid and foodstuff,” a U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) employee told Reuters by telephone, adding that there would be an investigation to determine the cause. The Houthi-run Saba news agency reported the fire at the port, but did not mention the cause. Workers said the warehouses also contained hundreds of thousands of mattresses meant for those displaced by the war, which has killed more than 10,000 people and crippled the economy. The United Nations says that three out of four Yemenis - 22 million civilians - need relief aid.  A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised Yemeni government that was forced into exile by the Iran-aligned Houthis.  Late year the coalition, under international pressure, eased a three-week blockade imposed on Yemeni ports and airports in November in response to a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis towards the Saudi capital, Riyadh.

2018-03-31,"* IOC’s crude processing at record 1.4 mln bpd in 2017/18 * Northeast plants at 100 pct capacity for first time * Processed 1.38 million bpd oil at directly owned plants By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, March 31 (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp plans to invest 1.43 trillion rupees ($22 billion) in next five years as the country’s top refiner seeks to raise its annual capacity to about 3.2 million barrels per day by 2030, its head of refineries said on Saturday. Refiners in India, the world’s third-biggest oil consumer and importer, have sketched out plans to raise their capacity by 77 percent to about 8.8 million bpd by 2030 to meet the country’s rising fuel demand. India is emerging as one of the global drivers for refined fuels consumption as its economic expansion and rising industrial activity yields infrastructure improvements and increased energy access for commercial and retail consumers. “There is a need for us to enhance our capacity to meet the future demand and enhance our capacity ... We have already made our plans for investment of 1.06 trillion rupees,” B. V. Rama Gopal told a news conference. He said board approval was yet to be obtained for 365 billion investment aimed at raising capacity of its Guwahati and Bongaigaon refineries in the northeast and Paradip plant in eastern Odisha state. “We are going to enhance capacity in terms of crude processing and fuel specification,” Rama Gopal said, as India plans a nationwide roll out of Euro-VI compliant fuels in the country from April 2020. IOC’s current capacity stands at about 1.62 million bpd including 230,00 bpd controlled by its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corp. IOC processed a record 1.38 million bpd crude at its directly owned plants in 2017/18 mainly due to higher runs at its refineries in Paradip, which was commissioned in 2015, and at Bongaigaon, Guwahati and Digboi in the northeast. Plants in land-locked northeastern India, with a combined capacity of about 80,000 bpd, for the first time operated at full capacity as the company began supplying low sulphur crude imported at Paradip through pipelines and by road. Traditionally the northeastern refineries were using local crude, supplies of which have declined. IOC is gradually building its portfolio of alternative fuels such as solar and production of ethanol, as well as boosting its petrochemical production. “We don’t want to remain a refining company alone ... in addition to refining we will be venturing out in different areas like petrochemicals and alternate fuels,” he said.

2018-03-31,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi air defence forces intercepted a missile fired by Houthi fighters in neighbouring Yemen at the southern Saudi city of Najran on Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition said. In a statement carried by state news agency SPA the coalition said that according to initial findings an Indian resident was injured by falling debris after the missile was intercepted. The Houthi-run Saba news agency earlier said a missile was fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, and that it had led to “losses in the ranks of the enemy and its military equipment”. The Iran-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom since the coalition intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 after the Houthis drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.  Last week, Saudi air defence forces intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh.   Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge.
