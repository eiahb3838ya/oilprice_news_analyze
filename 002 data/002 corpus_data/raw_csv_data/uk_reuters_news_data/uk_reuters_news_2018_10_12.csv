2018-10-12,"MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Searchers on Friday uncovered the first body in the rubble of the Florida town of Mexico Beach, which was nearly obliterated by Hurricane Michael, as the toll from the historic storm rose to at least 18 and was expected to climb further. Rescue teams, hampered by power and telephone outages, used cadaver dogs, drones and heavy equipment to hunt for hundreds of people unaccounted for in devastated communities across the Florida Panhandle.  “I’ve watched on television, thinking of what others have experienced, like in the Carolinas and Texas,” Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey told reporters referring to earlier hurricanes. “But it’s different when you walk down and see this, and your emotions run away. This is just a small unique coastal community.”  No other information was available about the dead man found in Mexico Beach, said Joseph Zahralban, Miami’s fire chief who was leading a search and rescue unit. He said it was unclear if the man lived alone or with a family. Three deaths were reported in Marianna, in Jackson County, Florida, Sheriff Lou Roberts told a news conference on Friday afternoon.   Florida accounts for nine of the storm-related deaths, with five more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia.  The death toll is expected to rise as rescuers go house-to-house and comb through the rubble in Mexico Beach and other Florida coastal communities, such as Port St. Joe and Panama City, said Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The Houston-based volunteer search-and-rescue network CrowdSource Rescue said its teams were trying to find about 2,100 people either reported missing or stranded and in need of help in Florida, co-founder Matthew Marchetti said. Social media websites were crowded with messages from those trying to reach missing family in Florida’s Bay and Gulf Counties. Marchetti said his volunteer search teams, consisting mostly of off-duty police officers and firefighters, also had rescued or accounted for 345 others previously reported to CrowdSource Rescue since Michael struck on Wednesday. FEMA crews have been using bulldozers and other heavy equipment to push a path through debris so rescuers can sift  the rubble using specially trained search dogs. More than 1,700 search and rescue workers have been deployed, Governor Rick Scott’s office said in a statement, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances. Michael crashed ashore near Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon as one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history, with winds of up to 155 mph (250 kph). It pushed a wall of seawater inland, causing widespread flooding. The tropical storm, which grew in less than two days into a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, tore apart entire neighbourhoods in the Panhandle, reducing homes to naked concrete foundations or piles of wood and siding.  Except for the emergency 911 system, authorities in Bay County, the epicentre of the disaster, were virtually without telephone or internet service until late on Friday, making communications internally and with the public difficult. “We didn’t have anything,” said Ruth Corley, a spokeswoman for the Bay County Sheriff’s Department. “We’ve been writing things down on pieces of paper. We’re doing what we can with the minimal media that we have.” She said local television stations were knocked off the air for two days, and authorities were relying on the Gulf State College radio station to transmit public service bulletins.  Search teams went door-to-door hunting victims. FEMA’s Long urged communities such as Mexico Beach, where many homes were pulverized by 12 to 14 feet (3.7 to 4.3 meters) of storm surge, to rebuild to withstand future storms. “It’s OK if you want to live on the coast or on top of a mountain that sees wildfires or whatever, but you have to build to a higher standard,” he said. “If we’re going to rebuild, do it right.” By Friday morning the storm remnants were about 275 miles (445 km) southwest of Nantucket, Massachusetts, packing maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph). More than 940,000 homes and businesses on the U.S. East Coast were without power and it could be weeks before power is restored to the most damaged parts of Florida.  The numbers in emergency shelters were expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by Friday, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross. The Coast Guard said it rescued 129 people. Even as rescuers searched the rubble for survivors or the dead, some Mexico Beach residents were nervously trickling back, expressing hope the place, nicknamed “the Forgotten Coast,” would not change too much as it rebuilds. “It was the perfect beach town. Not all of that commercialism,” said Dottie Sinclair, 57, a nurse, adding a Subway fast-food restaurant was the only commercial chain. “I don’t think it will ever be the same,” said her husband Danny, 64, who is semi-retired. “People will just pack up and leave.” Reporting by Rod Nickel; Additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in Port St. Joe, Florida, Gina Cherelus and Scott DiSavino in New York, Gary McWilliams and Liz Hampton in Houston, Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Alex Dobuzinskis, Steve Gorman and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Writing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Sandra Maler and Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/storm-michael/update-5-officials-expect-more-dead-as-rescuers-probe-florida-hurricane-debris-idUKL2N1WS091,12 Oct 2018,"Rescuers used heavy

2018-10-12,"WASHNGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s hyping of a plan to boost ethanol demand drew cheers at an Iowa rally on Tuesday, but the oil refining industry has promised a lawsuit to block the move, so victory for Midwest farmers is far from certain. Trump on Tuesday indicated that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should allow for a waiver for higher-ethanol gasoline, known as E15, to be sold all year, which has been prohibited due to smog concerns. He did not mention the threatened lawsuit and was not asked about it. The hitch, according to industry experts as well as legal precedent, is that Trump needs an act of Congress to change the rule. New Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in 2012 that EPA cannot change the rule unless congress changes the law, and the refining industry has promised to sue if the agency tries. Still, some ethanol industry experts said Trump’s political support in farm states will give him enough cover to push either Congress or regulators to act. Some said the media coverage of the proposal alone should help Republican members of congress in tight farm state races. “You can’t tell me this didn’t have a political impact,” said Monte Shaw, head of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. He said he was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, having breakfast on Friday when a waiter congratulated him on Trump’s announcement.  He said, however, that Trump must publish the rule ahead of the November election or else Democrats will try to paint the announcement as all show, no substance.  U.S. gasoline sold in the summer contains 10 percent ethanol. For years, the biofuel industry has sought to lift the summer ban on E15, with 15 percent ethanol, to boost domestic demand for corn-based ethanol. Since Trump took office, there has been a tug of war over ethanol policy within his administration. Trump’s former adviser, billionaire oilman Carl Icahn, led an effort to change rules requiring refiners to blend biofuels into gasoline or pay for credits for those who can. The biofuels industry and Democrats blasted his efforts, saying his ownership in refining company CVR Energy created a conflict of interest. Icahn ultimately stepped aside as a presidential adviser.  Trump has tried to thread the needle between the rival corn and oil industries, seeking ways to boost overall ethanol demand while giving refiners relief from the cost. The administration could not secure assurances from the refining industry not to sue over lifting the ban on E15. But with midterm elections looming, Trump moved ahead anyway, siding with Farm Belt supporters who helped secure his narrow 2016 election victory.  Several industry experts said the Clean Air Act forbids such a change without Congressional action.  “EPA can’t change a rule that’s created by the Congress,” said Jonathan Lewis, senior counsel for Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit working to reduce pollution. “They need the Congress to amend the Clean Air Act.” Kavanaugh wrote in a 2012 case that was dismissed on procedural grounds: “The waiver might be good policy; if so, Congress has the power to enact a new law permitting E15. But under the statute as currently written, EPA lacks authority for the waiver.” The refining industry has seized on this. “We are going to sue, and other organizations are going to sue, and I think the case is pretty black-and-white that it’s against the law,” Chet Thompson, head of American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said.  Despite these headwinds, Trump hyped his plan at a rally on Tuesday in Council Bluffs, Iowa, part of a congressional district where incumbent Republican U.S. Representative David Young faces a tough race.  “I believe the administration understands how important of an issue this is to many farmers across the country,” said Andrew Walmsley, a director at the American Farm Bureau, an interest group. “If the Congress can’t do it, perhaps EPA should try - that’s the mindset.” Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Humeyra Pamuk; additional reporting by Michael Hirtzer in Chicago; Editing by David Gaffen and David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-ethanol-lawsuits/analysis-trumps-ethanol-plan-hype-now-legal-fights-later-idUKL2N1WR1B3,12 Oct 2018,"President Donald

2018-10-12,"LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices fell this week as sellers struggled to offload the last of their November cargos and Chinese demand for December supplies failed to materialise significantly after a frenzy of Asian buying last month. November spot LNG LNG-AS fell 50 cents to $10.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) though trades were sparse and the bid-offer spread was wide. December prices were cited as low as $10.50 although a trade was heard at around $11.10. Crude, which was heading for a first weekly fall in over a month as part of a global market rout, also weighed on LNG as many contracts are linked to the oil index. Spot Asian LNG spiked last month in anticipation of winter demand after a hot summer depleted stockpiles. China was seen as providing support to prices after the country got caught short last winter with its storage capacity still low. However, that has not been the case so far this month. “China has been pacing down supplies, so as not to spike prices again,” said one LNG trader. “Storage is a fact but I guess they are replacing volumes a little wiser than last winter.” Another trader said a November cargo was bought by Osaka Gas for $10 per mmBtu although the Japanese utility had a wide delivery window and quality specification to make the sale attractive to suppliers. “There’s some distressed sellers out there; the bid offer spread is wide,” said one LNG trader. Turkey’s Botas closed a tender on Friday for 13 cargoes to be delivered in the first week of each month from November to February, according to several sources. WINTER START-UPS In the absence of a surge in demand, supplies were so far healthy going into the winter months, traders said. Japan’s Inpex said last week it had shipped its first condensate cargo from the mammoth Ichthys LNG project in Australia, which was seen as a prelude to LNG exports. Russia’s Yamal facility in the Arctic pumped a record 2.4 million tonnes of LNG in September and operator Novatek said its third train would begin operations in December, some 6 months ahead of schedule. Traders say Yamal’s restrictions lie more in the number of Arctic-class vessels available to ship the LNG than output. Two more Arc7 vessels, the Georgiy Brusilov and the Boris Davydov are now undergoing sea trials before joining Yamal, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The start-up of a number of export projects in the United States will also add to supply, with some still expecting the first cargoes from Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass 5 and Corpus Christi 1 to hit the spot markets this year. Several traders mentioned the private tenders of multi-year strips from Corpus Christi 2, expected to begin operations next year, and Dominion Energy’s Cove Point. They said India’s Gail, which is committed to buying 5.8 million tonnes of LNG a year from the United States, was tendering Cove Point cargoes from 2021. Australia’s Woodside Petroleum and Indonesia’s Pertamina, both big LNG players, were also looking to sell Corpus Christi 2 cargoes. A three week planned outage at Cove Point is expected to end at the weekend.

2018-10-12,"* ARA gasoline stocks at record high for time of year * Gasoline demand in U.S., Europe declined in August (Adds graphic) By Ahmad Ghaddar and Ron Bousso LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Benchmark gasoline refining margins in Europe turned negative on Friday for the first time in nearly five years amid bloated stocks and weaker demand in the Atlantic basin. Gasoline stocks in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub remain at a record high for this time of the year, according to data from PJK International, with disappointing demand for the fuel in the United States, a key export market. Profit margins for converting crude oil into Eurobob gasoline were calculated at around -$0.906 a barrel at 1011 GMT, the lowest since Dec. 2, 2013, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The weak margins, also known as cracks, have prompted speculation that some European refiners would reduce their gasoline output in coming weeks, according to traders. Overall refining margins in northwest Europe were below seasonal levels seen over the past three years. They were, however, supported by relatively strong diesel refining margins. “Refining margins have clearly been responding to an oversupplied market in recent weeks, and with European markets struggling to find export destinations for gasoline volumes especially, the economic run cuts we have begun to see over September could well continue through the weeks ahead,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said in a note. In the United States, benchmark gasoline refining margins RBc1-CLc1 were near their lowest levels since February 2017 after stocks on the East Coast rose last week to 70.6 million barrels, compared with 58.2 million a year earlier. U.S. gasoline demand in August was down 1.5 percent from a year earlier at 9.61 million barrels per day (bpd) while in Europe it was down 1.3 percent at 2.01 million bpd, according to the International Energy Agency. ARBITRAGE TO AUSTRALIA OPENS Weak European margins usually prompt an increase in export opportunities to regions that are priced more competitively. French major Total made a provisional booking in recent days for a tanker to load 90,000 tonnes of gasoline in ARA to go to Australia. The STI Alexis is expected to load on Oct. 18 and the booking allows the ship an option to deliver to other destinations. The route to Australia from Europe is very rare. Traders said the paper price differential between Europe and Asia for December, known as the east/west arbitrage, has risen from $0.80 a barrel at the start of October to around $1.70 a barrel now. This indicates more favourable economics to export to Asia Pacific. One trader said the weak European cracks is likely to stir import interest from China.

2018-10-12,"(Adds consultancy comment, detail) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Maintenance at Norway’s natural gas fields and processing plants is scheduled to cut production capacity by some 7 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2019, more than in recent years, data from system operator Gassco and analysts showed on Friday. Outage plans for offshore fields and onshore processing plants in the following year are published in the fourth quarter, and while it is subject to revision, the 2019 schedule should be viewed as a complete plan, Gassco told Reuters. Last year, Gassco transported a record 117.4 bcm through the pipeline systems from Norway to continental Europe and Britain. The scope of outages announced for 2019 is 3 bcm bigger than that of 2017, a year of exceptionally low maintenance, and is also expected to be higher than that of 2018, consultancy Energy Aspects said. When Gassco published outage plans for 2018, in December 2017, they amounted to 3.2 bcm, but said that number was only partial. The overall number will definitely be lower than 7 bcm however, said Trevor Sikorski, head of natural gas and carbon at Energy Aspects. Norway’s largest gas field Troll will undergo maintenance between April and September, with August and September the months with the highest maintenance impact for the field. Kollsnes, the country’s largest processing plant and a major exporting facility to Britain, will also undergo major maintenance, with the heaviest part taking place between Aug. 24 and Sept. 5, when capacity will be reduced by 146.5 million cubic metres per day.

2018-10-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has warned operators of electrical power links with Europe that they will need to set up alternative trading arrangements if the country leaves the European Union next year with no exit deal. The United Kingdom imports around 6 percent of its electricity via power links with France, the Netherlands and Ireland but plans to build several more. Companies operating electricity interconnectors, which include Britain’s National Grid (NG.L) and French grid operator RTE, should “carry out contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ scenario”, a government paper said. In the event of no deal on Britain’s EU exit, European energy law will no longer apply to the UK electricity market. The paper said the government and energy regulator Ofgem were working with interconnector operators “to ensure new access rules are approved in Great Britain and are providing support to interconnectors engaging with EU Member State authorities”. Britain has issued a series of papers outlining the implications of a no-deal Brexit for a range of sectors. The British government wants to increase power supply options, such as new interconnectors, as old domestic coal and nuclear plants close from the mid-2020s. However, Norway’s state-owned grid operator Statnett [STASF.UL] warned earlier this year that Brexit could hamper new projects, including two planned links with Norway.

2018-10-12,"(Repeats story published late on Oct 11 with no changes to text) BOGOTA, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Colombia’s constitutional court on Thursday ruled that local referendums that ban mining and oil extraction cannot halt energy projects, after a raft of votes spooked multinational companies. A wave of environmentally focused anti-mining referendums over the past 18 months have worried investors, and forced some to alter investment plans, like AngloGold Ashanti which suspended a potential $2 billion project last year. The ruling on the suit brought by Mansarovar Energy Colombia, a joint venture between India’s ONGC-Videsh and China’s Sinopec, was backed 5 to 1 by magistrates, the court said. The Colombian Mining Association (ACM) said in a statement after the court decision it was now optimistic projects would get back on track. “This decision not only gives life to several mining projects that would have been truncated by the (votes) but begins to give positive signals in terms of legal security,” it said. The previous government failed to legislate the issue, but President Ivan Duque, who took office two months ago, promised during his campaign to boost investment in the sector, which meant providing legal clarity to the mining sector. The country’s subsoil is national property and cannot be restricted by local authorities, the court ruling said. The national government, however, cannot exercise sole control over extractive projects and Congress must pass regulations as soon as possible that allow communities to voice opposition to mining and oil projects, the court said. There are 158 referendum initiatives in 135 municipalities nationwide, of which 9 votes have been held, all against mining and oil exploitation, the ACM said. Mansarovar brought the suit after residents of Cumaral municipality in central Meta province voted last year to ban oil exploration. Mansarovar could not immediately be reached for comment.

Eskom, which has fewer than 20 days of coal supply at 10 of its power stations, supplies more than 90 percent of the nation’s power and is one of its most indebted state firms. “We have made offers to Eskom, they have from what I hear, approved those offers,” Exxaro’s chief executive officer Mxolisi Mgojo told Reuters in an interview. “The final decision is sitting with the (state) Treasury to enable them to execute those contracts.” Eskom said last month it was trying to secure new contracts with companies to ensure it had enough coal, after a major supplier cut supplies and sought insolvency protection. Exxaro, which already supplies Eskom’s Matimba, Matla and Medupi power stations, aims to enter into short-term contracts with Eskom, said Mgojo. “We don’t want to get involved in long-term 10-, 20-, 30-year type arrangements,” said Mgojo. “We want to create the flexibility whereby when the opportunity makes sense for us to play short-term into the Eskom market we have that flexibility to do that.” Eskom’s spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the power utility was “very close” to signing new deals. He declined to confirm that a deal with Exxaro was imminent. “Hopefully before the end of this month we should be seeing the first trucks coming through to the stations that are affected,” said Phasiwe. Phasiwe declined to say who Eskom was negotiating coal contracts with, only that it was talking to 12 companies. “We are not in a position to mention them but some of them include the main players in the market,” Phasiwe said. Eskom needs 3 million tonnes of coal to close its deficit but was also looking to stockpile a further 10 million tonnes, Phasiwe said. Eskom, which has a total national output of 45,000 MW, implemented power cutting measures, known locally as “load shedding”, in 2015, denting economic output.

2018-10-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration this week killed a contract for a project to convert plutonium from Cold War-era bombs into power, which it has said would cost tens of billions of dollars, after its supporters lost a legal battle. CB&I Areva MOX Services LLC, a consortium including France’s state-owned Orano, formerly called Areva, has been building the Mixed Oxide (MOX) project at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina since 2007.  But the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration told it in a letter dated Oct. 10 that the project was over. “This notice terminates the contract in its entirety, and is effective immediately,” said the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The move came a day after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit halted a lower court’s injunction of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) plan to shut the plant. MOX Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  South Carolina politicians, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, have defended the MOX plant, saying it was about 70 percent complete, would help keep plutonium out of the hands of militants, and provide up to 600 direct jobs.  The DOE told Senate and House of Representatives committees in May that MOX, a type of specialized nuclear recycling plant that has never been built in the United States, would cost about $48 billion more than the $7.6 billion already spent on it.  Instead of completing MOX, the Trump administration, like the Obama administration before it, wants to blend the 34 tonnes of deadly plutonium - enough to make about 8,000 nuclear weapons - with an inert substance and bury it underground in New Mexico’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Burying the plutonium would cost nearly $20 billion over the next two decades and would require 400 jobs at Savannah River, the DOE has estimated. The DOE has said the Savannah River site could be used to manufacture new plutonium pits, or triggers, for nuclear weapons. But there have not been final decisions on that plan, and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has complained it would not provide jobs for many years.  MOX opponents praised the closure. “Taxpayers can now rest easier that their money will no longer be thrown down a black hole called MOX,” said Tom Clements of the Savannah River Site Watch. An NNSA spokeswoman said the agency will work with MOX Services to reduce “short-term impacts” on workers at the site resulting from the project’s termination.   Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-plutonium-mox/trump-administration-kills-contract-for-plutonium-to-fuel-plant-idUKL2N1WS1J3,12 Oct 2018,"The Trump administration this

2018-10-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets worldwide rebounded on Friday after a multi-day sell-off but still registered their biggest weekly losses in months, while U.S. Treasury yields rose and the dollar held its gains. Wall Street snapped a six-day losing streak as investors looked for bargains even as worries about U.S.-China trade tensions lingered. Technology shares led the gains. “People are starting to buy in, thinking the higher-flying growth stocks were oversold,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. But until the United States and China reach a trade deal, the rebound could be vulnerable as investors are anxious about the impact of tariffs on corporate profits. “If earnings come out good I think this rally is sustainable if we don’t get negative trade news,” she said. Kicking off the U.S. earnings reporting period, three of the largest U.S. banks reported double-digit profit growth on Friday. The results reflected an array of positive business factors including a lift from cost-cutting programs implemented after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. All three major U.S. stocks indexes posted their biggest weekly percentage declines since March 23, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index  fell 5.2 percent for the week, its biggest weekly drop since January 2016. The biggest market shakeout since February has been blamed on factors including fears about the impact of the U.S.-China tariff fight, a spike in U.S. bond yields this week and caution ahead of earnings season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 287.16 points, or 1.15 percent, to 25,339.99, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 38.76 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,767.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 167.83 points, or 2.29 percent, to 7,496.89.

The MSCI index was down 3.9 percent for the week in its biggest weekly decline since March 23. U.S. Treasury yields edged up, recovering from falls in the previous session, as investors unwound safe-haven bids. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 10/32 in price to yield 3.167 percent, from 3.131 percent late on Thursday. The dollar climbed against a basket of currencies along with the rebound in equities and as robust Chinese export figures soothed worries about the world’s second-biggest economy and its trade war with Washington. China’s trade surplus with the United States hit a record high in September, providing a likely source of contention with Trump over trade policies and the yuan currency. The data showed solid expansion in China’s overall imports and exports, suggesting little damage to the country from the tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.25 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.3 percent to $1.1558. Gold XAU= was down 0.5 percent at $1,217.81 an ounce.

2018-10-12,"LAGOS (Reuters) - The main opposition challenger to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in next year’s election has selected a former governor from the southeast of the country to be his running mate, the candidate’s spokesman said on Friday.  Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president who will stand as the candidate for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 2019 vote, chose Peter Obi, formerly governor of the southeastern state of Anambra.  The choice points to a strategy to generate support in the southeast, where Buhari has polled badly in past elections and cracked down on secessionists by deploying troops on the streets. Geographical affiliations are crucial in a sprawling nation of 190 million people from 250 ethnic groups.  Obi, a 57-year-old who was governor of Anambra from 2006-2014, had a background in business prior to entering politics, including a stint as chairman of Nigeria’s Fidelity Bank.  “Mr. Obi’s choice was largely influenced by his youthfulness, vast knowledge of global and local economics as well as being a financial expert, all experience which Nigeria is in great need at this point in time,” Abubakar’s spokesman said. “This ticket will be able to steer our nation back on the path of progress, economic prosperity and unity.”  Buhari’s handling of one of Africa’s biggest economies since taking office in 2015 has become a central campaign issue. The country emerged in 2017 from its first recession in 25 years but economic growth remains sluggish and inflation is above the central bank’s single-digit target. Abubakar, who like Buhari is a Muslim from northern Nigeria, has long enjoyed support from the country’s business elite and as vice president from 1999-2007 implemented a liberalisation programme in areas such as the telecoms sector. Bismarck Rewane, chief executive of Lagos-based consultancy Financial Derivatives, described Abubakar’s choice of Obi as “a very good addition to the ticket”.  “(Obi) brings a reputation for having business acumen and integrity. It makes for a very interesting race,” said Rewane. Former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday endorsed Abubakar, his former deputy, for the top job. Marking the end of a long-standing public feud between the two men, Obasanjo said Abubakar’s experience could make an administration led by him “business-friendly”.

2018-10-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude futures gave back early gains and turned lower on Friday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) deemed supply adequate and the outlook for demand weakening, while U.S. crude steadied as equities rebounded. The energy watchdog said in its monthly report that the market looked “adequately supplied for now” and trimmed its forecasts for world oil demand growth this year and next. [IEA/M] “This is due to a weaker economic outlook, trade concerns, higher oil prices and a revision to Chinese data,” said the IEA, which advises industrialized countries on energy policy. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 25 cents a barrel to $80.01 by 2:16 p.m. EDT (1816 GMT), after dropping 3.4 percent on Thursday. U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose 6 cents to $71.03 a barrel. “The weaker outlook has gotten a raised profile in the market, but there’s potential for a real supply crunch towards the end of this year,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “The demand outlook is hurt right now because of the situation with the U.S. and China in particular.” Both benchmarks were headed for their first weekly drop in five weeks, pressured by a big rise in U.S. inventories and fading concerns about shrinking global supplies due to looming U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. [EIA/S]     The IEA report is the latest official forecaster to predict weaker demand ahead and conclude that supply is adequate. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) made a similar move on Thursday. [OPEC/M] “The bearish alarm bells are ringing for next year’s oil balance as market players brace for the return of a supply surplus,” said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM. Additionally, the U.S. oil drilling rig count rose this week for the first time in four weeks, an indication that production is rising. [RIG/U] Drillers added eight oil rigs in the week to Oct. 12, bringing the total count to 869, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The increase is the biggest weekly gain since mid-August. Early in the session, crude rose as global equities were set for their biggest daily gain in nearly a month. Declining equities amid wider risk-off investor sentiment had pressured oil on Thursday. [MKTS/GLOB]  A drop in U.S. oil production this week supported prices. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, companies cut output by 40 percent on Thursday because of Hurricane Michael, even as some began returning crews to offshore platforms. Michael made landfall in Florida on Wednesday as the third most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland.

2018-10-12,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Sixteen people were killed after a fire broke out on Friday on an oil pipeline in the southeast of Nigeria, a spokesman for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation told Reuters. The state oil company said the fire occurred along the Osisioma axis near the Aba depot and emergency services had now been deployed to the scene.  It added that production would be affected as they had to stop pumping oil on the line, although “not adversely” as they also transport crude by road.  “The incident might have been caused by suspected oil thieves who had hacked into the line to intercept the flow of petrol from Port Harcourt to Aba,” NNPC said in an earlier statement.    Many oil spills in the southern oil production heartland of Africa’s biggest crude producer are caused by theft and pipeline sabotage. The methods used to steal the oil often result in accidents that cause fires.

Wall Street rose as investors returned to technology and other growth sectors, but gains were limited by ongoing worries about U.S.-China trade tensions and rising interest rates. “Generally what we were seeing is more momentum and technology names selling off.

Kicking off the U.S. earnings reporting period, three of the largest U.S. banks reported double-digit profit growth on Friday.

2018-10-12,"(Recasts headline, first paragraph, adds analyst comment on Permian rig count increase) Oct 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil drilling rig count rose this week for the first time in four weeks, boosting the number of rigs in the nation’s biggest oil field to the most in nearly four years. Drillers added eight oil rigs in the week to Oct. 12, bringing the total count to 869, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The increase was the biggest weekly gain since mid August. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 743 rigs were active because energy companies have ramped up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian Basin, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there increased by four this week to 489, the most since January 2015. Analysts said drillers could be adding rigs in anticipation of increased takeaway capacity ahead of the expected Nov. 1 startup of Plains All American Pipeline LP’s Sunrise pipeline, which will add a total of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Midland to Wichita Falls in Texas. “Producers are looking to fill the new capacity on Sunrise rather quickly,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Before this week, the total number of rigs had stalled at around 860 since June as the West Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution in the Permian basin have overwhelmed the region’s ability to transport more oil out of the region via pipeline. On Friday, U.S. crude futures were trading around $71 per barrel, putting the contract on track to fall for the first week in five due to a big rise in U.S. inventories and fading concerns about looming U.S. sanction s aimed at cutting Iran’s oil exports. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $67.14 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $71 per barrel for the balance of 2018 and just above $70 for calendar 2019. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,063 oil and gas rigs were already in service, the most since March 2015, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,021. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this week projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.7 million bpd in 2018 and 11.8 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017.

Wall Street surged after the U.S. stock market’s worst two days of losses since February, with the technology sector moving towards its best day in seven months after being hammered earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 294.13 points, or 1.17 percent, to 25,346.96, the S&P 500 gained 41.12 points, or 1.51 percent, to 2,769.49 and the Nasdaq Composite added 161.90 points, or 2.21 percent, to 7,490.96. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 1.4 percent on the day. European stocks also opened higher following a rise in Asian shares overnight, but began to edge lower by mid-morning. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.06 percent. “Some traders are cautiously buying back into the market today, but the underlying issues which brought about the sell-off are still relevant,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. Results for the United States’ largest banks, which began to roll in on Friday, were expected to set the tone for earnings season and help gauge the impact on U.S. company profits from President Donald Trump’s trade war with China. “The market is going to focus on not just current quarter earnings, but guidance going forward, particularly as it relates to the profit margins. You’ve got some indications of rising wage pressure and higher interest rates,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. The biggest market shakeout since February has been blamed on factors including fears about the impact of the U.S.-China tariff fight, a spike in U.S. bond yields this week and caution ahead of earnings season.

2018-10-12,"MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Searchers on Friday uncovered the first body in the rubble of the Florida town of Mexico Beach, which was nearly obliterated by Hurricane Michael, as the toll from the historic storm rose to at least 18 and was expected to climb further. Rescue teams, hampered by power and telephone outages, used cadaver dogs, drones and heavy equipment to hunt for hundreds of people unaccounted for in devastated communities across the Florida Panhandle.  “I’ve watched on television, thinking of what others have experienced, like in the Carolinas and Texas,” Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey told reporters referring to earlier hurricanes. “But it’s different when you walk down and see this, and your emotions run away. This is just a small unique coastal community.”  No other information was available about the dead man found in Mexico Beach, said Joseph Zahralban, Miami’s fire chief who was leading a search and rescue unit. He said it was unclear if the man lived alone or with a family. Three deaths were reported in Marianna, in Jackson County, Florida, Sheriff Lou Roberts told a news conference on Friday afternoon.   Florida accounts for nine of the storm-related deaths, with five more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia.  The death toll is expected to rise as rescuers go house-to-house and comb through the rubble in Mexico Beach and other Florida coastal communities, such as Port St. Joe and Panama City, said Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The Houston-based volunteer search-and-rescue network CrowdSource Rescue said its teams were trying to find about 2,100 people either reported missing or stranded and in need of help in Florida, co-founder Matthew Marchetti said. Social media websites were crowded with messages from those trying to reach missing family in Florida’s Bay and Gulf Counties. Marchetti said his volunteer search teams, consisting mostly of off-duty police officers and firefighters, also had rescued or accounted for 345 others previously reported to CrowdSource Rescue since Michael struck on Wednesday. FEMA crews have been using bulldozers and other heavy equipment to push a path through debris so rescuers can sift  the rubble using specially trained search dogs. More than 1,700 search and rescue workers have been deployed, Governor Rick Scott’s office said in a statement, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances. Michael crashed ashore near Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon as one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history, with winds of up to 155 mph (250 kph). It pushed a wall of seawater inland, causing widespread flooding. The tropical storm, which grew in less than two days into a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, tore apart entire neighbourhoods in the Panhandle, reducing homes to naked concrete foundations or piles of wood and siding.  Except for the emergency 911 system, authorities in Bay County, the epicentre of the disaster, were virtually without telephone or internet service until late on Friday, making communications internally and with the public difficult. “We didn’t have anything,” said Ruth Corley, a spokeswoman for the Bay County Sheriff’s Department. “We’ve been writing things down on pieces of paper.

2018-10-12,"WASHNGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s hyping of a plan to boost ethanol demand drew cheers at an Iowa rally on Tuesday, but the oil refining industry has promised a lawsuit to block the move, so victory for Midwest farmers is far from certain. Trump on Tuesday indicated that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should allow for a waiver for higher-ethanol gasoline, known as E15, to be sold all year, which has been prohibited due to smog concerns. He did not mention the threatened lawsuit and was not asked about it. The hitch, according to industry experts as well as legal precedent, is that Trump needs an act of Congress to change the rule. New Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in 2012 that EPA cannot change the rule unless congress changes the law, and the refining industry has promised to sue if the agency tries. Still, some ethanol industry experts said Trump’s political support in farm states will give him enough cover to push either Congress or regulators to act. Some said the media coverage of the proposal alone should help Republican members of congress in tight farm state races. “You can’t tell me this didn’t have a political impact,” said Monte Shaw, head of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. He said he was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, having breakfast on Friday when a waiter congratulated him on Trump’s announcement.  He said, however, that Trump must publish the rule ahead of the November election or else Democrats will try to paint the announcement as all show, no substance.  U.S. gasoline sold in the summer contains 10 percent ethanol. For years, the biofuel industry has sought to lift the summer ban on E15, with 15 percent ethanol, to boost domestic demand for corn-based ethanol. Since Trump took office, there has been a tug of war over ethanol policy within his administration. Trump’s former adviser, billionaire oilman Carl Icahn, led an effort to change rules requiring refiners to blend biofuels into gasoline or pay for credits for those who can. The biofuels industry and Democrats blasted his efforts, saying his ownership in refining company CVR Energy created a conflict of interest. Icahn ultimately stepped aside as a presidential adviser.  Trump has tried to thread the needle between the rival corn and oil industries, seeking ways to boost overall ethanol demand while giving refiners relief from the cost. The administration could not secure assurances from the refining industry not to sue over lifting the ban on E15. But with midterm elections looming, Trump moved ahead anyway, siding with Farm Belt supporters who helped secure his narrow 2016 election victory.  Several industry experts said the Clean Air Act forbids such a change without Congressional action.  “EPA can’t change a rule that’s created by the Congress,” said Jonathan Lewis, senior counsel for Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit working to reduce pollution. “They need the Congress to amend the Clean Air Act.” Kavanaugh wrote in a 2012 case that was dismissed on procedural grounds: “The waiver might be good policy; if so, Congress has the power to enact a new law permitting E15. But under the statute as currently written, EPA lacks authority for the waiver.” The refining industry has seized on this. “We are going to sue, and other organizations are going to sue, and I think the case is pretty black-and-white that it’s against the law,” Chet Thompson, head of American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said.  Despite these headwinds, Trump hyped his plan at a rally on Tuesday in Council Bluffs, Iowa, part of a congressional district where incumbent Republican U.S. Representative David Young faces a tough race.  “I believe the administration understands how important of an issue this is to many farmers across the country,” said Andrew Walmsley, a director at the American Farm Bureau, an interest group. “If the Congress can’t do it, perhaps EPA should try - that’s the mindset.” Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Humeyra Pamuk; additional reporting by Michael Hirtzer in Chicago; Editing by David Gaffen and David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-ethanol-lawsuits/analysis-trumps-ethanol-plan-hype-now-legal-fights-later-idUKL2N1WR1B3,12 Oct 2018,"President Donald

2018-10-12,"LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices fell this week as sellers struggled to offload the last of their November cargos and Chinese demand for December supplies failed to materialise significantly after a frenzy of Asian buying last month. November spot LNG LNG-AS fell 50 cents to $10.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) though trades were sparse and the bid-offer spread was wide. December prices were cited as low as $10.50 although a trade was heard at around $11.10. Crude, which was heading for a first weekly fall in over a month as part of a global market rout, also weighed on LNG as many contracts are linked to the oil index. Spot Asian LNG spiked last month in anticipation of winter demand after a hot summer depleted stockpiles. China was seen as providing support to prices after the country got caught short last winter with its storage capacity still low. However, that has not been the case so far this month. “China has been pacing down supplies, so as not to spike prices again,” said one LNG trader. “Storage is a fact but I guess they are replacing volumes a little wiser than last winter.” Another trader said a November cargo was bought by Osaka Gas for $10 per mmBtu although the Japanese utility had a wide delivery window and quality specification to make the sale attractive to suppliers. “There’s some distressed sellers out there; the bid offer spread is wide,” said one LNG trader. Turkey’s Botas closed a tender on Friday for 13 cargoes to be delivered in the first week of each month from November to February, according to several sources. WINTER START-UPS In the absence of a surge in demand, supplies were so far healthy going into the winter months, traders said. Japan’s Inpex said last week it had shipped its first condensate cargo from the mammoth Ichthys LNG project in Australia, which was seen as a prelude to LNG exports. Russia’s Yamal facility in the Arctic pumped a record 2.4 million tonnes of LNG in September and operator Novatek said its third train would begin operations in December, some 6 months ahead of schedule. Traders say Yamal’s restrictions lie more in the number of Arctic-class vessels available to ship the LNG than output. Two more Arc7 vessels, the Georgiy Brusilov and the Boris Davydov are now undergoing sea trials before joining Yamal, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The start-up of a number of export projects in the United States will also add to supply, with some still expecting the first cargoes from Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass 5 and Corpus Christi 1 to hit the spot markets this year. Several traders mentioned the private tenders of multi-year strips from Corpus Christi 2, expected to begin operations next year, and Dominion Energy’s Cove Point. They said India’s Gail, which is committed to buying 5.8 million tonnes of LNG a year from the United States, was tendering Cove Point cargoes from 2021. Australia’s Woodside Petroleum and Indonesia’s Pertamina, both big LNG players, were also looking to sell Corpus Christi 2 cargoes. A three week planned outage at Cove Point is expected to end at the weekend.

2018-10-12,"* ARA gasoline stocks at record high for time of year * Gasoline demand in U.S., Europe declined in August (Adds graphic) By Ahmad Ghaddar and Ron Bousso LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Benchmark gasoline refining margins in Europe turned negative on Friday for the first time in nearly five years amid bloated stocks and weaker demand in the Atlantic basin. Gasoline stocks in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub remain at a record high for this time of the year, according to data from PJK International, with disappointing demand for the fuel in the United States, a key export market. Profit margins for converting crude oil into Eurobob gasoline were calculated at around -$0.906 a barrel at 1011 GMT, the lowest since Dec. 2, 2013, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The weak margins, also known as cracks, have prompted speculation that some European refiners would reduce their gasoline output in coming weeks, according to traders. Overall refining margins in northwest Europe were below seasonal levels seen over the past three years. They were, however, supported by relatively strong diesel refining margins. “Refining margins have clearly been responding to an oversupplied market in recent weeks, and with European markets struggling to find export destinations for gasoline volumes especially, the economic run cuts we have begun to see over September could well continue through the weeks ahead,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said in a note. In the United States, benchmark gasoline refining margins RBc1-CLc1 were near their lowest levels since February 2017 after stocks on the East Coast rose last week to 70.6 million barrels, compared with 58.2 million a year earlier. U.S. gasoline demand in August was down 1.5 percent from a year earlier at 9.61 million barrels per day (bpd) while in Europe it was down 1.3 percent at 2.01 million bpd, according to the International Energy Agency. ARBITRAGE TO AUSTRALIA OPENS Weak European margins usually prompt an increase in export opportunities to regions that are priced more competitively. French major Total made a provisional booking in recent days for a tanker to load 90,000 tonnes of gasoline in ARA to go to Australia. The STI Alexis is expected to load on Oct. 18 and the booking allows the ship an option to deliver to other destinations. The route to Australia from Europe is very rare. Traders said the paper price differential between Europe and Asia for December, known as the east/west arbitrage, has risen from $0.80 a barrel at the start of October to around $1.70 a barrel now. This indicates more favourable economics to export to Asia Pacific. One trader said the weak European cracks is likely to stir import interest from China.

Outage plans for offshore fields and onshore processing plants in the following year are published in the fourth quarter, and while it is subject to revision, the 2019 schedule should be viewed as a complete plan, Gassco told Reuters. Last year, Gassco transported a record 117.4 bcm through the pipeline systems from Norway to continental Europe and Britain. The scope of outages announced for 2019 is 3 bcm bigger than that of 2017, a year of exceptionally low maintenance, and is also expected to be higher than that of 2018, consultancy Energy Aspects said. When Gassco published outage plans for 2018, in December 2017, they amounted to 3.2 bcm, but said that number was only partial. The overall number will definitely be lower than 7 bcm however, said Trevor Sikorski, head of natural gas and carbon at Energy Aspects. Norway’s largest gas field Troll will undergo maintenance between April and September, with August and September the months with the highest maintenance impact for the field. Kollsnes, the country’s largest processing plant and a major exporting facility to Britain, will also undergo major maintenance, with the heaviest part taking place between Aug. 24 and Sept. 5, when capacity will be reduced by 146.5 million cubic metres per day.

2018-10-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has warned operators of electrical power links with Europe that they will need to set up alternative trading arrangements if the country leaves the European Union next year with no exit deal. The United Kingdom imports around 6 percent of its electricity via power links with France, the Netherlands and Ireland but plans to build several more. Companies operating electricity interconnectors, which include Britain’s National Grid (NG.L) and French grid operator RTE, should “carry out contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ scenario”, a government paper said. In the event of no deal on Britain’s EU exit, European energy law will no longer apply to the UK electricity market. The paper said the government and energy regulator Ofgem were working with interconnector operators “to ensure new access rules are approved in Great Britain and are providing support to interconnectors engaging with EU Member State authorities”. Britain has issued a series of papers outlining the implications of a no-deal Brexit for a range of sectors. The British government wants to increase power supply options, such as new interconnectors, as old domestic coal and nuclear plants close from the mid-2020s. However, Norway’s state-owned grid operator Statnett [STASF.UL] warned earlier this year that Brexit could hamper new projects, including two planned links with Norway.

2018-10-12,"(Repeats story published late on Oct 11 with no changes to text) BOGOTA, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Colombia’s constitutional court on Thursday ruled that local referendums that ban mining and oil extraction cannot halt energy projects, after a raft of votes spooked multinational companies. A wave of environmentally focused anti-mining referendums over the past 18 months have worried investors, and forced some to alter investment plans, like AngloGold Ashanti which suspended a potential $2 billion project last year. The ruling on the suit brought by Mansarovar Energy Colombia, a joint venture between India’s ONGC-Videsh and China’s Sinopec, was backed 5 to 1 by magistrates, the court said. The Colombian Mining Association (ACM) said in a statement after the court decision it was now optimistic projects would get back on track. “This decision not only gives life to several mining projects that would have been truncated by the (votes) but begins to give positive signals in terms of legal security,” it said. The previous government failed to legislate the issue, but President Ivan Duque, who took office two months ago, promised during his campaign to boost investment in the sector, which meant providing legal clarity to the mining sector. The country’s subsoil is national property and cannot be restricted by local authorities, the court ruling said. The national government, however, cannot exercise sole control over extractive projects and Congress must pass regulations as soon as possible that allow communities to voice opposition to mining and oil projects, the court said. There are 158 referendum initiatives in 135 municipalities nationwide, of which 9 votes have been held, all against mining and oil exploitation, the ACM said. Mansarovar brought the suit after residents of Cumaral municipality in central Meta province voted last year to ban oil exploration. Mansarovar could not immediately be reached for comment.

Eskom, which has fewer than 20 days of coal supply at 10 of its power stations, supplies more than 90 percent of the nation’s power and is one of its most indebted state firms. “We have made offers to Eskom, they have from what I hear, approved those offers,” Exxaro’s chief executive officer Mxolisi Mgojo told Reuters in an interview. “The final decision is sitting with the (state) Treasury to enable them to execute those contracts.” Eskom said last month it was trying to secure new contracts with companies to ensure it had enough coal, after a major supplier cut supplies and sought insolvency protection. Exxaro, which already supplies Eskom’s Matimba, Matla and Medupi power stations, aims to enter into short-term contracts with Eskom, said Mgojo. “We don’t want to get involved in long-term 10-, 20-, 30-year type arrangements,” said Mgojo. “We want to create the flexibility whereby when the opportunity makes sense for us to play short-term into the Eskom market we have that flexibility to do that.” Eskom’s spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the power utility was “very close” to signing new deals. He declined to confirm that a deal with Exxaro was imminent. “Hopefully before the end of this month we should be seeing the first trucks coming through to the stations that are affected,” said Phasiwe. Phasiwe declined to say who Eskom was negotiating coal contracts with, only that it was talking to 12 companies. “We are not in a position to mention them but some of them include the main players in the market,” Phasiwe said. Eskom needs 3 million tonnes of coal to close its deficit but was also looking to stockpile a further 10 million tonnes, Phasiwe said. Eskom, which has a total national output of 45,000 MW, implemented power cutting measures, known locally as “load shedding”, in 2015, denting economic output.

2018-10-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - British energy company Cuadrilla said on Friday it would begin fracking a shale gas well at its Lancashire site on Oct. 13 after a court removed the final hurdle to the first hydraulic fracturing in Britain in seven years. The privately owned company will spend three months fracking two horizontal wells, which involves injecting sand, water and chemicals to split the tightly packed shale rock and induce gas to flow out. This will be the first fracking of a horizontal shale gas well since a 2011 attempt by Cuadrilla caused earth tremors, prompting protests, tighter regulations and delays. The process will be followed by the first flow rate tests from fractured horizontal shale gas wells in Britain to ascertain not only whether the well could commercially produce gas but test how similar the prospect is to the shale plays that have transformed the U.S. gas industry. “We are delighted to be starting our hydraulic fracturing operations as planned,” Cuadrilla’s Chief Executive Francis Egan said in a statement. Flow rate tests will be run after Cuadrilla fracks the two wells and results are expected in the new year. The company said last week it would put sensors in one well as the other is fracked to monitor any seismic activity during the process. Egan said last week that a result matching an estimate that a single 2.5 km (1.6 mile) well could produce about 5 million cubic feet a day would be a good one. A local resident wanted the fracking suspended to allow for a judicial review of the local council’s safety procedures, but a High Court judge dismissed the case.

2018-10-12,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government is committed to introducing tougher sanctions against companies that foster criminal behavior in the wake of Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) diesel emissions scandal, the country’s justice minister said. In an interview published in Friday’s edition of the Handelsblatt newspaper, Katarina Barley said she had seen a pattern whereby companies try to blame individual managers for any wrongdoing. “This was very blatant in the diesel scandal, in several companies,” she added, without naming any of the companies. Barley said individuals will in future still be responsible for any crimes they commit. “But if there is a visible structure in a company that fosters and covers up criminal behavior, there should be penalties for companies in the future,” she said. A coalition agreement between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and their centre-left SPD partners signed in March included plans to ensure that companies that profit from the wrongdoing of staff members face tougher sanctions. The agreement said that the maximum penalty for companies generating more than 100 million euros in annual revenues should be raised to 10 percent of annual sales, up from a cap of 10 million euros previously. While it is unlikely that all plans in the coalition agreement will be implemented, Barley’s comments suggest that the proposal on company sanctions could become law. Volkswagen in 2015 admitted to using illegal software to cheat emissions tests, sparking a scandal that has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines. Environmental lobby group DUH, which has been seeking bans on diesel cars in a number of German cities in the wake the VW scandal, told Handelsblatt that Barley, of the SPD party, was not going far enough. New legislation should require that sanctions against companies are pursued, and it should also allow companies to be sanctioned even if none of their staff members can be made personally liable, DUH managing director Juergen Resch told the paper. “Our criminal law is being hampered by the fact that only people but not companies can be punished. That is absurd,” he said.   German industry association BDI meanwhile criticized Barley, saying the proposed change in law risked unnecessarily criminalizing companies. “Existing law already offers ways to sanction both individuals and companies,” Handelsblatt quoted Niels Lau, head of BDI’s legal department, as saying.

2018-10-12,"* Asian, European shares bounce; sentiment cautious * VIX volatility gauge retreats from 8-month high * China trade surplus with U.S. hits all-time peak By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Shares worldwide were set for their biggest daily gains in nearly a month on Friday as European and Asian markets recovered from a days-long sell-off that left them set for their worst week since February. After Asian shares rose overnight, European stocks opened higher, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.7 percent. Germany’s DAX was up half a percent while Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.7 percent. S&P stock futures pointed to a rebound in U.S. stocks later in the day , while the VIX volatility index climbed down from an eight-month high. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up half a percent on the day. “Some traders are cautiously buying back into the market today, but the underlying issues which brought about the sell-off are still relevant,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. The biggest market shakeout since February has been blamed on a series of factors, including worries about the impact of a U.S.-China trade war, a spike in U.S. bond yields this week and caution ahead of earnings season. Trade figures from China on Friday showed China’s trade surplus with the United States hit a record high in September, providing a likely source of contention with U.S. President Donald Trump over trade policies and the currency. The data showed solid expansion in China’s overall imports and exports, suggesting little damage from the tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States. That added to bullish sentiment on Friday, CMC’s Madden said, noting the decision by U.S. Treasury staff to refrain from labelling China a currency manipulator as a positive for stocks. Shanghai shares bounced 0.9 percent, recouping earyly-session losses of 1.8 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 2.06 percent, the biggest one-day gain for more than two years. The bounce came after the index fell 3.6 percent on Thursday to hit a 1-1/2-year low, and it is still on track for a weekly loss of 3.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average rose half a percent. So far this week, Chinese and U.S. shares are among the biggest losers, a sign investor worries about the trade war are growing. MSCI’s U.S. index has shed 5.5 percent, compared with a 4.9 percent fall for MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries. China A shares are still down 8.7 percent. “We’re still left with the sense that there has been a significant shift that markets now have to take stock of,” Daiwa Capital Markets head of economic research Chris Scicluna said. Gold, which had risen to a 10-week high on the back of the sell-off, fell half a percent on Friday to $1.217.31 an ounce. The yield on 10-year U.S. notes edged up in Europe to 3.170 percent, reversing early-session falls on flight-to-quality bids. It is off its seven-year Tuesday high of 3.261 percent but a further rise in U.S. borrowing costs might hurt risk sentiment. Online broker XM investment broker Marios Hadjikyriacos said the pullback in yields was a major comfort factor for investors. “This can be seen as a self-correcting mechanism, where stocks begin to sell off as bond yields rise, leading investors to shift back to bonds amid the risk-averse environment, hence driving yields back down and calming the stock market,” he said. Adding to the confusion for investors, Trump launched a second day of criticism of the Federal Reserve on Thursday, calling its interest rate increases a “ridiculous” policy. While that does not appear to have shaken investor confidence in the Fed’s independence, some investors suspect expectations on future rate hikes could be undermined if Trump’s language becomes more threatening. The dollar against a basket of major currencies rose 0.1 percent to 95.093. The euro was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1583, after a gain of 0.65 percent on Thursday. But the yen eased to 112.24 versus the dollar after hitting a three-week high of 111.83 on Thursday. The Chinese yuan weakened half a percent, giving up some of the gains it had made the previous day. Oil prices bounced back on Friday. Brent crude futures rose 0.4 percent to $80.60 a barrel, holding off a 4-year high of $86.74 touched on Oct. 3. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho

2018-10-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil markets look “adequately supplied for now” after a big production increase in the last six months, but the industry is coming under strain, the West’s energy watchdog said on Friday. The International Energy Agency said in its monthly report that the world’s spare oil production capacity was down to 2 percent of global demand, with further falls likely. “This strain could be with us for some time and it will likely be accompanied by higher prices, however much we regret them and their potential negative impact on the global economy,” the Paris-based organisation said. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other exporters such as Russia agreed in June to raise output as the market appeared increasingly tight. The price of global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 has risen from around $45 a barrel in June 2017 and peaked at over $85 this month on bullish bets by speculators. [O/R] OPEC, Russia and others such as U.S. shale companies had increased production sharply since May, the IEA said, raising global output by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd). Overall, OPEC had boosted production by 735,000 bpd since May as Middle East Gulf producers such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE more than compensated for declining output in Venezuela and Iran, which is facing U.S. sanctions from next month. Supply from Iran during September dropped to a two-and-a-half year low, the IEA said, as customers continued to cut back in the run-up to new sanctions, which start on Nov. 4. Iranian output fell to 3.45 million bpd, it said, down 180,000 bpd month-on-month. Iranian oil exports in September fell to 1.63 million bpd, down 800,000 bpd from recent 2Q18 peaks, the agency estimated. “The decline may deepen significantly ahead of U.S. sanctions - and subsequently as final cargoes are delivered,” said the IEA, which advises major oil consumers on energy policy.  But the outlook for world oil consumption is faltering, the IEA said as it cut its forecast of global oil demand growth by 0.11 million bpd for both this year and next to 1.28 million bpd and 1.36 million bpd respectively. “This is due to a weaker economic outlook, trade concerns, higher oil prices,” it said. OECD commercial stocks rose by 15.7 million barrels in August to 2.854 billion barrels, their highest level since February, on strong refinery output and liquefied petroleum gas restocking, the IEA said. It added that OECD inventories were likely to have risen by 43 million barrels in the third quarter, the largest quarterly increase in stocks since the first quarter of 2016. “The increase in net production from key suppliers since May of approximately 1.4 million bpd, led by Saudi Arabia, and the fact that oil stocks built by 0.5 million bpd in 2Q18 and look likely to have done the same in 3Q18, lends weight to the argument that the oil market is adequately supplied for now,” the IEA said.

2018-10-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Diesel car sales in Europe fell sharply in the first half of the year amid buyer concerns over pollution and falling resale value as governments seek to reduce combustion engine car sales. “The disaffection towards diesel engine cars is spreading all over Europe,” the International Energy Agency said in a report. The sale market share of diesel cars in the European Union fell to 36.5 percent in the first half of 2018 from 42.5 percent in the first half of 2017, according to the IEA. Sales declined by 16 percent during the period to 3.12 million units, with declines in Britain reaching 30 percent. In Germany, home to some of the world’s biggest diesel car producers including Volkswagen AG (VOWG.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), diesel car sales dropped to 31.1 percent of the total in the first half of 2018 from 41.3 percent a year earlier. As a result, demand for diesel in Europe is also faltering, down by 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August from the previous month. A number of major European cities including Berlin, London and Paris have launched diesel car ban programmes to fight pollution. Europe has been the world’s biggest market for diesel cars since the 1980s after governments sought highly efficient engines to curb oil consumption and limit carbon emissions.  Diesel engines have fallen out of favour in recent years over their high emissions of toxic particles and following Volkswagen’s emissions scandal in 2015.

2018-10-12,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Amid gathering gloom over the state of the Chinese economy, exporters of motorcycles, tractors, photocopiers and Christmas tree lighting will join thousands of other companies peddling their wares at China’s largest trade fair Monday.  Many of those exporters will have something in common - uncertainty over future U.S. orders as a trade war with the United States rages. The turmoil has added to concerns over the health of the Chinese economy, already under pressure from a cooling property market, a crackdown on corporate debt and risky lending practices, and a nationwide anti-pollution campaign.  The United States over the summer levied tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods as punishment for what it says are unfair trade practices by China. The latest tariff salvo represented half of the $500 billion of products that the United States bought from China last year. The rapid escalation of the trade dispute has taken many Chinese exporters by surprise. At the spring session of the twice-a-year Canton Fair in Guangzhou, only a quarter of the exporters whom Reuters spoke to said they expected a full-blown trade war. As exporters gather at the autumn session of the three-week gathering that starts Monday, a far more sombre outlook is expected to pervade the tens of thousands of exhibition booths at the fair.  U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap tariffs on more Chinese imports in an intensifying trade war that has led many forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund, to cut their global economic projections for 2018 and 2019.  Beijing has been urging Chinese exporters to diversify their overseas destinations and rely less on the United States - China’s biggest trading partner - or turn their focus to domestic customers instead.  “Our existing U.S. orders are relatively stable, but our U.S. clients are not increasing their orders,” said an official at a Guangzhou-based battery maker, one of many facing higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese batteries.  “We’re keeping prices stable and swallowing the tariffs ourselves,” the official said.  As export-reliant cities and provinces like Guangdong show the strain, policymakers are increasingly rolling out measures to help businesses weather the trade storm.  The central bank has cut the amount of cash that commercial banks need to set aside as reserves four times this year to spur lending to small businesses. The finance ministry has reduced taxes and increased tax rebates to help lower the overheads of businesses. Billion-dollar infrastructure projects have been put on the fast track to stimulate growth. The authorities, while saying they will not resort to competitive devaluation of China's currency to boost exports, have allowed the yuan CNY=CFXS to fall about 6 percent against the dollar this year.  Overall Chinese exports have been mostly resilient, with data Friday showing that September shipments soared 14.5 percent year-on-year, far exceeding expectations for an 8.9 percent uptick. [L4N1WP28H] The trade war with the United States is complicating an already weakening picture of growth in China this year. Beijing has set a GDP growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018. The economy expanded 6.9 percent last year.  Growth has been slowing as China sheds excess production capacity and shuts polluting factories, with fixed asset investment slumping this year and monthly industrial output growth stuck in a relatively low range of 6-7 percent.   Meanwhile, curbs and restrictions put in place to fend off property speculators have resulted in a slowdown in the residential real estate market, hitting construction and other related sectors. The impact of a multi-year crackdown on corporate debt levels and risky lending practices has also become more apparent. Private firms are warning about tighter financing as their access to shadow financing - a cheaper source of funds than bank loans - shrinks.  Annual growth in outstanding total social financing, a broad gauge of credit that includes off-balance sheet financing, slowed to 10.1 percent in August, the lowest on record. As businesses struggle or even go belly-up, domestic consumption, a driver of the economy, has started to moderate.  Monthly growth in retail sales, one gauge of China’s consumption, dipped below 10 percent in April where they have remained since. The last time retail sales grew less than 10 percent was over a decade ago.  Automobile sales fell for the third straight month in September, down 11.6 percent from a year earlier, as worries about the economy prompted consumers to tighten their purse-strings and forego big-ticket purchases. WAIT-AND-SEE The state-controlled media has so far played up China’s capability to tackle both internal and external challenges, including the trade war, saying there are ample policy tools available to keep growth on an even footing.  “The impact of the trade war is not too obvious yet because the U.S. tariffs have not filtered down to some sectors yet,” said Joe Chung, owner of a ceramic tile manufacturer in Guangdong. “The worry is not just about the United States. With exports to the U.S. slowing, there will be increased competition for other overseas markets,” Chung said, predicting tough times over the next two years.  Ceramic floor materials are on the U.S. tariff hit-list.  Chinese exporters of goods not yet on any U.S. tariff retaliation list vary, including products like toys, sewing machines and wigs.  China’s foreign trade growth may slow in the fourth quarter, the country’s customs agency said on Friday.

2018-10-12,"FRANKFURT, Oct 12 (Reuters) - German utility Uniper has hit back at suggestions that Germany should sacrifice the company’s planned Datteln 4 coal power plant to help to meet the country’s carbon-reducing climate goals. The Rheinische Post daily reported on Friday that Economy Minister Peter Altmaier proposed that Germany considers shutting close to 5 gigawatts (GW) of German coal-fired power capacity and that Datteln 4 should not be connected to the power grid. The plant is already under contruction and slated to begin operating in 2020. “It would be a foolish act to symbolically sacrifice Datteln 4 within a possible coal-exit scenario,” Uniper board member Eckhardt Ruemmler said in a written statement. “Instead of making the energy transition a model of success with the help of one of the most modern power stations in Europe, we would instead continue to operate old and more highly CO2-emitting plants (should Datteln 4 not go live).” A spokeswoman for the Berlin ministry said Altmaier had not made numerical suggestions regarding coal capacity to be shut. She referred to a coal-exit commission that is due to meet on Friday ahead of a year-end deadline to come up with a schedule for limiting and phasing out coal-fired power generation. Altmaier is not part of the commission. Datteln 4, a 1,050 megawatt (MW) hard-coal plant, should have started in 2011 but proved a major headache for Uniper, attracting protests by environmentalists and swallowing 1.2 billion euros  ($1.4 billion) in investment so far. It has also been held up by damages to its boiler during component tests. Ruemmler emphasised that Uniper was ready to work with the government on making power production less carbon-intensive and eventually get out of coal altogether. Germany still derives 40 percent of its power from coal and employs tens of thousands in the industry. The coal commission will help to allocate federal funds amounting to 1.5 billion euros in the current government’s term for bringing new industries into coal regions, according to a draft proposal seen by Reuters. It is also expected to discuss additional funding needs and infrastructure for the longer-term future of the regions, working closely with the European Union.

2018-10-12,"WARSAW, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The Polish government is looking to reduce the impact of surging electricity prices on households, either by helping suppliers or giving tax relief for consumers, the Parkiet newspaper said, quoting draft regulations prepared for the energy ministry. Such a move would be the latest costly proposal from the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party ahead of municipal elections this month. The party, which took power in 2015, has also promised to boost spending on roads and air quality. The energy ministry was not immediately available to comment. Electricity prices on the Polish power exchange have leapt 60-70 percent in the year to September, on the back of higher coal prices and the rising cost of carbon emissions permits. Poland has liberalized power prices for companies but still regulates them for households. While the head of the energy market regulator said earlier this year the higher price would have to be reflected in households bills, the energy minister has said prices will remain unchanged. Parkiet said the energy ministry had worked out two proposals to help households, both to be financed with proceeds from the sale of EU carbon permits. One would include support for mostly state-run electricity suppliers, although this could run foul of EU state-aid rules, Parkiet said. The other proposal is potential tax relief for households. “We are aware of the weight of the problems resulting from electricity price increase. We are planning to launch a package of shielding solutions for citizens and industrial consumers. These could be reliefs from various payments, or even compensations for (the) CO2 emission price,” Parkiet quoted the energy minister as saying. The current electricity tariff expires at the end of this year. Analysts say Poland’s state-run utilities are unlikely to ask for regulatory approval to raise power prices for households ahead of regional elections next month and a general election next year, although this may hit their profits.

Overall OPEC had boosted production by 735,000 bpd since May as Middle East Gulf producers such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE more than compensated for declining output in Venezuela and Iran, which is facing U.S. sanctions from next month. And the outlook for world oil consumption was faltering. The IEA cut its forecast of global oil demand growth by 0.11 million bpd for both this year and next to 1.28 million bpd and 1.36 million bpd respectively. “This is due to a weaker economic outlook, trade concerns, higher oil prices and a revision to Chinese data,” said the IEA, which advises major oil consumers on energy policy. OECD commercial stocks rose by 15.7 million barrels in August to 2.854 billion barrels, their highest level since February, on strong refinery output and liquefied petroleum gas restocking, the IEA said. It added that OECD inventories were likely to have risen by 43 million barrels in the third quarter, the largest quarterly increase in stocks since the first quarter of 2016. “The increase in net production from key suppliers since May of approximately 1.4 million bpd, led by Saudi Arabia, and the fact that oil stocks built by 0.5 million bpd in 2Q18 and look likely to have done the same in 3Q18, lends weight to the argument that the oil market is adequately supplied for now,” the IEA said.

2018-10-12,"BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The former chairmen of CEFC China Energy and China Development Bank (CDB) were named in a high-profile graft trial of a senior Communist Party official, state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing prosecution evidence presented in court. The report gives the first inkling of why the once high-flying CEFC chairman, Ye Jianming, has disappeared from public view after it was revealed in March he was under investigation for suspected economic crimes. The businessman ranked second in Fortune magazine’s “40 Under 40” list of the world’s most influential young people in 2016, but the conglomerate he created is now being dismantled under a mountain of debt. Until now, authorities had given no information about any of the allegations against Ye. But on Thursday at the corruption trial of former official Wang Sanyun in Henan, prosecutors alleged that Wang had accepted bribes from Ye in 2011, CCTV reported. Wang was Communist Party chief of northwestern Gansu province from 2011 to 2017. The bribes helped CEFC acquire a stake in Hainan Bank, and the favour was channelled through Hu Huaibang, then chairman of Bank of Communications and later chairman of major CEFC creditor CDB, the report said. Wang is accused of taking bribes from multiple sources worth about 67 million yuan ($9.7 million) from 1993 to 2017, according to the indictment. The former provincial chief was also accused of helping CEFC subsidiary CEFC Hainan to obtain $4.8 billion in financing from CDB when Hu served as the policy bank’s chairman. Hu stepped down as CDB chairman in September. Wang pleaded guilty to the charges after evidence was presented, according to CCTV. CEFC grew in a few years from a niche fuel trader into a diversified conglomerate with assets across the globe and more than 30,000 employees. In September last year it agreed to buy a $9.1 billion stake in the Russian oil major Rosneft. But in recent months CEFC’s creditors, led by CDB, have been conducting sales of the debt-laden conglomerate’s global assets, including oil and gas stakes in Abu Dhabi and Chad, and properties in Europe and Shanghai. The Zhengzhou Intermediate People’s Court said its verdict on the Wang case would be delivered at a later date. CDB and Bank of Communications did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. Ye and Hu could not be reached for comment. CEFC did not respond an email request for comment.

2018-10-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will cut the incentives available to those buying plug-in hybrid vehicles as it focuses on pure electric models, sparking anger from an industry trade body as carmakers already face declining sales in Europe’s second-biggest autos market.  Buyers of vehicles which emit less than 50 grams/km of CO2 and have a zero-emission range of at least 70 miles will see the grant they are eligible for reduced by 22 percent to 3,500 pounds. Those purchasing cars emitting up to 75 grams/km of CO2 but with a lower zero-emission range will no longer be eligible for such support under plans due to come into force next month.  “With plug-in hybrid models like the Mitsubishi Outlander becoming popular among consumers the government is focussing its attention to zero emission models such as the Nissan Leaf and BMW i3,” the government said in a statement.  Hybrid vehicles have both a combustion and electric engine.   The announcement comes just over two weeks before Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond is due to make his annual budget statement.  Sales of alternative-fuel vehicles, which include different types of environmentally-friendly cars, are the fastest growing part of the market, rising 22 percent so far this year, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).  However, the overall market is down 7.5 percent so far this year hit by a clampdown on diesel and more stringent emissions tests.  “Prematurely removing upfront purchase grants can have a devastating impact on demand – without world-class incentives, government’s world-class ambitions will not be delivered,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

2018-10-12,"* Ex-Japan Asia MSCI up 2.0 pct, biggest gain in 2 yrs * Volatility index hits highest since Feb * China, U.S. shares among worst performers this week * European shares seen rising 0.4-1.0 pct By Hideyuki Sano SINGAPORE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Asian shares staged a rebound on Friday to set course for their first gains in two weeks, with Shanghai managing a modest recovery from a rout that saw its shares crumble to near 4 year lows. The strong gains soothed investor sentiment, which was hit after a major volatility index, seen as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose to an eight-month high. European shares are seen following suit, with spreadbetters expecting London’s FTSE to open up 0.4 percent, and Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC 1.0 percent. Shanghai shares bounced 0.8 percent, recouping earlier losses of 1.8 percent as cheap valuations drew bargain hunters. “Since yesterday, trading volume has been fairly big suggesting strong buying interest,” said Naoki Tashiro, president of TS China Research in Tokyo. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 2.0 percent, the biggest in more than two years. But the bounce came after the index fell 3.6 percent on Thursday to hit a 1-1/2-year low. On the week, it is still on track for a weekly loss of 3.6 percent. The biggest market shakeout since February has been blamed on a series of factors, including worries about the impact of a Sino-U.S. trade war, a spike in U.S. bond yields this week and caution ahead of earnings seasons. Japan’s Nikkei average rose 0.5 percent while the U.S. stock futures gained 1 percent in Asian trade on Friday, in part helped by media report that the U.S. Treasury Department will not call China a currency  manipulator in its upcoming semiannual report. Earlier, Wall Street offered Asia a weak lead overnight with the U.S. S&P 500 falling just over 2 percent to a three-month low, following a 3.29 percent drop on Wednesday. “The (U.S. share) market is now about 7 percent off of its 100-day high, but this is far from a rare occurrence historically,” economists at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note. “Indeed, history is littered with over 5 percent-ish type selloffs in the midst of economic expansions,” they said. “The sharp sell-off we are seeing in the market has left a lot of folks wondering if this is the beginning of the end. Investors shouldn’t panic,” said Christopher Smart, head of macroeconomic and geopolitical research at Barings. “So far, it has the feel of a temporary correction that will take some of the excess air out of tech stocks. But the volatile markets mean that economic data and corporate earnings will get even closer scrutiny in the weeks ahead. “ Chinese trade figures on Friday showed, however, China’s trade surplus with the United States hit a record high in September, providing a likely source of contention with U.S. President Donald Trump over trade policies and the currency. The data showed solid expansion in China’s overall imports and exports, suggesting little damage from the tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States. CBOE Volatility index rose on Thursday to its highest close since Feb 12, pointing to investors concern of further losses in markets. So far this week, Chinese and U.S. shares are among the worst performers in a sign investor worries about the trade war are deepening. MSCI’s U.S. index has shed 5.5 percent, compared with a 4.9 percent fall for MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries. China A shares are still down 8.7 percent. Gold, typically seen as a safe-haven asset at times of high uncertainty, held steady on Friday. It fetched $1,221.9 per ounce, keeping the 2.5 percent gain from Thursday, which was its biggest percentage rise since June 2016. The yield on 10-year U.S. notes edged up 4.5 basis points in Asia to 3.176 percent, reversing earlier falls on flight-to-quality bids. It is still off its seven-year high of 3.261 percent touched on Tuesday, but a further rise in the U.S. borrowing costs could hurt risk sentiment. “Asian stocks appeared to have stabilised but ultimately where U.S. bond yields will settle down will be key,” said Teppei Ino, senior analyst at MUFG Bank. Adding confusion for investors, Trump launched a second day of criticism of the Federal Reserve on Thursday, calling its interest rate increases a “ridiculous” policy. While that does not appear to have shaken investor confidence in the Fed’s independence, some investors suspect expectations on future rate hikes could be undermined if Trump raises his threats levels. “I doubt Trump will tolerate further rise in U.S. rates ahead of U.S. mid-term elections. I believe the rise in U.S. yields and the dollar’s rally are coming to a turning point,” said Naoki Iwami, fixed income chief investment officer at Whiz Partners in Tokyo. The dollar lacked momentum against a basket of major currencies as U.S. bond yields stayed off recent peaks. The euro ticked up slightly to $1.1590, after a gain of 0.65 percent on Thursday. But the yen eased to 112.35 to the dollar after hitting a three-week high of 111.83 on Thursday. The Chinese yuan weakened about 0.3 percent, giving up some of the gains it had made the previous day. Oil prices bounced back on Friday. Brent crude futures rose 1.2 percent to $81.25 a barrel, holding off a four-year high of $86.74 touched on Oct 3.

2018-10-12,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s vast export engine unexpectedly kicked into higher gear in September, producing a record trade surplus with the United States that could exacerbate the already-heated dispute between Beijing and Washington. Analysts said last month’s strong export growth - which might indicate U.S. tariffs are not biting much yet - is unlikely to be sustained. But the robust numbers reported on Friday by China’s customs agency - the last ones from China before U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6 - could prompt a reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump. September exports rose 14.5 percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace since February, the customs data showed. That was well above August’s 9.8 percent and a Reuters poll forecast of  8.9 percent.  “The big picture is the Chinese exports have so far held up well in the face of escalating trade tensions and cooling global growth, most likely thanks to the competitiveness boost provided by a weaker renminbi,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. “With global growth likely to cool further in the coming quarters and US tariffs set to become more punishing, the recent resilience of exports is unlikely to be sustained.” A weaker yuan CNY=CFXS, which has depreciated about 6 percent against the dollar this year, may have taken the sting out of the tariffs imposed on $250 billion of exports to the United States.  Despite concerns from some officials about the yuan’s depreciation, U.S. Treasury staff have not recommended labelling China as a currency manipulator in a coming report on foreign exchange rate practices, according to media reports on Thursday. China’s politically-sensitive surplus with the U.S. was $34.13 billion (£25.78 billion) in September, surpassing the record of $31.05 billion in August. Beijing’s export data has been surprisingly resilient to tariffs, possibly because companies ramped up shipments before broader and stiffer U.S. duties went into effect, raising concerns about a sharper drop in export strength once all tariffs kick in.  “The front-loading impact is quite obvious to me,” said Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.  She cited a jump in exports of electrical machinery - the biggest export item from China to the U.S. - as a sign exporters might have pushed out shipments ahead of implementation of the latest tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese exports. Along with electrical machinery, exports for textiles, furniture and chips all rose faster than in the previous month, the customs data showed.  “If that’s the case then I think further downside risk can be expected in the fourth quarter,” Wang said. Li Kuiwen, a spokesman from the country’s customs agency, also told reporters trade growth may slow somewhat in the fourth quarter.  The world’s two biggest economies last slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other’s goods on Sept. 24. There is no specific date set for the next round of tariffs, even as Trump has made repeated threats to impose them on virtually all Chinese goods. China’s exports to the U.S. continued to rise at a double- digit clip in September compared with a year earlier, while imports fell for the first time since February.  Over the first nine months of the year, China’s surplus with its largest export market totalled $225.79 billion, compared with about $196.01 billion in the same period last year. Growth in overall imports for September instead showed a moderate slowdown, in line with signs the broad cooling in domestic demand. Imports rose 14.3 percent in September, versus a 19.9 percent gain in August, slightly missing analysts’ forecast of a 15.0 percent growth. Iron ore imports rose to their highest level in four months as steel mills ramped up output ahead of winter production restrictions. For trade with all countries, China logged a surplus of $31.69 billion for September, compared with forecasts in a Reuters poll for $19.4 billion and August’s surplus of $27.89 billion.  China’s economy is feeling some heat from tariff dispute and signs of slowing that prompted the central bank on Sunday to loosen policy by cutting banks’ reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for a fourth time this year. Growth in China’s factory sector in September stalled after 15 months of expansion, with export orders falling the most in more than two years, a private business survey showed. An official survey also confirmed a further manufacturing weakening. To shore up growth, Beijing has pledged to increase export tax rebates from Nov. 1 for the second time this year and promised to cut corporate burden on a larger scale to help struggling Chinese firms. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for this year and next, saying that the U.S-China trade war was taking a toll. It also slashed China’s growth forecast for next year to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent. China will cut import tariffs on a wide range of goods beginning on Nov. 1, as part of Beijing’s pledge to take steps to increase imports this year amid rising tension.

2018-10-12,"PORT ST. JOE, Fla., Oct 12 (Reuters) - Rescuers will pick through the rubble of ravaged beach communities searching for survivors on Friday after Michael, one of the most powerful hurricanes in U.S. history, slammed into the Florida Panhandle, killing at least seven people. Michael struck Florida’s northwest coast near the small town of Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 kph), pushing a wall of seawater inland and causing widespread flooding. The storm tore entire neighborhoods apart, reducing homes and businesses to piles of wood and siding, damaging roads and leaving scenes of devastation that resembled the aftermath of a carpet-bombing operation. U.S. Army personnel used heavy equipment to push a path through debris in Mexico Beach to allow rescuers through to search for trapped residents, survivors or casualties, as Blackhawk helicopters circled overhead. Rescuers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) used dogs, drones and GPS in the search. “We prepare for the worst and hope for the best. This is obviously the worst,” said Stephanie Palmer, a FEMA firefighter and rescuer from Coral Springs, Florida. Much of downtown Port St. Joe, 12 miles (19 km) east of Mexico Beach, was flooded after Michael snapped boats in two and hurled a large ship onto the shore, residents said. “We had houses that were on one side of the street and now they’re on the other,” said Mayor Bo Patterson, who watched trees fly by his window as he rode out the storm in his home seven blocks from the beach. Patterson estimated 1,000 homes were completely or partially destroyed in his town of 3,500 people. Jordon Tood, 31, a charter boat captain in Port St. Joe, said: “There were mandatory evacuation orders, but only idiots like us stuck around.” “This was my sixth (hurricane), so I thought I was prepared,” he said. In Apalachicola, about 30 miles (48 km) east of where the storm made landfall, a little less than half of the 2,200 people stayed and rode out the storm, residents said. “I’ve never seen anything like this craziness,” said Tamara’s cafe owner Danny Itzkovitz, 54, as he was busy grilling burgers. “We’ve had storms before - in ‘05 we had four or five in a row. I didn’t even take the boards off my window. But, holy smokes, this one kicked our butt.” The storm peeled back part of the gym roof and tore off a wall at Jinks Middle School in Panama City. A year ago, the school welcomed students and families displaced by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. “I have had employees going to the communities where our kids live, going door to door and checking,” Principal Britt Smith said by phone. “I have been up since 3:30 or 4 a.m. emailing and checking on staff to see if they are safe. So far, everybody seems to be very safe.” With a low barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, a measure of a hurricane’s force, Michael was the third strongest storm on record to hit the continental United States, behind only Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys. It weakened overnight to a tropical storm. Fast-moving Michael, a Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale when it came ashore, was about 15 miles (25 km) northeast of Norfolk, Virginia, at 10 p.m. (0200 GMT), with top sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph) as it headed for the Atlantic coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It was toppling trees and bringing life-threatening flash flooding to areas of Georgia and Virginia, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence, as it marched northeast. At least seven people were killed by falling trees and other hurricane-related incidents in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, according to state officials. Emergency services carried out dozens of rescues of people caught in swiftly moving floodwaters in North Carolina. Many of the injured in Florida were taken to hard-hit Panama City, 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Mexico Beach. Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center treated some but the hospital evacuated 130 patients as it faced challenges running on generators after the storm knocked out power, ripped off part of its roof and smashed windows, according to a spokesman for the hospital’s owner, HCA Healthcare Inc. Almost 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power from Florida to Virginia on Thursday because of the storm. The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by Friday, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross. Brad Rippey, a meteorologist for the U.S. Agriculture Department, said Michael severely damaged cotton, timber, pecan and peanut crops, causing estimated liabilities as high as $1.9 billion and affecting up to 3.7 million crop acres (1.5 million hectares). Michael also disrupted energy operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as it approached land, cutting crude oil production by more than 40 percent and natural gas output by nearly a third as offshore platforms were evacuated.

2018-10-12,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Solar power projects in the northwest Chinese region of Ningxia are struggling to maintain operations and face “bankruptcy risks” because of long subsidy payment delays, according to an investigation by regulators. The warning follows rapid growth in China’s solar sector, which has led to a subsidy backlog of 120 billion yuan ($17.4 billion), with prices for solar power varying wildly from region to region. China wants to bring down renewable energy costs to allow wind and solar projects to compete subsidy-free with coal-fired power. It has already capped the number of new projects this year in a bid to ease its subsidy burden and help the sector focus on efficient supply. The National Energy Administration’s (NEA’s) bureau in charge of northwest China said the payment backlog had forced many Ningxia projects to take high-interest loans to stay afloat, with some unable to afford basic maintenance. Government-approved solar projects are entitled to a subsidy for each kilowatt-hour they sell to the grid, but the surge in new capacity has left the finance ministry struggling to make the payments on time. “Local authorities in Ningxia should further control the capacity of renewable projects and strengthen supervision of subsidy distribution... in order to prevent widespread bankruptcy in the industry,” said the report. Some Chinese regions have already achieved “grid-price parity”, and according to draft rules published earlier this year, the government will work to provide more support for subsidy-free projects. However, wind and solar projects in western regions like Ningxia and Xinjiang still find it difficult to compete with cheaper coal, even though grid firms are legally obliged to source as much power from renewable sources as they can. The regulator admitted solar and wind power generation and transmission projects in Ningxia were “very expensive”, with data earlier this week showing the grid in Ningxia paid just 255.5 yuan per megawatt-hour (MWh) for coal-fired power last year, compared to 871.6 yuan for solar.

2018-10-12,"* Cooler temperatures curb coal demand from utilities * Typhoon Mangkhut disrupted unloading at key port in Sept * But imports expected to climb as winter approaches * Jan-Sept coal imports up 12 pct BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China’s coal imports dropped sharply in August from the month before, customs data showed on Friday, after cooler weather crimped demand from utilities and as a typhoon disrupted supply. Total arrivals last month fell 12 percent from August to the lowest since May at 25.14 million tonnes, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. Volumes were also down more than 7 percent from the same month last year. That came after utilities curbed buying as weather cooled earlier than normal in northern China, prompting households and businesses to turn off their air conditioners. “The earlier arrival of autumn cooled the coal market in September,” said a trader at state-owned Minmetals. “But we are expecting the upcoming winter heating season to bring back demand from utilities,” he added, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. On the supply side, traders said Typhoon Mangkhut in mid-September hit the unloading of coal cargoes at the port of Guangzhou in southern China. China’s largest coal port, Qinhuangdao in the northeast, also took temporary steps to restrict coal unloading in September as part of the country’s campaign against pollution. Total coal imports in the first nine months of 2018 climbed 12 percent from the same period last year to 228.96 million tonnes, the customs data showed. Reporting by Meng Meng and Aizhu Chen

2018-10-12,"* Ex-Japan Asia MSCI up 1.3 pct; Nikkei, Shanghai down * Volatility index hits highest since Feb * China, U.S. shares among worst performers this week By Hideyuki Sano SINGAPORE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Asian shares found a slightly firmer footing on Friday to set course for their first gains in two weeks, but the rout continued in Shanghai where shares hit lows last seen in 2014. Investor sentiment was frail though as Wall Street’s fear gauge rose to an eight-month high, pointing to more downside risk, market sources said. The biggest market shakeout since February has been blamed on a series of factors, including worries about the impact of a Sino-U.S. trade war, a spike in U.S. bond yields this week and caution ahead of earnings seasons. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.3  percent, led by gains in South Korea and Taiwan. The MSCI index fell 3.6 percent on Thursday to hit a 1-and-a-1/2 year low. It is on track for a weekly loss of more than 4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average fell 0.5 percent while the Shanghai Composite dropped as much as 1.8 percent to the lowest levels since late 2014, taking losses so far this week to almost 10 percent. Wall Street offered Asia a weak lead overnight with the U.S. S&P 500 falling just over 2 percent to a three-month low, following a 3.29 percent drop on Wednesday. “The (U.S. share) market is now about 7 percent off of its 100-day high, but this is far from a rare occurrence historically,” economists at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note. “Indeed, history is littered with over 5 percent-ish type selloffs in the midst of economic expansions,” they said.

So far this week, Chinese and U.S. shares are among the worst performers in a sign investor worries about the trade war are deepening. MSCI’s U.S. index has shed 5.5 percent, compared with a 4.9 percent fall for MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries.

But the yen eased to 112.35 to the dollar after hitting a three-week high of 111.83 on Thursday. The Chinese yuan weakened about 0.3 percent, giving up some of the gains it had made the previous day. Oil prices bounced back on Friday. Brent crude futures rose 0.5 percent to $80.66 a barrel, holding off a four-year high of $86.74 touched on Oct 3. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.44 percent to $71.28 a barrel, also off its multi-year highs touched last week.

2018-10-12,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s daily crude oil imports in September hit their highest level since May, customs data showed on Friday, as independent refiners looked to shore up their inventory ahead of winter. Shipments into the country last month stood at 37.12 million tonnes, or 9.05 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 9.04 million bpd in August and marking their third straight monthly rise, according to numbers from the General Administration of Customs.  Total crude imports over the first nine months of the year climbed 6 percent from the same period in 2017 to 336 million tonnes, or 8.98 million bpd, the customs data showed. “Crude run rates have been rising since September. With stable fuel demand, we have been scooping up crude oil, pushing up premiums of some crude grades,” a crude trader with an independent refinery said before the data was released. He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media. However, some Chinese refiners said they were concerned that a rally in global oil prices would erode their profit margins.  “Crude import growth slowed in September (partly) due to what was probably positive growth in domestic crude production,” said Sengyick Tee, a Beijing-based consultant at SIA Energy. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 stood around $80.60 per barrel on Friday, up more than 20 percent from the beginning of the year.  Looking ahead, China has hiked non-state oil import quotas for 2019, potentially supporting imports of the commodity. Total natural gas imports in September came in at 7.62 million tonnes, the customs data showed, dropping from 7.76 million tonnes in August.

2018-10-12,"BARCELONA, Oct 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The future that fast-growing cities in South Asia and Africa choose - cleaner and safer, or dirtier and more dangerous - will be pivotal to efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, scientists said in a key U.N. report this week. Iconic metropolises such as New York and London often grab headlines with their plans to cut air pollution, adopt electric transport, design green buildings or protect residents from floods. But greater efforts are needed to make similar changes in developing-world cities, particularly as many smaller ones lack the knowledge and financial resources to do it, experts said. “We know that much of urban growth is going to be in these small- and medium-sized cities in the global south,” said William Solecki, an author of the climate science report and professor at Hunter College-City University of New York. However, “these are cities that historically have had limited capacity in governance and finance,” he said. Around the world, cities consume more than two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for about three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the United Nations. Whether they can cut those emissions swiftly and protect inhabitants against worsening climate impacts, from flooding to heatwaves, will play a huge role in determining whether the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change are met. But many cities in poorer nations face significant challenges, including large and growing slum populations that lack basic services and are increasingly at risk from climate disasters, experts said. “The report highlights that climate change will impact the most vulnerable, that the capacity to respond will be most limited in those locations and among those peoples,” Solecki said. The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlined ways to hold warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, and sounded the alarm about the consequences if action to achieve that goal is not stepped up. The world’s slum population, for instance, is expected to triple to 3 billion by 2050, placing a significant proportion of people “beyond the direct reach” of formal policies to cut emissions and adapt to wild weather and rising seas, it noted. How to tackle the conditions that lead to informal urban settlements and fuel the risks to their inhabitants “is a central question”, the report said. Among the problems that need to be addressed, it said, are poverty, weak governance and low levels of investment by local authorities. On the brighter side, the lack of government services in poorer parts of cities also can spur “green” informal economies, based around things like recycling. Such economies are often low-carbon and use resources efficiently, the report noted. Bringing low-carbon transitions to slums will require governments teaming up with communities, it said. But “there is no guarantee that these partnerships will evolve or cohere into the type of service delivery and climate governance system that could steer the change on a scale required to limit to warming to 1.5C”, the report warned. Still, it acknowledged work by some organisations, such as Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI), to try to make that happen. That non-profit network is collaborating, among other initiatives, on a project in the South African city of Durban to build evidence - in part by having slum communities collect data - on the best ways to upgrade more than 20 informal settlements. Mark Watts, executive director of C40 Cities, which promotes climate action in metropolises, said his group was funding advisors for member African cities, to help them put together plans in line with the 1.5C warming goal. While those cities may lack expertise, they do not have “big negative bureaucracies to push against”, which may make winning the case for low-carbon development easier, he said. They also can “leapfrog the mistakes made by the West”, he added. An African city that lacks a waste management system, for instance, can build modern treatment plants that run on clean energy, rather than trying to fix or improve older facilities. Watts urged cities to stop investing in infrastructure - including roads - that is likely to hike carbon emissions in future. Instead they should put scarce resources into clean transport, zero-carbon buildings and training people to deliver green infrastructure, he said. Seven cities that are members of C40 - New York, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London, Oslo, Paris and Stockholm - have already published climate change strategies designed to deliver on the 1.5C goal, and a further 65 have committed to do so. But most cities are still developing in an unsustainable way that is adding to carbon emissions, Watts said. The 1.5C report made clear what cities must do to become green and resilient, and the urgency of following that path, he noted. ""The cities that don't change won't be viable in a few decades' time,"" he warned. (Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Laurie Goering.

2018-10-12,"(Adds quote, context on auctions, OPEC comments) By Alexandra Valencia QUITO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Ecuador has begun talks with neighboring Peru to jointly explore two oilfields at the border and allow state-run Petroamazonas to operate natural gas areas in Peru, Ecuadorian Energy Minister Carlos Perez said on Thursday. Ecuador, which earlier this year awarded foreign and domestic energy firms exploration and production rights for four oil blocks in the Andean country, plans to continue offering areas through an onshore auction later this year and another in 2019 for natural gas blocks off its Pacific shore. “We could form a joint venture between (state-run oil firms) Petroamazonas and Petroperu plus a private company to bring in capital,” Perez told Reuters in an interview. The crude to be jointly produced along the border would feed Peru’s 65,000-barrel-per-day Talara refinery through an existing pipeline, while natural gas to be produced in Peruvian territory would be exported to Ecuador to ease a shortage there. Ecuador President Lenin Moreno’s government is moving fast to attract foreign investment in the country’s energy industry to reverse a slow decline in crude output. Other countries in the region, including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, also are competing for oil capital. Oil contracts in Ecuador have been changed to allow operators to export independently and over a dozen crude and gas blocks are planned to be offered to foreign companies through production agreements and service contracts. After completing the Intracampos 2 onshore oil tender in the last quarter of 2018, Ecuador will next year auction exploration and production rights for gas blocks off the Esmeraldas, Manabi and Guayas shores, which have been studied but reserves have not been confirmed. The country’s largest gas field, Amistad, is also being offered for private investment. “We want to bring large companies (to the gas auction) because bigger investment is required there,” Perez said. Ecuador, which plans to boost oil output to 590,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 from 520,000 bpd this year, supports a crude production increase at the December OPEC meeting, he said. “Due to national interest, Ecuador wants to have the option of being able to increase production. That will be our point of view (in the upcoming OPEC meeting),” Perez said. The current crude price of between $70 and $80 per barrel is “reasonable”, Perez said, adding that “we must find a balance” in the market.
