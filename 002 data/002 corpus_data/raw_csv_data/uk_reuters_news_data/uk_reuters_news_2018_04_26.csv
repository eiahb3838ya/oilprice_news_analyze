2018-04-26,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has ordered local governments to “ease the burden” on renewable power generators by strengthening guaranteed purchase agreements and giving them priority access to new grid capacity, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said on Thursday. According to China’s renewable energy law, grid companies are obliged to take on all electricity generated by renewable sources, but many projects have still been left with inadequate grid access, a problem known as curtailment.  The NEA said it would “strictly implement” rules guaranteeing renewable power purchases and would order grid firms to “promptly accept” grid access applications from renewable projects. For regions that fail to make the guaranteed purchases, the NEA will take action to slow the pace of project construction. The NEA also urged local authorities to reduce land costs for renewable energy providers and abolish arbitrary charges and unreasonable project approval conditions. Local governments must also pay back illegally collected fees. Friends of Nature, an environment group, is suing grid companies in northwest China for failing to maximize purchases of renewable power. It said timely grid access to renewable projects was crucial, but the new measures did not go far enough to ensure China’s clean energy resources were fully utilized. “Setting a minimum number of kilowatt-hours for renewable power is not the same as buying all of it, as stipulated in the renewable energy law,” said Friends of Nature’s He Miao. “We hope new rules will emerge to implement the law more comprehensively.”      China wasted 41.9 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of wind power in 2017 as a result of poor grid connectivity, 12 percent of total wind generation. Wasted solar amounted to 7.3 billion kWh, 6 percent of total generation. The NEA said this week that wind curtailment fell to 8.5 percent and solar to 4.3 percent in the first quarter of this year.     The government is cutting subsidies available to renewable energy providers after a decline in costs over the last decade, but it is looking for other ways to encourage clean energy projects. The NEA said in the notice that it would encourage financial institutions to increase credit available to renewable energy developers, and would also encourage the issuing of green bonds.   Authorities are also now ironing out the details of a mandatory renewable energy quota system that will compel grid firms and big power consumers to acquire a minimum proportion of electricity from clean sources.

2018-04-26,"April 26 (Reuters) - First Solar Inc on Thursday announced it will expand its domestic manufacturing, the second such announcement by a U.S. solar firm this month that has been an apparent knock-on effect from Trump policies on trade and taxes. First Solar Inc will spend $400 million to build a new solar panel factory in Ohio, creating 500 jobs, the company said in a statement. The factory will be located near an existing facility the company has in Perrysburg. Strong domestic demand for solar energy and changes in U.S. tax policies underpinned the decision, said First Solar’s senior vice president of global manufacturing, Mike Koralewski. Last week, First Solar rival SunPower Corp said it would buy a U.S. domestic panel maker, as it sought to dodge the impact of 30 percent tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the administration of President Donald Trump.. First Solar benefits from having a technology that is not subject to tariffs. Its panels are made from cadmium telluride, while the tariffs apply only to traditional silicon solar products. As a result, solar project developers have increasingly sought out First Solar’s tariff-free panels, and in February the company said it would restart some production at its Ohio factory that was stopped late last year and hire new employees to run those lines. The new factory will produce First Solar’s next-generation Series 6 solar panel technology. In a statement provided by First Solar, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the company’s domestic expansion was “exactly the result we had hoped for.” Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar is one of the world’s largest solar energy companies. Most of its manufacturing is done in Malaysia. The Ohio expansion will triple the company’s domestic capacity. Construction will begin later this year and is contingent on state and local incentive packages, First Solar said.

2018-04-26,"(Adds details on tender) MEXICO CITY, April 26 (Reuters) - Mexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) said on Thursday that national oil company Pemex will tender for partners in seven onshore areas to form joint venture projects. The CNH said that Pemex will have a 45 percent stake in the onshore areas scheduled to be tendered on Oct. 31. The tender, which represents more than 20 sites that have been grouped into seven areas, should generate up to $870 million dollars of investment. Pemex has tempered expectations for the year after failing to find partners on its Ayin-Batsil shallow water development and the Nobilis-Maximino deepwater project, whose tender was canceled in December due to lack of interest. Pemex will not operate the projects. By mid-year 2017, Pemex was considering 160 onshore and offshore areas for development. Now just seven more modest onshore projects are planned for such partnerships in the states of Veracruz, Chiapas and Tabasco, according to company statements. Crude production in the areas covered by the tender is expected to reach a total of up to 58,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2022-2023, up from the current production of 33,000 bpd, the CNH said during the presentation. Gas production is expected to rise to 310 million cubic feet per day, up from 190 million cubic feet per day at present. “These are allocations that we already have in production, which already have a certain level of proven reserves; that’s exactly why we are choosing to move them to partners to invest in them and boost production,” said Gabriel Macias, who is part of Pemex’s legal team. The government of President Enrique Pena Nieto enacted a wide-ranging reform in 2013-2014 to encourage foreign investment and end the slide in oil output to multi-year lows. The reform ended Pemex’s 75-year monopoly over the energy sector, one of the key generators of revenue for the government. Mexico has opened oil and gas exploration and production, as well as retail sale of fuel, to private investors.

2018-04-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global equities advanced on Thursday, buoyed by a round of solid quarterly earnings in Europe and the United States, while the euro weakened after the head of the European Central Bank hailed “solid” economic growth but kept interest rates unchanged.  On Wall Street, technology stocks jumped 2.27 percent, led by a 9.06 percent jump in Facebook Inc and a 4.90 percent rise in Visa after their quarterly results. Facebook reported a surprisingly strong rise in profit and an increase in users, with no sign that business was hurt by a scandal over the mishandling of users’ personal data. Its shares notched their best day since January 2016. “It’s been pretty much good earnings across the board,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.  “Revenues have been strong, so the earnings are not just cost-cutting as they were a couple years back, but there’s obviously rising costs.” A drop in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield below the 3 percent mark also aided equities. Economic data supported the view that the Federal Reserve would stick to its gradual pace of rate increases. Although domestic core capital goods orders fell in March, filings for jobless benefits plunged to their lowest in over 48 years. The 10-year yield on Wednesday reached its highest since January 2014, at 3.035 percent.  (Graphic: S&P 500 vs U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield - reut.rs/2Kfu7Qs) The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 238.92 points, or 0.99 percent, to 24,322.75, the S&P 500 gained 27.72 points, or 1.05 percent, to 2,667.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 114.94 points, or 1.64 percent, to 7,118.68. In Europe, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) shares closed 2.66 percent higher, even though its first-quarter operating profit fell, as investors were encouraged by its new chief executive, the car maker’s financial health and lower provisions for the diesel emissions scandal. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.91 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.70 percent. The FTSE index marked its strongest day since April 5 while MSCI’s index snapped a five-session losing streak, its longest since November. The euro dropped to session lows after ECB President Mario Draghi hailed “solid” euro zone growth but kept rates unchanged, without a clear signal about ending the central bank’s quantitative easing program. The dollar strengthened as short positions unwound on the U.S. economic data. “You’re seeing a wash-out of short dollar positions primarily,” said Karl Schamotta, director of FX strategy and structured products at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto, Canada.  “It is a far too crowded trade at this point.” (Graphic: ECB to kick off rate hikes in mid-2019? - reut.rs/2KbVFpP) The euro fell to its lowest against the dollar since mid-January, at $1.2096, after the ECB kept monetary policy unchanged. The euro zone single currency had initially rebounded after Draghi played down concern over recent softness in data.  The dollar index rose 0.46 percent, with the euro down 0.46 percent to $1.2103. A sharp sell-off in bonds over the last week has been pushing up global borrowing costs, putting additional focus on when the ECB will end its 2.55 trillion euro ($3.2 trillion), three-year stimulus program.

2018-04-26,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the world’s largest independent oil and gas exploration and production company, posted a bigger-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by rising crude prices CLc1 and cost cuts. Results at Conoco, like many of its peers, have steadily improved in recent quarters alongside commodity prices and as better technology makes operations more efficient.  Conoco’s stock has risen as the company has prioritized cost cuts and asset sales over production increases. The Houston-based company generated more cash in the first quarter than its capital budget and shareholder payouts, an accomplishment feted by analysts. Shares are up about 21 percent so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500 Energy Index .SPNY, which has gained about 3 percent since January. The stock’s biggest increase came after the company boosted its share buyback and dividend in February.  Conoco’s stock closed 2.9 percent higher at $66.97. “We’re maintaining our discipline and following our game plan,” Chief Financial Officer Don Wallette told investors on a conference call.        Earnings rose to $888 million, or 75 cents per share, compared to $586 million, or 47 cents, in the year-ago quarter.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 96 cents per share, exceeding the 73 cents expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Doug Terreson, an oil industry analyst with Evercore ISI, said the results reflected a “positive surprise” and were an indication that energy companies can generate healthy profits even when prioritizing shareholder returns.     Production fell 23 percent to 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) as a result of recent asset sales. Conoco’s U.S. shale operations, which made money after losing cash for more than a year, are now profitable at oil prices CLc1 under $45 per barrel, more than $20 below current levels. “We’re seeing the earnings power of our unconventional operations driving our overall portfolio,” Wallette said.     Conoco kept its 2018 capital budget at $5.5 billion, but raised its production outlook slightly and now expects to pump 1.2 million to 1.24 million boe/d this year.     Conoco said on Wednesday an international arbitration court ordered Venezuela’s state-run oil company, PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], to pay it $2.04 billion for early dissolution of two joint ventures. “We intend to be aggressive and persistent” in recovering the award, Wallette said. “It’s something that’s going to take time to recover, the value that we lost.”  Rivals Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) report results on Friday.

2018-04-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices gained on Thursday as the risk of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran, plunging Venezuelan output, and robust global demand shook off the effects of a strong dollar. Global benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 gained 74 cents to settle at $74.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 were up 14 cents to $68.19 a barrel. “Oil has had a very good week so far given what the dollar has done,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago.  The dollar against a basket of currencies .DXY hit its highest since mid-January. A stronger greenback makes it more expensive to buy dollar-denominated commodities like oil. “The dollar has held crude back from gaining further ground. I expect the market to have a good finish for the week given the uncertainty around the Iran deal,” Baruch said.  A top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said Tehran would not accept any change to the 2015 nuclear deal, as Western signatories prepare a new package in the hope of persuading U.S. President Donald Trump to stick with the accord. This comes a day after French President Emmanuel Macron said he expected Trump to pull out of the agreement. Trump will decide by May 12 whether to restore the sanctions, which would probably result in a reduction of Iranian oil exports. Brent has gained about 6 percent this month thanks to expectations that the United States could do so.  “The rally seems to be intact and is looking for the next spark to push it higher. That spark could come from reinstituting sanctions. But not only is there the possibility of sanctions on Iran, but there’s also the possibility of Venezuelan and Russian sanctions,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Venezuelan oil output PRODN-VE has already tumbled forty percent in two years, and the European Union said earlier this month it could impose further sanctions on Venezuela if it believes democracy is being undermined there. Trade data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows seaborne imports of crude by Asia’s main buyers will hit a record this month. By end-April, China will likely have taken in more than 9 million bpd of crude - its most ever and nearly 10 percent of global consumption. The equities market, with all three major indexes up [.N], was also supporting oil, said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP.  “Crude needs help from the stock market to sustain any new highs,” he said.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil production, storage levels - reut.rs/2Fi2ouG) Meanwhile, surging U.S. production, which hit 10.59 million bpd last week, has encouraged record-high U.S. exports.

2018-04-26,"NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Investors buying Venezuelan debt in recent weeks on hopes the May elections might bring a new government or that rising oil prices will bolster the OPEC member’s creditworthiness may be in for a rude awakening, analysts and portfolio managers say. Venezuelans are crossing by the thousands every day into neighboring Colombia and Brazil as an escalating economic and social crisis has left millions suffering from shortages of food and medicine. But those counting on a regime change should be mindful of the opposition’s inability, so far, to fully coalesce around the candidacy of 56-year-old former soldier and governor Henri Falcon who is running against President Nicolas Maduro. And the bets investors are making based on crude oil prices trading at the highest levels in more than three years are offset by Venezuela’s rapidly declining oil output. Since October of 2017, the Venezuelan government and state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) have both missed making debt payments of $2.6 billion through early April, according Millstein & Co, which was recently hired as a financial advisor by some of Venezuela’s creditors. The country’s decision to selectively make debt payments has pushed some bond prices up and left others to languish. For PDVSA’s 2020 bond issue, backed by assets of refiner Citgo, prices have held up with the bid around 86.5 cents on the dollar and a yield hovering near 20 percent. But the benchmark Venezuelan 2027 bond dropped to around 19 cents on the dollar in early January before rallying to its current bid price of 31.625 cents. The very low bond prices tempted distressed-debt investors into the market earlier this year, said Ray Zucaro, chief investment officer at RVX Asset Management in Miami. “What I think has happened more recently,” he said, “is that the overall situation in Venezuela has become so bad, so chaotic, that the general sentiment is ‘well, we’ve got to be near the end or closer to the end [of the current government] than we were before’.” Zucaro said he bought PDVSA debt earlier this month, but declined to give more details. Venezuelans will head to the polls on May 20 and president Nicolas Maduro is running for reelection. The opposition has called for a boycott of the vote and the electoral process was rejected by the United Nations Human Rights Council. The main hope for some investors and Venezuelans alike is that the alternative candidate, Falcon, a former member of Maduro’s party, can emerge as a transition leader. He currently leads Maduro by 7 percentage points in voter intention according to pollster Datanalisis. “I don’t think there’s any real chance Maduro’s side would win a fair and free election, but the probability that the election will be fully free and fair is very low,” said Paul McNamara, London based Investment Director in global asset management firm GAM’s Emerging Markets Team. Optimism regarding the potential for a regime change is misplaced, said Kathryn Rooney Vera, head of research and emerging market strategy at Bulltick LLC in Miami. “There’s very little reason to be optimistic,” she said, adding that “the regime that is in charge right now is unlikely to make the economic reforms necessary to continue servicing the debt in a reasonable way.” The election notwithstanding, some analysts see the rise in bond prices as a reflection of the steady increase in the price of crude oil in the past year, as Venezuela sits atop the world’s largest proven oil reserves. “The biggest reason for the rise in Venezuela debt prices is the oil price,” said GAM’s McNamara, adding: “The higher the oil price is, the Venezuelan debt is effectively an option on the very long-dated price of oil.” Front month crude oil futures have more than doubled from the 2016 lows near $26 per barrel, hitting a more than three-year high near $70 earlier this month. Venezuelan oil production, however, has shrunk to about 1.6 million barrels per day last January from 2.3 million in January 2016 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. OPEC data shows the decline has continued through this year. “Price is doing great but (Venezuela’s) production is crappy, so it’s not really helping them out as much,” said RVX’s Zucaro. “They’re at a point where they’re not able to really truly benefit from higher prices.” Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; additional reporting by Paul

2018-04-26,"LONDON, April 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - People can be “remarkably, suicidally careless” with the planet, British environment minister Michael Gove said on Thursday as he welcomed a major initiative to cut plastic pollution. More than 40 companies, including Britain’s biggest supermarkets, Coca Cola, Nestle and Procter & Gamble, have bowed to growing pressure to tackle pollution by committing to cut plastic use over the next seven years. Signing up to the UK Plastics Pact, launched on Thursday by sustainability campaign group WRAP, they have pledged that 100 percent of plastic packaging will be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. “When we think about the plastic we throw away, there is no elsewhere, no other planet, where that rubbish goes,” Gove said at the launch of the initiative in London. He said it was “impossible” for the world to carry on using plastic as it has before, “or we risk there being more plastic in the sea than fish”. Eight million tonnes of plastic – bottles, packaging and other waste – enter the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, says the United Nations Environment Programme. “The plastic packaging system is broken,” said world record-breaking sailor Ellen MacArthur, whose UK-based foundation co-launched the initiative. “Most packaging is not designed to be recycled, and as a result you have a lot of plastic leaking into the environment,” she told the event. The 42 Plastic Pact companies are responsible for over 80 percent of the plastic packaging on products sold through British supermarkets, according to WRAP. ""This is absolutely existential change,"" said Mike Barry, head of sustainable business at British retailer Marks & Spencer, which signed up to the initiative.

2018-04-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Commission believes U.S. President Donald Trump is setting unacceptable conditions for the European Union to get a permanent exemption from steel and aluminum tariffs, a German newspaper reported on Thursday. The United States imposed import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in March on aluminum on grounds of national security, but it provided a temporary exemption until May 1 for the European Union. Citing an internal paper from the European Council on the state of discussions with the United States, the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had asked European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom to provide a joint statement by May 1 with key points on bilateral trade negotiations to extend the exemption.  The newspaper said the European Commission was still optimistic the exemption would be extended and cited the European Council paper as saying Malmstrom and Ross would speak again by telephone this week. It said that during their last phone call Ross had demanded that the EU voluntarily limit exports of steel and aluminum to the United States to 90 percent of the average 2016/2017 level, which it said amounted to a 16.3 percent reduction. The newspaper said the Commission had rejected the demands as unacceptable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold talks on trade with Trump in Washington on Friday. A senior German government official said on Thursday that Germany expected U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum products to kick in on May 1. The European Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the newspaper report.

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - British interior minister Amber Rudd said she had no plans to resign after giving contradictory statements about meeting targets for deportations, deepening a scandal over Britain’s treatment of Caribbean immigrants. For nearly two weeks, British ministers have been struggling to explain why some descendants of the so-called “Windrush generation”, invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, had been labelled as illegal immigrants. The Windrush scandal overshadowed the Commonwealth summit last week in London and has raised questions about Theresa May’s six-year stint as interior minister before she became prime minister in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum. May apologised to the black community on Thursday in a letter to The Voice, Britain’s national Afro-Caribbean newspaper. “We have let you down and I am deeply sorry,” she said. “But apologies alone are not good enough. We must urgently right this historic wrong.” Rudd said at a lunch with reporters in parliament that it had been “a difficult few weeks”, but she was committed to the Home Office. She told lawmakers on Wednesday that Britain did not have targets for the removal of immigrants, but on Thursday was forced to clarify her words after leaked documents showed some targets did exist. “I have never agreed that there should be specific removal targets and I would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people,” Rudd told parliament in answer to an urgent request for a statement from the opposition Labour Party. “The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using  local targets for internal performance management,” Rudd said. “These were not published targets against which performance was assessed. But if they were used inappropriately then this will have to change.” Opposition lawmakers called for her to resign. “Isn’t it time that the Home Secretary considered her honour and resign?” asked the Labour Party’s home affairs spokeswoman, Diane Abbott. Rudd told reporters she did not want immigration officers to be set targets for the number of people who need to be removed from Britain and distanced herself from government statements it wanted to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants. “I have not approved or seen or cleared any targets for removals,” she said. “Looking ahead I will not be doing that.”  Rudd, who is tipped by some as a future prime minister, also denied a story in the Sun newspaper on Wednesday that she is raising money for a future leadership bid when May resigns. “I am just thinking about staying in the game,” she said.    May’s spokesman said the prime minister had full confidence in Rudd. The spokesman added that the idea of removal targets went back a number of decades under successive governments. “The home secretary is working hard in order to address the concerns that have been raised in relation to Windrush and to ensure they are addressed and put right,” the spokesman added. May has apologised for the Windrush scandal and promised citizenship to all those affected. But the fiasco has raised awkward questions about how the pursuit of lower immigration after Britain’s 2019 exit from the European Union sits alongside the desire to be an outward-looking global economy. Some of the Windrush migrants have been made homeless, lost their jobs, been threatened with deportation and denied benefits, according to the Guardian newspaper. The crisis has focussed attention on May, who as interior minister set out to create a “really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants, imposing tough new requirements in 2012 for people to prove their legal status. She said in her letter to The Voice the government would do “whatever it takes” to end the anxieties faced by those affected.  “This country is your home and Britain would not be Britain without you,” she said.

2018-04-26,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Thursday its earnings fell 25 percent year-on-year in 2017, partly due to higher debt and costs of a legal dispute with Ukraine. Net profit for the year totaled 714.3 billion roubles ($11.41 billion), the company said, down from 951.6 billion roubles a year earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the company to post a net profit of 684 billion roubles. Net debt increased 24 percent year-on-year to 2.4 trillion roubles, Gazprom said, due to currency exchange rates. The company also booked reserves of more than 198.8 billion roubles, mainly due a legal dispute with Ukrainian state-owned energy firm Naftogaz. Gazprom has to pay Ukraine $2.56 billion after a Stockholm court found in Naftogaz’s favor in the final stage of a long-running legal battle in February. This sum is net of mutual claims and counter-claims related to gas supplies and transit. Naftogaz was awarded damages of $4.63 billion, but since the court previously ordered Naftogaz to pay Gazprom for gas supply arrears, the net payment Gazprom will have to make to Ukraine is $2.56 billion.  Revenue totaled 6.5 trillion roubles in 2017, Gazprom said, while earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at 1.47 trillion roubles.

EPS of 24 Canadian cents vs est of 22 Canadian cents * Q1 production down 10 pct * WTI/WCS crude differentials jump 59 pct April 26 (Reuters) - Canada’s Husky Energy Inc cut its 2018 production forecast on Thursday, saying it would temporarily cut heavy oil output due to low prices and a slow ramp up at its offshore Indonesia project. Earlier in the day, the oil producer and refiner reported an explosion at its 38,000 barrel per day (bpd) Superior, Wisonsin, refinery. Local media reports said at least 20 people were injured. Shares of the company, which were trading slightly down, fell more than 5 percent following the incident. Transport bottlenecks in Canada have widened Canadian oil’s discount compared to U.S. light crude. Husky said its differentials averaged C$30.69 per barrel in the first quarter, a 59 percent jump compared with last year. Western Canadian Select (WCS) - the benchmark for heavy crude - has historically traded at a discount of $15 to West Texas Intermediate (WTI). Husky, whose first-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates, lowered its annual production forecast to 310,000 to 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from 320,000 to 335,000 boepd. Husky’s profit beat market expectations by 2 cents despite first-quarter production falling more than 10 percent. The widening gap between the price of WTI and WCS caused Husky’s income from its infrastructure and marketing segment to nearly double to C$138 million ($107.6 million) in the quarter. Husky, which runs drilling and refining businesses in Canada, the United States and Asia, said its average U.S. refining margin rose to $8.51 per barrel from $7.08 per barrel a year ago. “Husky  remains  the  only  heavy  oil producer  that  we believe  could  be  a  (modest)  net  beneficiary  from  our expectation  of persistently  wide  heavy  oil  differentials,” Raymond James analysts said. The company’s net earnings rose to C$248 million, or 89 Canadian cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, from C$71 million, or 66 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Husky earned 24 Canadian cents per share, beating analysts’ estimate of 22 Canadian cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s average quarterly production fell to 300,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from 334,000 boepd a year earlier as it sold some of its assets in Western Canada in 2017.

2018-04-26,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq failed to attract investment from the top global energy companies in its oil and gas exploration/development contract auction on Thursday, with no major firms winning any bids and only Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) submitting an offer. The Oil Ministry held an auction to award contracts to international energy companies, with 11 blocks on offer near the borders with Iran and Kuwait and in offshore Gulf waters. “We have decided to speed up the development of border fields after five decades without investments ... leaving them without investments meant wasting the oil wealth of the country,” Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said ahead of bidding. “I say to the companies (that will bid), ‘thank you’ because this means trusting Iraq ... and it means services and education for the citizens who live in the regions where you are going to operate,” he added. Five of the exploration blocks failed to attract any bids. Three went to Iraqi-owned, United Arab Emirates-based Crescent Petroleum, two to China’s Geo-Jade, and one to United Energy Group, also based in China. Eni made two unsuccessful bids, while no other majors bid. Fourteen companies had expressed interest and bought a package containing the bidding documents and terms for the 11 blocks, the ministry had said on April 14. “It is a very successful round. As an Iraqi company it’s not a commercial matter, it’s about investing and developing the production of Iraq,” Crescent executive director Abdullah al-Qadi told Reuters. The blocks were initially to be auctioned in June. The date was brought forward to April 15, then postponed to April 25 to give bidders more time, the Oil Ministry had said. A combination of factors was behind the failure by five blocks to draw bids, said Abdul Mahdy al-Ameedi, director general of Iraq’s Petroleum Contracts and Licensing Directorate.  Some cover former battlefields, some are hard to access and the one offshore plot needs more data, he said. Ameedi said another round could be held for the five blocks but provided no further details. The contracts on offer excluded oil by-products from the companies’ revenue, established a link between prevailing oil prices and their remuneration, and introduced a royalty element. Oil companies operating in Iraq currently receive a fee from the government linked to production increases, which include crude and oil by-products such as liquefied petroleum gas. OPEC’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, Iraq decided to change the contracts after a glut caused oil prices to crash in 2014, reducing Baghdad’s ability to pay such fees. Companies including BP (BP.L), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Eni, Total (TOTF.PA), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Lukoil (LKOH.MM) have helped Iraq expand production in the past decade by over 2.5 million barrels per day to about 4.7 million bpd. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government produces oil and gas from fields it controls in northern Iraq under a production-sharing model that is more profitable to companies. The new contracts offered by Baghdad will also set a time limit for companies to end gas flaring from oilfields they develop. Iraq continues to flare some of the gas extracted alongside crude oil at its fields because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel. Iraq hopes to end gas flaring by 2021. Flaring costs the government nearly $2.5 billion (1.8 billion pounds) in lost revenue each year and could cover most of its unmet needs for gas‐fired power, according to the World Bank. Below is a summary of Iraq’s bidding round detailing the blocks on offer and the winning bids in terms of remuneration as percentage from oil revenue. The winners were companies offering to take the lowest percentage. Block                   Winner           Bid 1- Gilabat-Qumar        Crescent         9.21 percent 2- Khashim Ahmar-Injana Crescent         19.99 percent 3- Naft Khana           Geo-Jade         14.67 percent 4- Zurbatiya            no bid 5- Shihabi              no bid 6- Huwaiza              Geo-Jade         7.15 percent 7- Sindbad              United Energy    4.55 percent 8- FAO                  no bid 9- Jabal Sanam          no bid 10- Khider al-Mai       Crescent         13.75 percent 11- ‘’Arabian Gulf’’ (offshore) no bid The remuneration is before tax and after the payment of royalties and cost recovery. Royalties are set at 25 percent of total revenue of the field and tax at 35 percent of the company’s income.  For example: if the revenue from the field’s production is $1,000, the operating company’s costs $100 and its percentage remuneration 20 percent, it will first pay $225 to the government (a quarter of $900, which is the revenue minus cost) in royalties, and split the remaining $675 with the government along the percentage agreed, taking $135 and giving the government $540.   The company then pays 35 percent in tax on its $135, or $47.25, and is left with $87.75 in net income.

2018-04-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of smaller independent U.S. refiners with less complex facilities surged in the stock market in the first quarter as investors expect strong earnings growth thanks to a fall in price of their primary cost - light, sweet crude oil coming out of West Texas - to more than three year lows. Over the last 20 years, the nation’s biggest refiners spent billions building units capable of turning heavy, sour crude into gasoline, diesel fuel and other products.  But the U.S. shale revolution has boosted crude production to a record 10.5 million barrels per day, upending the global oil market by adding millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix. A majority of that new production is light, sweet West Texas crude, which needs less processing to produce premium fuels. Recent trends have turbocharged this shift: full pipelines in West Texas, where light U.S. oil originates from, have depressed prices for Midland, Texas, crude WTC-WTM to more than three-year lows. On the other hand, OPEC production cuts and supply issues among big producers of heavy crude like Venezuela and Mexico have raised the cost of heavy, sour oil.  That gives an advantage to some independent refiners equipped for lighter crude. Investors have been buying up shares in independents with less complex refineries like Delek US Holdings Inc (DK.N) and HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N), as they could benefit from low Permian prices for several quarters to come. “To have your major feedstock be in such abundant supply is unequivocally a positive for U.S. refining,” said Matthew Blair, a Denver-based refinery analyst with Tudor Pickering & Holt. “The benefits of that are going to be unevenly spread through the group.” To be sure, shares of most refiners have been rallying, as refining margins CL321-1=R are at nearly six-month highs and U.S. gasoline demand is near record levels.  Results for the first quarter are likely to show strong profits across the sector. Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), the top independent U.S. refiner, was the first to report results on Thursday, exceeding profit expectations.  However, over the last three months, as Permian crude has slumped, Delek shares have soared, returning more than 30 percent, with HollyFrontier close behind at 25 percent, besting all other independent refiners. The two are also ranked highest among U.S. refining companies in the Thomson Reuters earnings revisions model, which looks at analyst revisions for earnings and revenue and recommendation changes. “Light” grades are distinguished based on what is known as API gravity - a measurement of density. A majority of U.S. shale crude output growth is at the top of the scale with API gravity above 40 degrees.  More complex U.S. refineries are configured to run on grades of crude with an API gravity of around 31-33 degrees. Most refineries cannot simply take in only lighter crude, because it would affect operational efficiency.   “In order to process more shale from here on, refiners will need access to more heavy crude too,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note last week.  About 70 percent of Delek’s crude slate is based on Permian crude, according to a March company presentation. The company did not respond to a request for comment.  HollyFrontier is less reliant on the Permian - it accounts for 35 percent of its crude slate, said Craig Biery, director of investor relations.  However, its imports of heavy crude have exclusively been discounted Canadian oil in the six months through January, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. The company has existing pipeline commitments for that oil, so it can take full advantage of those discounts, said Barclays analyst Paul Cheng. Valero, Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) and Andeavor ANDV.N, three of the largest independent refiners, have had more downward earnings revisions over the last 30 days than other independent refiners, according to Thomson Reuters data. Those refiners, with multiple facilities on the Gulf Coast, rely more on imports from Latin America.  For the six months through January, Valero imported 6 million to 7 million barrels a month, and only 10 to 15 percent is from Canada, according to the EIA, with the bulk from Mexico, Venezuela or other Latin American nations.  The spread between international benchmark Brent crude and U.S. crude WTCLc1-LCOc1, a proxy for import costs, has surged to more than $6 a barrel - the biggest premium seen all year.  Valero has only about 25 percent of its crude slate directly linked to U.S. crude, and its exposure to Midland is even smaller, Cheng said. A March investor presentation says sweet crude makes up an average of 17-37 percent of its Gulf refineries.   The company has exhausted its capability of running light sweet crude, Vice President Gary Simmons said during a conference call with analysts on Thursday.  “Our economic signals are pointing us to maximize light sweet pretty much every where we can.” GRAPHIC: Crude oil grades go differing ways - tmsnrt.rs/2vKuIX2 Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by David Gaffen, Matthew Lewis and Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-refineries/update-1-skinny-and-sweet-u-s-refiner-earnings-depend-on-the-oil-diet-idUKL1N1S31CQ,26 Apr 2018,"Shares of smaller independent

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Encouraging results and a fall in the euro boosted European stock markets on Thursday, while earnings disappointments weighed on some stocks including Germany’s Lufthansa and Kion. The STOXX 600  ended the session 0.9 percent higher as the euro fell to a session low after the European Central Bank (ECB) kept policy unchanged at its latest meeting. “Taking into account the recent deceleration in growth, still low core inflation, substantial labour market slack in key economies, and the threat of U.S. protectionism, I believe the ECB made the right call,” said Ronald Temple, co-head of multi asset investing at Lazard Asset Management.  The boost from the currency and upbeat earnings eclipsed worries over rising bond yields that jolted risky assets earlier in the week. As investors sifted through the heaviest week of earnings season, JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka said: “Based on the results so far, the earnings delivery looks encouraging in the U.S., while the numbers in Europe and Japan are somewhat softer, but still positive.” Bank earnings were a key focus. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) shares had a choppy session and ended 2 percent lower after the lender said it would scale back its bond and equities trading in a significant overhaul of its investment bank, after reporting a 79 percent drop in net profit in the first quarter. “The strategy potentially resolves the capitalisation concerns of the bank, but profitability remains an issue,” KBW analysts said in a note.   Deutsche Bank shares are down nearly 25 percent year-to-date, the worst-performing of the European banks sector .SX7P.  Meanwhile Norway’s largest bank, DNB (DNB.OL), jumped 6.7 percent after profit beat expectations as a pick-up in activity in the oil sector wiped the bank clean of loan losses. Among notable gainers, Finnish oil refining firm Neste (NESTE.HE) topped the STOXX, soaring nearly 17 percent after reporting first-quarter sales that comfortably topped analysts’ estimates. Industrials were strong overall, with French engine maker Safran (SAF.PA) rising after results, but Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) falling 5.5 percent. The German airline’s revenue growth disappointed due to expansion of its Eurowings budget carrier. Investors are watching the European earnings season keenly for any signs of strain from slowing economic growth after recent business activity and consumer confidence measures faltered. Analysts have downgraded their expectations for euro zone earnings. The euro zone STOXX .STOXXE saw the biggest downward revisions to earnings estimates since July 2016 this week.  Oil majors moved in opposite directions after results.  France’s Total (TOTF.PA) rose 1.5 percent after it reported that record production had lifted profits, while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) declined 1 percent despite reporting a 42 percent rise in first-quarter profit. “First-quarter free cash-flow generation was at $4.4 billion, below our estimates on weaker than expected operating cash flow,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts on Shell. There were also some big disappointments. Shares in Philips Lighting (LIGHT.AS), the world’s largest lighting maker, fell 13.3 percent after the firm reported lower than expected first-quarter earnings due to falling sales and margins. BE Semiconductor Industries (BESI.AS) sank nearly 17 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its results. Semiconductors across Europe have been under pressure recently as sentiment on the tech sector turns more pessimistic.

2018-04-26,"* Total CEO says deal closed on March 31 * Says informed Libyan authorities * Says Total will develop field in Libyan interests By Bate Felix PARIS, April 26 (Reuters) - Libyan authorities were informed before French energy major Total closed a $450 million deal with Marathon Oil to take over the U.S. firm’s 16 percent share in the Waha concession, Total’s chief executive said on Thursday. Patrick Pouyanne told analysts during Total’s first-quarter earnings call that despite reports that the deal could hit a snag over Libyan displeasure, Libyan authorities raised no objections before it closed on March 31. “We informed Libyan authorities far in advance that the deal had been settled between Total and Marathon and we were intending to close it by the end of March,” Pouyanne said. “From a strictly legal point of view, neither in Libyan law nor in the oil concession agreement is there a request for a formal approval,” he said, adding that as of now, the shares of Marathon in Libya were with Total. “We informed them. There was a target for us for the end of March to close the deal, we wrote to them again before, there was no objection and so we decided to close.” Libya is considering whether to intervene and its options include pushing for better terms, sources have told Reuters. Libya’s National Oil Corporation said on Monday any such deal “must have the approval of NOC and the Libyan authorities” and “any attempt to conclude the sale prior to this approval would be in breach of the concession contractual agreement”. A government source also said the deal needed formal Libyan approval. Pouyanne said Total was able to move in and rapidly close the unplanned deal because it was willing to take in the political risk of the Libyan situation. Libya, an OPEC member, has been mired in seven years of turmoil that have hit its oil sector. “Total can take these kinds of Libyan risk in our portfolio more than Marathon was willing to keep them, which is why we did the deal,” he said. Total said the Waha concession represented about 500 million barrels of oil reserves with production of around 50,000 barrels per day. “The cost of access to these barrels was quite attractive due to the political situation. Maybe it created some moves in Libya after they discovered the value of the deal, but the terms of the concession did not change,” Pouyanne said. Seeking to sooth concerns in Libya, Pouyanne said the company was in permanent dialogue with Libyan authorities. “We will give them all the comfort they are legitimately requiring, to reassure them of our willingness to develop the Waha field in the national interest of Libya,” he said.

2018-04-26,"* Tech earnings power Wall Street higher * U.S. 10-year yield back below 3 pct * Euro weakens after ECB decision (Updates with U.S. markets, changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - A gauge of global equities advanced on Thursday, boosted by a slew of solid quarterly earnings in Europe and the United States, while the euro weakened in the wake of comments by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. Technology stocks jumped 2.28 percent, led by gains in Facebook, up 8.94 percent and Visa, up 4.26 percent, after their quarterly results. Facebook reported a surprisingly strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users, with no sign business was hurt by a scandal over the mishandling of personal data. Its shares were on track for their best day in over two years. Also supporting equities was a drop in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield below the 3 percent mark, as a fall in domestic core capital good orders in March was offset by a decline in jobless benefit filings to their lowest level in over 48 years. “A slight pullback in yields is likely to give investors a chance to focus on corporate results,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 221.06 points, or 0.92 percent, to 24,304.89, the S&P 500 gained 23.07 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,662.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 106.78 points, or 1.52 percent, to 7,110.51. In Europe, Volkswagen shares climbed 2.56 even though its first-quarter operating profit fell as investors were encouraged by its new chief executive, the carmaker’s financial health and lower provisions for the diesel emissions scandal. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.85 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.62 percent. MSCI’s index was poised to snap a five-session losing streak, its longest since November. The euro dropped to session lows after ECB President Mario Draghi hailed “solid” euro zone growth but kept rates unchanged, without a clear signal about ending the central bank’s quantitative easing program. The dollar strengthened as short positions unwound on the U.S. economic data. The euro fell to its lowest since mid-January at $1.204 after the European Central Bank announced its decision to keep monetary policy unchanged. The single currency had initially rebounded after Draghi played down concern over recent softness in data. The dollar index rose 0.37 percent, with the euro down 0.36 percent to $1.2115. A sharp sell-off in bonds over the last week has been pushing up global borrowing costs, putting additional focus on when the ECB will end its 2.55 trillion euro ($3.2 trillion), three-year stimulus program. After touching four-year highs, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries dipped below 3 percent as buyers emerged following a week-long sell-off spurred by concerns about rising inflation and growing borrowing by the U.S. government. The rise in borrowing yields and commodity prices has caused several companies, such as Caterpillar and 3M, to caution this week about rising costs, raising flags for investors about the strength of future earnings. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.9959 percent, from 3.024 percent late on Wednesday.

2018-04-26,"(Adds details, context) By Camillus Eboh ABUJA, April 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s state oil company illegally paid 216 billion naira ($707.4 million) in fuel subsidies in 2017, which should be reimbursed to the government, according to the findings of a Senate probe released on Thursday. The investigation by the upper legislative house said that parliament had not approved those payments by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) last year, and any further spending on subsidies should be halted with immediate effect. “The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) should stop the illegal payments,” the report said. An NNPC spokesman told Reuters: “We have neither seen nor received the report. It is when we see it and analyse it that we will officially respond.” Fuel subsidies are a contentious issue in Nigeria, where prices are kept artificially low at 145 naira ($0.48) per litre, often as a populist tool. That has meant that as fuel prices increase globally, it has become unprofitable for private petrol marketers to import, forcing NNPC to step in to prevent major shortages. However, state oil firm money spent on subsidies is meant to be included in Nigeria’s national budget, subject to approval by the national assembly. In December and January, a run on petrol amid rumours of a price increase created queues lasting hours at filling stations around the country.

2018-04-26,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish utility Fortum (FORTUM.HE) on Thursday played down concerns that Moscow might block its planned purchase of a stake in Uniper, after an article in a Russian government newspaper described Fortum as “a real threat” to Russian security. The article here in Rossiskaya Gazeta this month, by anti-Western economist Mikhail Delyagin, sparked worries in Finland that Moscow might turn down state-controlled Fortum's request for approval to buy a 47 percent stake in Germany's Uniper. Uniper (UN01.DE) has some power plants in Russia, and the deal has to pass a Russian law that effectively prohibits foreign states or state-owned entities from gaining control over strategic national assets. Fortum CEO Pekka Lundmark said on Thursday, however, he was confident of winning approval for the deal. “We are in good discussion regarding ... (Russian) clearances and we expect to receive them by mid-year,” he told a news conference. “We have not received ... such messages or information that we would not be getting these clearances.” Asked about the article, Lundmark said: “The negative articles that we have seen do not reflect the views of the Russian government ... Our view of the business environment is rather stable. We are calm in that sense.” Fortum recently completed a 4.5 billion euro ($5.5 billion)investment program in Russia and last year generated sales of 1 billion euros in the country. The risks of doing business in Russia are a familiar theme for the company. A few years ago, Fortum was in talks with Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) over a plan to restructure Russian hydro and thermal power company TGC-1 (TGKA.MM). Fortum was supposed to get a controlling stake in a planned spin-off hydropower company if it took a stake in a Russian-backed Finnish nuclear project here, which needed new investors. Fortum made that investment, but the hydropower talks made slow progress, and last month Fortum said it had abandoned hopes for the Gazprom deal. Several Finnish companies have a long history in doing business in neighboring Russia. Some, including retailers Kesko KESBV.HE and Stockmann (STCBV.HE), have recently pulled out of the market.

2018-04-26,"BONN, Germany, April 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - C ities, which produce about 70 percent of carbon emissions, are driving green reforms and will be key to tackling climate change, the United Nations’ climate chief said on Thursday. Their contribution to global warming could rise as two-thirds of the world will live in cities by 2050, up from about half now, the United Nations (U.N.) says. “Cities are where the climate battle will be won or lost,” said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), during a conference of city and government officials in Germany. “We’re seeing an incredible momentum for action in cities,” she said, noting that city-level decisions, such as whether a local park would be built or electric buses installed, often felt more tangible to citizens than national reforms. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement has been ratified by 175 nations, with the goal of keeping the rise in average global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. Espinosa spoke to the Thomson Reuters Foundation as she readied for two weeks of “crucial negotiations” to finalise preparations for December’s U.N. climate change summit, COP24, in Poland. Cities are “indispensable” to tackling climate change as they bring together different strands of the economy and social activities, while many national governments cannot deliver reforms alone, she said. “Never has our work been more needed or more urgent and 2017 made this very clear - it was nothing less than a climate disaster for many people,” she said, citing floods, fires and droughts. Extreme weather robbed millions in developed and developing countries of their lives, homes and jobs in 2017, she said. “The impacts of climate change are not going to get better, they are going to get worse,” she cautioned, citing densely-populated cities such as Alexandria in Egypt and Osaka in Japan as particularly high-risk locations. “We can avoid the worst of these impacts if we act now,” she said, by ramping up city-level actions to build resilience by preparing for climate emergencies and investing in initiatives to address climate change. “We have a lot ahead of us.” Reporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Katy Migiro.

2018-04-26,"CALVIA, Spain, April 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - I sland governments around the world are no longer begging for help to tackle the many problems they face - from too many tourists to devastating storms and rising seas - but are finding their own solutions and sharing them, experts say. There has been a “huge shift” in the past 10 to 15 years, said Kate Brown, executive director of the Global Island Partnership, an alliance spearheaded by island leaders. Islands no longer present themselves merely as victims of external pressures, but are blazing a trail in areas such as marine conservation, renewable energy and sustainable tourism. “There is a real difference in thinking - that it is possible to do something and we don’t need to wait for other people to tell us what to do,” Brown told the Smart Island World Congress in Calvia on the Spanish island of Mallorca this week. Islands have had successes at international climate talks, she noted - from winning a lower limit on global temperature rise in the Paris climate deal to convincing the world’s shipping industry to curb its planet-warming emissions. Progress is being made on home shores too, Brown said. Her organisation is working with the Marshall Islands, Palau and Fiji, for instance, to see how global development goals apply to them and uniting business and government to map out an action plan - as has been done in Hawaii. The conference, attended by representatives of more than 100 islands alongside researchers, businesses and other experts, showcased efforts to preserve the natural wealth of islands and protect them better from worsening extreme weather, plastic pollution, uncontrolled tourism and other stresses. Palau - an archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean with a population of less than 22,000, which views itself as a “large ocean state” - allows its own people to fish in zones near the shore but about 80 percent of its seas have been designated as marine sanctuaries to stamp out industrial catches. And since late last year, more than 60,000 visitors have signed the Palau Pledge, devised by its children and stamped into passports, promising  to “tread lightly, act kindly and explore mindfully”. In La Possession, on the French island of Reunion, a new eco-district has been designed as the city’s centre, equipped with digital sensors to monitor resource use, charging points for electric vehicles, rooftop solar systems and one-third of the space devoted to greenery. Meanwhile, hurricane-hit Saint Martin hosted a hackathon in March, partnering with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), at which young entrepreneurs hashed out 21 ideas for the Caribbean island to build back greener and more resilient. “It’s a treasure trove - there is so much happening,” said Arno Boersma, manager of the UNDP Centre of Excellence for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, based in Aruba. “Islands are laboratories for a lot of innovative things (and) sustainability.” But knowledge remains fragmented and there are barriers to expanding successful projects, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the conference. For example, governments may want to ditch the costly imported diesel many islands rely on, and generate electricity from solar, wind and other renewables, but persuading power companies to lay off staff and reforming regulations takes time. Island policy makers are often overloaded, and lack the capacity to capture and share the best ways of doing things, Boersma added. “Sometimes a hurricane can be a silver lining,” he said, as it can be easier to start from scratch than trying to remodel outdated infrastructure. In the British Virgin Islands, battered last year by floods and two major hurricanes in the space of two months, the government wants to lay power lines in the ground to keep them safe from high winds. Ahead of the upcoming storm season, it is tightening up building codes and putting in place early warning systems and stronger emergency response capabilities. The Caribbean territory suffered more than $3.6 billion in property and other damage, the displacement of nearly a fifth of its people, massive tree loss and marine pollution in the trio of disasters. “Most island countries just don’t have the money to recover from this,” said Brodrick Penn, chairman of the islands’ disaster recovery coordinating committee. “It is important to recognise that we need help.” Many islands are struggling to find ways to fund infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather and the impacts of climate change. Ormoc City on the Philippines’ island of Leyte needs a scheme to widen and deepen river channels to help prevent annual floods that hit the area’s poor farmers hard, in addition to a new water supply and irrigation system, elected officials said. The city of about 225,000 people - also rattled by a large earthquake last year - is always in recovery mode, said Ormoc Mayor Richard Gomez, a famous actor and sports star. “We never adapt and move forward,” he said. With both national and local budgets stretched, Ormoc’s best hope may lie with foreign aid donors like Japan, he added. But not enough international funding is available to help islands adapt to the effects of climate change, while private investors often shy away from island projects seen as too small and risky, Brown of the Global Island Partnership said. No one yet knows where the money will come from to pay for the green, disaster-resilient infrastructure islands urgently need, she said. ""I think that is going to remain a really big problem,"" she added. (Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Alex Whiting.

2018-04-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany expects U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminium products to kick in on May 1, a senior government official said before Chancellor Angela Merkel travels to Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday. Trade will be a major topic for discussion at the meeting, before an exemption from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports granted to the European Union expires on May 1. “From today’s point of view, one has to expect that the tariffs will come on May 1,” the official said, stressing Germany would continue to negotiate to try to get a broad package including other industries. The tariffs would hit Germany’s powerful auto sector especially hard. “I think the chancellor would prefer a broad dialogue with the Americans. The government is open to extending the package to other duties and trade barriers,” said the official. “Whether we succeed on that, we don’t know. For that to happen, we would first need the exemption to be delayed for the long term,” he said. Germany’s BDI industry association is banking on an agreement with Trump. “The threatened tariffs are an acid test for the transatlantic relationship,” said BDI President Dieter Kempf, adding one in four jobs in Europe’s biggest economy depends on exports. The official argued that as well as exporting vehicles, German firms operate plants in the United States which provide jobs and export cars around the world.  Merkel’s one-day working trip follows a three-day state visit to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron. Cautious Merkel has failed to establish as strong a rapport with Trump as she did with Barack Obama and the mood music of her visit is likely to contrast sharply with that of Macron’s “bromance” with the U.S. president.  Macron called on the United States not to abandon a multinational Iran nuclear deal as Western envoys said Britain, France and Germany were nearing a package that seeks to persuade Trump to save the pact. Trump has threatened to wreck the 2015 accord, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, by reimposing U.S. penalties next month unless the three European allies agree to fix its “flaws”. “The premise of Macron’s proposal is that the agreement remains in its existing form and additional elements come on top,” another German government official said. “In our view this agreement should be maintained.” He said add-ons could include issues such as Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its role in the region. Trump may try to seize on a planned Russian gas pipeline running under the Baltic Sea to Germany as a bargaining chip.  The United States sees the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the existing pipeline’s annual capacity of 55 billion cubic metres, as a threat to Europe’s energy security. Despite increased tensions between the West and Moscow in the last few weeks, Merkel appears committed to the project. She has, however, conceded that there are political as well as economic factors at stake and has sought to reassure Ukraine which is worried it will lose gas transit revenues. The German officials argued that Germany, which gets 37 percent of its gas from Russia, was not making itself more dependent on Moscow and that it was trying to get foreign investors to help Ukraine by investing in its pipeline. “Our analysis is ... that does not make us more dependent on Russia,” one of the two officials said.

2018-04-26,"JUBA (Reuters) - Ten aid workers have gone missing in the South Sudanese town of Yei, a U.N. official said on Thursday, the latest incident involving relief staff in the war-ridden country. Alain Noudehou, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, said a convoy of U.N. and other aid workers had been heading to Tore from Yei, in the Central Equatoria region, early on Wednesday.  The whereabouts of the 10, all South Sudanese, were now unknown. “We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being,” Noudehou said. Aid workers are often targeted by armed groups operating in South Sudan, which has been in the grip of war between supporters of President Salva Kiir and those of his former deputy Riek Machar since 2013. Tens of thousands of people, including nearly 100 relief workers, have been killed. Noudehou said of the missing people, one was working for the humanitarian office UNOCHA, two for UNICEF, one for the South Sudanese Development Organisation, two for aid group ACROSS, three for Plan International and one for Action Africa Help. Earlier this week, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had suspended operations in Leer after their field base was shot at on April 10. It evacuated its staff to the South Sudanese capital Juba. In mid April, rebels said they had freed seven aid workers detained for nearly three weeks in Central Equatoria on accusations of spying for the government. An aid worker was also killed when gunmen shot at his agency vehicle near the northern town of Bentiu. Both rebels and government forces stand accused of targeting humanitarian workers and sometimes blocking access to relief and hijacking food and other aid. Lam Paul Gabriel, rebel SPLA-IO deputy spokesman, said he had received reports of aid workers’ disappearance and his forces were investigating with their commander in the ground.  “I am not denying or accepting that we are the ones responsible for this but we are investigating because that is our territory, but we should not ruled out the presence of other armed forces,” he said. He said there were also a separate armed group called NASA, as well as government troops present in the area. “So until we get that report from the ground commander, we will not be able to confirm,” he said.

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition watchdog said the planned merger of SSE’s (SSE.L) retail power and gas business in the UK with Npower, owned by German rival Innogy (IGY.DE), could lead to higher prices for customers and warrants further scrutiny. The watchdog said the merger would be referred for a longer Phase 2 investigation unless the parties offer acceptable undertakings to address the competition concerns.  “We know that competition in the energy market does not work as well as it might,” said Rachel Merelie, senior director at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). “However, competition between energy companies gives them a reason to keep prices down. “We have found that the proposed merger between SSE Retail and Npower could reduce this competition, and so lead to higher prices for some customers. We therefore believe that this merger warrants further in-depth scrutiny.”  SSE said on Thursday it remained confident the proposed merger will benefit customers and the energy market as a whole, and that it will be able to demonstrate this to the CMA.  The utility will take its time to assess CMA’s response.  Combined, SSE and Npower have around 11.5 million customers, making the new company second only to Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, which has more than 14 million customer accounts. Energy prices have come under the political spotlight after household bills doubled over the past decade to an average of about £1,150 ($1,600) a year. The government now aims to impose price caps for a large portion of customers.  “The proposed merger between SSE and Npower risks damaging the development of a more competitive energy market, reducing consumer choice, and threatening to be a bad deal for energy consumers,” said Rachel Reeves, a British lawmaker who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.   The British market is dominated by the so-called “big six” of British Gas, SSE, Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power, Npower, E.ON [EON.UL] and EDF Energy (EDF.PA), which account for about 80 percent of the retail electricity market. But aside from facing price caps on their most common tariffs, standard variable tariffs, these companies have also been rapidly losing market share to smaller rivals — they had 95 percent of the market just three years ago.

2018-04-26,"* Stocks edge up as growth fears, bonds counter Q1 results * Investors await signals from ECB on stimulus wind down * U.S. 10-year yield back below 3 pct * Dollar index drifts off 3-1/2-mth high * Euro stuck near 1-1/2-mth low By Sujata Rao and Marc Jones LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - European stocks and the euro made tentative gains on Thursday as a drop in bond market stress levels helped sentiment ahead of a read out from the European Central Bank’s latest meeting. A sharp sell-off in bonds over the last week has been pushing up global borrowing costs, meaning there is more focus than ever on when the ECB ends its 2.55 trillion euro ($3.2 trillion), three-year stimulus programme. For now it is keeping things steady, the ECB confirmed . European equities were up 0.4 percent ahead of Mario Draghi’s 1230 GMT news conference and as MSCI’s most widely-followed gauge of world stocks pulled out of its longest losing streak of the year so far. This happened as 10-year U.S. bond yields drifted back below the psychologically significant 3 percent mark and Wall Street futures pointed fractionally higher with another heavy dump of first quarter earnings coming up from companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Intel. Asia also rose overnight as record quarterly profits from Samsung helped offset nerves in China after reports that U.S. prosecutors have been investigating whether Chinese tech giant Huawei violated Iran sanctions. Oil was back on the rise, feeding what are likely to be questions for the ECB on rising inflation and supported by expectations of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran and declining output in crisis-hit Venezuela. “The music is still playing and we are still dancing, but we are reducing risk,” said Pau Morilla-Giner, chief investment officer at London & Capital. “The worry is about an overheating, leading to a rise in inflation, higher interest rates which bring on a textbook recession.” The U.S. Dow Jones bluechip index had snapped a five-day losing streak on Wednesday, thanks to strong corporate earnings. The Nasdaq was expected to benefit on Thursday after forecast-beating after-market results from data-scandal hit Facebook. Europe’s rises dragged it of one-week lows, though a mixed set of earnings weighed, including a 79 percent drop in profit at Deutsche Bank. The reaction from its new chief executive, Christian Sewing, was to order cut backs in bond and equities trading in its long-troubled investment bank. At the day’s main event, the ECB kept its policy unchanged as was widely expected, but focus will be on a news conference by the bank’s chief, Mario Draghi, for any hint about winding up the ECB’s powerful stimulus this year. An 11 percent oil price rise this year, on top of last year’s 18 percent jump, is increasing inflation levels and some of the bank’s top policymakers have said they expect the recent soft patch in euro zone economic data to pass. “The Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of 30 billion euros, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary,” the ECB’s policy statement said. Credit Agricole strategist Orlando Green said: “The risk is that he (Draghi) is less dovish than expected.” That could lift the euro which has sold off in recent days against the dollar to approach its March 1 level of $1.2154. It fetched $1.2185 before the ECB meeting as the dollar saw only its second drop in eight sessions. Sweden’s central bank remained dovish at a policy meeting, pushing the crown to its lowest versus the euro since late-2009 . The breather for the dollar helped emerging market currencies regain some ground having been almost universally whacked by the combined yield and dollar rise over the last week. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries, the reference rate for global borrowing,, have risen around 25 basis points since early-April and are now hovering at four-year highs. That, alongside the rise in commodity prices has led companies such as Alphabet to warn of surging costs while heavy equipment maker, Caterpillar said its buoyant first-quarter earnings could be the “high water mark”. While 81.2 percent of U.S. earnings have beaten consensus estimates and Thomson Reuters data projects first-quarter earnings growth at 22 percent, investors fear similar warnings from other companies. “We have been on a real high with corporate profitability so people got psyched up about those numbers getting even better,” said Peter Lowman, CIO of UK-based wealth manager Investment Quorum. “But with Treasury yields rising, people are worrying we may be peaking on profits, or if GDP growth is peaking and we are now in a situation where markets are getting very nervous,” he said, adding that the U.S. Federal Reserve appeared to be in no mood to brake its rate-hike programme.

2018-04-26,"(Repeats with no changes in text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China coking coal imports vs. SGX price: reut.rs/2FjMuzM By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 26 - China’s imports of coking coal staged a strong comeback in March after a weak start to the year, and may be poised for further strength as steel output rises. Imports of coking coal, used to make steel, jumped to 4.02 million tonnes in March, up 38 percent from the 2.91 million tonnes recorded in February, according to customs data released on April 24. However, the robust outcome in March went only some way to reversing the weaker trend so far this year. Imports for the first quarter as a whole totalled 12.05 million tonnes, a drop of 28 percent on the same period last year. In some ways the decline in first-quarter coking coal imports isn’t that surprising, given the winter restrictions placed on steel production as part of the authorities’ efforts to limit air pollution. However, steel production in China wasn’t actually weak over the first quarter, with output rising 5.4 percent from the same period in 2017 to 212.2 million tonnes. In fact, March’s production of 74 million tonnes was the most since September, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. What is the likely explanation is that steel production was curbed in the north of country, where winter pollution concerns are most acute, but mills in other parts of China were able to increase their output to take advantage of good prices. The higher steel output in the first quarter doesn’t fit well with the lower imports of coking coal, but there are some factors that may help explain some of the issues. The first is that steel mills have been using higher quality iron ore, therefore requiring less coking coal to produce the same amount of raw material. Certainly, recent months have seen widening premiums for higher-grade iron ore and traders have reported mills have been preferring quality over quantity. A switch to quality probably isn’t enough by itself to explain lower coking coal imports, and it’s doubtful that domestic production has been making up the shortfall. China’s total coal production, including both thermal and coking grades, fell to the lowest in five months in March, totalling 290 million tonnes. First-quarter output was up 3.9 percent on the same period in 2017 to 804.5 million tonnes, suggesting that, if anything, there was only a modest increase in domestic supply of coking coal. It’s likely that steel mills and producers of coke - which is made from coking coal and used in blast furnaces - have been running down inventories. Coking coal prices in the first quarter certainly wouldn’t have been encouraging additional buying beyond what was absolutely necessary to sustain operations. The main domestic price, Dalian Commodity Exchange futures , hit the highest in a year in late January, closing at 1,511 yuan ($238.70) a tonne on Jan. 30. However, recently the price has been in retreat, with the contract dropping to 1,213 yuan a tonne at the close on Wednesday - down almost 20 percent from the January high. Coking coal futures on the Singapore Exchange, which track the free-on-board price in Australia, the world’s largest exporter of the fuel, have also declined in recent weeks, ending at $191 a tonne on Wednesday. This is down almost 28 percent since the January peak of $265 a tonne, a nine-month high. Lower prices may well encourage steel mills and coke producers to restock, especially if steel prices and demand hold up in the coming months. Both of China’s largest providers of coking coal, Australia and Mongolia, have the capacity to supply more and competition between the two is somewhat limited, given they largely supply different steel-making regions. Both Mongolia and Australia have seen volumes supplied drop in the first quarter at a rate just below the overall drop of 28 percent. However, third-ranked supplier Russia has bucked the trend, with China’s imports increasing 0.4 percent, as buyers take advantage of the price advantage of Russian cargoes over those from Australia.

2018-04-26,"BEIJING, April 26 (Reuters) - China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec) reported its best quarterly profit since June 2015 on strong earnings from its refining department and firmer crude oil prices. Net profit at Asia’s largest refiner grew 12.3 percent in the first three months versus the same year-go period to 19.31 billion yuan ($3.05 billion). This was up from 12.75 billion yuan in the fourth quarter when losses from operating its gas business crimped earnings, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday. Sinopec’s total revenue rose to 621.3 billion yuan in the January to March period, up 6.7 percent from the year earlier period. Higher processing margins have benefited both state-owned and private refiners and pushed the country’s refinery throughput to record high in March. Sinopec’s refinery throughput gained 2.1 percent from the first quarter last year at 60.16 million tonnes, or about 4.88 million barrels per day (bpd). The company might rake in less revenue from its refining business in the second quarter as its largest subsidiary plant Zhenhai is slated for a major overhaul from May. Sinopec reported realized natural gas prices at $6.28 per thousand cubic feet, up 25.6 percent from a year earlier. Realised crude oil prices were $59.8 a barrel, up 22 percent from a year earlier. The firm produced 71.35 million barrels of crude oil during the period, down one percent on year. Its natural gas production inched up 0.6 percent to 239.83 billion cubic feet.

2018-04-26,"MILAN (Reuters) - Eni (ENI.MI) executive Roberto Casula, who is being investigated over corruption allegations, has taken a leave of absence from the Italian oil major. Casula, a former head of Africa operations for the state-controlled major, has been questioned by Milan prosecutors in a case involving alleged corruption in the Congo Republic. “Noting the recent allegations made against me, and given the esteem in which I hold our business and colleagues, I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence from work,” Casula said in an emailed comment to Reuters. “My primary objective is to fully and promptly address these allegations and cooperate to the fullest extent with the judicial authorities.” Casula is also one of a series of defendants, including the Eni CEO, due to stand trial next month over alleged corruption in Nigeria in a case involving the 2011 purchase by Eni and Shell (RDSa.L) of the OPL-245 offshore oilfield. The companies and Eni’s CEO have denied any wrongdoing. “Eni hopes for Mr Casula’s swift return to work. In the meantime (his) position... has been temporarily covered by another senior manager,” an Eni spokesman said. Casula is Eni’s chief development operations and technology officer. His position is being temporarily filled by Alessandro Puliti, who is executive vice president of reservoir and development projects, Eni said on its web page.

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell reported on Thursday a 42 percent rise in first-quarter profit to its highest in more than three years on stronger oil prices and production, but its shares fell as the oil major’s cash flow missed forecasts. Expectations are high for Shell to continue generating strong profits and cash flow after the Anglo-Dutch company beat larger rival Exxon Mobil on both fronts in 2017 thanks to its cost cuts and higher efficiencies. But Shell’s shares slid 2.1 percent by 1025 GMT as cash flow fell short of forecasts, even though profits rose more sharply than expected to $5.3 billion. The broader European energy index was up 0.9 percent. “The focus for the big oils in recent months has been the return to free cash flow, particularly given how strong Q1 normally is seasonally for the group,” analysts at Barclays said in a note, which had said it expected a negative share reaction. The world’s top oil companies are expected to generate more cash in 2018 than at any other time this decade after three years of cuts, but boards remain cautious amid uncertainty over near-term and long-term prices.   (GRAPHIC: Shell and Total vs. Crude - reut.rs/2Khfk7Q)  Shell in the fourth quarter scrapped its scrip dividend in a sign of confidence it could maintain around $15 billion in annual dividend payments without resorting to borrowing after a three-year oil price downturn. It plans to buy back $25 billion of shares by 2020 to offset the dilutive effect of the scrip and its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group.  Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl did not specify when Shell would begin the buybacks, telling reporters that the firm was “on track but not there yet” as it focuses first on reducing debt and paying dividends. After missing expectations the previous quarter, Shell’s cash flow from operations in the first three months of 2018 recovered to $9.43 billion but that was still slightly weaker than $9.5 billion a year earlier. Free cash flow was little changed at $5.178 billion. Uhl said lower cash flow was due to higher hedging payments from rising oil prices and one-off tax payments. Net income attributable to shareholders, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, rose to $5.322 billion, topping a company-provided analysts’ consensus of $5.277 billion. A year earlier, net income was $3.754 billion. Oil and gas production grew by 2 percent to 3.839 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earnings for the segment almost tripled from a year earlier. Income from the refining and marketing segment, known as downstream, weakened due to lower refining margins and plant availability. Gearing, the ratio between debt and Shell’s market capitalization was slightly lower from the end of 2018 at 24.7 percent by the end of March. Brent oil prices have risen in recent months to $75 per barrel, their highest since late 2014. Prices averaged about $67 a barrel in the first quarter, up nearly 25 percent from a year earlier.

2018-04-26,"* Gasoline off the coast approaches 1.5 mln tonnes tmsnrt.rs/2KbM8Pr * Nigeria’s onshore fuel stores also brimming * Exports to region from Europe spiked in March - traders * Flows to Nigeria slowing down, but unlikely to halt By Libby George LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - An unusually large quantity of gasoline is floating off the coast of West Africa as Nigeria boosts imports to avoid shortages before a presidential election early next year. Nearly 1.5 million tonnes of the motor fuel is on ships off West African shores, according to industry monitor Genscape, the highest level since it began tracking the data in January 2017. The bulk of the gasoline will likely flow to Nigeria, the region’s most populous nation and Africa’s largest economy, according to traders. Sources in Nigeria said tanks on shore were also brimming after a major import push by state oil firm NNPC in the past few months. “Local gasoline is oversupplied,” one importer said, adding that prices had fallen in some places in Nigeria to below the official price cap as retailers sought to sell the surplus. Gasoline availability is a politically charged issue in Nigeria, an OPEC crude exporter that has to import gasoline and other oil products as it lacks refining capacity. Nigerians expect the government to provide plentiful, cheap fuel. In recent years, Nigeria has faced regular shortages leading to queues at fuel pumps, as private firms have been deterred from importing due to government price caps on fuel sales and because of the difficulty sourcing dollars when a fall in global crude prices hit Nigeria’s hard currency revenues. To fill the gap, NNPC has accounted for more than 90 percent of imports in the past year. With a presidential election due in February, trade sources said the government was keeping up the pace of imports to ensure ample availability. “NNPC is being overly cautious with the presidential election less than a year away,” another importer said. Traders in Europe said loadings for the region had reached 2.3 million tonnes in the past month, the highest level in two years of tracking the trade. Thomson Reuters TradeFlow data showed a spike in early spring in gasoline loadings from Europe, a rise that had helped support sagging gasoline margins amid weak demand from other key destinations, such as the United States. Traders said volumes had started to dip in April. But they added that Nigerian purchases were unlikely to fall off sharply. Indicating NNPC’s continued activity in the market, the state firm awarded a spot tender to buy 10 additional 37,000 tonne cargoes for delivery in May, on top of the shipments it typically receives via swaps for crude oil.

2018-04-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) first-quarter operating profit fell on Thursday, but optimism over its new chief executive, the carmaker’s financial health and lower provisions for the diesel emissions scandal lifted its shares. Two weeks after elevating brand chief Herbert Diess to group CEO as part of the biggest management shake-up in more than a decade, Europe’s biggest carmaker is shifting the focus to making its operating business more efficient. “The Volkswagen group is in a robust economic position. The quarterly results confirm that we are on the right path,” Diess said after VW posted group earnings before interest and taxes of 4.21 billion euros (3.67 billion pounds), a fall of 3.6 percent. This was below the 4.47 billion euro consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages. VW said negative effects of 300 million euros from switching to the IFRS accounting standard contributed to the profit drop, adding that underlying earnings slightly exceeded last year’s 4.37 billion if the changes were excluded. The group said it set aside no more significant funds between January and March to cover fines, compensation and vehicle refits related to its 2015 emissions scandal, after it raised provisions by another 600 million euros in the fourth quarter to a total of 25.8 billion euros.  “The market is hoping for Diess to push further profitability gains and is taking joy from the fact that Dieselgate risks are abating,” said NordLB analyst Frank Schwope who has a “Buy” recommendation on the stock, in reference to the diesel emissions test cheating scandal which has cost VW about $30 billion in fines and other costs. Net cash flow, a benchmark for financial health and a buffer against future challenges, increased to 2.4 billion euros from minus 2.6 billion a year earlier, VW said, even excluding 800 million euros in cost outflows for the “Dieselgate” scandal. “We believe the market needs to wake up to the underlying cash strength of this company,” Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. The scandal has prompted major changes at the German group, which is reorganising its multiple car brands and carving out truck operations while shouldering billions of investments in battery-powered and self-driving vehicles. But investors have urged more progress in cutting R&D and material costs as VW keeps grappling with high complexity in products and parts although it has pledged to scale back model variants, platforms and drivetrains. Quarterly profitability at VW’s core namesake brand slid to 4.4 percent from 4.6 percent a year ago on advance costs for its electric-car offensive and eased to 8.5 percent from 8.7 percent at luxury division Audi (NSUG.DE) amid spending to launch over 20 redesigned and new models this year. Czech division Skoda, the biggest intra-group beneficiary from VW’s modular production platforms, kept its return on sales at 9.6 percent, only lagging sports car brand Porsche where investment in electric-car assembly brought down the operating margin to 17.3 percent from 18.5 percent.     VW shares were up 2.1 percent to 170.50 euros at 0957 GMT, outperforming Germany's benchmark DAX .GDAXI index. Despite the quarterly profit drop and second-half risks expected from introducing so-called WLTP lab tests related to car emissions and fuel consumption, VW stuck to its full-year guidance published in February, predicting a return on sales of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent before special items, compared with 7.4 percent in 2017. Revenue is expected to exceed the 2017 record of 231 billion euros by as much as 5 percent while group deliveries may moderately exceed last year’s 10.7 million vehicles, VW said.

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Higher output and soaring oil prices helped European majors Royal Dutch Shell RDAs.L and Total (TOTF.PA) to begin 2018 on a high note with better than expected first-quarter results on Thursday. Brent crude oil prices in the first three months of this year averaged around $67 (48 pounds) a barrel, leaving last year’s $54.5 behind as a distant echo of the price crash of late 2014. The world’s top oil companies are expected to generate more cash in 2018 than at any other time this decade after three years of cuts, but boards remain cautious over near- and long-term price uncertainty. However, Shell shares slipped 2.7 percent by 1000 GMT as cash flows fell short of investors’ strong expectations. Total shares gained 0.7 percent. With Shell’s output up 2 percent at 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) and Total’s production rising 5 percent to 2.7 million boe/d in the quarter, both were well positioned to capture the price upswing in benchmark oil prices. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, together with other producers led by Russia, started in early 2017 to throttle its output to revive prices and regain market share from U.S. oil producers.  This month, Brent crude oil futures climbed above $74 a barrel, reaching highs last seen in late 2014 — a welcome development for oil producers.  Shell reported a 42 percent rise in first-quarter profit, its highest in over three years. Adjusted net income rose to $5.322 billion, topping a company-provided analysts’ consensus of $5.277 billion. Total’s net adjusted profit came in at $2.9 billion, beating analysts’ forecast of $2.77 billion in the quarter. Armed with such results, Shell and Total are in payback mood to investors, buying back shares after diluting stakes with scrip dividends - consisting of shares rather than cash - introduced after the price crash which sent oil prices as low as $28 a barrel. Shell plans to buy back $25 billion of shares by 2020 and    Total said it will raise first quarter interim dividend by 3.2 percent, while Scrip shares issued in January for the second 2017 interim dividend were bought back.

The Southeast Asian country is developing a wave of new power plants to support economic growth that is among the strongest in Asia. Vietnam’s gross domestic product grew 6.81 percent last year, faster than an expansion of 6.21 percent a year earlier. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has given the go-ahead for the two facilities in the province of Dong Nai, state oil firm PetroVietnam, which holds a 51 percent stake in PV Power, said in a statement. The Nhon Trach 3 and Nhon Trach 4 plants will have a combined capacity of 1,500 megawatts and will cost 33.3 trillion dong ($1.46 billion) to build, PetroVietnam said. They are scheduled to start generating in 2020 and 2021 respectively. In a separate deal, Singapore’s Sembcorp Industries said its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sembcorp Utilities, on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam to build another power plant in the country. The 750-megawatt gas-fired power plant will be built in the central province of Quang Ngai, the company said in a statement, without providing the cost and time frame for building the facility. PV Power, the second largest power producer in Vietnam after the state-run Vietnam Electricity group, said earlier this year that it was looking to sell 676.39 million shares, or a 28.9 percent stake, to strategic investors. The company’s shares were trading at 14,100 dong apiece on Thursday, potentially putting the value of the deal at $419 million.

2018-04-26,"* The companies start selling home photovoltaic kits * Engie sees taget market of three million houses * French retail market opens up to more competition (Adds Frankfurt dateline, quotes from sonnen CEO, detail, context) PARIS/FRANKFURT, April 26 (Reuters) - French utility Engie and German solar battery maker sonnen have teamed up to offer a package of solar panels and home power storage to French households, they said on Thursday. Sonnen, a venture capital-backed start-up, said the package, called “My Power”, would be available immediately. Herve-Matthieu Ricour, head of Engie’s French retail unit, said in Paris the utility estimated there were about three million power customers in France with detached houses that are suitable for the solar and storage package. In the south of France, users could cover nearly 100 percent of their power needs between May and September with the package, he said, while in the north customers would be able to generate about two thirds of their electricity needs. Sonnen’s Chief Executive Christoph Ostermann told Reuters in Germany that the company hoped to replicate inroads in the German and Italian markets, helped by France’s goal to reduce its reliance on nuclear energy and the dominant position of former monopoly EDF. “Engie has tested the systems and is now going into this market,” Ostermann said. “Together, we would like to become a dominant player in French home solar batteries within two to three years.” Ostermann said sonnen could appeal to customers wanting to become more autonomous in a power market still more than 90-percent supplied by EDF. Nuclear production used to guarantee French consumers cheap power but retail prices have increased by around 20 percent over the past five years as reactors age, power needs grow and the build-up of renewable energy takes time. Worldwide, sonnen has sold 30,000 batteries for storing solar power to small generators with a combined 210 megawatts of capacity, mostly to rooftop solar panel owners in Germany, Italy, the United States and Australia. The French storage market is in its infancy, whereas in sonnen’s home market, there are vast opportunities to sell batteries for 1.6 million solar rooftop systems, sonnen said. But France has an edge in legislation to support the take-up of smart meters that will enable data apps to share energy flows and to market related services, and with an investment subsidy for the purchase of photovoltaic systems. Germany is deliberately lagging behind in the adoption of smart meters, due to doubts over cost-benefit and data privacy considerations.

2018-04-26,"(Repeats for wider distribution.) By Devika  Krishna Kumar NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Smaller independent refiners with less complex facilities are surging in the stock market of late, as investors expect strong earnings growth thanks to the recent fall in price of their primary cost - light, sweet crude oil coming out of West Texas. Over the last 20 years, the nation’s biggest refiners spent billions building units capable of turning heavy, sour crude into gasoline, diesel fuel and other products. But the U.S. shale revolution has boosted crude production to a record 10.5 million barrels per day, upending the global oil market by adding millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix. A majority of that new production is light, sweet West Texas crude. Recent trends have turbocharged this shift: full pipelines in West Texas, where light U.S. oil originates from, have depressed prices for Midland, Texas, crude WTC-WTM to more than three-year lows. On the other hand, OPEC production cuts and supply issues among big producers of heavy crude like Venezuela and Mexico have raised the cost of heavy, sour oil. That gives an advantage to some independent refiners equipped for lighter crude, which is less complicated to process. Investors have been buying up independents with less complex refineries like Delek US Holdings Inc and HollyFrontier Corp, as they could benefit from low Permian prices for several quarters to come. “To have your major feedstock be in such abundant supply is unequivocally a positive for U.S. refining,” said Matthew Blair, a Denver-based refinery analyst with Tudor Pickering & Holt. “The benefits of that are going to be unevenly spread through the group.” To be sure, shares of most refiners have been rallying, as refining margins CL321-1=R recently hit a five-month high and U.S. gasoline demand is near record levels. Results are likely to show strong profits across the sector, beginning with Valero Energy Corp on Thursday. However, over the last three months, as Permian crude has slumped, Delek shares have soared, returning more than 30 percent, with HollyFrontier close behind at 25 percent, besting all other independent refiners. The two are also ranked highest among U.S. refining companies in the Thomson Reuters earnings revisions model, which looks at analyst revisions for earnings and revenue and recommendation changes. “Light” grades are distinguished based on what is known as API gravity - a measurement of density. A majority of U.S. shale crude output growth is at the top of the scale with API gravity above 40 degrees. More complex U.S. refineries are configured to run on grades of crude with an API gravity of around 31-33 degrees. Most refineries cannot simply take in only lighter crude, because it would affect operational efficiency. “In order to process more shale from here on, refiners will need access to more heavy crude too,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note last week. About 70 percent of Delek’s crude slate is based on Permian crude, according to a March company presentation. The company did not respond to a request for comment. HollyFrontier is less reliant on the Permian - it accounts for 35 percent of its crude slate, said Craig Biery, director of investor relations. However, its imports of heavy crude have exclusively been discounted Canadian oil in the six months through January, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. The company has existing pipeline commitments for that oil, so it can take full advantage of those discounts, said Barclays analyst Paul Cheng. Valero, Marathon Petroleum Corp and Andeavor , three of the largest independent refiners, have had more downward earnings revisions over the last 30 days than other independent refiners, according to Thomson Reuters data. Those refiners, with multiple facilities on the Gulf Coast, rely more on imports from Latin America. For the six months through January, Valero imported 6 million to 7 million barrels a month, and only 10 to 15 percent is from Canada, according to the EIA, with the bulk from Mexico, Venezuela or other Latin American nations. The spread between international benchmark Brent crude and U.S. crude WTCLc1-LCOc1, a proxy for import costs, has surged to more than $6 a barrel - the biggest premium seen all year. Valero has only about 25 percent of its crude slate directly linked to U.S. crude, and its exposure to Midland is even smaller, Cheng said.

2018-04-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - Engie (ENGIE.PA) CEO Isabelle Kocher said the French utility has no plans for a German-style split of its activities and had considered buying independent power retailer Direct Energie DIREN.PA but decided against it. German utilities E.ON (EONGn.DE) and RWE (RWEG.DE) last month carved up RWE unit Innogy (IGY.DE) between them to create two specialised utilities, with E.ON focussed on grids and retail and RWE on renewable power generation.  That move has given a boost to the stocks of the two German companies, as investors often prefer simpler business models.  Kocher said the move was a surprise for the utilities industry, which will be closely watching the German experiment. She said the restructuring represented a bet that a utility can be a better power producer without a client portfolio, and a better grid operator without having privileged access to power generation assets. “We have not made that bet, quite the opposite in fact. We are a group which presents itself to its clients as an architect that can do everything,” she said.  NO PLANS TO SPIN-OFF ENGINE UNITS Asked about a possible spin-off of some Engie activities in order to boost the value of the Engie group’s shares, Kocher said this was not something the market was asking for.  “We do not feel market pressure for an operation of that kind,” she told reporters.  She said the pressure to sell off divisions is felt more by companies which are undervalued by the stock market, which was not the case for Engie.  “We are one of the best valued companies in the industry,” she said. “There was a time that we suffered a discount, but that is no longer the case,” she said.  Thomson Reuters data show that Engie has one of the lowest price-to-book ratios in the Stoxx European utilities index .SX6P, with its market capitalisation at about 0.94 percent of its asset value.  Following the German restructuring, RWE trades at about two times book and E.ON at more than four times book.  Kocher also said Engie had looked into buying independent Direct Energie, but had decided against it.  “We knew they were going to sell at some point ... but we did not need to buy an entry ticket into the French power market, we are already there,” she said. French oil major Total (TOTF.PA) bought Direct Energie last week in a deal that will make it a major challenger to market leader EDF (EDF.PA).

2018-04-26,"* World stocks flat; growth fears, bonds overshadow Q1 results * U.S. 10-year yield just above 3 pct, highest since early 2014 * Higher U.S. yields lift dollar index to 3-1/2-mth high * Euro stuck near 1-1/2-mth low, ECB policy meeting in focus By Sujata Rao LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - World markets remained edgy on Thursday, with shares eking out gains amid concern over the global economic outlook and with U.S. bond yields at four-year highs after breaking above the psychologically significant 3 percent line this week. Investors will be watching the European Central Bank later for clues on when it will signal an end-date for its 2.55 trillion euro ($3.2 trillion) asset-buying programme . Equities enjoyed strong gains in South Korea, where electronics conglomerate and key tech bellwether Samsung posted record quarterly profits , while Japan’s Nikkei added 0.5 percent. On Wednesday, the U.S. Dow Jones benchmark snapped a five-day losing streak thanks to more strong corporate earnings. While the Nasdaq tech index fell again, it could benefit from a strong after-market rise in Facebook which posted forecast-beating results. Equity futures were tipping Nasdaq to open 0.4 percent higher while the other two indexes are seen only marginally higher. But the momentum fizzed in Europe where shares flatlined near one-week lows, as a mixed set of earnings weighed, including a 79 percent profit drop at Deutsche Bank. All that kept MSCI’s all-country equity index only marginally in the black after five straight days of losses . Investors remain cautious even though company after company, especially in the United States, has posted record-shattering first quarter results. Instead, signs of ebbing economic growth momentum are preying on their minds, alongside higher global borrowing costs that could dent future earnings. Oil’s 11 percent rise this year, on top of last year’s 18 percent jump, is adding to inflation fears. “The music is still playing and we are still dancing, but we are reducing risk,” said Pau Morilla-Giner, chief investment officer at London & Capital. “The worry is about an overheating, leading to a rise in inflation, higher interest rates which bring on a textbook recession.” Ten-year Treasury yields, the reference rate for global borrowing, extended their yield surge. Having risen around 25 basis points since early-April, the yield is a whisker off the 3.041 percent mark that would be a new four-year high. The yield has risen for six straight days - the longest upward run since September 2017, according to Reuters data. That, alongside the rise in commodity prices has led companies such as Alphabet to warn of surging costs while heavy equipment maker, Caterpillar said its buoyant first-quarter earnings could be the “high water mark”. While 81.2 percent of U.S. earnings have beaten consensus estimates and Thomson Reuters data projects first-quarter earnings growth at 22 percent, investors fear such warnings from other companies. “We have been on a real high with corporate profitability so people got psyched up about those numbers getting even better,” said Peter Lowman, CIO of UK-based wealth manager Investment Quorum. “But with Treasury yields rising, people are worrying we may be peaking on profits, or if GDP growth is peaking and we are now in a situation where markets are getting very nervous,” he said, noting the U.S. Federal Reserve appeared to be in no mood to brake its rate-hike programme. The European Central Bank is expected to keep policy unchanged at its meeting ending on Thursday and will likely play down the recent softness in the euro economy. Euro zone bond yields, swept up in the Treasury market momentum, inched down from multi-week highs before the meeting, and the euro firmed off eight-week lows against the dollar . Money-market pricing suggests investors expect the ECB to deliver a rate hike by June 2019, having pushed back expectations from early next year. Credit Agricole strategist Orlando Green said markets expected ECB President Mario Draghi to focus on the softer recent data and address concerns about euro strength and global trade tensions. “The risk is that he is less dovish than expected,” Green added. That could provide a lift to the euro which has sold off in recent days against the dollar to approach its March 1 level of $1.2154 — weakest since mid-January. It fetched $1.21775 before the ECB meeting. Sweden’s central bank meanwhile remained dovish at a policy meeting, pushing the crown to the lowest versus the euro since late-2009. In contrast, the dollar has powered higher in recent weeks to hit 3-1/2 month highs against a basket of G10 peers, supported by rising debt yields. Against the yen it traded this week at 109.490, its strongest since Feb. 8. Reporting by Sujata Rao, additional reporting by Shinichi

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - More than 40 companies, including Britain’s biggest supermarkets, Coca Cola, Nestle and Procter & Gamble, have bowed to growing pressure to tackle pollution by committing to cut plastic use over the next seven years. The companies have promised to hit a target by 2025 to eliminate unnecessary single-use plastic packaging in the United Kingdom. Signing up to the UK Plastics Pact, launched on Thursday by sustainability campaign group WRAP, they have pledged that 100 percent of plastic packaging will be reusable, recyclable or compostable by that date. Other targets are that 70 percent of plastic packaging is effectively recycled or composted, and that all plastic packaging will have 30 percent average recycled content. Food and drink manufacturers and retailers around the world are under pressure to act on plastic waste given growing concern from the public and lawmakers about its damaging impact on the environment. Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate avoidable plastic waste in Britain by 2042 as part of a “national plan of action” and her government is looking at a range of options including banning some products and using the tax system to change consumers’ behavior. The 42 Plastic Pact companies are responsible for over 80 percent of the plastic packaging on products sold through UK supermarkets, according to WRAP. Market leader Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Walmart’s Asda, Morrisons, Marks & Spencer, discounters Aldi and Lidl have all signed up. Other signatories include the UK government and trade associations. “Together, we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rethink and reshape the future of plastic so that we retain its value, and curtail the damage plastic waste wreaks on our planet,” said WRAP CEO Marcus Gover. In January, privately-owned Iceland became the first British supermarket to promise to eliminate plastic packaging from all of its own brand products and called on the industry to follow its lead. Morrisons, Britain’s fourth largest grocer, which unlike rivals makes about 30 percent of the food it sells, said on Thursday it would work through all of its own brand products to identify, reduce and remove any unnecessary plastic packaging. It said black plastic trays used for fresh meat and fish will be phased out by the end of 2019, while customers will be allowed to use their own containers for produce purchased from its butcher and fishmonger counters. Other measures include trialling the effect of removing plastic packaging from fruit and vegetables, with an aim to examine how plastic packaging, which helps keep food fresh, can be reduced without increasing food waste. Tesco had already committed to making all packaging fully recyclable or compostable by 2025 and is targeting a halving of packaging weight by the same date compared to 2007 levels. Sainsbury’s has reduced its own brand packaging by 35 percent since 2005 and is targeting a 50 percent reduction by 2020. Asda said in February it would use 10 percent less plastic in its own brand products over 12 months and had already committed to making sure all own brand packaging is recyclable by 2025. Environmental groups have welcomed the food retailers’ actions but have said they do not go far enough.

While missile strikes and threats of a global trade war have hogged the headlines, it’s an unexpected loss of economic momentum, particularly in Europe, that has frightened investors who played down political risks for years and stayed firmly focused on brisk economic growth and rising corporate profits. The recent surge in oil prices, adding inflation to the economic mix, may also weigh further on markets assessing whether a slowdown is afoot, or if the first quarter was merely a soft patch before the boom resumes. “For the first time in 18 months, markets no longer have the protective shield of growth momentum,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, who so far considers the soft economic data an air pocket. “There is not enough evidence to say this is the beginning of the end, yet if you look at fundamentals, there is deterioration relative to last year, no question about that.” Big multilateral forecasters remain broadly optimistic. The International Monetary Fund predicts robust 3.9 percent growth for 2018 and next year, though it too warned last week of risks from trade tensions or the waning impact of U.S. tax cuts. Data this week showed euro zone business morale worsened further in April, while German authorities have cut growth forecasts after business confidence hit its lowest level in more than a year. U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data due on Friday is predicted by the latest Reuters polls to show a 2.2 percent expansion, down from a forecast in March of 2.6 percent growth. Adding to investors’ concerns are warnings from companies such heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc., which said on Tuesday its forecast-beating first-quarter profits and sales were probably a high watermark for the year. Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, told clients equities would continue to do well but he predicted lower returns and higher volatility than in 2017, partly because there was “less room for growth to top expectations.” So where, besides Europe’s faltering Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs), are concerns about growth evident? Perhaps most illustrative are government bonds in Western countries where yield curves, the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, have inexorably narrowed all year - a fairly reliable indicator of growth pessimism. Some of the curve flattening has reversed slightly after the oil price jump increased inflation worries and lifted long-term yields. But the gap between U.S. 2-year and 10-year yields remains almost 30 basis points below the highs hit this year. “I don’t think the curve is telling us anything different from other indicators,” Pictet’s Paolini said. “It’s telling you that over the next one to two years there is reason to be cautious.” Shipping market bellwether, the Baltic Dry Freight Index , fell to eight-month lows this month and while it has rebounded in recent days, it is still 20 percent off its December highs. Copper, another growth barometer, has come off four-year highs hit late in 2017. Then there are indexes that estimate how much pessimism or optimism is priced into markets, based on how often data beat or miss forecasts, and by how much. Perhaps the most closely watched is Citi’s Economic Surprise Index, which has slumped into the red after hitting 7-1/2-year highs at the end of 2017. And finally, equities. After a record 15-month winning streak, world stocks are 7 percent below end-January highs . Even more telling, U.S. shares in so-called defensive sectors such as telecoms and utilities have modestly outperformed cyclicals such as technology stocks since mid-March, Morgan Stanley analysts said last week. Defensive stocks usually fare better during downturns while cyclicals thrive in booms. The slight shift may indicate, “economic growth is likely peaking not accelerating at this point in this cycle”, Morgan Stanley told clients. What if markets are reading it wrong? Most still believe that while growth has stuttered rather than roared into 2018, a powerful expansion continues nonetheless. Seasonal adjustments after a long and severe Northern hemisphere winter, early Easter holidays and China’s New Year, may also be to blame. Barclays, for instance, believes U.S. growth did lose steam in the first quarter and has downgraded its forecasts. But it sees “residual seasonality” also playing a role. Even though the U.S. government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis has adjusted its methodology to account for seasonal factors, they still cause weak reported growth in the first quarter each year and buoyant activity later, Barclays said. In Europe too, analysts have blamed weak data on one-offs such as the harsh winter, Easter vacations and high sick levels of sick leave due to flu. Finally, some such as Sebastian Raedler at Deutsche Bank don’t see indicators, market levels and growth forecasts as out of kilter. Instead, purchasing manager indexes were over-optimistic from late 2017, especially in the euro zone, he said. “PMIs and GDP growth move very closely in line with each other, but suddenly this gap opened up between GDP running at 2.5 percent and PMIs implying 4 percent growth,” Raedler said. According to Raedler, growth remains firm but the rate of change in growth looks less certain. “If it’s the rate of change then that matters, then that has just started to roll over... and we have seen the impact on stock and bond markets.” Reporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting and graphics by

2018-04-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - French energy company Total (TOTF.PA) on Thursday reported record high quarterly oil and gas output while beating profit forecasts helped by higher prices. New projects and recent acquisitions powered an increase in output of more than 5 percent to 2.703 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), topping the 2.663 million boe/d expected by analysts. It raised output from new projects such as Yamal LNG in Russia and Moho Nord in Congo, while adding assets, including Maersk Oil and Al Shaheen in Qatar. Net adjusted profit of $2.9 billion topped the $2.77 billion expected by analysts in a poll. Higher oil prices are helping energy companies too, with Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) also posted higher profits on Thursday. “Oil prices continued to rebound in the first quarter 2018,” Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement. “Brent rose to an average of $67 per barrel, supported by strong demand, OPEC-non-OPEC compliance and geopolitical tensions,” he said. “Cash flow after organic investments increased to $2.8 billion, up by more than 50 percent from a year ago, thanks to good operational performance and continued spending discipline,” Pouyanne noted. Total shares were up 0.6 percent at 0849 GMT versus a 0.3 percent rise in the European oil and gas index .SXEP.  Total said it expected to exceed its 6 percent production target for 2018 helped by start-ups and ramp-ups of new projects, such as Kashagan in Kazakhstan, Kaombo in Angola and Ichthys in Australia, later in the year. Total aims for 5 percent annual output growth through 2022, though it noted persistent uncertainty about the evolution of global supply. “The oil price is up and they have captured that through the earnings and the cash flow. It tells you they are holding the line on costs and all of that leverage is falling to the bottom line,” Bernstein analyst Clint Oswald said. “They are pointing to higher-than-expected volumes this year so operations must be going well,” he said. Total said it would continue to exercise discipline on its cost base. It maintained 2018 investments at $15-$17 billion, with an operating expense target of $5.5 per barrel of oil equivalent. It said cost reduction plans were ongoing, with an objective of more than $4 billion in 2018. The company said it would raise its first-quarter dividend by 3.2 percent, while scrip shares issued in January for the second 2017 interim dividend were bought back to prevent dilution. “The group bought back a further $300 million of shares to return to shareholders as part of the benefit realized from higher oil prices,” Pouyanne said. The company said in February that it planned to buy back up to $5 billion of stock over 2018-2020 to share the benefits of higher oil prices with investors.

2018-04-26,"SHANGHAI, April 26 (Reuters) - China has ordered local governments to “ease the burden” on renewable power generators by strengthening guaranteed purchase agreements and giving them priority access to new grid capacity, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said on Thursday. According to China’s renewable energy law, power transmission companies are obliged to take on all the electricity generated by local renewable sources, but many projects have still been left with inadequate grid access, a problem known in the industry as curtailment. The NEA said in a notice that it would “strictly implement” the guaranteed renewable power procurement system, and it would also order grid firms to “promptly accept” grid access applications from wind, solar and biomass power projects. For regions that fail to make the guaranteed purchases, the NEA will take action to slow the pace of project construction. The NEA also urged local authorities to reduce land costs and stop imposing arbitrary charges and unreasonable project approval conditions on renewable energy firms. Local governments have been ordered to pay back fees that have been illegally collected from renewable companies. Two grid companies in northwest China are currently being sued by an environmental group for failing to maximise purchases of renewable power, causing more than 100 million yuan ($15.80 million) in lost earnings. China wasted 41.9 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of wind power in 2017 as a result of poor grid connectivity, 12 percent of total wind generation. Wasted solar amounted to 7.3 billion kWh, 6 percent of total generation. In data published this week, the NEA said the situation improved somewhat in the first quarter of 2018, with wind curtailment at 8.5 percent and solar at 4.3 percent. The government is cutting the subsidies available to renewable energy providers after costs have declined over the last decade, but it is looking for other ways to encourage clean energy projects. The NEA said in the notice that it would encourage financial institutions to increase the credit available to renewable energy developers, and would also encourage the issuing of green bonds. Authorities are also now ironing out the details of a mandatory renewable energy quota system that will compel grid firms and big power consumers to acquire a minimum proportion of electricity from clean sources.

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) named Helge Lund, a former head of Norway’s Statoil, as its next chairman on Thursday, as the British oil major looks to extend a period of rapid growth after recovering from a deadly oil spill in 2010.  Lund, who also led BG Group during its acquisition by rival Royal Dutch Shell, will replace Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of BP for almost nine years, at the beginning of next year. The 55-year-old Lund steered Statoil through its transformation from a state oil company into a leading global player, and is likely to have to navigate BP through the succession of its veteran CEO Bob Dudley later this decade. “It is a good appointment,” said Rohan Murphy, analyst at asset manager Allianz Global Investors. “He has already had a great career and coming from Statoil and BG shows his upstream expertise which is still the main driver of earnings at BP so it is key to understand this well.” Lund will join BP at a time when the British oil and gas company is growing quickly, having recovered from the deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 that brought the company to the brink of collapse.     The Norwegian earned his reputation as a leader when he oversaw Statoil’s STL.OL shift from a domestic-focused state oil firm into an international major over the 10 years to 2014.      He was also CEO of BG Group from 2015 to 2016. Just two months into the job, he agreed to a takeover by Shell (RDSa.L) which corporate filings showed would trigger payouts that could net him more than 32 million pounds ($48 million).    Lund will join BP’s board as chairman designate and a non-executive director on Sept. 1 and will become chairman on Jan 1, the company said. It did not give salary details.      “Our industry is changing faster than ever as the world focuses on meeting the dual challenge of more energy with fewer emissions ... Helge has a track record of leadership in addressing these issues,” Svanberg said in a statement. Svanberg, from Sweden, became chairman on Jan. 1, 2010, four months before the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history that left 11 workers dead. He played a key role in the aftermath of the disaster that cost the company over $65 billion. Lund, who is also chairman of Denmark’s Novo Nordisk AS (NOVOb.CO), will stand down as a director at oilfield service company Schlumberger (SLB.N) with immediate effect. He has been a Schlumberger director since June 2016. He started his career as a consultant with McKinsey & Company and a parliamentary adviser for Norway’s Conservative party. Lund was also on the board of directors of Nokia (NOKIA.HE) from 2011 to 2014.

The former DONG Energy reported a 68 percent increase in earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 5.5 billion Danish crowns ($899.24 million), topping the 4.03 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters survey. Profits at the company’s offshore wind farms in operation doubled compared to the same period a year ago, due to a ramp-up of three wind parks in Britain as well as higher wind speeds, it said. “The offshore wind business has had a strong start to the year with high yields from our operating assets and continued good progress on our construction projects,” said chief executive Henrik Poulsen. The world’s largest developer of offshore wind increased its EBITDA guidance by 0.5 billion crowns to 12.5-13.5 billion crowns. The increase was due to an operationally strong start to the year as well and a positive outcome of an arbitration related to a gas purchase contract, it said.

However, sagging Chinese shares limited the upside potential of the market. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open higher off the back of firm U.S. stocks, pointing to a rise in Britain’s FTSE of 0.1 percent, an increase in Germany’s DAX of 0.4 percent and in France’s CAC of 0.4 percent. The dollar hovered near 3-1/2-month highs against a basket of currencies, supported by the rise in U.S. long-term debt yields to a four-year peak. South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 1.3 percent, with tech shares buoyed by news of a record quarterly profit from Samsung Electronics. The region’s other gainers included Japan’s Nikkei, which rose 0.5 percent and Thai and Malaysian stocks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.15 percent, as weaker Chinese stocks weighed on the market. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 index dropped 1.4 percent as tech shares came under pressure following news that U.S. prosecutors have been investigating if China’s Huawei violated U.S. sanctions on Iran. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.25 percent on Wednesday, ending five consecutive sessions of losses, and the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent on optimism over a spate of upbeat earnings that managed to offset jitters about rising U.S. bond yields. The rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to a four-year peak above 3 percent had weighed on stocks amid concerns higher costs to borrow could dampen corporate profits. Nonetheless, the broader equity market reaction to the latest jump in U.S. yields appeared to be more measured compared to February, when a similar spike in rates sent stocks tumbling. “The equity markets slid sharply in January and March in response to the rise in Treasury yields. But the Federal Reserve signalled in March that its rate hikes would be gradual,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “Expectations towards U.S. rate hikes being gradual are enabling equities to take the current yield rise in stride.” The 10-year yield rose to 3.035 percent on Wednesday, its highest since January 2014. The yield has climbed on expectations of a steady U.S. economic expansion, accelerating inflation and concerns about increasing debt supply. It last stood at 3.031 percent. U.S. yields have dragged up their European counterparts, with 10-year German bund reaching a six-week high of 0.655 percent and its British Gilt equivalent setting a nine-week peak of 1.57 percent this week. The rise in borrowing rates has also supported the dollar. The dollar index of a basket of six major currencies was steady in Asia at 91.157 and within reach of 91.261, its highest since Jan 12 scaled on Wednesday. The dollar has risen without pause through much of the past week, in part helped by an easing of concerns over a U.S.-China trade dispute. The euro fetched $1.2175 after sliding to a 1-1/2-month low of $1.2160. The immediate focus for euro traders is the European Central Bank monetary policy decision due at 1145 GMT. The ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged but its comments will be followed closely for any hints of when it might scale back its massive monetary stimulus. “We expect no changes to the ECB’s setting of monetary conditions or its guidance. Some people in the market will be disappointed by that, but ECB President (Mario) Draghi has been starkly clear about the Governing Council’s position,” wrote Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics. “Conditions prerequisite for a change in the central bank’s stance have not been met.” The dollar was little changed at 109.340 yen after going as high as 109.490, its strongest since Feb. 8. Crude oil prices were up amid the prospect of fresh sanctions on Iran and concerns about output from Venezuela. Brent crude added 0.7 percent to $74.50 a barrel and U.S. crude futures were 0.55 percent higher at $68.42 a barrel. Higher U.S. yields and a stronger dollar weighed on gold, with spot prices slipping to a five-week low of $1,318.51 an ounce overnight. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro; Editing by Sam Holmes and Neil

2018-04-26,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China coking coal imports vs. SGX price: reut.rs/2FjMuzM By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 26 - China’s imports of coking coal staged a strong comeback in March after a weak start to the year, and may be poised for further strength as steel output rises. Imports of coking coal, used to make steel, jumped to 4.02 million tonnes in March, up 38 percent from the 2.91 million tonnes recorded in February, according to customs data released on April 24. However, the robust outcome in March went only some way to reversing the weaker trend so far this year. Imports for the first quarter as a whole totalled 12.05 million tonnes, a drop of 28 percent on the same period last year. In some ways the decline in first-quarter coking coal imports isn’t that surprising, given the winter restrictions placed on steel production as part of the authorities’ efforts to limit air pollution. However, steel production in China wasn’t actually weak over the first quarter, with output rising 5.4 percent from the same period in 2017 to 212.2 million tonnes. In fact, March’s production of 74 million tonnes was the most since September, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. What is the likely explanation is that steel production was curbed in the north of country, where winter pollution concerns are most acute, but mills in other parts of China were able to increase their output to take advantage of good prices. The higher steel output in the first quarter doesn’t fit well with the lower imports of coking coal, but there are some factors that may help explain some of the issues. The first is that steel mills have been using higher quality iron ore, therefore requiring less coking coal to produce the same amount of raw material. Certainly, recent months have seen widening premiums for higher-grade iron ore and traders have reported mills have been preferring quality over quantity. A switch to quality probably isn’t enough by itself to explain lower coking coal imports, and it’s doubtful that domestic production has been making up the shortfall. China’s total coal production, including both thermal and coking grades, fell to the lowest in five months in March, totalling 290 million tonnes. First-quarter output was up 3.9 percent on the same period in 2017 to 804.5 million tonnes, suggesting that, if anything, there was only a modest increase in domestic supply of coking coal. It’s likely that steel mills and producers of coke - which is made from coking coal and used in blast furnaces - have been running down inventories. Coking coal prices in the first quarter certainly wouldn’t have been encouraging additional buying beyond what was absolutely necessary to sustain operations. The main domestic price, Dalian Commodity Exchange futures , hit the highest in a year in late January, closing at 1,511 yuan ($238.70) a tonne on Jan. 30. However, recently the price has been in retreat, with the contract dropping to 1,213 yuan a tonne at the close on Wednesday - down almost 20 percent from the January high. Coking coal futures on the Singapore Exchange, which track the free-on-board price in Australia, the world’s largest exporter of the fuel, have also declined in recent weeks, ending at $191 a tonne on Wednesday. This is down almost 28 percent since the January peak of $265 a tonne, a nine-month high. Lower prices may well encourage steel mills and coke producers to restock, especially if steel prices and demand hold up in the coming months. Both of China’s largest providers of coking coal, Australia and Mongolia, have the capacity to supply more and competition between the two is somewhat limited, given they largely supply different steel-making regions. Both Mongolia and Australia have seen volumes supplied drop in the first quarter at a rate just below the overall drop of 28 percent. However, third-ranked supplier Russia has bucked the trend, with China’s imports increasing 0.4 percent, as buyers take advantage of the price advantage of Russian cargoes over those from Australia.

2018-04-26,"NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Smaller independent refiners with less complex facilities are surging in the stock market of late, as investors expect strong earnings growth thanks to the recent fall in price of their primary cost - light, sweet crude oil coming out of West Texas. Over the last 20 years, the nation’s biggest refiners spent billions building units capable of turning heavy, sour crude into gasoline, diesel fuel and other products. But the U.S. shale revolution has boosted crude production to a record 10.5 million barrels per day, upending the global oil market by adding millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix. A majority of that new production is light, sweet West Texas crude. Recent trends have turbocharged this shift: full pipelines in West Texas, where light U.S. oil originates from, have depressed prices for Midland, Texas, crude WTC-WTM to more than three-year lows. On the other hand, OPEC production cuts and supply issues among big producers of heavy crude like Venezuela and Mexico have raised the cost of heavy, sour oil. That gives an advantage to some independent refiners equipped for lighter crude, which is less complicated to process. Investors have been buying up independents with less complex refineries like Delek US Holdings Inc and HollyFrontier Corp, as they could benefit from low Permian prices for several quarters to come. “To have your major feedstock be in such abundant supply is unequivocally a positive for U.S. refining,” said Matthew Blair, a Denver-based refinery analyst with Tudor Pickering & Holt. “The benefits of that are going to be unevenly spread through the group.” To be sure, shares of most refiners have been rallying, as refining margins CL321-1=R recently hit a five-month high and U.S. gasoline demand is near record levels. Results are likely to show strong profits across the sector, beginning with Valero Energy Corp on Thursday. However, over the last three months, as Permian crude has slumped, Delek shares have soared, returning more than 30 percent, with HollyFrontier close behind at 25 percent, besting all other independent refiners. The two are also ranked highest among U.S. refining companies in the Thomson Reuters earnings revisions model, which looks at analyst revisions for earnings and revenue and recommendation changes. “Light” grades are distinguished based on what is known as API gravity - a measurement of density. A majority of U.S. shale crude output growth is at the top of the scale with API gravity above 40 degrees. More complex U.S. refineries are configured to run on grades of crude with an API gravity of around 31-33 degrees. Most refineries cannot simply take in only lighter crude, because it would affect operational efficiency. “In order to process more shale from here on, refiners will need access to more heavy crude too,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note last week. About 70 percent of Delek’s crude slate is based on Permian crude, according to a March company presentation. The company did not respond to a request for comment. HollyFrontier is less reliant on the Permian - it accounts for 35 percent of its crude slate, said Craig Biery, director of investor relations. However, its imports of heavy crude have exclusively been discounted Canadian oil in the six months through January, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. The company has existing pipeline commitments for that oil, so it can take full advantage of those discounts, said Barclays analyst Paul Cheng. Valero, Marathon Petroleum Corp and Andeavor , three of the largest independent refiners, have had more downward earnings revisions over the last 30 days than other independent refiners, according to Thomson Reuters data. Those refiners, with multiple facilities on the Gulf Coast, rely more on imports from Latin America. For the six months through January, Valero imported 6 million to 7 million barrels a month, and only 10 to 15 percent is from Canada, according to the EIA, with the bulk from Mexico, Venezuela or other Latin American nations. The spread between international benchmark Brent crude and U.S. crude WTCLc1-LCOc1, a proxy for import costs, has surged to more than $6 a barrel - the biggest premium seen all year. Valero has only about 25 percent of its crude slate directly linked to U.S. crude, and its exposure to Midland is even smaller, Cheng said. A March investor presentation says sweet crude makes up an average of 17-37 percent of its Gulf refineries. The company declined comment. Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York

2018-04-26,"NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Demand to ship fuel on Colonial Pipeline’s Line 2, its main distillate line, has dropped to about a six-month low as rising Gulf Coast exports have kept barrels from being sent through the pipeline to other U.S. regions, traders said. Colonial Pipeline’s Line 2, which can carry 1 million barrels of distillate per day from Houston, Texas, to Greensboro, North Carolina, has not been allocated since cycle 15, just over a month ago, a company spokesman said. Colonial, the largest fuel pipeline system in the United States, functions as the primary artery carrying about 3 million barrels of gasoline and other fuels daily from the Gulf Coast to various points throughout the U.S. Southeast and East Coast. High Gulf Coast export demand has boosted buying in the region and strengthened prices for distillates like heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel, market sources told Reuters. That makes it less economical to send barrels on Colonial to the East Coast or other areas in the United States. Colonial declined to comment on why the line has been unallocated. Gulf Coast middle distillate exports are at over 1.2 million barrels per day so far in April, a five-month high, said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. A majority of exports are heading to Central and South America, he said. East Coast supply could remain tight for as long as Line 2 stays unallocated. Inventories of distillates hit their lowest levels since 2014 in the most recent week, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. East Coast distillate prices have been strong due in part to both high export demand and less supply from the Gulf Coast. Gulf Coast distillate fuel oil inventories have fallen for four consecutive weeks, according to EIA data. Gulf diesel ULSD-DIFF-USG hit its strongest levels in seven months in early April and has since weakened slightly to 4 cents per gallon below the futures benchmark on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gulf Coast heating oil HO-DIFF-USG traded on Wednesday at 17 cents per gallon below the futures contract, near levels not seen since January, a signal of strong demand. A Colonial “cycle” is a five-day period when a sequence of all in-season products is pumped. The company pumps the same sequence of products every five days. In 2017, Line 2 was not allocated between cycle 38 and cycle 58, a Colonial spokesman said, the equivalent of about three months.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced back from three-week lows plumbed the previous day and gained 0.35 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 1.2 percent, with tech shares buoyed after Samsung Electronics posted a record quarterly profit. Australian stocks edged up 0.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.7 percent. Shanghai bucked the trend and slipped 0.3 percent. The Dow rose 0.25 percent overnight, ending a five-day losing streak, and the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent on optimism over a spate of upbeat earnings that managed to offset jitters over rising U.S. bond yields. The spike to a four-year peak above 3 percent in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield this week - a benchmark for global borrowing costs - had weighed on stocks amid concerns rising corporate borrowing costs could dampen profits. Nonetheless, the broader equity market reaction to the latest jump in U.S. yields appeared to be more measured compared to February, when a similar spike in rates sent stocks tumbling. “The equity markets slid sharply in January and March in response to the rise in Treasury yields. But the Federal Reserve signalled in March that its rate hikes would be gradual,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “Expectations towards U.S. rate hikes being gradual are enabling equities to take the current yield rise in stride.” The 10-year Treasury note yield rose to 3.035 percent overnight, its highest since January 2014. The yield has climbed on expectations of a steady U.S. economic expansion, accelerating inflation and concerns about increasing debt supply. Higher U.S. yields have dragged up their European counterparts, with 10-year German bund reaching a six-week high of 0.655 percent and its British Gilt equivalent setting a nine-week peak of 1.57 percent this week. The dollar has drawn support from the surge in U.S. yields, with its index against a basket of six major currencies last steady at 91.163 and within reach of 91.261, its highest since Jan. 12 scaled on Wednesday. The greenback has risen without pause through much of the past week as concerns over a U.S.-China trade dispute receded, allowing the market to turn its attention back to dollar-supportive fundamentals. The euro fetched $1.2176 after sliding to a 1-1/2-month low of $1.2160. Immediate focus was on the European Central Bank’s monetary policy decision at 1145 GMT. The ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged but its comments will be followed closely for further guidance on the timing of its scaling-back of massive monetary stimulus. The dollar was little changed at 109.360 yen after going as high as 109.490, its strongest since Feb. 8. Crude oil prices were up amid the prospect of fresh sanctions on Iran and concerns about output from Venezuela. Brent crude added 0.6 percent to $74.43 a barrel and U.S. crude futures were 0.5 percent higher at $68.38 a barrel. Higher U.S. yields and a stronger dollar weighed on non-yielding gold, with spot prices slipping to a five-week low of $1,318.51 an ounce overnight. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro

2018-04-26,"* Market expects U.S. to re-impose sanctions against Iran * Plunging Venezuelan output further tightens markets * But soaring U.S. crude production holds back market By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, April 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, lifted by concerns over supply disruptions in Venezuela and the Middle East as well as by strong demand. Brent crude oil futures were at 74.44 per barrel at 0105 GMT, up 44 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $68.36 per barrel. Oil output in Venezuela PRODN-VE, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has fallen from almost 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to just around 1.5 million bpd currently due to political and economic turmoil in the South American country. U.S. oil major Chevron Corp has evacuated executives from Venezuela after two of its workers were imprisoned over a contract dispute with state-owned oil company PDVSA. Venezuela’s plunging output comes amid strong demand as well as concerns that supplies from the Middle East, by far the world’s biggest oil producing region, could also be disrupted, especially should the United States in May re-impose sanctions against OPEC-member Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump will decide by May 12 whether to restore U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which would likely result in a reduction of its oil exports. Not all market indicators point towards tighter supplies, however. U.S. crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA rose by 2.2 million barrels in the week to April 20, to 429.74 million barrels. That’s almost 10 million barrels above the five-year average. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA rose by 46,000 barrels per day (bpd) on the previous week, to 10.59 bpd. That’s an increase of more than a quarter since mid-2016. American crude oil output has overtaken that of top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia currently produces more, at around 11 million bpd. With U.S. output surging, some analysts warn that the 20-percent climb in Brent prices since February is starting to look overdone. “The market does look a little toppish,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

2018-04-26," LONDON (Reuters) - “Discipline” has become the oil industry’s favourite word as it emerges from the deepest and longest downturn in a generation. Senior executives are pledging to maintain a cautious approach to investment and spending despite the recovery in oil prices over the last two years. Business leaders and shareholders are still scarred by the memory of project over-runs, spiralling costs and frenzied drilling during the last boom, and the painful adjustments during the subsequent slump. Corporate leaders are under pressure to focus on returning more cash to investors rather than indulging in expensive and risky plans to boost production. The case for a more disciplined approach has been powerfully argued by my counterpart Liam Denning at Bloomberg (“This is Big Oil’s Quarter to Lose”, April 24). This time really will be different, according to the industry, with earnest promises to learn from past mistakes. But there are good reasons to be sceptical. The oil industry has been characterised by deep and prolonged boom-bust cycles since the first modern well was drilled in 1859. Deep cycles are the natural condition of the oil industry and there is no reason to think the future will be any different. Cyclical behaviour is the oil market’s most distinctive characteristic and deeply rooted in the industry’s structure rather than mistakes by its leaders. Price cycles stem from the low price-elasticity of supply and demand, the prevalence of backward-looking expectations and behaviour, and the lumpiness of new discoveries and investments. They also stem from the prevalence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms, which alternately amplify and dampen the initial impact of price changes. The oil market is really multiple sub-markets for crude, fuels, refining, services, engineering, construction, drilling, skilled labour, steel, raw materials etc. Each market is subject to its own feedback mechanisms, operating at different speeds and timescales, with constantly changing supply and demand. Balancing “the oil market” would mean balancing all these sub-markets simultaneously. In practice, the sub-markets are never simultaneously balanced or in a state of equilibrium except accidentally and never for very long. Economist Paul Frankel’s “Essentials of Petroleum”, published in 1946, remains the best explanation of the oil industry’s boom-bust cycle. Frankel noted the basic features of the oil industry made for “continuous crises” with hectic prosperity followed all too swiftly by complete collapse. Frankel concluded the oil industry was not self-adjusting and had an inherent tendency towards extreme crisis. As a result, he was sympathetic to the need for “leading interests” and “planners” to act as “eveners” and “stabilizers”. Frankel urged a form of managed competition, in which oil producers would recognise their common interests and coordinate their policies at strategic level while remaining competitors at tactical level. (I’m not sure how this distinction would work in practice. Frankel did not explain it in detail and seems to have been unsure himself). At different times, Frankel argued that the role of adjusters and eveners had been played by monopolies such as Standard Oil, the major international oil firms, and governments, sometimes in combination. But this was the least convincing part of Frankel’s argument. There is no evidence that any monopoly or combination of interests has ever managed to stabilise the market for long. Even the long period of apparent stability during the 1950s and 1960s came to a dramatic end with the oil shock of 1973 (which was rooted in the long period of low prices during the previous two decades). The price cycle cannot be tamed. Oil-producing companies and countries have to learn to ride with the volatility. “We’ve never been good at predicting these (price) cycles, neither when they occur nor their duration. We don’t spend a lot of time even trying,” Exxon Mobil’s then-chief Rex Tillerson told investors in March 2016. “How the future is going to look, we take no particular view on it, other than to recognise that whatever it is today it will be different sometime in the future, and after that it will be different again.” “In my nearly 41 years (with Exxon) ... I didn’t learn anything about my ability to foresee that. I learned a lot about how you deal with it.” The major oil-producing companies and countries are always cautious in the first stages of a cyclical expansion when memories of the previous slump are still fresh. In the early stages of the last boom, between 2002 and 2006, the major companies were notoriously conservative about investment, worried the rise in prices would not prove sustainable. Ironically, the slow response of investment and production accelerated the boom and pushed prices much higher than they would have risen otherwise. But the combination of high and seemingly sustainable prices eventually triggered a late-cycle rush of investment, not just from the majors but also the independent shale producers. The sluggish response of investment to changes in oil prices is one of the biggest causes of instability in the oil market. However, it is not clear the major oil companies could or should have behaved any differently. If they had adopted an even more restrictive approach to investment, prices would have risen higher, providing an even sharper incentive for other suppliers to fill the gap, most likely U.S. shale producers. The history of the oil industry is of attempts to restrict investment and production to stabilise prices. In every case, price stabilisation efforts have been undone when rival sources of supply were developed to fill the gap: Pennsylvania. Ohio. Dutch East Indies. Romania. Burma. Russia. Texas. Oklahoma. Alberta. California. Mexico. Venezuela. Persia. Iraq. Arabia. Libya. China. Alaska. Nigeria. North Sea. Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater. Oil sands. Most recently U.S. shale. There has never been a shortage of petroleum resources. Every attempt to restrict investment and production has failed because it encouraged the development of new and alternative sources. OPEC and the oil majors may exercise some influence over oil prices in the very short term, but in the medium run they have proved to be price-takers, not price-makers. If the oil majors were to attempt to be more “disciplined” this time around, the resulting rise in prices would simply accelerate the development of alternative sources of supply, as well as curbing demand growth. The majors would end up with lower prices and a smaller market share. Much the same fate awaits OPEC if it tries to tighten the oil market too much (again). What about control over costs? Here too the oil majors and other producers are at the mercy of the industry cycle. Costs for everything from skilled workers and drilling contracts to steel, raw materials, seismic surveys, engineering and a host of other oilfield services are pro-cyclical. In the aftermath of a slump, it is easy for corporate leaders to preach the need for continued cost control, but as the cycle matures and the supply chain tightens, cost pressures inevitably build. Oilfields are a declining asset. If oil companies want to remain in the game, they must invest, accept the price cycle, and manage it as best they can. Most oilfields will produce for decades, so producers must take a view through the cycle and accept the inevitable short-term volatility. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-04-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Morrisons (MRW.L) has become the latest British supermarket to bow to growing pressure on the industry to tackle plastic waste, pledging that by 2025 all of its own brand plastic packaging will be reusable, recyclable or compostable. Britain’s fourth largest grocer, which unlike rivals makes about 30 percent of the food it sells, said on Thursday it would work through all of its own brand products to identify, reduce and remove any unnecessary plastic packaging. The supermarket industry is under pressure to act on plastic waste given growing concern from the public and lawmakers about its damaging impact on the environment. Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate avoidable plastic waste by 2042 as part of a “national plan of action”. In January, privately-owned Iceland became the first British supermarket to promise to eliminate plastic packaging from all of its own brand products and called on the industry to follow its lead. The 491-store Morrisons, which trails market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L) and Walmart’s (WMT.N) Asda by annual sales, said its own research found plastic reduction is the third most important issue to its customers. It said black plastic trays used for fresh meat and fish will be phased out by the end of 2019, while customers will be allowed to use their own containers for produce purchased from its butcher and fishmonger counters. Other measures include trialling the effect of removing plastic packaging from fruit and vegetables, with an aim to examine how plastic packaging, which helps keep food fresh, can be reduced without increasing food waste. Drinking water fountains will also be fitted into new stores. Market leader Tesco has committed to making all packaging fully recyclable or compostable by 2025 and is targeting a halving of packaging weight by the same date compared to 2007 levels. Sainsbury’s has reduced its own brand packaging by 35 percent since 2005 and is targeting a 50 percent reduction by 2020. Asda said in February it would use 10 percent less plastic in its own brand products over 12 months. It had already committed to making sure all own brand packaging is recyclable by 2025. Environmental groups have welcomed the grocers’ moves but have said they do not go far enough. The government plans to ban the sale of plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds, is consulting on how the tax system can be used to change consumers’ behaviour and has pledged to invest to develop new, greener, products and processes. It has, however, resisted a call by campaigners and lawmakers to impose a so-called “latte levy” on single-use coffee cups.
