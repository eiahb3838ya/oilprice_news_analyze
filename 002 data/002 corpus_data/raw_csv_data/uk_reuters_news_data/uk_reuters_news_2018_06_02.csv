2018-06-02,"(Adds background) LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - Iran’s oil exports hit 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in May, the Oil Ministry’s news agency SHANA reported on Saturday, a new record since the lifting of international sanctions on Tehran in 2016, and despite the threats of fresh U.S. sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump on May 8 said the United States was exiting a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and would impose new sanctions that seek to reduce the country’s oil shipments. Iran exported 2.4 million bpd of crude oil in May, SHANA reported, and 300,000 bpd of natural gas condensate. Iran’s oil exports was 2.6 bpd in April. The estimates from Geneva-based Petro-Logistics suggested this week that Iranian oil buyers are not rushing to cut volumes from OPEC’s third-largest producer. The U.S. sanctions have a 180-day period during which buyers should “wind down” purchases. The bulk of Iran’s crude exports, at least 1.8 million bpd, goes to Asia. Most of the rest goes to Europe and these volumes are seen by analysts and traders as the more vulnerable to being curbed by U.S. sanctions. European powers still see the nuclear accord as the best chance of stopping Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and have intensified efforts to save the pact. Iran’s top leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on May 23 that European powers must protect Iranian oil sales from U.S. sanctions, and continue buying Iranian crude, if they want Tehran to stay in the nuclear deal. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said this week that he was hopeful that an agreement with Europe would inspire other potential buyers of Iranian oil. Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin

2018-06-02,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL] has agreed to purchase 200 C919 and 100 ARJ-21 planes from the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC), the companies said on Saturday. HNA and COMAC said in a statement that they had signed a strategic cooperation under which HNA had agreed to introduce and operate the jets in China and in overseas markets such as Africa over an unspecified period of time.  It did not disclose financial terms or say whether these were firm orders or options.  The Chinese conglomerate, which has been selling assets to raise cash, holds stakes in over ten airlines, including Hainan Airlines (600221.SS), Capital Airlines and Africa World Airlines in Ghana. It signed a deal for 15 C919 planes in 2010.  HNA said it had signed the deal to support the development of China’s aviation industry as well as Beijing-led “Made in China 2025” and Belt and Road initiatives, it said.  The C919 aircraft is a symbol of China’s ambition to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing’s broader “Made in China 2025” plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. The state planemaker sent the C919 narrowbody plane on its maiden flight last year and obtained approval to begin mass production of the ARJ-21 regional jet last July. In February, COMAC said its total order book for the C919 jet was 815 aircraft, while orders for the ARJ21 stood at 453.

2018-06-02,"(Reuters) - As lava continued to pour vigorously from the ground through fissures at the foot of Kilauea Volcano, the month-old eruption on Hawaii’s Big Island has entered a new, seemingly calmer phase inside the summit crater, government scientists said on Friday. But vulcanologists monitoring and measuring Kilauea’s every move during the past four weeks hastened to add the latest change in the volcano’s behaviour, while undoubtedly significant, leaves them uncertain about what will follow. The summit crater, which began ejecting ash and volcanic rock in periodic, daily eruptions in mid-May, has largely fallen quiet since Wednesday, Kyle Anderson, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geophysicist, told reporters in a conference call. The apparent reason, newly revealed in footage recorded by drone aircraft flown over the summit, is that tons of rocky material shaken loose from the inside walls of the crater vent have plugged up the bottom of the void, Anderson said. What happens next is unknown. “It’s possible that new explosions will blast through the rubble at the bottom of the vent, and these may or may not be larger than previous explosions,” he said. “It’s also possible that the vent could become permanently blocked, ending the explosions entirely.” In any case, the volcano’s behaviour ultimately hinges on the ebb and flow of huge rivers of molten rock called magma, the term for lava while it remains underground. The steady collapse of the crater’s inner walls, caused by magma draining out of the summit and oozing downslope under the volcano’s surface, has also greatly enlarged the mouth of the vent, which has grown in size from about 12 acres (4.9 hectares) to 120 acres (48.5 hectares), Anderson said. At the same time, the Kilauea summit itself has sunken, or subsided, by at least 5 feet (1.50 meters) in elevation as the magma level continues to drop, exerting tremendous pressure on seismic faults to create numerous earthquakes, mostly small tremors, in the immediate vicinity.     Although the summit crater of Kilauea has fallen silent for the moment, many of the two dozen volcanic fissures running through populated areas on its eastern flank continued to spout and ooze lava and toxic gases that prompted the evacuation of some 2,500 residents. At least 75 homes — most of them in the hard-hit community of Leilani Estates — have been devoured by streams of red-hot molten rock creeping across the landscape since May 3. Lava flows also have knocked out power and telephone lines in the region, disrupting communications. Another issue has been the occurrence of a phenomenon called Pele’s hair — fine, glass-like fibres of volcanic material produced by fountains of lava and carried aloft by the wind. The filament, named for the mythical goddess of volcanoes, can cause skin, eye and respiratory irritation like fibreglass. Residents have been warned to avoid exposure to Pele’s hair, one of several airborne volcano hazards including emissions of sulphur dioxide gas, wind-blown ash and noxious clouds of laze — a term combining the words “lava” and “haze” — formed when lava reacts with seawater to form a mix of acid fumes, steam and glass-like specks. The latest upheaval of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, comes on the heels of an earlier eruption cycle that began in 1983 and continued almost nonstop for 35 years, destroying 215 dwellings and other structures.

2018-06-02,"SREKOR, Cambodia, June 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Nat Sota worries about the spirits of her ancestors. They have been lying in watery graves since Cambodia’s newest hydroelectric dam flooded her village of Srekor, and with it, the nearby burial ground. “We don’t know whether they can swim or not,” she said, sitting under a wooden house on stilts near the dam’s reservoir. Nat Sota has earthly concerns too. Only the red roof of the village primary school is now visible above the water, and she worries for her two young grandchildren if they are unable to get an education. She is among 62 of the village’s ethnic Kreung, Bunong and Lao minority families who have refused the government’s offer to move them to a newly-built village. Instead they have decamped to a settlement near the reservoir that flooded their homes, and are now stuck in limbo. They say the government’s proposed site to is too far from the Sesan River, where their people have fished for generations, and the cash offer not enough to cover the loss of property and crops. The plight of this community in a remote corner of northern Stung Treng province highlights the human cost of Cambodia’s push to bring power to the entire country. “By 2020, all villages have to have access to the electricity supply,” said Victor Jona, a spokesman for the department of energy at the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The Southeast Asian nation is well on its way, according to World Bank statistics. In 2000, only 16 percent of Cambodians had access to electricity. That increased to 31 percent by 2010, and almost half the population was connected to the grid by 2016. Much of that progress has been driven by dams. Between 2010 and 2014, hydropower’s contribution to the energy mix jumped from 3 to 61 percent, the World Bank said. Cambodia is considering two new dams, both of which would dwarf the Lower Sesan 2 in terms of size and output, as well as the impact on land and fisheries. The government has provided fair compensation to those who had to make way for seven dams built so far, Jona said, citing the Lower Sesan 2 as a “good example.” He noted that most of the 860 families in villages affected by the dam have relocated to new sites, where authorities have built schools and health centres, as well as providing houses and farmland. “Some people are not happy with the compensation,” he conceded. In a letter to provincial authorities, the 62 families holding out in Srekor asked the government to recognise their new settlement as an “indigenous community” with rights to the land. The government should provide cash compensation for their lost homes and crops, they said, and build infrastructure including a well, school and a health centre. The villagers said they stayed in their homes until rising waters forced them to move in December. The reservoir had begun filling up in late September when the Lower Sesan 2 Dam’s floodgates were closed. Underscoring its importance to Cambodia’s power plan, Prime Minister Hun Sen inaugurated the project, dismissing the concerns of “radical environmentalists” in his speech. The dam will be running at full capacity by the end of the year, said Jona, with eight turbines producing a total 400 megawatts (MW) of electricity. The project generated controversy even before its approval in 2012. Many of the 5,000 people in six villages in the reservoir area protested, and environmentalists predicted a devastating impact on fisheries. A 2012 study in the journal ‘Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences’ predicted that the Lower Sesan 2 Dam alone would cause a 9.3 percent drop in fish biomass throughout the Mekong River Basin. The Mekong Basin is “the biggest inland fishery in the world,” said the study. But dams block migration, preventing some fish from reaching areas where they feed and spawn. Villagers in Srekor told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that one species of fish has already disappeared. Two more hydropower projects under consideration would have an even greater impact, according to two different assessments. “The Sambor Dam, proposed by the government of Cambodia, is probably the largest and most destructive dam in the Mekong River Basin,” according to the Natural Heritage Institute, a conservation group that assessed the project for the government. The 2,600 MW dam across the Mekong would be 18 km wide, 33 m (36 yards) high and create a reservoir 82 km long. It would “be devastating for migratory fish stocks”, said the U.S.-based non-profit. Upriver from Sambor, the proposed 978 MW Stung Treng Dam would inundate 21 villages that are home to 10,617 people, according to the Mekong River Commission, which is comprised of the four countries overseeing the river’s development. Jona said the government is now focused on constructing coal-fired power plants, and has not yet decided whether to build more hydroelectric dams. The dams represent an existential question for Cambodia in its quest to electrify: are the benefits worth the costs? In the case of the Lower Sesan 2 Dam, the government answered ‘yes’. “Normally, when we do a project this size, development has to be balanced between environmental and social (concerns),” said Jona. But for some like Kheun Fut, who refused to relocate and instead built a new house on high ground just metres from the reservoir’s edge, the cost of leaving was too high. He guided a motorised canoe through the ghostly remains of his village, stopping to speak with his father who was salvaging the roof of his former home. “I had a big house, but now I’ve lost it,” said 85-year-old Noy Fut, as he pried corrugated metal sheets from the rafters. Kheun Fut used a paddle to push off from the submerged building and headed back to shore, steering between tree tops and past the red and gold roof of the village’s Buddhist pagoda. ""This is development,"" he said, the canoe leaving a murky wake behind him.

2018-06-02,"By Lisandra Paraguassu and Alexandra Alper RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer scrambled to name a new chief executive for state-controlled oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) on Friday, after the surprise resignation of CEO Pedro Parente over fuel pricing policies. Parente’s departure wiped $11 billion (£8.2 billion) off the market value of the company, known as Petrobras, and marked the highest profile casualty so far of a trucker’s strike that virtually paralysed Brazil for nearly two weeks.  Once a beacon of national pride, Petrobras had become engulfed in a damaging corruption scandal and overloaded with debt before turnaround wizard Parente’s arrival as CEO two years ago. His replacement Ivan Monteiro, until Friday Petrobras’ chief financial officer and formerly a top executive at state-controlled bank Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA), will be under pressure to show he can keep cutting debt and pushing investor-friendly policies. Petrobras’ board said it had named Monteiro as interim CEO at a rapidly organised meeting on Friday, and Temer recommended him to take on the job on a longer-term basis later in the day. However, with elections looming, Monteiro’s tenure is likely to end in December when the president leaves office. Shares in Petrobras, Latin America’s biggest oil producer, closed down 15 percent on Friday, wiping some 40 billion reais (£8 billion) from the company’s capitalization. The real currency weakened as much as 1 percent against the dollar. Petrobras bonds also fell, as Moody’s called Parente’s resignation credit negative for the company. Temer sought to reassure markets as he announced his recommendation of Monteiro. “We will maintain the economic policy that took the company out of the red in the last two years and made it once again one of the most respected in Brazil and abroad,” he said. “There will be no interference at all in the company’s pricing policy.” Parente arrived at a Friday morning meeting with Temer with his resignation letter already in hand, a company source and a person close to the government said. In it, Parente said he was leaving because he would “not be an obstacle” to new pricing policies that might be necessary to shield Brazilian consumers from volatility in world oil prices. During 2010-13, the company posted about $40 billion in refining losses due to unprofitable fuel prices, imposed by the then-government, according to Moody’s. A key plank of Parente’s turnaround campaign for the company and a condition for his taking the top job in 2016 was freedom to control fuel prices. He sought to align those more closely with international markets through nearly daily price adjustments. But on Sunday Temer, governing with rock-bottom approval ratings, announced plans to placate striking truck drivers - protesting the high cost of diesel - by freezing fuel prices on a monthly basis and taking other measures to bring domestic diesel prices down. Late on Friday, Brazil’s Mines and Energy Ministry said it wanted to create a pricing mechanism that would protect consumers without impacting the policies of Petrobras and other energy companies. Although Temer promised the government would compensate Petrobras for losses incurred by its intervention on fuel prices, Sunday’s move crossed Parente’s red line against political meddling, sources said. One source close to Parente said the 65-year-old had stepped down because he had “reached his limit” with government interference.  Another source close to Temer said the president was surprised by the resignation and had not sought to push the CEO out.  Parente’s departure comes days before Brazil hopes to attract foreign oil companies to bid on oil fields in its coveted “presalt” exploration areas and leaves in limbo several of his key priorities, including selling major refineries. Also unresolved is a long-running dispute with the government over an oil-rich offshore area, which could represent a windfall for Petrobras if a deal is reached.  Parente’s policies had helped pushed Petrobras shares to a multiyear peak just last month, but a rise in international oil prices triggered anger at Brazilian gas stations and led to calls from politicians and unions for the executive to go. The company risks becoming a political football in October’s presidential election, with far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro’s key economic adviser calling for its privatisation, while leftist Ciro Gomes has warned investors to avoid state energy sector assets because he would expropriate them. While investors and oil industry insiders bemoaned Parente’s departure, others rejoiced.  “Parente was the most responsible for the crisis that Brazil has faced with the trucker strike,” the truckers lobby said in a statement. “Nothing justifies the abusive diesel prices put in place by the company in the last few months.”  Petrobras oil workers, who walked off the job earlier week in part to demand Parente’s dismissal, also celebrated.  “You don’t deserve to walk through the doors of Petrobras again,” said Jose Maria Rangel, leader of FUP, Brazil’s largest oil workers union, in a video message. Parente’s market-friendly policies had ultimately made him the scapegoat of the truckers strike and its fallout, said Roberto Castello Branco, a former Petrobras board member. “The pressure on him was enormous,” he said.  “For the country, for the company, a great source of uncertainty has opened that is very dangerous,” he added.
