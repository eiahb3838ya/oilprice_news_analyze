2018-03-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump gave a warm welcome to Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday and credited U.S. defence sales to the Saudis with boosting American jobs, even as Riyadh’s involvement in Yemen’s civil war faced criticism. In the Oval Office, Trump and the crown prince praised the strength of U.S.-Saudi ties, which had grown strained under the Obama administration in part over differing views towards Riyadh’s regional rival, Iran. Not so with Trump, who has taken a hardline view against Iran similar to that of the Saudi crown prince who has compared Iran’s supreme leader to Adolf Hitler. The talks were part of the first visit by the prince to the United States since he became the heir apparent last year to King Salman. Trump’s red-carpet treatment highlighted his administration’s strong backing of the crown prince, who carried out an anti-corruption purge that consolidated his power and whose aggressive foreign policy has caused unease among some Western allies. At the same time, the kingdom has seen a cautious new climate of social freedoms with the rise of the 32-year-old crown prince after decades of elderly rulers. Trump and Prince Mohammed discussed an agreement last year for $200 billion worth of Saudi investments with the United States, including large purchases of U.S. military equipment. Trump said the military sales contributed to the creation of 40,000 American jobs.  Trump held up charts to show the depth of Saudi purchases of U.S. military hardware, ranging from ships to missile defence to planes and fighting vehicles. “Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they’re going to give the United States some of that wealth, hopefully, in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” he told reporters. The crown prince, who is also the defence minister, is on a public relations blitz while travelling in the United States, with stops in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston to cultivate investments.     As they talked, U.S. senators debated a resolution seeking an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s campaign in Yemen’s civil war, in which about 10,000 people have been killed. Some members of Congress have been critical of the Saudi involvement, particularly over the humanitarian situation and civilian casualties. The Senate rejected the resolution.  A Saudi-led coalition, with logistical and intelligence support from Washington, is fighting to counter the influence of Iran, an ally of the Houthi militia, which denies any help from Tehran and says it is fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and Gulf powers in thrall to the West. A senior Trump administration official said the two leaders talked about the humanitarian situation in Yemen and that civilian casualties “did not come up in a major way,” given that Washington had been working with the Saudis to minimize them. They also discussed nuclear cooperation. Riyadh has been stepping up plans to develop a civilian nuclear energy capability as part of a plan to reduce its dependence on oil. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the chamber’s Foreign Relations Committee, said senators questioned the crown prince closely about Yemen during a meeting with him on Tuesday.  The Saudi embassy said the prince discussed with members “countering the threat posed by Iran and the Iran-backed Houthi militias” as well as Saudi “efforts to address and alleviate the humanitarian situation in Yemen.” Prince Mohammed capped his rapid rise to power last June by replacing his elder cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who had  close relationships with U.S. intelligence and defence circles, as crown prince. He is likely to rule for many decades if he succeeds his father. Trump praised the king’s move to elevate Mohammed and called U.S.-Saudi ties strong as ever. “I thought your father made a very wise decision. And I miss your father - a special man,” he said. King Salman is to visit the United States later this year. Although the prince has won Western plaudits for seeking to ease Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil, tackle chronic corruption and reform the conservative Sunni Muslim kingdom, the severity and secrecy of his anti-corruption crackdown last November unnerved some in the West. The crown prince, in a rare foray into speaking English, said on Tuesday the Saudi pledge for $200 billion in investments would end up at $400 billion when fully implemented. He said a 10-year window for implementing the deal was under way. A key focus of his visit will be any information on a potentially lucrative listing of up to 5 percent of Saudi oil firm Aramco. The New York Stock Exchange is among the possible venues for the listing. Also high on the agenda in the White House talks was confronting Iran, a country Trump has repeatedly criticized for its expansionist policies in the Middle East.  Saudi Arabia on Monday called the Iran nuclear deal a “flawed agreement,” and Trump has made clear he plans to exit the agreement unless changes are made to it. “But Iran has not been treating that part of the world or the world itself appropriately,” he said. “The deal is coming up in one month and we’ll see what happens.” The prince was also due to have dinner with Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, along with Jason Greenblatt, the two point men in the Trump administration overseeing Middle East peace efforts. Crown Prince Mohammed and Kushner have forged a close relationship, which has at times come under criticism in Washington for circumventing normal diplomatic channels.

2018-03-20,"NEW YORK, March 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A campus in Hawaii is joining a handful of U.S. colleges and universities aiming to use 100 percent renewable energy, it said on Tuesday, part of a growing nationwide trend of schools going green. The move by the University of Hawaii campus on Maui island is forward-looking and makes economic sense given the cost of fuel on the remote Pacific archipelago of islands and atolls, said Michael Unebasmi, a university spokesman. With plans to replace oil-based electricity from a utility with solar panels, Maui College joins a handful of U.S. schools such as Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts and the University of New Hampshire’s main Durham campus. The decision puts Maui College “at the leading edge,” Unebasmi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We thought by doing this it would be a great example,” he said. The network of solar panels will fuel the needs of the 78-acre (32 hectares) grounds by 2019, he said. With a reliance on fossil fuels, Hawaii has particularly high energy prices of more than twice the national average, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. The push by U.S. schools moving away from polluting sources of electricity has picked up pace, said Bronte Payne at the Denver-based non-profit Environment America. About half a dozen colleges and universities have announced commitments over the last two years to use renewable energy sources rather than planet-warming fossil fuel, she told the Foundation. Largest among them are Boston University, Colorado State University and Cornell University, she said. More than 500 other colleges and universities are aiming for carbon neutrality, offsetting the use of fossil fuel with renewable energy or so-called carbon credits from low-level producers of greenhouse gases. “They will set an example for communities across the country,” she said. Cornell, in western New York state, aims to replace its on-campus natural gas power plant with a mix of solar and enhanced geothermal energy by 2035, said Sarah Zemanick, director of its campus sustainability office. The main campus in Ithaca, with some 22,000 students, stretches across 745 acres (301 hectares). “We’re at the scale of a small city, so it’s a good place for us not only to discover solutions that might work but also try them on our own campus,” she told the Foundation.

2018-03-20,"(Adds details on influence of Lobao and Braga over Eletrobras privatization, response from representatives) By Rodrigo Viga Gaier and Luciano Costa RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO, March 20 (Reuters) - The expected resignation of Brazil’s Energy Minister Fernando Coelho Filho in April to run for a governorship or congressional seat is damaging efforts to privatize state-controlled power holding company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, two sources close to the matter said on Tuesday. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said it had become clear that veteran Senator Edison Lobao, a former energy minister, had regained his political grip on the energy sector. Another senator and former energy minister, Eduardo Braga, has also risen as a powerful force in determining who becomes the next minister. Lobao and Braga, both members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), are against any privatization. The government hopes to raise 12.2 billion reais ($3.68 billion) by privatizing Eletrobras, but the project faces open resistance in Congress. According to the sources, should either Lobao or Braga succeed in appointing one of their choices to head the ministry, it could completely scuttle the privatization, as the appointee would have similar anti-privatization leanings. Representatives for Braga denied the senator was moving to influence the appointment of the next energy minister. Representatives for Lobao did not immediately respond to requests for comment. $1 = 3.31 reais

2018-03-20,"(Adds detail of Higgins’ career; adds background on PREPA’s struggles) By Nick Brown NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s bankrupt power authority, PREPA, has appointed Walter Higgins as its new chief executive officer, the utility said on Tuesday, on the six-month anniversary of Hurricane Maria’s destruction of the island’s power grid. Higgins was CEO of Bermuda-based Ascendant Group Ltd from 2012 to 2016, and has 40 years of experience in energy industry management roles, PREPA said in a statement. He will succeed interim Executive Director Justo Gonzalez. Maria struck Puerto Rico in September as its most destructive storm in 90 years, cutting electricity to all 3.4 million of the U.S. territory’s residents. Six months later, tens of thousands remain in the dark. The storm proved the downfall of ex-CEO Ricardo Ramos, who resigned in November after a U.S. congressional committee launched a probe into PREPA’s awarding of a no-bid, $300 million repair contract to tiny, Montana-based Whitefish Energy Holdings. Governor Ricardo Rossello later canceled the contract, then, in January, announced plans to privatize PREPA over the next 18 months. The utility was crippled even before Maria and in bankruptcy to shed some $9 billion in debt. Its weak infrastructure, which not been modernized in years, was no match for Maria’s 155-mile-per-hour winds. Higgins inherits an entity long beset by frequent management turnover and a staff that shrank from more than 8,600 people in 2012 to around 6,000 last year, a reflection of Puerto Rico’s broader population exodus as it battles a protracted recession. As it works to recover from Maria, Puerto Rico is also working its way through the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with $120 billion in bond and pension debt, including PREPA’s debt. Reinventing PREPA as a nimbler, partly privately-run company, and shedding its debt, is a key piece of that process. Higgins, a former U.S. naval officer, has held management roles at Sierra Pacific Resources, Atlanta Gas Light Company and Portland General Electric Company, among others, PREPA said in Tuesday’s statement. At Ascendant, whose BELCO subsidiary served as the sole power utility in Bermuda, Higgins navigated three hurricanes and led an initiative to restructure electricity rates on the island, the statement said. “We have a real opportunity here, not just to restore power but to eventually deliver lower-cost, reliable power for all the citizens of Puerto Rico,” Higgins said in the statement. Ernesto Sgroi Hernandez, who chairs PREPA’s governing board, called Higgins “a distinguished leader and industry visionary.” Reporting by Nick Brown

2018-03-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday killed a resolution seeking an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s campaign in Yemen’s civil war, the same day President Donald Trump was due to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. The Senate voted 55-44 to dismiss the resolution, which sought for the first time to take advantage of a provision in the 1973 War Powers Act that allows any senator to introduce a resolution on whether to withdraw U.S. armed forces from a conflict not authorized by Congress. During Senate debate before the vote, some backers called the three-year-long conflict in Yemen a “humanitarian catastrophe,” which they blamed on the Saudis. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders noted the deaths of thousands of civilians, displacement of millions, famine and potentially the largest cholera outbreak in history because of the conflict. “That is what is going on in Yemen today as a result of the Saudi-led war there,” Sanders said. Senator Mike Lee, a Republican backer of the resolution, stressed that it had been in the works for some time, and was not timed “in any way, shape or form” to coincide with the Saudi crown prince’s visit. “Saudi Arabia is an indispensable partner in the region, without which the United States would be less successful,” Lee said. The vote was largely along party lines, although a handful of Democrats voted with the majority Republicans to kill the measure, and a handful of Republicans supported the failed effort to let it move ahead.

2018-03-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday auctioned off more than 51,000 acres (21,000 hectares) in southeastern Utah for oil and gas development, a sign of strong industry demand in a region conservationists have vowed to protect. The Utah lease sale included terrain near the former boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument, whose size was scaled back by the Trump administration last year, as well as the Hovenweep and Canyons of the Ancients monuments, according to the bureau. Results of the online auction, posted on Tuesday afternoon, showed that all 43 parcels up for sale received winning bids, which averaged $28.68 per acre and ranged between $2 and $93 per acre. Total proceeds from the auction were $1.56 million, according to the BLM. “This means drilling in these parcels poses a more serious and immediate threat to the landscape and archaeological resources,” Aaron Weiss, media director for the Center for Western Priorities, said about the apparent strong demand. The Monticello area received some of the highest bids, with Context Energy LLC bidding $145,600 for a 1,600-acre parcel, according to the BLM. Other bidders included Ayers Energy LLC, Wasatch Energy LLC and Kirkwood Oil and Gas Inc, according to the data. The auction comes as the administration of President Donald Trump seeks to boost domestic energy production by expanding federal leasing and rolling back land protections. Local officials have been eager to open up the areas, administered by the BLM, saying resource extraction is one of few economic opportunities for rural San Juan county, one of Utah’s poorest areas. “Oil and gas operations are an important contributor to a diversified county economy and the county supports leasing as a necessary step toward realizing economic benefits,” county planner Nick Sanberg said in comments to the BLM. But conservation groups fumed, threatening lawsuits. “We won’t sit idly by while President Trump and Interior Secretary (Ryan) Zinke auction off America’s cultural and public lands heritage to the oil and gas industry,” said Stephen Bloch, legal director with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. The alliance argued that the BLM did not adequately study potential impacts on wilderness and cultural sites.  Southeastern Utah’s dramatic landscapes are rich in Native American artifacts, historical sites and dinosaur fossils. A 360 acre-parcel near Bears Ears received a winning bid of $28 per acre, while 13 parcels near the nearby Hovenweep monument sold at an average of $29 per acre. A bid of $7 per acre won a 965-acre parcel next to Canyons of the Ancients National Monument. The results were more competitive than those of a lease sale last week in which a 200-acre parcel near the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument sold for the minimum $2 per acre.    Zinke this month deferred or scaled back two other lease sales near archaeological and tourist sites in New Mexico and his home state of Montana amid local outcry and opposition from state lawmakers.   The BLM was not immediately available for comment but said it would post results of the sale, including names of winning bidders, by Wednesday morning. Other recent lease sales have yielded relatively low bids, a reflection of soft demand for federal property as the oil and gas industry taps vast reserves on private lands.

2018-03-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue signaled on Tuesday that the Trump administration was backing off efforts to make major changes to the nation’s biofuels program and may leave it to lawmakers to settle the divisive issue instead. The White House spent the last few weeks trying to negotiate a heated dispute between the corn and oil industries, key constituencies for President Donald Trump, over the future of the Renewable Fuel Program - a regulation that requires refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s fuel. The RFS has created a lucrative market for Midwest corn farmers, but refiners who must prove compliance by earning or purchasing blending credits say it is too costly. Perdue said he and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt sent the White House a list of options, but it was unclear if Trump would ultimately implement changes to the RFS on the executive level, as has been widely expected, or whether it would instead leave reforms to Congress. “The White House is trying to determine whether they need to make a call on a decision, or allow Congress to do it,” Perdue said.  Perdue’s comments marked the first time the administration has signaled a willingness to let lawmakers take control, said Stephen Brown, a lobbyist for refinery Andeavor, which has supported the legislative pathway. “A handful of merchant refiners have continued to agitate for any relief, even regulatory that could prove to be fleeting,” Brown said. “They are so removed from where the rest of the refining sector as to be considered essentially irrelevant at this point.”  Perdue did say the Trump administration can make the nation’s biofuel laws more affordable for oil refiners without putting a cap on prices for the tradable credits at the center of the program. “We’re hoping that we can resolve it where we will not see RINs capped,” Perdue said, referring to the name of the credits. He said he instead favored expanding high ethanol blend gasoline sales year round, something he said “would increase the RIN availability, guiding RIN prices down.” Perdue made the comments during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. A video of the speech was provided to Reuters. Reports that the Trump administration was backing off its plans to enforce changes to the program caused ethanol credit prices to rise by 3 cents, coming off a one-year low of 38 cents earlier in the day, traders said. The prices have plummeted by 40 percent in recent weeks amid political uncertainty in Washington. The efforts by the White House have drawn sharp criticism from ethanol producers and corn-state lawmakers, who say Trump pledged to preserve the RFS on the campaign trail. The Republican president has expressed support in the past for capping RIN prices in exchange for allowing sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline all year round. The Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a group of merchant refiners, said it remained optimistic that Trump would eventually reach a compromise that contained credit costs.  “Those who make money off of RINs – a windfall never intended when the program was established – obviously see it differently but haven’t exactly been in the relevant meetings,” the coalition said in a statement.

2018-03-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed to their highest level in three weeks on Tuesday as tension in the Middle East and the possibility of further falls in Venezuelan output helped offset the impact of growing U.S. crude production. Brent crude futures for May delivery rose $1.37 to $67.42 a barrel, a 2.07 percent gain. The global benchmark rose to $67.88 during the session, its highest level since late February.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for April delivery rose $1.34 to settle at $63.40 a barrel, a 2.2 percent gain. WTI traded between $62.08 and $63.81. The more active May U.S. crude futures rose $1.41 to settle at $63.54 a barrel. Prices extended gains in post-settlement trading after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories.  Stocks fell 2.7 million barrels in the week ended March 16 to 425.3 million barrels, according to the API, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.6 million barrels. Government inventory data is due on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT). [EIA/S] Geopolitical risks were top of mind on Tuesday. Saudi Arabia called the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers a “flawed agreement” on Monday, on the eve of a meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has threatened to withdraw the United States from the accord between Tehran and six world powers, raising the prospect of new sanctions that could hurt Iran’s oil industry. “There’s an expectation that (Trump and Prince Mohammed) are going to take a harder line on Iran, and that’s bringing prices up,” said Phil Flynn, a senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Worries about falling production in Venezuela, whose output has been halved since 2005 to below 2 million barrels per day (bpd) due to the country’s economic crisis, also supported oil markets. The International Energy Agency said last week Venezuela was “vulnerable to an accelerated decline” and that the Latin American country could trigger a renewed drawdown in stocks. However, increased output in the United States, Canada and Brazil has capped oil price gains. U.S. crude oil production has risen more than a fifth since mid-2016, to 10.38 million bpd. The ramped-up production threatens to undermine cuts made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in an effort to draw down a global supply glut.  Appetite for U.S. crude is adding to the headache facing OPEC. A widening discount of WTI to Brent crude makes it more attractive for foreign refiners to process U.S. oil. Brent is the benchmark for several Middle East and other global crudes. The premium of Brent crude to WTI rose above $4 a barrel on Tuesday. Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 2.1 percent on Tuesday to settle at $1.9659 a gallon, the highest level since August 2017. Data from market intelligence firm Genscape showed gasoline inventories in the New York Harbor region fell by about 1.1 million barrels last week, traders who saw the data said.  Heating oil futures rose 2.2 percent to finish at $1.9495 a gallon, their highest settle since late February.

2018-03-20,"NEW YORK, 2018 - A rise in oil prices to three-week highs helped lift equity markets worldwide on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar jumped ahead of a meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers, who are expected to go ahead with the first of at least three U.S. rate hikes this year. U.S. technology stocks lagged broader markets, continuing a sell-off sparked by reports of large-scale misuse of Facebook user data. Facebook Inc (FB.O) shares lost 2.5 percent, continuing a slide that took nearly 7 percent off their price on Monday. While stocks on Wall Street climbed, Facebook’s drop kept the gains in check. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 116.36 points, or 0.47 percent, to 24,727.27, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 4.02 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,716.94 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC rose 20.06 points, or 0.27 percnet, to 7,364.30. There were other tech-related problems, as well. An accident with an Uber test car UBER.UL on Monday that resulted in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle also weighed on Silicon Valley sentiment.  Shares in European chipmakers faced pressure, while Germany’s SAP (SAPG.DE) declined 0.5 percent, hit by a knock-on effect from U.S. business software peer Oracle, whose quarterly revenue missed analysts’ estimates.  “There certainly are some stocks where valuations look somewhat stretched... so we’re focusing our exposure within the technology sector on the cheaper end of the market,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.     “We’re a bit more cautious on the more expensive and some of the more popular names in the sector,” he added. The U.S. dollar climbed to a one-week high against the Japanese yen as traders limbered up for the start of a two-day Fed Reserve meeting. With a quarter-point hike - its sixth since the Fed began raising interest rates in late 2015 - baked into market prices, major currencies were largely moving in ranges. “Euro/dollar is being buffeted by cross currents, especially as both central banks (Fed and the ECB) are normalizing policy, but it needs an unexpected policy action to jolt markets,” said Neil Jones, Mizuho’s London head of currency hedge fund sales. Markets expect at least two more U.S. rate hikes after Wednesday this year, although analysts acknowledged that the central bank’s ‘dot plot’ could potentially point to as many as four. The Fed bets kept long-term U.S. bond yields edging higher, with short-dated yields up too. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was up at almost 2.89 percent US10YT=RR, 6 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago. Two-year notes US2YT=RR hit a 9-1/2-year high of 2.33 percent. Among major commodities, oil prices jumped in line with the dollar as investors remained wary of growing crude supply, although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support. [O/R] U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 2.24 percent to $63.52 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $67.37, up 2 percent. The potential for a trade war cast a shadow over export currencies after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum. The government is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday. U.S. businesses were alarmed, with several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), on Monday urging Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China. The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.74 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.75 percent to $1.2241. The Japanese yen weakened 0.42 percent versus the greenback to 106.54 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was at $1.3996, down 0.19 percent on the day.

2018-03-20,"(Adds U.S. official on emergency food, medical aid; U.N. estimate of people fleeing Venezuela) By Lesley Wroughton WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - The United States will provide $2.5 million in food and medical aid to Venezuelans fleeing their economically-crippled country to neighboring Colombia and is poised to help other countries if the situation worsens, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. It is the first funding by the U.S. government’s main aid agency to help Venezuela’s neighbors deal with the influx of hundreds of thousands of people trying to escape hunger and poverty in Venezuela. The move signals Washington is seeking to boost its involvement in the fallout from Venezuela’s crisis following several rounds of financial sanctions that have effectively blocked President Nicolas Maduro’s ability to borrow money abroad. Mark Green, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID, said in a statement that the assistance will go to Venezuelan migrants and the Colombian communities hosting them. OPEC-member Venezuela has fallen on hard times under Maduro and more Venezuelans are leaving as an economic meltdown worsens and opposition hopes of fair elections fade. “Regrettably, this crisis in Venezuela, which is now spilling into the broader region, is man-made - the result of continued political mismanagement and corruption by the Maduro regime,” Green said. Colombia has borne the brunt of the exodus of Venezuelans. The number of Venezuelans living within its borders jumped by 62 percent in the second half of last year to more than 550,000. The crisis has posed major challenges for governments in the region, who also worry that assistance to Venezuelans could increase the number of people leaving their country. Another U.S. official cited U.N. data showing more than 1.5 million Venezuelans have been displaced by the crisis. The USAID money was for the most vulnerable and was not meant to be a long-term measure, the official told Reuters. In a joint statement, Representative Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the top Republican on the committee, said the funding was a “welcome start” but urged other countries to also step up. They also urged the Trump administration to give food and medicine to Venezuelans inside their own country. The U.S. official, however, said the Maduro government had refused direct assistance. U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat, called for a donor conference to coordinate assistance for Venezuelans.

2018-03-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran has defused all regional threats against the country, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday, as tension rises between Tehran and Washington over the influence of the Islamic Republic in the Middle East. In an Iranian New Year message, Khamenei did not specify any particular threat. But he appeared to be mainly referring to the Islamic State militant group, which Iranian forces have confronted in Syria and Iraq as well as at home. Shi’ite Iran has also been locked in a regional power struggle with Sunni Saudi Arabia which has extended to the war in Yemen and to Lebanon. “Last year, the Islamic Republic defused regional threats - one of their aims was to harm the Islamic Republic,” Khamenei said in a broadcast on state television. “These threats did not damage our country, but turned into opportunities.” In November, Tehran declared the end of Islamic State and hailed the Iranian soldiers killed fighting against it in Syria and Iraq. Iran has provided critical military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, helping his army regain swathes of land from rebels and militants in recent months. “Our humble soldiers and tireless diplomats were able to stand with the people of Iraq, Syria and Lebanon to establish stability and increase security for the region,” President Hassan Rouhani said in his New Year message.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who sees Iran as a threat to  stability in the Middle East, has pledged to work with Gulf Arab states and Israel to curb what they say are Tehran’s attempts to extend its influence in the region. Trump sent greetings on Monday to Iranians celebrating the New Year’s holiday, known as Nowruz, but used the message to attack Iran’s government, particularly its powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Trump has threatened to pull the United States out of the 2015 agreement between world powers and Tehran which limited Iran’s nuclear programmes in return for a lifting of sanctions. Trump said in his Nowruz message that Tehran had spent more than $16 billion to prop up Syria’s government and support militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Many Iranians, however, resent the foreign interventions and want their leaders to create more jobs at home, where youth unemployment stood at 25 per cent this year. Anti-government protests swept the country in December, with young working-class demonstrators asking for jobs and calling for more freedom. The unrest resulted in 25 deaths and nearly 5,000 people reportedly were arrested. Khamenei said on Tuesday the protests were “the enemies’ plot against Iran” and were promptly defused. Rouhani, who is under pressure for his economic record, took a softer stance against protesters. “The people said that criticising and protesting is the right of the people. But the wise people of Iran will not accept lawlessness, will not accept violence,” Rouhani said in his New Year message.

2018-03-20,"LONDON, March 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Water stress is increasingly driving migration around the world, but efforts to adapt to worsening shortages could help, a new U.N. study suggests. Water stress - not just shortages, but water-quality issues - is expected to drive more people from their communities permanently and cause rapid growth of cities, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Two-thirds of the world’s people suffer some water scarcity for part of each year, with communities dependent on agriculture worst affected, said FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva in a video message for the 8th World Water Forum in Brazil. Finding ways to adapt to that reality - rather than simply responding to disasters caused by water shortages - is the most effective way to deal with the problem, the FAO said. Water use has increased six-fold worldwide over the past century, said the study, which drew on a survey of more than 180 research papers on water scarcity and migration issues. As climate change brings increasingly irregular rainfall, worsening droughts and higher temperatures, water scarcity will likely increase, particularly as demand for agricultural water remains high, the study said. Investment in preparing for water crises - such as adopting more water-smart agricultural practices - could cut the need for people to migrate, the study said, although drawing a clear link between water scarcity and migration remains complicated. Experts believe drought played a role in the early stages of the Syrian conflict when 1.5 million farmers headed to cities as the country suffered its worst drought on record, said Charles Iceland of the World Resources Institute, a research body. Drought was clearly not the major factor, he said, but instead exerted an additional pressure alongside political and social issues. He said much of the world would face water scarcity by 2040 as populations and temperatures rise. Combating that would require changes including in agriculture, such as adopting water-saving drip irrigation, he said. About 70 percent of freshwater used each year goes to agriculture, experts have estimated. Reporting by Nicole Hoey, Editing by Robert Carmichael. Please

2018-03-20,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization is set for a cacophonous meeting on Friday when the United States, China and the European Union will be among those airing grievances about each other’s trade policies, an agenda for the meeting showed on Tuesday. The WTO’s Council for Trade in Goods listed 15 potential trade conflicts on an unusually full agenda, including three apiece aimed at the United States and China.  Earlier on Tuesday, India hosted an informal WTO meeting of nearly 50 countries in New Delhi, where they warned about the serious threat to the WTO from unilateral trade actions, a pointed reference to steel and aluminium tariffs imposed by the United States that have caused a global outcry. The Council’s agenda showed China and Russia had both proposed a debate on U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial tariffs, as well as U.S. policies on imports of fish and seafood.  China has also requested discussion of U.S. “safeguard” tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, which Trump signed into law in January. Japan plans to raise concerns about China’s new export control law, and — together with the United States — about a recent decree on the auto industry in Vietnam.  The United States wants a discussion of China’s restrictions on imports of scrap materials. China said last year it would refuse to import many types of waste paper and plastic as part of a campaign against “foreign garbage”. The United States also wants to discuss the African Union’s new import levy, while Malaysia, a major palm oil producer, will raise the EU’s energy directive, which it described in January as “crop apartheid”.  Several other agenda items were issues that have been raised at least once before, including Russian trade restrictions, India’s duties on computer and IT products, and China’s duties on integrated circuits.  The items for debate do not amount to trade disputes, but they serve as a warning shot and give disgruntled countries a chance to show the strength of feeling about particular policies. There was no detail on the agenda, which simply listed the trade concerns that would be debated.

2018-03-20,"(Refiles story without changes to add subscriber code.) By David Randall NEW YORK, March 20, 2018 - Rising oil prices helped lift equity markets worldwide on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar jumped ahead of a meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers, who are expected to go ahead with the first of at least three U.S. rate hikes this year. U.S. technology stocks lagged broader markets, continuing a selloff sparked by reports of large-scale misuse of Facebook user data. Shares of Facebook Inc dipped nearly 5 percent in morning trading, continuing a slide that took nearly 7 percent off its share price on Monday. While stocks on Wall Street climbed, Facebook’s drop kept the gains in check. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 165.58 points, or 0.67 percent, to 24,776.49, the S&P 500 gained 5.78 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,718.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.67 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,357.91. There were other tech-related problems, too. An accident involving an Uber test car on Monday which resulted in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle weighed on Silicon Valley sentiment. Shares in European chipmakers also faced pressure, while Germany’s SAP declined 0.5 percent, hit by a knock-on effect from U.S. business software peer Oracle, whose quarterly revenue missed analysts’ estimates. “There certainly are some stocks where valuations look somewhat stretched ... so we’re focusing our exposure within the technology sector on the cheaper end of the market,” Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. “We’re a bit more cautious on the more expensive and some of the more popular names in the sector,” Bell added. The U.S. dollar climbed to a one-week high against the Japanese yen as traders limbered up for the start of a two-day Fed Reserve meeting. With a quarter-point hike - its sixth since the Fed began raising interest rates in late 2015 - baked into market prices, major currencies were largely moving in ranges. “Euro/dollar is being buffeted by cross currents, especially as both central banks (Fed and the ECB) are normalizing policy but it needs an unexpected policy action to jolt markets,” said Neil Jones, Mizuho’s London head of currency hedge fund sales. Markets expect at least two more U.S. rate hikes after Wednesday for the rest of the year, although analysts acknowledged that the central bank’s ‘dot plot’ could potentially point to as many as four. The Fed bets kept long-term U.S. bond yields nudging higher with short-dated yields up too. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was up at almost 2.89 percent, 6 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago. Two-year notes hit a 9 1/2-year high of 2.33 percent. Among the major commodities, oil prices jumped in line with the dollar as investors remained wary of growing crude supply although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support. U.S. crude rose 2.43 percent to $63.57 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.55, up 2.27 percent. The potential for a trade war cast a shadow over export currencies after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum. The government is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday. U.S. businesses were alarmed, with several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc and Target Corp , on Monday urging Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.48 percent, with the euro down 0.41 percent to $1.2283. The Japanese yen weakened 0.30 percent versus the greenback to 106.41 per dollar, while sterling was at $1.4012, down 0.08 percent on the day.

2018-03-20,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Washington has rejected European Union proposals for an alternative to U.S. safeguard tariffs imposed on solar power goods, the two trading powers said in a joint World Trade Organization filing on Tuesday. The 30 percent tariff on solar panels was among the first unilateral trade restrictions imposed by the Trump administration as part of a broader protectionist agenda aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers. Safeguard tariffs are a form of emergency trade protection, permitted under WTO rules if a country is facing a sudden, damaging surge in imports of a particular product.  But they come with strings attached: the United States is supposed to compensate major solar power-exporting countries by offering them improved trade in other areas, or accept them putting up barriers to U.S. exports to balance things out. The EU, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia all demanded compensation after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the tariffs into law in January. At an EU-U.S. meeting on Feb. 15, the EU said its exports were not causing serious damage to U.S. competitors, due to the volume of trade and higher prices, the WTO filing said.   “Thus, it suggested a form of measure that would be less penalizing for European Union imports such as a quota allocated by country or a minimum import price. The United States did not agree with this,” the WTO filing said. “In addition, there was no agreement on the form of compensation,” though both sides agreed to monitor developments and continue discussions. In a separate document, the United States and Taiwan said that if there was no agreement between them, Taiwan could introduce compensatory measures in February 2022.

Legal sources said the facility searched in Austria was BMW’s engine plant in Steyr, where the company employs about 4,500 staff and assembles 6,000 engines a day. “There is an early suspicion that BMW has used a test bench-related defeat device,” prosecutors said in a written statement. Rival German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to using “defeat device” software in the United States to cheat diesel engine emissions tests, plunging the company into the biggest business crisis in its 100 year history.  Since then, emissions irregularities have surfaced at several major carmakers, although none has proved as serious as at Volkswagen.  BMW, in a separate statement, said prosecutors were looking into “erroneously allocated” software in about 11,400 vehicles of the BMW 750d and BMW M550d luxury models. Having long denied its cars are equipped with software designed to game emissions tests, BMW said the findings did not reveal a “targeted manipulation” of emissions cleaning. BMW last month recalled 11,700 cars to fix engine management software after discovering the wrong programming had been installed.

2018-03-20,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - The automotive industry is waking up too late to the fact that China will hold most of the world’s supply of cobalt, a key metal for electric vehicle (EV) batteries, Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said on Tuesday. “If cobalt falls into the hands of the Chinese, yeah you won’t see EVs being produced in Europe etc. They are waking up too late ... I think it’s because the car industry has never had a supply chain problem before,” Glasenberg told the FT Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne, Switzerland. Glasenberg said he was nevertheless prepared to sell cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo to China if the price was good. He added that the company was not changing its production plans in the DRC. More than 60 percent of global cobalt production comes from the DRC. Glencore, the world’s biggest producer, agreed last week to sell a third of its output to China’s GEM. GEM and its subsidiaries will buy 13,800 tonnes of cobalt from Glencore this year, 18,000 tonnes next year and 21,000 tonnes in 2020. The Swiss-based miner is expected to produce about 39,000 tonnes this year or about 35 percent of the global total, estimated at 110,000 tonnes by analysts. A byproduct of copper and nickel smelting, cobalt extends the life of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which automakers typically guarantee for eight to 10 years. Expectations of supply shortages have fuelled a rally that has taken prices to around $39 (£27.8) a lb, from near $10 a lb in January 2016 and to their highest since July 2008, before the financial crisis started. Reuters reported last year that Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) had agreed a deal late in 2016 to buy large amounts of cobalt from Glencore. CATL’s listing prospectus published last year names Glencore as a top-five supplier.

2018-03-20,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Tuesday they had searched Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) headquarters as part of a new investigation into whether the carmaker had overstated the fuel efficiency of more vehicles than previously disclosed.   The news is the latest setback in the German company’s efforts to move on from a 2015 scandal in which it admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines.  Prosecutors from the city of Braunschweig searched 13 offices at Volkswagen’s (VW) headquarters in nearby Wolfsburg at the start of March, seizing documents and computer files that will now be reviewed, a spokesman for the prosecutor’s office said, confirming a report by German magazine WirtschaftsWoche. They were checking a statement issued by VW on Dec. 9, 2015 -  about three months after its “dieselgate” scandal broke in the United States - over suspicions its contents were incorrect In that statement, VW said its own investigations found it had understated fuel consumption, and hence carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, on no more than 36,000 vehicles. That was much lower than its preliminary estimate of around 800,000 diesel and gasoline vehicles produced five weeks earlier, which caused VW to warn it could face a 2 billion euro ($2.5 billion) hit to profits from the disclosure.  VW also said in its December 2015 statement that it had found no evidence of unlawful alterations to CO2 emissions data. Prosecutors said on Tuesday they were investigating unknown individuals over suspicions of market manipulation.  VW, Europe’s biggest carmaker, confirmed the searches, but declined further comment.  At 1410 GMT, its shares were little changed at 160.35 euros. Separately, Braunschweig prosecutors are investigating VW’s former CEO Martin Winterkorn, former finance chief and current chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, and current VW brand CEO Herbert Diess over possible market manipulations related to the dieselgate scandal. VW has denied any market manipulations. Manfred Doess, head of legal affairs at VW’s majority stakeholder Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE), said on Tuesday he did not expect the latest inquiry to lead authorities to press charges against VW. “In my judgement, nothing will come out of this,” Doess said at the holding firm’s earnings press conference. Since its dieselgate scandal, VW has launched a multibillion-dollar investment in electric vehicles and mobility services as part of an attempt to rebuild its image.

2018-03-20,"* World stocks hold steady ahead of Fed’s policy review * Tech comes under pressure after Facebook data woes * Europe’s STOXX 600, Wall Street both inch higher * Concerns over U.S. protectionism undermines sentiment By Kit Rees LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - A worldwide selloff of internet stocks caused by reports of industrial-scale misuse of Facebook data began to ease on Tuesday, while the dollar was flying ahead of what is expected to be the first of at least three U.S. rate hikes this year. Wall Street opened almost flat with Facebook inching down 0.3 percent after its near 7 percent drop on Monday while the rest of the so-called FANGs — Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet — all nudged modestly higher. Europe’s tech stocks were also back to level pegging after an early 0.3 percent dip, on the ripple effect of the reports that Facebook had allowed improper access to some 50 million of its users data. There were other tech problems too. An accident involving an Uber test car on Monday which resulted in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle further weighed on Silicon Valley sentiment. Shares in European chipmakers had also faced pressure, while Germany’s SAP declined 0.5 percent, hit by a knock-on effect from U.S. business software peer Oracle, whose quarterly revenue missed analysts’ estimates. “There certainly are some stocks where valuations look somewhat stretched ... so we’re focusing our exposure within the technology sector on the cheaper end of the market,” Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. “We’re a bit more cautious on the more expensive and some of the more popular names in the sector,” Bell added. The currency market was focused on other things namely the dollar as it climbed to a one-week high against the Japanese yen as traders limbered up for the start of a two-day Fed Reserve meeting. With a quarter point hike — its sixth since the Fed began raising interest rates in late 2015 — baked into market prices, major currencies were largely moving in ranges though. “Euro/dollar is being buffeted by cross currents, especially as both central banks (Fed and the ECB) are normalizing policy but it needs an unexpected policy action to jolt markets,” said Neil Jones, Mizuho’s London head of currency hedge fund sales. Markets expect at least two more rate hikes after Wednesday for the remainder of the year, although analysts acknowledged that the central bank’s ‘dot plot’ could potentially points to as many as four. Along with some expectations of a more confident sounding Fed, a sharp drop in a confidence survey among German investors also weighed on the euro which was down 0.5 percent and buying $1.227. The ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors dropped to 5.1, its lowest reading in a year and a half, from 17.8 in the previous month. The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll was for 13.0. In addition, the potential for a trade war cast a shadow over export currencies after U.S. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum. The Trump administration is also expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, two officials briefed on the matter said Monday. U.S. businesses were alarmed with several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc and Target Corp , on Monday urging Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China. Back in Europe, the UK’s FTSE 100 index slightly outperformed the broader European market, up 0.4 percent, as investors cheered a transition deal reached between Britain and the European Union on Monday. The British pound just below $1.40 and 1.14 euro again having had a bumper day on Monday. The Fed bets kept long-term U.S. bond yields nudging higher with short-dated yields up too. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was up at almost 2.89 percent, 6 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago. Two-year notes hit a 9 1/2-year high of 2.33 percent. Analysts are betting the Fed will bump up its policy interest rates to 1.50-1.75 percent from the current 1.25-1.50 percent. The dollar was also higher against the yen at 106.46 per dollar, with Japanese traders also wary of any new developments in a cronyism scandal that has eroded support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Among the major commodities, oil prices jumped in line with the dollar and as investors remained wary of growing crude supply although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support. Brent crude futures traded at $67.21 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were $63.20a barrel. Reporting by Kit Rees and Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo

2018-03-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tehran denied on Tuesday allegations made by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Iran was harbouring Osama bin Laden’s son and supporting him as the new leader of al Qaeda.   Decades-old animosity between Sunni Muslim kingdom of Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Shi’ite Iran has deepened in recent years as the two sides wage proxy wars in the Middle East and beyond, including in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Iran’s murky and fluid relationship with al Qaeda has contributed to tensions with Riyadh, which previously accused Tehran of backing al Qaeda and sheltering its members. Prince Mohammed told CBS in an interview that Iran was protecting al Qaeda operatives, including some of bin Laden’s relatives.    “This includes the son of Osama bin Laden, the new leader of al Qaeda. He lives in Iran and works out of Iran. He is supported by Iran,” he said. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi called crown prince’s comments a “big lie”. Hamza bin Laden was one of several bin Ladens who ended up in Iran after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001. Documents recovered from his father’s compound in Pakistan after he was killed in a U.S. raid in 2011 said Hamza was, at least for a period, held under house arrest Iran. His current whereabouts are not known. Since Osama bin Laden’s death, al Qaeda has been led by his former deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Nonetheless Hamza has issued a number of messages on behalf of the network in recent years, threatening further violence against the West. The group has been sidelined significantly by its rival and foe, the militant organisation Islamic State.   Iran’s Qasemi said that after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan began in 2001, some al Qaeda fighters had crossed into Iran illegally, but that they had been arrested and extradited to their countries of origin. These included bin Laden family members with Saudi citizenship. “Bin Laden’s daughter was extradited to the Saudi embassy in Tehran,” Qasemi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. “Upon consultation with Saudi Arabia, other members of Bin Laden family were deported through the same border they had illegally entered Iran,” he added. Shi’ite Muslim Iran and strict Sunni militant group al Qaeda are natural enemies on either side of the Muslim world’s great sectarian divide. Yet intelligence veterans say that Iran, in pursuing its own ends, has in the past taken advantage of al Qaeda fighters’ need to shelter or pass through its territory. In Sunday’s interview Prince Mohammed also accused Iran of having recruited some of the Saudis who took part in the 9/11 attacks on New York, with the aim of creating a “schism between the Middle East and the West, between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America.” Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-iran-alqaeda/iran-denies-saudi-allegations-of-harbouring-bin-ladens-son-idUKL8N1R22UB,20 Mar 2018,"Tehran denied on Tuesday

2018-03-20,"SINGAPORE, March 20 (Reuters) - Goldilocks Investment Co, a leading shareholder of Noble Group Ltd, has filed a lawsuit with the Singapore High Court against the commodities trader and some of its former and current senior executives, alleging the company inflated its assets. “We have filed it today,” said Daniel Chia, a Morgan Lewis Stamford lawyer, who is representing Goldilocks. An external spokeswoman for Noble declined to comment. The move comes days after Noble said it would not make the redemption payment for its $379 million bonds which matured on Tuesday as it seeks a debt restructuring. Noble’s debt restructuring deal has been opposed by some bondholders and shareholders such as Goldilocks Investment, an Abu Dhabi Financial Group equity fund. The fund was not immediately available for comment. Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its books. Noble has stood by its accounting. Noble said last week it had finalised the restructuring deal with a group of senior creditors holding 46 percent of its debt, and is in talks with others, as it races to launch the deal - crucial to its survival.

2018-03-20,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is looking at ways to boost production at Skoda, including building a new factory outside the brand’s Czech home, to help it keep up with booming demand, company sources said.  Best known for its low-priced cars, Skoda moved last year into the fast-growing market for sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) with the new Kodiaq and Karoq models, and plans to launch another 19 models by 2020.  But attempts to increase capacity at its main Czech plant in Mlada Boleslav, where it builds more than half a million cars a year, are in limbo because the Kovo union opposes extending the work-week to Saturday, two Volkswagen (VW) group sources said.  Skoda has offered to create 3,000 jobs in the Czech Republic if labor leaders agree to additional shifts at the two automaking plants, a move management says could boost output at Mlada Boleslav alone by 83,000 cars a year.  “Additional capacity is absolutely essential to be able to meet continually growing demand,” Skoda said in an emailed statement. “The company has been producing at full capacity for some time.” Once the butt of jokes in the West, Skoda has blossomed under nearly 30 years of VW ownership to become one of its profit drivers, even beating luxury brand Audi’s (NSUG.DE) and BMW’s (BMWG.DE) operating margins last year, thanks to its cheap labor and to VW’s cost-saving modular production platforms. Growing demand in Europe and China has helped Skoda’s sales to jump nearly a third over the past five years to a record 1.2 million cars in 2017. Sources said Skoda could miss out on about 360,000 car sales by 2020 if capacity is left unchanged. Production of Skoda models has been expanded in recent years in markets including China, India and Russia. VW and Skoda are aiming to find solutions by the summer, the sources said, to help the brand with its goal to expand foreign sales to 120 countries, from about 100, by 2025. Deliberations include searching for under-used capacity within the VW group, as well as investing in a new facility outside the Czech Republic where production could be shared with other VW brands, the sources said. “Of course we are always pleased if brands like Skoda develop very positively. But that also affects other brands where we have bottlenecks,” VW group chief executive Matthias Mueller told Reuters TV last week when asked how he wanted to solve capacity constraints at Skoda. “Our platform strategy thankfully gives us a chance to also react at short notice, meaning within a few weeks or months,” he said, referring to the group’s strategy of maximizing the number of parts used in common across brand and model lines. Last year, labor leaders at the group’s VW brand pushed for some Skoda production to be shifted from the Czech Republic to help offset declining output at German sites, fuelling concerns among some Czech workers and politicians. It remains unclear where Skoda models could be built. The VW brand’s main Wolfsburg plant in Germany is grappling with falling demand for its top-selling Golf hatchback, but utilization has improved at a fellow German plant in Emden, which has been awarded production of another model and so sees no room to build Skodas before 2020, a VW source said. Audi says capacity is tight at its main Ingolstadt plant in Germany, where some models are based on the MQB platform shared by Skoda. VW’s Spanish brand Seat is also operating near full capacity at Martorell after the new Arona SUV was added to assembly lines, and the brand has swapped production of the higher-volume Audi Q3 for the Audi A1 to ease workload at the factory. But in the wake of the group’s costly diesel emissions scandal, it is likely to want to tap any under-used capacity across the business ahead of building a new factory.  VW finance chief Frank Witter last week reaffirmed the group’s goal to cut both capital spending and R&D costs to 6 percent of sales by 2020, from 6.4 percent and 6.7 percent respectively. “I have said all along that ... 2017, 2018 and 2019 will be a dog fight, and I haven’t changed my view,” Witter, also Skoda’s chairman, said on an earnings call. At Skoda, management are determined not to lose momentum. “We are intensively pushing forward Skoda,” CEO Bernhard Maier said at the Geneva auto show this month. “We are motivated from head to toe to continue along this path.” Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Reuters TV; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-skoda-production/vw-looking-at-ways-to-boost-skoda-output-including-new-plant-sources-idUKL8N1R01PN,20 Mar 2018,"* Skoda could forgo 360,000 cars by 2020 if no

2018-03-20,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Glencore is buying Rio Tinto’s Hail Creek coal mine and the Valeria coal project in Australia for $1.7 billion, tightening the Swiss trading and mining giant’s grip on coal as its rivals exit the industry. The acquisition, announced by both companies on Tuesday, follows Glencore’s purchase of half of Rio Tinto’s Hunter Valley coal operations, also in Australia, for $1.1 billion last year in a deal with China’s Yancoal Australia Ltd. Glencore is already the world’s biggest exporter of thermal coal used for power stations, and Hail Creek will give it a bigger stake in metallurgical coal used for steelmaking. “You’ve got one of the few big companies, in Glencore, that is both willing and able and clearly likes coal strategically and has been acquiring these assets,” said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein in London. The sale consists of Rio’s 82 percent interest in the Hail Creek operating mine and its 71.2 percent interest in the Valeria project, the company said in a statement. Rio Tinto made a strategic decision in 2017 to exit coal and focus on growth in iron ore, copper and its aluminum division. On Tuesday it said it was still looking to sell its remaining Australian coal assets - the Kestrel coking coal mine and the Winchester South development project. Investors had expected the two mines and projects to be sold as a package.  “The best option to extract value for our shareholders is to go in a piecemeal approach,” Rio Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques told reporters after a business event in Melbourne. Analysts said the price for Hail Creek and Valeria looked good for Rio Tinto while not too expensive for Glencore. “Given we all expected a $2 billion to $2.5 billion number for Hail Creek plus Kestrel and the other stuff, it’s a pretty big number,” said Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O’Connor in Sydney. Rio’s London-listed shares rose 0.7 percent, while Glencore’s were flat. Gait said that he was bullish on metallurgical coal prices, now above $200 a ton, which would help justify the price Glencore agreed to pay. “Glencore clearly have synergies in terms of both the operating and, physically, the marketing of these assets and when I look at the price that they’ve acquired these things for, it doesn’t seem to me to be exorbitant,” he said. Rio Tinto said it planned to use the sale proceeds “for general corporate purposes”, however Jacques did not rule out returning the cash to shareholders in future. “You shouldn’t draw any conclusions. The next time we review it will be in August,” he told reporters, referring to the company’s next moves on capital management. UBS has forecast that the sale of Hail Creek and Kestrel could help Rio hand back more than $9 billion to shareholders over the next 12 months. The Hail Creek deal is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018, Rio said. The remaining 18 percent of Hail Creek is owned by units of Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, Marubeni Corp and Sumitomo Corp, which all have rights to sell their stakes to Glencore, which it said in a statement would cost up to $340 million. Glencore declined to comment further on the acquisition. Nippon Steel declined to comment on its intentions. Marubeni and Sumitomo had no immediate comment. Bidders in the running for Kestrel include private equity firm EMR Capital with Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, Australia’s Whitehaven Coal and a consortium led by Apollo Global Management, Reuters reported earlier this month.

2018-03-20,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Trading giant Trafigura has moved its commodities hedging operations to the United States and Asia and away from Europe to avoid being subject to new, tighter MiFID II market regulations. “We moved our hedging business away from Europe into the U.S. and Singapore and other locations,” Chief Financial Officer Christophe Salmon told reporters. Trafigura was one of the main critics of Europe’s MiFID II regulations, saying it would drive business away from the continent as it was introducing unnecessary complications to operations. MiFID II introduced position limits on contracts such as Brent oil or refined products but many traders have long argued that they hold large positions in paper markets to hedge risks in the physical market rather than for purely speculative purposes. Trafigura trades around 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and refined products, roughly on par with rival Glencore (GLEN.L) but behind the world’s largest oil trading house, Vitol. “You don’t want to diversify for the sake of it. You have to be in the top 3 in any commodity you trade. It is extremely important to maintain scale,” Chief Executive Jeremy Weir told the same briefing. Weir said Trafigura has been actively aggregating volumes from U.S. independent producers for exports to capitalise on its infrastructure amid a boom in U.S. shale oil. He said Trafigura has been the largest U.S. crude and condensate exporter over the past year. Weir and Trafigura’s co-head of market risk, Ben Luckock, both said the company was bullish on oil in the medium-term due to a shortage of new projects. “Peak demand is a long, long way away in the future. Shale oil is not a panacea for global oil production,” Weir said. Luckock said: “(U.S. oil basin of) Permian cannot be the only solution to world oil supply while demand is growing by 1.7 million bpd. In the U.S. oil industry, it should be a marathon but people are running it at a sprint pace. They are doing an amazing job but growth is tiring in the Permian.” Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Jason Neely",https://uk.reuters.com/article/trafigura-trading/trafigura-moves-hedging-out-of-europe-leads-u-s-oil-exports-race-idUKL8N1R2261,20 Mar 2018,"Trading giant

2018-03-20,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s top independent oil refiner is buying ethanol and two others are seeking government approval to blend the biofuel into their gasoline ahead of the country’s 2020 deadline to add it to the nation’s fuel supply, several sources told Reuters. China mandated last September that gasoline supplies should contain 10 percent ethanol, an alcohol typically produced from corn, in a blend known as E10. The push by the private refiners is the first sign of preparations to prepare for the roll-out of the new standard in the world’s biggest automotive market. The country’s top independent refiner Dongming Petrochemical Group, based in Heze in the eastern province of Shandong, has received permits from the Ministry of Commerce to begin E10 blending, said three company sources familiar with the matter. Shandong Wonfull Petrochemical Group, based in the city of Zibo in Shandong province, have applied to the Commerce Ministry for a licence to blend ethanol into their fuel for sale to gasoline stations or on the wholesale market, said two sources at the company familiar with the matter.  Henan Fengli Petrochemical Co, a refiner based in Puyang in Henan province, has also applied with the ministry for a blending permit, said a source based with company.  It is not clear when the two companies will receive their approvals. Dongming Petrochemical plans to start importing ethanol through its trading arm Pacific Commerce Pte to supply to its refinery as well as sell on the market, one of the company sources said. It is also considering building its own ethanol plant, he said, but did not give any further details. Meanwhile, Wonfull has installed blending equipment at its refinery, according to the two company sources, who declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media. They did not disclose further details about the plan. “If the government strictly enforces mandatory rules nationwide, (gas stations) will need to sell blended fuel,” one of the Wonfull sources said. The company has signed a preliminary deal with Chinaoil, China National Petroleum Corp’s trading unit, to buy imported ethanol, he said. A fourth independent refinery, Shandong Haike, is conducting research on the E10 market and may apply for a permit if they think it is promising, a company source said. Henan Fengli, Shandong Wonfull and Haike could not be reached for official comment. The Commerce Ministry and Chinaoil did not respond to requests for a comment. Dongming was not immediately available for comment. Importing ethanol could raise the costs of the teapot’s foray into the E10 market since China raised the tariff on ethanol to 30 percent in 2017. While China is the world’s third-largest ethanol producer, with output of about 2.1 million tonnes a year, it is far below the top two producers, Brazil and the United States.  The government aims to double output by 2020 to 4 million tonnes. Some independents have approached state-run agricultural processor and top ethanol producer COFCO about buying ethanol, a source at the company said. “The teapots are an enormous market for us,” he said. “We are looking to lift our production in northern provinces to meet their demand.”  COFCO did not respond to request for comment.

2018-03-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Essar Oil has picked Trafigura and BP to lend it $1 billion (£712.66 million) to be repaid with cargoes of refined products as the Indian refiner’s new owners seek to diversify the firm’s financing base, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Russian oil major Rosneft, fund UCP and Swiss commodities trader Trafigura bought Essar Oil’s large refinery, 3,500 fuel stations and infrastructure for $12.9 billion last year. Essar Oil has long relied entirely on funding from Indian banks while the new shareholders want to reduce exchange costs by adding alternative financing sources and directly use dollars to buy its oil instead.  Late last year, the refiner began talks with traders to raise cash in exchange for refined products such as gasoline and gasoil delivered over three to four years. It would be the refiner’s first major multi-year prepayment. The sources said that Trafigura and BP were jointly working to structure and then syndicate the loan with banks in the next few weeks.  BP and Trafigura declined to comment, while Essar was not immediately available. Existing and possible new U.S. sanctions will complicate discussions, banking sources said. Kremlin-owned Rosneft has been under U.S. sanctions since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the refiner also runs significant oil volumes coming from Iran and Venezuela. While the international oil embargo on Iran was lifted in early 2016, U.S. restrictions on dollar use in connection to Iran remain. President Donald Trump has also repeatedly criticised the nuclear pact with Tehran and threatened to stop extending U.S. sanctions relief. Trump’s nomination of Iran hawk Mike Pompeo as the new secretary of state has fuelled fears of an end to sanctions relief. The United States has also considered oil sanctions on Venezuela.

2018-03-20,"KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The price of carbon credits must rise drastically if they are to help protect Southeast Asia’s tropical forests against rubber plantation expansion, according to researchers. Individuals, companies and countries purchase carbon credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. Putting a cost on carbon emissions provides an incentive to do business more sustainably, and a disincentive to engage in environmentally damaging activities - like clearing forests. But researchers found that credits bought and sold on international markets would need to rise from $5-$13 per tonne of carbon dioxide to $30-$51 per tonne if they are to safeguard Southeast Asian forests from rubber. At current prices, carbon credits cannot compete with the profits to be made from felling forests and developing rubber plantations, according to the report published this month in the journal Nature Communications. “We looked at rubber as an economic driver of deforestation,” said Eleanor Warren-Thomas, the lead researcher who was at Britain’s University of East Anglia when she worked on the study. “What kind of profits can you make from rubber plantations, and what kind incentive (to preserve forests) do you need to provide through carbon finance?” Such a large study has not been done before, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Most forest conservation efforts in the region tend to focus on palm oil expansion, and the growth of rubber plantations has received little attention, said Warren-Thomas. Rubber demand rose over the last 20 years, as emerging markets like China and India became wealthier and more people were able to buy cars and motorcycles. Rubber plantations cover about 11 million hectares around the world, two-thirds of which are in Southeast Asia, while annual expansion rates roughly doubled between 2003-2013, said Warren-Thomas. Converting forests to rubber plantations results in net carbon emissions, as the carbon stored in the cut-down trees is released into the atmosphere - but that is not widely recognised in the industry, the researchers said. “Rubber is (from) trees, and so it looks like you’ve replaced one kind of forest with another,” said Tom Evans, an Oxford-based conservation director at the Wildlife Conservation Society, which was involved in the report. “But really you’ve replaced a high carbon system that provides a lot of other ecosystems services with a much lower carbon ecosystem.” Zero-deforestation pledges made by governments and large tyre companies, as well as the enforcement of forest protection laws, are crucial to curb rubber expansion, the report said. Besides higher carbon credit prices, it also recommended further development of synthetic alternatives to natural rubber and improvements in recycling of natural rubber. The researchers focused on forests in Cambodia, but those in China, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam are also under threat from rubber, Warren-Thomas said.

2018-03-20,"* THAWorld stocks hold steady ahead of Fed’s policy review * Tech comes under pressure after Facebook data woes * Europe’s STOXX 600 dips * Concerns over U.S. protectionism undermines sentiment By Kit Rees LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Global equities trod water on Tuesday ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting, while investors reassessed their views of tech stocks following a slump in Facebook’s shares after reports of data misuse. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat in percentage terms by 0901 GMT, while the pan-European STOXX 600 equity index slipped 0.1 percent. Tech stocks underperformed in Europe as the sector fell 0.3 percent, taking its cue from Monday’s falls for U.S. peers on the back of fears of stiffer regulation as Facebook came under fire following reports it allowed improper access to user data. Shares in European chipmakers in particular came under pressure, with ams, STMicroelectronics and ASML all in negative territory, while Germany’s SAP declined 0.5 percent, hit by readacross from U.S. business software peer Oracle Corp, whose quarterly revenue missed analysts’ estimates. In the U.S., Facebook tumbled 6.8 percent on Monday as the social media colossus faced demands for action from U.S. and European lawmakers following reports that a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump’s election campaign may have improperly gained improper access to data on 50 million Facebook users. Likewise an accident involving an Uber Technologies Inc car on Monday which resulted in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle further weighed on sentiment around tech. “There certainly are some stocks where valuations look somewhat stretched ... so we’re focusing our exposure within the technology sector on the cheaper end of the market,” Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. “We’re a bit more cautious on the more expensive and some of the more popular names in the sector,” Bell added. Though tech was a weight, Asian shares recovered to end in positive territory thanks to a rise in health stocks. The UK’s FTSE 100 index slightly outperformed the broader European market, up 0.1 percent, as investors cheered a transition deal reached between Britain and the European Union on Monday. The British pound was last at $1.4055. However, gains were muted as investors braced for new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first policy meeting starting later in the day and amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose additional protectionist trade measures. “Investors lightened their positions ahead of the Fed’s policy meeting. The markets are completely split on whether the Fed will project three rate hikes this year or four,” said Hiroaki Mino, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities. In addition, worries about the potential for a trade war cast a shadow after U.S. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium. The Trump administration is also expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, two officials briefed on the matter said Monday. U.S. businesses were alarmed with several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc and Target Corp , on Monday urging Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China. While long-term U.S. bond yields were muted, short-dated yields rose ahead of an expected rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 2.857 percent, 10 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago. But the yield on two-year notes hit a 9 1/2-year high of 2.32 percent on Monday as the Fed appears set to bump up its policy interest rates to 1.50-1.75 percent from the current 1.25-1.50 percent. Still, with a Fed rate rise already fully priced in, the dollar barely gained from the prospect of a rate hike. The euro moderated gains, rising to $1.2341 after bouncing on Monday following a Reuters report that European Central Bank officials were shifting their debate from bond purchases to the expected path of interest rates. The yen was little changed at 106.37 per dollar, with traders wary of any new developments in a cronyism scandal that has eroded support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Oil prices edged slightly higher as investors remained wary of growing crude supply although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support.

2018-03-20,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai anti-corruption agency is investigating the suspected misappropriation of up to 85 percent of money from a state fund for the poor in a new scandal to hit the military government, which has promised to clean up graft. The Office of Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) said on Tuesday it had found evidence of irregularities amounting to about 100 million baht ($3.2 million). “We have found that there are corrupt practices involving money destined for low-income people which the state allocates every year,” Korntip Daroj, secretary-general of the Office of Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC), told Reuters. “We have investigated and found corruption-related instances and evidence in about 49 out of 76 provinces.” The funds, which are given directly to those deemed in need in grants of up to 3,000 baht ($100), are disbursed through the Social Development and Human Security Ministry. Reuters was unable to reach officials at the ministry for comment. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads the junta that seized power in 2014, said he had ordered the dismissal of all those involved in misappropriating funds and called for an investigation by the ministry. Prayuth told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had always been stringent about corruption. “I don’t want you to think that it has become worse,” he said.  The latest investigation comes as Prayuth’s deputy, Prawit Wongsuwan, is under investigation for failing to declare among his assets a collection of luxury watches. That has partly fueled recent protests calling for an end to military rule, with elections set for February 2019 after repeated delays. The junta took power in the name of ridding Thailand of corruption as well as ending a decade-long political deadlock between rival factions, but government critics say it has failed to tackle a culture of impunity for the rich and powerful. Thailand ranked 96 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruptions Perceptions Index 2017, a slight improvement from 2016. Korntip said the fraud over the fund for the poor was allegedly committed by faking copies of national identification cards. It was later found that money never reached the intended recipients, he said.

2018-03-20,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services company John Wood Group Plc (WG.L), which bought smaller rival Amec Foster Wheeler last year, on Tuesday forecast a modest growth in core profit for 2018 after reporting an 11.1 percent fall in full-year earnings. Wood Group, which saw muted demand for its services over the last couple of years after oil producers cut budgets amid weak prices, said it expects early stage recovery in some areas of its core oil & gas market and cost synergies to boost its earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) in 2018.  However, the company’s 2017 EBITA fell to $598 million from $673 million a year earlier on a pro forma basis, hurt by cost overruns on some non-oil and gas contracts.   Revenue also fell 12 percent to $9.9 billion on a pro forma basis. Wood Group said its annualised cost savings from the Amec deal was ahead of plan with more than $40 million delivered to date. The company added it was confident of meeting its target of at least $170 million savings in three years from deal completion. British oil services companies, including Wood Group, Amec and Petrofac (PFC.L), have faced issues after UK’s Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal probe last July into Monaco-based Unaoil in connection with suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering.  Wood Group said its internal investigation confirmed that a legacy Wood Group joint venture made payments to Unaoil under agency agreements, and added the company was working with Scotland’s Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the SFO. The company said it was also co-operating with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Department of Justice on their ongoing investigations into Amec related to Unaoil.

The retreat came as investors braced for new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first policy meeting starting later in the day and amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose additional punitive trade measures against China. “U.S. tech indexes, including Nasdaq and Philadelphia semi-conductor index all hit record highs last week. So they were prone to profit-taking,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities. “Shares will be capped by various uncertainties for now.

2018-03-20,"KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Reuters) - U.S. engineering and construction company McDermott International plans to bid for $5 billion in contracts in the next few months in Asia Pacific as the region’s offshore oil and gas sector recovers, company executives said on Tuesday. The value of contracts available for bids are up from $4 billion six months ago, the McDermott executives said. “We have seen a 15-20 percent increase in the number of projects that we can bid in the region,” Mahesh Swaminathan, senior commercial director of McDermott Asia Pacific, told reporters on the sidelines of the OTC Asia conference. “This is why we say that there are already some green shoots and we hope that they continue to grow,” he said, referring to a recovery in the offshore exploration and development sector. Global oil prices that have held steadily above $60 a barrel and sharp cost cuts in the upstream sector are encouraging companies to pump money into exploration and production, although many producers remain wary that the U.S. shale oil and gas boom could keep prices lower for longer. McDermott plans to place 20 bids for projects in Malaysia, India, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Myanmar, the executives said, without specifying which projects. McDermott also hopes to close a deal to merge with Chicago Bridge &  Iron Co (CB&I) in May, said Ian Prescott, vice president of Asia at McDermott.

The filing is the latest salvo in the SEC’s lawsuit accusing the defendants of waiting too long to write down the coal assets, enabling the big Anglo-Australian mining company to raise about $5.5 billion from U.S. investors. “Defendants violated multiple provisions of the federal securities laws by engaging in a prolonged fraudulent course of conduct,” the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.   Accordingly, the defendants’ motion to dismiss the charges should be denied, it said. The defendants are Rio Tinto, former Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott. In an emailed comment, a Melbourne-based Rio Tinto spokesman said: “Rio Tinto believes that the SEC case is unwarranted and that, when all the facts are considered by the court, or if necessary by a jury, the SEC’s claims will be rejected.” Rio Tinto had acquired the coal assets in a 2011 takeover of Riversdale Mining and later renamed Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique for about $3.7 billion. It wrote off most of the assets in January 2013 and sold them in late 2014 for just $50 million. On March 5, the defendants said the SEC was “plainly wrong” to say they should have taken a big writedown no later than 11 months after the purchase. They said rising prices for “scarce” coking coal offset lower barging and rail capacity, and might have even boosted the assets’ value at that time.   The SEC said that the defendants were wrong to argue that it was too soon to book an impairment on Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM). “Rio Tinto was required to assess impairment at every reporting period,” it said. The defendants have until March 26 to respond, court records show. The case is being overseen by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan. On March 2, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission brought its own civil court action against Rio Tinto, Albanese and Elliott over the coal assets.

2018-03-20,"(Corrects spelling of Utqiagvik in eighth paragraph) By Yereth Rosen ANCHORAGE, Alaska, March 19 (Reuters) - The warmest winter on record in Arctic Alaska has hit local oil production, said officials from the U.S. state, as temperatures hampered industrial machinery designed to optimize output when conditions are most frigid. Production of the North Slope grade of crude oil has averaged about 518,000 barrels per day (bpd) through the current fiscal year, down from the approximately 533,000 bpd predicted last fall, state Revenue Commissioner Sheldon Fisher told state lawmakers on Monday. Warmer temperatures are largely to blame for that drop, Fisher said. “Overall the weather has been warmer in this winter,” Fisher told the state Senate’s finance committee. “We actually do better when the winter is colder. The equipment operates better and they’re able to accomplish more with colder weather.” Temperature-related declines in production were most pronounced at the giant Prudhoe Bay field, which is particularly sensitive to temperature changes, Dan Stickel, chief economist for the state’s Department of Revenue, told the committee. This winter’s warmth on the North Slope has shattered records, which has continued through this month, said Rick Thoman, climate science and services manager for the National Weather Service in Alaska. At Deadhorse, the camp community at Prudhoe Bay, the average December-to-February temperature was minus-0.1 degree Fahrenheit (minus-17.8 Celsius), 14.6 degrees warmer than the 1981-2010 average, he said. At Utqiagvik, also known as Barrow, December-January temperatures were 13.5 degrees warmer than the 1981-2010 average. Cold conditions have long been better for North Slope production, said Cathy Foerster, a member of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. “The facilities up there are designed to operate at their maximum when it’s cold,” she said, noting that production is highest in the coldest months and lowest in summer. Among the temperature-sensitive facilities are those handling natural gas, which is cycled through the fields to enhance oil recovery, she said. North Slope oil production is expected to recover somewhat in the next three months, bringing the fiscal 2018 average to 521,800 barrels per day, according to the state officials’ forecast, which is produced semiannually. Production in the coming fiscal year is expected to average 526,000 barrels per day, then decline gradually to 493,000 barrels per day by fiscal 2027. The gradual nature of the decline is an improvement from past years when North Slope output fell much more sharply, Fisher told lawmakers. North Slope production peaked in 1988 at over 2 million barrels per day. The decline has been at the heart of a long-term fiscal problem for the oil-dependent state government, which faces a budget deficit of over $2 billion this year.

2018-03-20,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will waive income tax for three years for foreign investors trading the country’s new crude futures contract, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday, in a bid to attract overseas capital for the much anticipated launch. The start of trading on Monday will mark the culmination of a years-long push by China to create Asia’s first oil futures benchmark, and is aimed at giving the world’s biggest oil importer more clout in pricing crude sold to Asia. It will potentially give the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will operate the new contract, a share of the trillions of dollars each year in oil futures trading. The finance ministry said foreign brokers will be exempted from paying income tax on commissions they earn from dealing in the new Shanghai crude futures. The tax exemption could help encourage foreign players to engage with the new contract, despite concerns about issues such as foreign exchange conversion and potential capital curbs. The number of foreign investors seeking to open non-resident accounts to allow trading has so far been below expectations, a source at CITIC, one of eight banks that is handling margin deposits for foreign investors, told Reuters. The source declined to be named as he is not authorited to talk with media. The oil market is closely watching the liquidity of the contract, as institutional investors and brokers expect trading volumes and open interest to be relatively small compared with China’s iron ore, copper and steel futures contracts. China in recent days has provided more details on the contract, including margins, trading limits and transaction fees, and has approved the use of six bonded storage warehouses.

2018-03-20," (This story corrects name in paragraph 11 to North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation, not U.S. Commission for Environmental Cooperation in March 15 story.) By Roslan Khasawneh and Jane Chung SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s move to shut coal-fired generators to control air pollution at the same time as nuclear reactors are going into scheduled maintenance is resulting in surging fuel oil imports, as utilities burn the dirty feedstock to meet power demand. South Korea’s trade ministry said in February it would suspend five coal-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.32 gigawatts (GW), from March to June, part of a broad campaign to reduce pollution. That plan may backfire, at least in the short-term. A cold winter has raised power and heating demand, forcing utilities to burn more fuel oil in order to meet demand. “Both from a pollution reduction and cost reduction perspective, it does not make sense to burn fuel oil,” said Bikal Pokharel, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie.  While carbon emissions from fuel oil are just around 10 percent less than coal, the operating cost of fuel oil is almost three times than that of coal, Pokharel said, while liquefied natural gas (LNG)-fired plants emit half the carbon compared to coal but cost almost twice as much to operate at current fuel prices.  A by-product of the crude oil refining process, fuel oil’s biggest use ahead of power generation is as a shipping fuel. “In the near-term, fuel oil imports will increase to make up for the shortfall in coal-fired generation capacity,” said Pat Markey, managing director of consultancy Sierra Vista Resources. Fuel oil imports by power producers into Asia’s fourth-largest economy have jumped to 200,000 tonnes in March so far, up from 92,000 tonnes in February, tender data compiled by Reuters showed. [FUEL/TENDA]      First-quarter fuel oil imports are expected at 417,000 tonnes, up 28 percent from a year ago and already more than 60 percent of the 660,000 tonnes taken for all of last year.  Burning fuel oil for power results in lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal-fired plants, but releases more toxic particles into the air.  “Pollutants generated during combustion of fuel oils are nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, greenhouse gases, volatile compounds (like unburned hydrocarbons) and toxic trace metals,” according to the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation. An official from a South Korean state-owned utility, said the increased fuel oil demand was partly a result of the government’s decision to halt coal-fired plants temporarily due to pollution and reduced nuclear power because of planned maintenance.  The official, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media, said some 110,000 tonnes of fuel oil would be needed in April.  Only two of South Korea’s major utilities, Korea East-West Power Co Ltd (EWP) and Korea Western Power Co (WP), issue tenders for fuel oil for power generation, mostly during peak summer and winter demand, data on Thomson Reuters Eikon shows.  The two utilities declined to comment.  Coal power generates about 40 percent of South Korea’s total electricity needs, nuclear around 30 percent, and natural gas meets 20 percent. The rest comes from oil and renewables.  Even with the increase in fuel oil purchases, South Korea will have to raise imports of other fuels to meet demand as nearly half of its nuclear power plants are down for maintenance.  LNG is the most likely fuel to fill the gaps. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows South Korea’s LNG shipments reached nearly 12 million tonnes between January and March 14, up 1.5 percent from the first quarter of last year.

The retreat came as investors braced for new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first policy meeting starting later in the day and amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose additional protectionist trade measures. “U.S. tech indexes, including Nasdaq and Philadelphia semi-conductor index all hit record highs last week. So they were prone to profit-taking,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities. “Shares will be capped by various uncertainties for now. Once those uncertainties are cleared, investors will shift their focus back to relatively attractive valuations,” he added. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.0 percent. On Wall Street the S&P 500 lost 1.42 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 1.84 percent, both suffering their worst day in five weeks. “Investors lightened their positions ahead of the Fed’s policy meeting. The markets are completely split on whether the Fed will project three rate hikes this year or four,” said Hiroaki Mino, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities. Facebook led the losses, tumbling 6.8 percent as the social media colossus faced demands from U.S. and European lawmakers to explain how a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump’s election campaign gained improper access to data on 50 million Facebook users. In addition, worries about the potential for a trade war cast a shadow after U.S. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium. The Trump administration is also expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, two officials briefed on the matter said Monday. U.S. businesses were alarmed with several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc and Target Corp , on Monday urging Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China. The sharp fall in share prices put a lid on long-term U.S. bond yields while short-dated yields rose ahead of an expected rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 2.857 percent, 10 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago. But the yield on two-year notes hit a 9 1/2-year high of 2.32 percent on Monday as the Fed appears set to bump up its policy interest rates to 1.50-1.75 percent from the current 1.25-1.50 percent. Still, with a Fed rate rise already fully priced in, the dollar barely gained from the prospect of a rate hike. Instead it was the euro that stole the spotlight after Reuters reported that European Central Bank officials were shifting their debate from bond purchases to the expected path of interest rates. The euro rose to $1.2345, bouncing back from $1.2258 hit the previous day. The British pound hit one-month high of $1.4088 after Britain and the European Union agreed to a 21-month post-Brexit transition period and a potential solution to avoid a “hard border” for Northern Ireland. It was last at $1.4037. The yen was little changed at 106.01 per dollar, with traders wary of any new developments in a cronyism scandal that has eroded support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

2018-03-20,"* Oil traders concerned U.S. may re-impose sanctions on Iran * Falling Venezuela output also supports oil markets * Shaky stock markets, fear of trade war caps gains * Relentless rise in U.S. crude production also weighs By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Tuesday, lifted by tensions in the Middle East, although rising output in the United States and shaky stock markets put a lid on further gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.31 a barrel at 0128 GMT, up 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $66.26 per barrel, up 21 cents, or 0.3 percent. Traders pointed to concerns in the Middle East, where the United States may reimpose sanctions on Iran, as well as tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worries about Venezuela’s tumbling crude production also supported oil markets. The International Energy Agency said last week that Venezuela, where an economic crisis has cut oil production by almost half since early 2005 to well below 2 million bpd PRODN-VE, was “clearly vulnerable to an accelerated decline”, and that such a disruption could tip global markets into deficit. Falls on global share markets helped cap gains. Markets are under pressure from concerns over a possible trade war between the United States and other major economies, as well as from fears of stiffer regulation as Facebook came under fire following reports it allowed improper access to user data. Also looming over oil markets has been surging U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has risen by more than a fifth since mid-2016, to 10.38 million barrels per day (bpd), pushing it past top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia produces more, at around 11 million bpd, although U.S. output is expected to overtake Russia’s later this year as well. Soaring U.S. output, as well as rising output in Canada and Brazil, is undermining efforts by the Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to curb supplies and bolster prices. Many analysts expect global oil markets to flip from slight undersupply in 2017 and early this year into oversupply later in 2018.

2018-03-20,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HKextT By John Kemp LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Hedge funds continue to turn more cautious on the outlook for oil prices, but the liquidation of former bullish positions is very gradual, suggesting most see price risks close to balance. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 23 million barrels in the week to March 13. Funds have trimmed their net long position in six of the last seven weeks by a total of 268 million barrels, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges. But managers still hold a net long position across the petroleum complex that is 906 million barrels higher than at the end of June 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2HKextT). The entire adjustment has come from the bullish side of the market, with long positions cut by 277 million barrels since Jan. 23. Bearish short positions have actually declined by 10 million barrels in the same period. Long positions in Brent, NYMEX and ICE WTI, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil total 1,347 million barrels compared with just 131 million barrels of short positions. As a result, long positions outnumber short ones by a ratio of more than 10:1, not far below the record ratio of 12:1 set almost two months ago. The liquidation of bullish positions shows no sign of accelerating. There are no signs of significant fresh short selling. And the hedge fund positioning remains exceptionally lopsided. Fund managers have become slightly more cautious about the prospect of a further increase in oil prices following the strong rally between June and January, but few are willing to bet prices will drop back much. The fund community still expects oil prices to rise further, but it has inevitably and logically become slightly less bullish given prices have risen by more than $20 (almost 50 percent) already. Fund positioning in the oil market continues to look stretched and remains a source of considerable downside price risk if and when portfolio managers try to realise more of their profits. But the fact liquidation has so far been gradual, there has been no rush for the exit, and prices have remained steady, have given bullish managers more resilience and confidence. Prices appear capped on the upside by the threat of increasing output from U.S. shale producers, but supported from below by strong consumption growth and OPEC’s determination to continue cutting inventories. For now, traders seem comfortable with prices moving in a relatively narrow range around $65 per barrel for Brent, which is contributing to the fall in volatility to its lowest level since 2012-2014.

2018-03-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order barring any U.S.-based financial transactions involving Venezuela’s new petro cryptocurrency, as U.S. officials warned that it was a “scam” by President Nicolas Maduro’s government to further undermine democracy in the OPEC country. “The ‘petro’ is a desperate effort by a corrupt regime to defraud international investors,” a senior U.S. administration official told reporters, strongly warning that any transactions in the petro digital currency would violate U.S. sanctions. “Investing in the ‘petro’ should be viewed as directly supporting this dictatorship and its attempts to undermine the democratic order in Venezuela,” the official added.   Trump’s order bars “all transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in, by a United States person or within the United States, any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token,” issued by Venezuela’s government since Jan. 9, the White House said in a statement. Maduro is hoping crypto-currencies will help Venezuela skirt U.S. financial sanctions as it struggles under hyperinflation and a collapsing socialist economy. Venezuela rejected the sanctions, which it says are illegal under international law. “These unilateral sanctions ... constitute a new imperial aggression aimed at intensifying the attack on our people,” the government said in a statement. The order comes as the Trump administration is actively exploring options to sanction Venezuela’s oil sector. On Feb. 20, Maduro said the newly launched oil-backed petro cryptocurrency raised $735 million (£524.1 million) in the first day of a pre-sale. Maduro also said last month Venezuela is preparing a new cryptocurrency called “petro gold” that will be backed by precious metals. Any U.S. transactions of the Venezuelan petro conducted before Monday’s order would be considered on a case-by-case basis, a second U.S. administration official said. “We would base our licensing determinations on the facts and circumstances of those particular applications,” the second official added.   The United States is considered a crucial source of capital for securities and tokens because of the size of its economy and because many global financial operations at some point pass through U.S. financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against four Venezuelan government officials for corruption and economic mismanagement. The senior administration official said the sanctions against the four officials were not directly linked to the cryptocurrencies issue.
