2018-07-08,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, July 8 (Reuters) - Mostly young protesters in Haiti blocked streets on Sunday while many stores remained closed for a third day following anger over steep fuel price increases in the Caribbean nation. The U.S. embassy warned its citizens to avoid the unrest in the capital Port-au-Prince and reschedule any travel plans as several airlines canceled flights. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant announced the temporary suspension of double-digit government hikes to prices for gasoline, diesel and kerosene on Saturday afternoon - just a day after they were announced - but the unrest has continued. The decision to raise prices was part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which requires the country to enact a range of austerity measures aimed at strengthening its economy. On Saturday, demonstrators erected flaming roadblocks, while others attacked hotels and businesses. “Due to continuing demonstrations, roadblocks, and violence across Port-au-Prince, as well as short staffing at the airports, embassy personnel have been instructed to re-book any flights originally scheduled for Sunday,” the U.S. embassy said in a statement. A spokesman for U.S. carrier American Airlines Group Inc said it had canceled three out of seven roundtrip flights scheduled to stop in Port-au-Prince on Sunday. The carrier’s Sunday route to Haiti’s Cap-Haitien airport had not been canceled. JetBlue Airways Corp also canceled its flights to Haiti on Sunday. Haiti’s Commerce and Economic ministries announced on Friday that it would lower fuel subsidies in a bid to generate more government revenue, which translated to a 38 percent jump for gasoline and 47 percent for diesel. The decision proved deeply unpopular among the nation’s overwhelmingly poor residents.

2018-07-08,"BAQUBA, Iraq (Reuters) - Two women from the Philippines kidnapped in Iraq on Saturday have been freed, the Diyala province police chief said on Sunday. The women had been travelling with three compatriots on the road connecting Baghdad to oil city Kirkuk when their car broke down, two military sources said.  The two women got out of the car after it broke down. Unknown men drove by in a yellow car and took them, a military source said.     The identities, affiliation, and motivation of the kidnappers was not yet clear, the sources said on Saturday. There has been an increase in attacks and kidnappings by Islamic State militants over the past few weeks near the area where the women were taken. At least eight members of the security forces were kidnapped and later killed by militants on the same highway last month.

2018-07-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Daimler AG has temporarily halted deliveries of a truck engine after finding that, in certain driving conditions, its emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) could exceed legal limits, the company said on Sunday. Stuttgart-based Daimler, responding to a report in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, said it had informed Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority of the issue last month and was in a “constructive” dialogue. German automakers have been under intense scrutiny since the “Dieselgate” scandal of 2015, in which Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to using illegal software steering its diesel engines to cheat emissions tests. Volkswagen reached a multi-billion-dollar settlement in the United States, but the scandal continues to reverberate in Germany where the head of its Audi unit, Rupert Stadler, has been arrested in a separate investigation. Daimler is also under scrutiny over how its diesel car engines use a urea nitrate additive, called AdBlue, to neutralise emissions of nitrogen oxide, which can contribute to the formation of harmful smog and ozone. Germany’s Transport Ministry said last month that 774,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe had been found to contain unauthorised “defeat” devices and ordered Daimler to recall 238,000 cars in Germany. In the latest case, Bild am Sonntag reported that Daimler had found during internal checks that software running the OM 501 truck engine would, in certain circumstances, stop the injection of AdBlue. In a statement, Daimler said the report was misleading and that the engine’s on-board diagnosis system was designed to manage the flow of AdBlue in unusual circumstances such as when the engine was running on biodiesel.  This would prevent excessive injections of AdBlue leading to the release of ammonia, which in high concentrations can act as a respiratory irritant. “In the course of regulator tests, Daimler AG found isolated situations when a six-cylinder heavy-truck engine of the Euro V standard slightly exceeded the relevant NOx limits,” the company said. Daimler said it had undertaken a detailed analysis of the findings and informed the Federal Motor Transport Authority at the end of June. The motor was sold in Mercedes-Benz trucks in Europe until 2013, and is currently on sale only outside Europe. “Until the technical issues are clarified, the company has taken a precautionary decision no longer to deliver this engine,” Daimler said.

2018-07-08,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi police opened fire to disperse dozens of protesters near the southern oil hub of Basra on Sunday as they demonstrated against a shortage of jobs, electricity, water and other basic services, police and local officials said. Police sources said eight protesters were wounded in the shooting while a local mayor said one demonstrator was killed and three were wounded. “Protesters were only making fair demands for jobs and better basic services but police opened fire and killed one protester,” said Yaseen al-Battat, a local mayor from the Imam Sadiq area where the protesters were. Police and oil officials said Sunday’s incident didn’t impact the security or operations of the giant southern oilfields.  The protesters, from farmland areas around 100 km (62 miles) north of Basra, gathered on a highway located near the southern oilfields perimeters of West Qurna-2, which is being developed by Russia’s Lukoil, and West Qurna 1oilfield, operated by Exxon Mobil, police said. Local communities and tribes in Iraq, where foreign oil companies are developing the OPEC nation’s vast energy reserves, periodically protest to urge companies to provide jobs and other benefits. Stability in Basra, the main southern city at the edge of the Gulf, is of vital importance as a hub for oil exports accounting for over 95 percent of government revenues.

2018-07-08,"(Reuters) - Haitian leaders pleaded for calm on Saturday as violent protests over fuel price increases entered a second day and U.S. airlines cancelled flights to the Caribbean nation. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant announced the temporary suspension of double-digit government hikes to prices for gasoline, diesel and kerosene on Saturday afternoon - just a day after they were announced. But as local television footage showed, the government’s decision to back down did not keep angry residents from taking to the streets. Some demonstrators erected flaming roadblocks, while others attacked hotels and businesses. “The poor people want to be able to eat,” one masked protester told Reuters TV as a car blazed behind him. “I want to tell (President) Jovenel (Moïse) that Haiti is not for him and his family. Haiti is for every Haitian. He needs to leave the country and leave the country to us so we can live.” In a statement, Lafontant said the government strongly condemns the acts of violence and vandalism. U.S. carriers American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines announced flight cancellations Saturday to the capital Port-au-Prince citing civil unrest. “Due to concerns over safety from unrest in the area, Spirit Airlines felt it necessary to temporarily suspend service to Port-au-Prince, Haiti Saturday,” the airline said in a statement. “We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused, but the safety of our guests and crew is paramount.” A spokesman for the airline said it was not yet clear when flights would resume.      The U.S. Embassy in Haiti advised personnel and Americans in the country to shelter in place.  The U.S. State Department said separately that it was aware of vandalism at a Best Western hotel, where media reports said Americans were staying, and at an American Airlines office in downtown Port-au-Prince.  “At this time, we have not received any reports of U.S. citizens injured in the incidents,” the State Department said in a statement.  On Friday, Haiti’s Commerce and Economic ministries announced that fuel price increases, including a 38 percent jump for gasoline and 47 percent for diesel, would take effect at midnight. The now-suspended decision by Moïse’s government to raise prices was part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which requires the country to enact a range of austerity measures.
