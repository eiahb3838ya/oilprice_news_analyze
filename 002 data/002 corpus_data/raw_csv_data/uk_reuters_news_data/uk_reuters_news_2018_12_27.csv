2018-12-27,"RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s king put a veteran former finance minister in charge of foreign affairs on Thursday, aiming to improve the kingdom’s image after the crisis caused by the killing of a journalist and greater scrutiny of the Yemen war. The Saudi government has come under intense international criticism over the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. It has also faced growing scepticism over its intervention in Yemen, where the United Nations says millions of people could starve to death because of supply lines disrupted by a Saudi-led war against the Houthi movement which controls the capital. The events have gravely harmed the reputation of King Salman’s son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed, 33, who is poised to succeed his father in the kingdom’s first generational transfer of power for more than 65 years.  In a cabinet reshuffle, Ibrahim al-Assaf, who served as finance minister for 20 years and has represented Saudi Arabia at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, was named to take over as foreign minister from Adel al-Jubeir. Experts in Saudi politics said the move reflected a perception that Jubeir, a veteran diplomat, was tainted by having served as Riyadh’s chief global defender during the Khashoggi affair. “(Assaf) will basically follow orders, but is seen as key to rebuilding the kingdom’s tarnished image given his own positive international image,” said Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow at Britain’s Chatham House think tank. “So this rings in the new for the new year, but no real change.” Assaf was among scores of senior businessmen, officials and princes who was detained at a luxury hotel during an anti-corruption crackdown launched by the crown prince last year, although he was swiftly exonerated and released. A Saudi official said the reshuffle came at the end of the cabinet’s four-year term, as required by law. In other changes, King Salman appointed Prince Abdullah bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz to replace Prince Khaled bin Ayyaf as chief of the National Guard. General Kalid bin Qirar al-Harbi was named general security chief, while Musaed al-Aiban, a Harvard-educated son of Saudi Arabia’s first intelligence chief, was named national security adviser. Turki al-Sheikh, a close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed, was moved from his position as head of the sports committee to head up an entertainment commission. “The reappointment of sports czar Turki al-Sheikh as head of the entertainment authority as well as changes in the national economy and security councils are an effort to put a polish on a tainted government,” said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.  “None of this however calls into question the position of the crown prince. On the contrary, it reinforces it.” Turki al-Shabana, an executive at broadcaster Rotana, was appointed minister of information. Rotana is owned by billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who was also detained at the Ritz last year and later released. King Salman also ordered the creation of a Saudi Space Agency, chaired by his 62-year-old son Prince Sultan bin Salman, who heads the Saudi tourism agency and flew aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery in the 1980s as the first Arab in space.

2018-12-27,"* Wall Street falls after 1-day surge * U.S. consumer confidence, Chinese industrial profits drop * Oil prices slip back after 8 pct surge; bond yields down (Updates to mid-day U.S. trading) By Trevor Hunnicutt Dec 27 (Reuters) - A dramatic global stock rally faded on Thursday after a fall in Chinese industrial profits and in U.S. consumer confidence offered reminders of the pressures on the world economy. Still, an index of world stocks stayed off near two-year lows hit earlier this week before Wednesday’s 1,000 point-plus surge on the U.S. Dow Jones index, which was attributed to the strongest holiday sales in years. “Yesterday was a blowout day for U.S. equity markets which triggered optimism that this could be a key reversal day but the upward momentum has not really followed through,” said Lee Hardman, an analyst at MUFG in London. “One reason is that maybe the sharp move higher was driven by year-end rebalancing, which exaggerated the scale of the rebound, and now we have reverted to the trend which has been in place most of this month.” That trend is toward weaker stock, U.S. dollar and oil prices along with stronger demand for safe-haven government bonds, gold and Japanese yen. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.85 percent and U.S. crude fell 2.29 percent to $45.16 per barrel after each staged big rallies the day prior. In a sign some consumers are getting nervous about the economy amid volatile stock markets and the partial shutdown of the U.S. government, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dropped to a five-month low in December and came in weaker than even the lowest economists’ estimate in a Reuters poll. Earlier, markets in mainland China as well as Hong Kong closed weaker after data showed earnings at China’s industrial firms dropped in November for the first time in nearly three years. A Reuters report added to the gloom around the world’s second-biggest economy, saying the White House was considering barring U.S. firms from buying telecoms equipment from China’s Huawei and ZTE. That overshadowed positive noises from the U.S. government on trade talks with Beijing, its efforts to temper the White House’s recent broadsides against the Federal Reserve and a report showing the number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits fell marginally last week in a sign of labor market strength. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 366.52 points, or 1.6 percent, to 22,511.93, the S&P 500 lost 42.95 points, or 1.74 percent, to 2,424.75 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.79 points, or 2.21 percent, to 6,409.56. “So far, we don’t see a shift in fundamentals. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China remain the biggest unknown factor for 2019,” said Hussein Sayed, a strategist at online brokerage FXTM. There were also renewed concerns in Italy, where troubled lender Banca Carige was denied a cash call by its largest shareholder, pushing its shares down 12.5 percent. The concerns over a faltering global economy and signs of an oil glut pressured crude prices a day after their 8 percent rally. U.S. Treasury prices also reversed direction after falling sharply on Wednesday, with the 10-year note last rising 15/32 in price to yield 2.7452 percent. Another safe-haven, gold, was up 0.9 percent to $1,277.68 an ounce, around a six-month peak. Investors also bought yen, strengthening that currency 0.68 percent against the greenback at 110.62 per dollar. Against a basket of trading partners’ currencies the dollar was down 0.54 percent. “We have started to see the yen regain its place as the safe haven of choice,” MUFG’s Hardman said.

2018-12-27,"MEXICO CITY, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Mexico’s government unveiled a plan on Thursday to step up use of the armed forces to combat fuel theft, vowing to root out corrupt officials it says are largely responsible for a problem that has cost the country billions of dollars. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference his government would fight the theft “outside and inside” state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), saying authorities were complicit in the bulk of the crimes. “This is the theft of national assets, of public funds, of money that belongs to all Mexicans,” he said. Criminal gangs have for years used fuel theft as a way of supplementing their income, hurting Mexico’s refineries and bleeding money from state coffers. Speaking alongside the president, Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said the security presence would be increased at key oil installations to better monitor distribution of fuel. Security forces would also receive additional training for the task, Sandoval added. Pemex’s new Chief Executive Officer Octavio Romero told the news conference more than 146 billion pesos ($7.40 billion) worth of fuel had been stolen in Mexico since 2016, with theft soaring to new heights this year. Questioned about whether the Pemex workers’ union had been involved in the theft of fuel, Lopez Obrador said there had been reports that the union had been restricting access to parts of the company’s operations. That issue had been addressed with the union’s leaders and access would not be restricted in future, he said. $1 = 19.7172 Mexican pesos

2018-12-27,"(Reuters) - Crude oil output has more than doubled in New Mexico over the last four years, making it the No. 3 producer among U.S. states, but a January change in state leadership to Democratic control has industry executives fearing tougher regulations are coming.  (Graphic: New Mexico's oil output has more than doubled in four years - tmsnrt.rs/2GFz1sg) Incoming New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and state land commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard plan to limit new leasing on state lands where drillers planned to tap freshwater aquifers. The incoming administration also has pledged to crack down on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is often flared during oil production or can leak into the atmosphere from faulty equipment.  “They could make it much harder for operators to make a good profit in New Mexico,” said Phil Buch, a Texas oil executive with personal energy holdings in New Mexico. “There’s definitely an added risk there.” Advancements in drilling technology over the last decade or so have boosted U.S. oil production dramatically. The country’s crude output surged to a record 11.5 million barrels per day (bpd) as of September. However, opposition to drilling has also grown as activists around the world have pressured governments to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. In North America, there have been growing protests against pipeline construction and measures to curb fossil fuels have made their way to the ballot box in many western states. Nevada voters last month approved a measure to increase the amount of renewable energy used by 2030, though voters rejected curbs on fossil fuels in state elections in Arizona, Colorado, and Washington state. Incoming New Mexico officials say they are focused on increasing tax revenue while cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas methane.  Governor-elect Lujan Grisham plans to put “an emphasis on methane” in her initial legislative objectives, said aide Dominic Gabello. She wants producers to capture methane gas that has leaked from equipment or is vented or flared, in hopes that limiting lost output will boost state tax revenue. “No one is trying to kick oil and gas out. That wouldn’t be done,” said Tarin Nix, an aide to Garcia Richard, the incoming land commissioner who was unavailable to comment. “The most you can do is make the most money from oil and gas.” Garcia Richard, whose office oversees 9 million acres of state land, wants to increase the production royalty by at least a third, which would match Texas’ royalty rate and boost revenues for funding schools and hospitals.  New Mexico’s oil output has more than doubled to 712,000 bpd in the last four years. The state accounts for about one-fifth of the production of the giant Permian Basin, the country’s largest oilfield, which produces more than 3.7 million bpd, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. An auction of federal land in New Mexico recently raised a record $972 million with bidders paying as much as $82,000 an acre, more than twice the state’s previous high. Big oil companies spent heavily in November elections to defeat initiatives seeking to tax carbon emissions in Washington state, restrict drilling in Colorado, and mandate renewable energy use in Arizona.  But in New Mexico, voters still opted for Garcia Richard after Chevron Corp gave $2.35 million and other oil companies including Occidental Petroleum Corp, Devon Energy and Marathon Oil Corp each gave at least $20,000 to a group opposing her election.  Chevron’s contributions favored “candidates who promote the responsible development of oil and natural gas resources,” said spokeswoman Veronica Flores-Paniagua. Devon backed candidates “who understand that our industry serves as the backbone of New Mexico’s economy,” spokesman John Porretto said in an email. Energy companies should expect a tougher view of the industry next year “that would certainly make it more expensive to drill,” said Larry Scott, owner of oil and gas investor Lynx Petroleum and a Republican state legislator from Hobbs, New Mexico.  The outgoing Republican administration created a “a pent-up demand for progressive and liberal legislation” that energy companies will soon experience, he said.  “There probably are changes on the horizon,” said Mike Miller, a Portales, N.M., resident who works for industry group Permian Basin Petroleum Association. The new administration and legislature “philosophically probably have some differences with our industry, but we just need to work with them in the framework and be patient.”  Reporting by Jennifer Hiller in Houston; Editing by David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-regulation-new-mexico/new-mexico-oil-producers-brace-for-tighter-regulation-as-output-jumps-idUKL1N1YN0WN,27 Dec 2018,"Crude oil output has more than doubled in

2018-12-27,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sinopec (600028.SS) has suspended two top officials at its trading arm Unipec and is evaluating the details related to  certain crude oil transactions that have incurred some losses, the Chinese state oil company said on Thursday. Unipec’s President Chen Bo, an industry veteran who helped the company become one of the world’s largest oil traders, has been suspended along with the senior Communist Party representative at the company, Zhan Qi, Sinopec said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. “The Company was informed that Unipec incurred some losses during certain crude oil transactions due to the oil price drop. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the details of such circumstance,” Sinopec said. Reuters earlier reported Chen Bo and Zhan Qi had been suspended after Unipec suffered losses, citing five sources. Neither Chen nor Zhan could immediately be reached for comment. Vice president Chen Gang has been appointed to handle the company’s administrative work, Sinopec added in the filing. “The government inspectors were looking into the company’s operations for the past few years ... one of the problems they found was the severe trading losses in the second half of this year because of wrong market judgment,” one of the sources said. The sources did not refer to any wrongdoing on the part of the two men. Benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 have fallen by about 40 percent since hitting their highest in four years in October, amid oversupply concerns as major producers ramped up output while the United States unexpectedly issued waivers that allowed countries to continue importing Iranian oil despite sanctions. A sudden widening of WTI’s spread with Brent earlier this year also led to hefty losses at major traders. Chen Bo, who rose through the ranks to take on Unipec’s top role, started the company’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading desk. He also advocated boosting China’s crude oil imports from the Americas to help the world’s largest oil importing country to diversify its suppliers. Oil traders said Chen’s removal could create uncertainty at Unipec. “He’s been a key man in the oil trading industry in the past decade,” said a veteran oil trader in Asia. Shares in Sinopec (600028.SS) closed at 5.25 yuan ($0.76) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the lowest in two years and down 6.7 percent from Wednesday. “Sinopec’s stock has been performing badly in the fourth quarter,” said a Beijing-based equity analyst who cannot be named due to local stock exchange rules. The news today caused “a selloff and decline in prices,” the analyst added. In October, Sinopec reported that third-quarter net profit fell from the previous quarter, after rising for five consecutive quarters. For the first nine months of 2018, the company reported a loss of 5.47 billion yuan ($794 million) from foreign exchange rate changes and holdings in derivative financial instruments, according to financial reports issued in October.  In the first nine months of 2017, the company reported a gain of 1.13 billion yuan.  Of the 2018 losses, 4 billion yuan occurred in third quarter, according to Reuters calculations based on the  financial reports. Sinopec does not provide a breakdown for revenues at its trading unit.

Still, world stocks stayed off near two-year lows, lifted by Wednesday’s 1,000 point-plus surge on the U.S. Dow Jones index which was triggered partly by the strongest holiday sales in years.

But the gains halved by 1130 GMT as a pan-European equity index fell 1.1 percent after a strong open and export-reliant German shares lost 2 percent .

2018-12-27,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rising protectionism and trade wars and the unpredictability of the U.S. administration have greatly contributed to global oil price volatility over the past two years, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday. Oil prices have been volatile, falling by more than a third this quarter, partly due to rising oil production in the United States. “All these uncertainties, which are now on the market: how China will behave, how India will behave... trade wars and unpredictability on the part of the U.S. administration... those are defining factors for price volatility,” Novak said. U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vociferous critic of OPEC, demanding the cartel act in order to cut prices of oil.     Russia’s Novak also told reporters that the U.S. decision to allow some countries to trade Iranian oil after putting Tehran under sanctions was one of the key factors behind this month’s global pact to cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other top oil producers led by Russia have agreed to cut their output beginning in January in order to prop up oil prices. “Had it been hard sanctions against Iran, we wouldn’t have done it (reduce output),” Novak told reporters. He also said that it was highly unlikely that OPEC and other oil producers would set up a permanent joint structure. According to the minister, Russia would cut its output by between 3 and 5 million tonnes in the first half of 2019 as part of the deal and then it would be able to restore it to 556 million tonnes (11.12 million barrels per day) for the whole 2019, on par with 2018. Russia has pledged to cut production under its global pact with other producers by around 230,000 bpd from the 11.41 million bpd it produced in October, its baseline for cutting its output. Novak said Russia would be able to boost its annual output by 10-15 million tonnes (200,000-300,000 bpd) over the next two years. Currently, the United States, which is not part of the global deal, is pumping 11.6 million bpd of crude, more than Saudi Arabia or Russia. Novak said it is only a question of time before oil production in the United States begins to decline. “I think they are faced with some difficulties. Despite the recent boom (in their output) their efficiency has fallen, it is more difficult for them to raise funds,” he said.

2018-12-27,"BUENOS AIRES, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Argentina plans to raise electricity prices by an average 35 percent nationwide next year, government sources directly familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Higher power bills would hit families already struggling with high inflation and a shrinking economy that has caused job losses and an increase in poverty. The 2019 electricity price increases will come in four stages, starting in February, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the policy had not yet been officially announced. Public utility prices have soared as the government has cut subsidies as part of its deficit reduction program. President Mauricio Macri has agreed to reduce the primary fiscal deficit, expected at 2.7 percent of gross domestic product this year, to zero in 2019 under a standby financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Subsidy cuts are a key part of his fiscal program. Inflation is expected to end this year at over 47 percent, in part due to increases in electricity, water, heating gas and public transportation prices. Analysts expect the inflation rate to fall to under 28 percent next year, although higher utility bills will put upward pressure on consumer prices. Energy subsidies are expected to total $5.11 billion next year, down from $6.88 billion in 2018 and far under the $17.23 billion that the government spent on energy when Macri took office in 2015, according to data from the office of the country’s energy secretary.

2018-12-27,"BERLIN, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Germany’s transport minister has cleared the way for retrofits, or hardware fixes, to older diesel cars to reduce pollution, mass-selling daily Bild reported, citing a technical paper it had seen. The 30-page paper sets out the requirements for a so-called “general operating permit”, which is necessary for the motor vehicle authority KBA to approve the hardware kits - a first legal step for retrofits of diesel cars, Bild said. The KBA has, however, not yet received complete applications for retrofits, Bild added in an advanced release of an article to run in its Friday edition, without citing a source. In October, the government presented plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes. But carmakers have not all committed to covering the cost of retrofits, which could run into billions of euros. The government cannot force carmakers to pay for hardware upgrades but it shares an interest with the industry in preventing further driving bans for cars that pollute more, which Hamburg has already imposed. Other cities including Berlin and Stuttgart, the home of Germany’s car industry, are set to introduce similar bans.

2018-12-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wild Christmas week ride in global markets continued on Thursday as stocks rallied from significant losses to post gains for the day. For the second consecutive session, early weakness in markets turned to strength by the time U.S. stocks closed as investors shuffled their portfolios.  “We had a very wild ride today,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JP Morgan Chase & Co’s asset management unit, on a conference call. “It really is not about fundamentals. There is nothing in the fundamental picture of the U.S. economy that would justify the kind of moves that we’ve seen.” A report early in the day showed the number of Americans filing applications for jobless benefits fell marginally last week in a sign of labour market strength. But other news was dismal, including the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dropping to a five-month low in December and earnings at China’s industrial firms falling in November for the first time in nearly three years.  Meanwhile, there is no end in sight to the U.S.-China trade war or the partial shutdown of the U.S. government. Investors often sell assets that have done well and buy those that have done the worst, including many stocks, at the end of the quarter to “rebalance” their portfolios. Some traders also cited investors closing out short positions among the reasons for Wall Street’s late rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 260.37 points, or 1.14 percent, to close at 23,138.82, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.13 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,488.83 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 25.14 points, or 0.38 percent, to 6,579.49.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.58 percent, rising further from near two-year lows hit earlier this week. The late U.S. stock rally left intact other aspects of the bearish market trend that has developed of late, with a weaker U.S. dollar and lower oil prices, along with stronger demand for safe-haven government bonds, gold and the Japanese yen.International Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled down 4.2 percent at $52.16 per barrel after staging a big rally on Wednesday as concerns about an oil glut weighed on the market.  U.S. Treasury prices reversed direction after falling sharply on Wednesday, with the 10-year note US10YT=RR last rising 4/32 in price to yield 2.7845 percent.  Gold, another safe haven, was up 0.6 percent to $1,275 an ounce, around six-month highs. XAU=  Investors also bought yen, boosting the currency JPY= 0.27 percent versus the greenback at 111.08 per dollar. Against a basket of trading partners' currencies, the dollar .DXY was down 0.52 percent.  “We have started to see the yen regain its place as the safe haven of choice,” said Lee Hardman, an analyst at MUFG in London.

2018-12-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday, retreating from an 8 percent rally in the previous session as the oil market focused on signs of faltering global economic growth and record production of crude. Brent crude LCOc1 futures dropped 4.24 percent, or $2.31, to settle at $52.16 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.61 to settle at $44.61 a barrel, down 3.48 percent. “The market is giving back some of its gains from yesterday that were brought along with the euphoria in the stock market,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Prices surged on Wednesday, tracking a spike on Wall Street after President Donald Trump’s administration attempted to shore up investor confidence.  U.S. stocks retreated for most of the session on Thursday, dragging oil prices, before roaring back to end in positive territory.  Brent and WTI have lost more than a third of their value since the beginning of October and are heading for declines of more than 20 percent in 2018. Concerns about slowing global economic growth have dampened investor demand for riskier asset classes and pressured crude futures.  Market participants are also worried about a glut of crude.  U.S. crude stocks rose by 6.9 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 21 to 448.2 million, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Thursday. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.9 million barrels. Official U.S. government data will be released on Friday.  Three months ago it looked as if the global oil market would be undersupplied through the northern hemisphere winter as U.S. sanctions removed large volumes of Iranian crude. But other oil exporters have compensated for any shortfall, depressing prices.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other producers, agreed this month to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to more than 1 percent of global consumption. But the cuts will not take effect until January and oil production has been at or near record highs in Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States, now the world’s top crude producer pumping 11.6 million bpd. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the country will cut its output by between 3 million and 5 million tonnes in the first half of 2019. It then will be able to restore it to 556 million tonnes (11.12 million barrels per day) for the whole 2019, on par with 2018, he added. Although U.S. sanctions have put a cap on Iran’s oil sales, Tehran has said its private exporters have “no problems” selling its oil.

2018-12-27,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rising protectionism and trade wars and the unpredictability of the U.S. administration have greatly contributed to global oil price volatility over the past two years, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday. Oil prices have been volatile, falling by more than a third this quarter, partly due to rising oil production in the United States. “All these uncertainties, which are now on the market: how China will behave, how India will behave... trade wars and unpredictability on the part of the U.S. administration... those are defining factors for price volatility,” Novak said. U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vociferous critic of OPEC, demanding the cartel act in order to cut prices of oil.     Russia’s Novak also told reporters that the U.S. decision to allow some countries to trade Iranian oil after putting Tehran under sanctions was one of the key factors behind this month’s global pact to cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other top oil producers led by Russia have agreed to cut their output beginning in January in order to prop up oil prices. “Had it been hard sanctions against Iran, we wouldn’t have done it (reduce output),” Novak told reporters. He also said that it was highly unlikely that OPEC and other oil producers would set up a permanent joint structure. According to the minister, Russia would cut its output by between 3 and 5 million tonnes in the first half of 2019 as part of the deal and then it would be able to restore it to 556 million tonnes (11.12 million barrels per day) for the whole 2019, on par with 2018. Russia has pledged to cut production under its global pact with other producers by around 230,000 bpd from the 11.41 million bpd it produced in October, its baseline for cutting its output. Novak said Russia would be able to boost its annual output by 10-15 million tonnes (200,000-300,000 bpd) over the next two years. Currently, the United States, which is not part of the global deal, is pumping 11.6 million bpd of crude, more than Saudi Arabia or Russia. Novak said it is only a question of time before oil production in the United States begins to decline. “I think they are faced with some difficulties. Despite the recent boom (in their output) their efficiency has fallen, it is more difficult for them to raise funds,” he said.

2018-12-27,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - It is highly unlikely that OPEC and other oil producers would  set up a joint structure due to the additional red tape it would create as well as the risk of U.S. monopoly-related sanctions, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other top oil producers led by Russia have since the end of 2016 made an unprecedented joint effort to curb output and support prices.    OPEC and Russia jointly produce more than 40 percent of the world’s oil.     Russia’s energy ministry had said that Moscow and OPEC lynchpin Saudi Arabia had reached a general agreement that the OPEC+ format should be “institutionalised” and extended until 2019 and beyond to monitor the market and take joint action if needed. However, Novak said such an idea has been ditched. “There is a consensus that there will be no such organisation. That’s because it requires additional bureaucratic brouhaha in relation to financing, cartel, with the U.S. side,” Novak told a briefing to reporters. I think, non-OPEC (countries) will not agree as they don’t want to be hit by sanctions.” Proposed U.S. legislation known as “NOPEC” could open OPEC up to anti-trust lawsuits but has long laid dormant, with previous U.S. presidents signalling that they would veto any move to make it law. However, U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of OPEC, blaming it for high oil prices and urging it to increase output. “This won’t be an organisation, this is some mechanism of cooperation: to convene, to discuss, adopt some memorandums, joint resolutions,” Novak said about future cooperation with OPEC.

The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) estimated crude steel output of the world’s second-biggest producer would drop to 26.31 million tonnes for the three-month period, down 0.4 percent from a year earlier. This would mean a third consecutive quarterly decline. Demand for steel products, including those for exports, is forecast to decline 1.1 percent to 23.59 million tonnes in the January to March quarter, although domestic demand would likely stay flat at 16.15 million tonnes, the ministry said, citing an industry survey. Exports, which typically account for about 40 percent of Japanese steel production, are forecast to slip 3.2 percent from a year ago during the period, the ministry said. JFE Steel, Japan’s second-biggest steelmaker, is having trouble at a blast furnace in Kurashiki steelworks in western Japan and another furnace in Chiba, near Tokyo, which are expected to cut its crude steel output for the year to March 2019 by 500,000 tonnes in total from its October estimate, a company spokesman said. In October, JFE cut its annual crude steel forecast to 28 million tonnes from 29 million tonnes, due to severe rains in July and September and technical trouble at the furnace in Kurashiki. “A recovery in the Kurashiki plant will be delayed by about a half month from an earlier plan of late December while the furnace in Chiba is also expected to be back in normal operation in mid-January,” the spokesman said. Japanese steelmakers are enjoying healthy local demand from automakers and the construction sector, which has been in full swing for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but a series of glitches at their aged facilities have prevented them from producing as much steel as they had wished. For the current financial year to March 2019, the ministry forecast the country’s crude steel output would fall for a second year to 104.39 million tonnes, against 104.84 million tonnes a year earlier.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 1,000 points for the first time on Wednesday, leading a broad Wall Street rebound, after a report that holiday sales were the strongest in years helped mollify concerns about the health of the economy. Stocks in Asia and Europe took their cue from this rally, and opened strongly, pushing the MSCI world equity index , which tracks shares in 47 countries, 0.4 percent higher. The index had already spiked 2.3 percent in the previous session, rising off a 22-month low hit on Christmas Eve. “The relentless selling which prevailed leading up to Christmas has mercifully halted as U.S. stock markets recorded significant gains,” said Stephen Innes, a trader at online FX broker OANDA. He attributed the rally partly to a Mastercard Inc report that sales during the U.S. holiday shopping season rose the most in six years in 2018, helping allay concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. “The surge in online purchases over the holiday season should be a reminder for the markets never to underestimate the purchasing power of the U.S. consumer,” Innes said. There were also some attempts by the White House to temper its broadside against the Federal Reserve. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Wednesday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s job was not in jeopardy. However, the rally fizzled somewhat in Europe where shares opened higher 0.5 percent, then erased most of the early gains. France’s CAC index and Spain’s Ibex stood 0.3 percent higher while a pan-European stock index was flat, dragged lower by Italian stocks. Milan was hit by renewed concerns over the country’s banking sector after lender Banca Carige was denied a cash call by its largest shareholder. The news weighed on Italian government bonds too, curbing a month-long rally and pushing 10-year yields higher on the day. Earlier, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent and away from eight-week lows while Japan’s Nikkei managed to pull out of bear market territory, to closing 3.9 percent higher. Australian shares jumped 1.9 percent. But Chinese shares did not join the rebound, with mainland shares as well as Hong Kong  down 0.4 percent. Earnings at China’s industrial firms dropped in November for the first time in nearly three years The concerns over a faltering global economy and signs of a crude oil glut pressured oil prices, sending Brent futures 2.4 percent lower to $53.26 a barrel and partly reversing the previous day’s 8 percent jump. Wednesday’s rise was triggered by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, agreeing to limit output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) starting in January. U.S. Treasury yields too reversed direction after rising sharply on Wednesday, and dropped three basis points to 2.765 percent. Another safe-haven, gold, was up 0.4 percent, remaining just below a six-month peak hit earlier this week. The dollar gave up some of its overnight gains, but losses were limited to around 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies. Against the yen, a perceived safe haven, it was off 0.5 percent at 110.82 yen. It had risen nearly 1 percent overnight, booking its largest single-day gain against the yen since late April.

In a buying frenzy as spectacular as the recent rout, U.S. stocks soared with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rocketing more than 1,000 points for the first time on Wednesday. That helped push MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.6 percent and away from eight-week lows. European shares are set to open higher as markets reopen after the Christmas break, with early indications from London’s FTSE and Frankfurt’s DAX pointing to gains of 0.6 to 0.7 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were last down 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei managed to pull out of bear market territory it had entered on Tuesday, closing 3.9 percent higher, while Australian shares jumped 1.9 percent. Chinese shares did not join Asia’s rebound. The blue-chip index was down 0.4 percent, as was Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index. There was no single trigger for the overnight relief rally on Wall Street, though a Mastercard Inc report that sales during the U.S. holiday shopping season rose the most in six years in 2018 helped allay concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. There were also some attempts by the White House to temper its broadside against the Federal Reserve. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Wednesday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s job was not in jeopardy. His comments came days after President Donald Trump described the Fed as the “only problem” in the U.S. economy after the central bank last week raised rates for the fourth time this year, and retained plans for more hikes in 2019. A U.S. government shutdown, concerns over slower global growth and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin convening a crisis group following the sharp sell-off in equities have also rattled investors. “There is a question which is starting to unfold, whether this is a bear market rally or whether this is something more sustainable,” said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone. “We probably got another 3 to 5 percent in these market rallies before we see people looking to fade into this.” Faced with deepening gloom, investors were quick to lap up media reports that a U.S. trade team will travel to Beijing the week of Jan. 7 to hold talks with Chinese officials. “I think worries regarding the U.S. government shutdown as well as lack of clarity over whether the U.S.-Sino negotiations (over trade) will go well or not still remain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Reuters reported on Thursday that the Trump administration is considering an executive order in the new year to declare a national emergency that would bar U.S. companies from using Huawei and ZTE products. Not all signs were positive overnight, with the Fed’s Bank of Richmond’s manufacturing index giving investors a reminder of the underlying global risks. The index fell the most on record, Refinitiv data going back to 1994 showed. The weak figures rekindled fears that Sino-U.S. trade tensions are weighing on U.S. producers, and came days before the release of the Chicago purchasing managers index at the end of the week. Oil also caught investors’ attention after U.S. crude and Brent overnight both marked their largest single-day rises since late November 2016. U.S. crude on Wednesday rallied almost 8.7 percent, while Brent jumped more than 8.8 percent in a partial rebound from steep losses that pushed crude benchmarks to lows not seen since last year. U.S. crude was last trading 0.4 percent lower at $46.06 a barrel, while Brent gave up 0.3 percent at $54.30 a barrel. “If we can see oil prices moving up in the low end of the range, which is around $49 to $50, then we’ll continue to see equities moving higher,” said Pepperstone’s Weston. As investors moved back into riskier assets overnight, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose and last stood at 2.786 percent, about 6.5 basis point off their lowest since April hit in Asian trading on Wednesday. The dollar gave up some of its overnight gains, but the losses were limited. Against the yen, a perceived safe haven, the dollar was last off 0.3 percent at 111.08 yen. It had risen nearly 1 percent overnight, booking its largest single-day gain against the yen since late April. The greenback was also on the back foot against the euro and the British pound, losing about 0.2 percent against both currencies, to $1.1386 and $1.2658, respectively.

2018-12-27,"* Imports climb 15 percent from Nov to Dec - data * Mainly driven by China’s continued gasification push * High imports likely to continue over Jan-Feb - analyst By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) into Northeast Asia have risen to a record in December, mainly driven by China’s continued gasification push, and as the region faces colder-than-usual temperatures this week. LNG imports into China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, have climbed to 20.5 million tonnes so far in December, 5 percent higher than the previous monthly record of 19.5 million tonnes back in January, data from Refinitiv Eikon showed. December shipments were nearly 15 percent higher than November, the data showed. “When we look at the region, we think it is mainly China which has been driving the North Asian growth over November to December,” said Kittithat Promthaveepong, lead analyst at energy consultancy FGE. “This was likely because of the spot supplies they had contracted for earlier in the year to avoid a shortage this winter.” LNG imports into China have risen to a record of about 6.5 million tonnes so far in December, up 6 percent from the previous high in November as households and businesses crank up their heating with the start of the Northern Hemisphere winter. China’s government has ordered residents and businesses to shift to natural gas for heating from coal to reduce air pollution. To avoid shortages, Chinese companies procured supplies ahead of the winter. Shipments to Japan also rose to a 10-month high in December, likely due to colder weather, but this could be a temporary increase as inventories are high, a Japan-based trader said. He added that buyers have largely finished their spot procurement for winter. Temperatures across Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul are expected to be colder than normal this week, with a widespread cool-down likely to cover China over the next 10 days, weather forecasts from Refinitiv Eikon show. However, Japan is likely to experience average-to-warmer weather between January and March next year. In South Korea, LNG imports also rose in December. The country’s LNG imports have generally been strong this year due to maintenance at nuclear power plants and a delay in the start-up of new nuclear plants, said Ken Lee, a senior analyst at FGE. “Over January to February, we expect these relatively high imports to continue, but the recent cold spell in China means that they’ll be able to absorb more volumes over first quarter of 2019 as stocks diminish,” FGE’s Promthaveepong said.

In a buying frenzy that was as spectacular as the recent rout, U.S. stocks soared with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rocketing more than 1,000 points for the first time on Wednesday. That helped push MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.8 percent and away from eight-week lows. Japan’s Nikkei managed to pull out of bear market territory it had entered on Tuesday, surging 3.8 percent. Australian shares jumped 1.6 percent as trading resumed after the Christmas break, while Chinese blue chips gained 0.6 percent. There was no single trigger for the overnight relief rally on Wall Street, though a Mastercard Inc report that sales during the U.S. holiday shopping season rose the most in six years in 2018 helped allay concerns about the health of the U.S. economy There were also some attempts by the White House to temper its broadside against the Federal Reserve. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Wednesday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s job was not in jeopardy. His comments came days after President Donald Trump described the Fed as the “only problem” in the U.S. economy after the central bank last week raised rates for the fourth time this year, and retained plans for more hikes in 2019. A U.S. government shutdown, concerns over slower global growth and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin convening a crisis group following the sharp sell-off in equities have also rattled investors. “There is a question which is starting to unfold, whether this is a bear market rally or whether this is something more sustainable,” said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone. “We probably got another 3 to 5 percent in these market rallies before we see people looking to fade into this.” Faced with deepening gloom, investors were quick to lap up media reports that a U.S. trade team will travel to Beijing the week of Jan. 7 to hold talks with Chinese officials. “Investors are aware of negative factors, but they aren’t paying attention to those. They are looking at the Dow’s $1,000 gain,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “I think worries regarding the U.S. government shutdown as well as lack of clarity over whether the U.S.-Sino negotiations (over trade) will go well or not still remain.” Not all signs were positive overnight, with the Fed’s Bank of Richmond’s manufacturing index giving investors a reminder of the underlying global risks. The index fell the most on record, Refinitiv data going back to 1994 showed. The weak figures rekindled fears that Sino-U.S. trade tensions are weighing on U.S. producers, and came days before the release of the Chicago purchasing managers index at the end of the week. After the overnight rally, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were last down 0.3 percent. Oil also caught investors’ attention after U.S. crude and Brent overnight both marked their largest single-day rises since late November 2016. U.S. crude on Wednesday rallied almost 8.7 percent, while Brent jumped more than 8.8 percent in a partial rebound from steep losses that pushed crude benchmarks to lows not seen since last year. U.S. crude was last trading about half a percent lower at $45.99 a barrel, while Brent gave up 0.4 percent at $54.24 a barrel. “If we can see oil prices moving up in the low end of the range, which is around $49 to $50, then we’ll continue to see equities moving higher,” said Pepperstone’s Weston. As investors moved back into riskier assets overnight, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose and last stood at 2.799 percent, about 8 basis point off their lowest since April hit in Asian trading on Wednesday. The shift into riskier assets provided support to the dollar, which rose nearly 1 percent against the yen to 111.41 overnight - its largest single-day gain against the safe-haven Japanese currency since late April. The dollar gave up some of those overnight gains on Thursday, and was last off 0.4 percent at 110.95 yen. The U.S. currency was also on the back foot against the euro and the British pound, losing about 0.2 percent against both currencies, to $1.1382 and $1.2658, respectively. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.2 percent at 96.840. In commodity markets, gold remained below a six-month peak hit during the previous session. Spot gold edged higher to $1,269.70, but its gains were capped as investors ventured back into riskier assets.

2018-12-27,"SEOUL, Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices on Thursday extended their sharp climb from the session before amid rising stock markets, but worries over a glut in crude supply and concerns over a faltering global economy kept a lid on gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were up 26 cents, or 0.56 percent, at $46.48 per barrel at 0032 GMT. They jumped 8.7 percent to $46.22 per barrel in the previous session. Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. They rose 8 percent to $54.47 a barrel the day before. Global stocks rebounded on Wednesday on the back of the Trump administration’s attempt to shore up investor confidence and a report on strong U.S. holiday spending. However, both crude benchmarks are still down roughly 40 percent from highs in October, pressured by concerns about oversupply and over the outlook for the global economy. “Oil prices have rebounded following the stock market’s move, but they are still low,” said Shim Hye-jin, a commodity analyst at Samsung Securities in Seoul. “But if OPEC’s cuts are fulfilled, WTI prices are expected to rise to $50-60 a barrel, while Brent is expected to go up to between $58-70 a barrel next year.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, agreed at a meeting earlier this month to limit output by 1.2 million barrels per day starting in January. Offering further support to oil prices, U.S. crude inventories were forecast to drop 2.7 million barrels in the week to Dec. 21, marking their fourth straight week fall, according to a preliminary Reuters poll on Wednesday. The American Petroleum Institute’s (API) inventory data is due on Thursday, while the U.S. Department’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) is set to release its report on Friday.
