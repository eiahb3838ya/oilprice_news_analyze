2018-10-18,"(Adds output at El Sharara field not affected) By Ayman al-Warfalli BENGHAZI, Libya, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Libyan tribesmen staged a demonstration at the eastern oil port of Hariga on Thursday in protest against the appointment of a government minister, a leading member of the tribe said. It was not clear whether the action affected oil exports from the port, located in Tobruk near the Egyptian border. A spokesman for port operator AGOCO, part of state oil firm NOC, declined to comment. “We are at the port’s gate. No car can enter or leave the port,” a member of the powerful Obeidat tribe told Reuters, asking not to be identified. He said tribesmen were protesting against a decision by the internationally recognized government in Tripoli to appoint Ali Essawi as economy minister. Hariga lies in eastern Libya, run by a rival administration. Libyan prosecutors had in 2011 named Essawi as the main suspect in the killing of Abdel Fattah Younes, a former top rebel commander during the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Younes belongs to the Obeidat tribe. A Libyan court in 2012 dropped the case against Essawi and other suspects. But he re-emerged in the spotlight when Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez appointed him as economy minister this month. Khalifa Haftar, a top commander whose troops control the east, this week ordered a new investigation into the killing of Younes. His killing caused deep rifts in the rebel camp which later took over the oil-producing country. Younes was for years part of Gaddafi’s inner circle. He defected at the start of the uprising in February 2011 and became the military chief of the rebellion, a move opposed by other rebels who had suffered under the old regime. The circumstances of his killing remain murky, but it is known that he was slain in July 2011 after rebel leaders summoned him back from the front line to Benghazi, the eastern city and cradle of the uprising. Separately, gunmen stole two company cars at a control station of Libya’s giant El Sharara oilfield on Thursday, a field engineer said. Output has not been affected, he added. The field typically produces around 300,000 barrels a day. Station 186, about 40km away from the main part of the field deep in the southern desert, has been attacked by gunmen several times. In July, two staff, one of them Romanian, were kidnapped there and have not been heard from since. Output dropped temporarily by around 160,000 barrels a day after the attack, leading to a shutdown of the station before later recovering to former levels. Tripoli-based NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor, formerly known as Statoil. Last week, NOC staff staged small protests at three fields demanding salary increases, better work conditions and security.

2018-10-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said on Thursday the agency has the authority to allow sales of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline year-round without an act of Congress, and hopes the oil industry will drop its threat of a lawsuit to stop the move. “We do have the authority to move forward on E15,” Wheeler told reporters after an event with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in Washington. “And I hope the oil industry would join us in helping make (U.S. biofuel policy) function better for the American public, rather than taking it to court.” President Donald Trump announced last week that he was directing the EPA to lift a summer ban on sales of so-called E15 to help farmers, a move cheered by the corn lobby but opposed by the oil industry, which threatened to sue to block it.  The oil industry is concerned that expanding sales of corn-based ethanol will cut into its share of the fuel market. The Environmental Protection Agency prohibits summer sales of E15 in certain areas because of smog concerns.

2018-10-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell sharply on Thursday while the Japanese yen rose in a move toward safety assets, with traders citing the Sino-U.S. trade war, Italy’s budget concerns and a widening gap between the United States and Saudi Arabia. European stocks closed near the day’s lows and Wall Street slid after the European Commission said Italy’s 2019 budget draft is in “particularly serious” breach of EU budget rules, a step that prepares the ground for what would be an unprecedented rejection of a member state’s fiscal plan. Italy’s 5-year yield hit its highest since October 2013 and its 10-year yield IT10YT=RR brushed against a 4-1/2 year high. The safe-haven yen rose for the eighth session in the last 11. Also weighing on market sentiment, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would not attend next week’s investment conference in Saudi Arabia. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday it “certainly looks” like U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is dead. Khashoggi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Worries over rising U.S. rates and a stronger dollar added to the sour tone, as well as the effect of a trade war between Washington and Beijing. Shanghai's benchmark stock index .SSEC tumbled overnight to close at a near four-year low and China's premier warned of risks to the economy. “The acceleration in market decline coincided with news that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is the latest official to pull out of the upcoming Saudi Arabian investment conference,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago. “Certainly other factors are at play as well – China being down 2.9 percent, the Italian budget debate and potential spillover implications for the global economy, etc,” he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 327.23 points, or 1.27 percent, to 25,379.45, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 40.43 points, or 1.44 percent, to 2,768.78 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 157.56 points, or 2.06 percent, to 7,485.14. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.51 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 1.21 percent. Emerging market assets were weighed down by the rising dollar and concerns about higher U.S. interest rates.     “The last thing emerging markets, or the U.S. yield curve or equities, want is a reminder that U.S. rates are going to keep going up,” Rabobank analysts told clients in a note.  Emerging market stocks lost 1.30 percent, while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.81 percent lower. The dollar rose as minutes of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting showed that every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed that borrowing costs were set to rise further. That reinforced expectations that U.S. yields will rise further despite President Donald Trump’s view that the Fed is tightening too much. The greenback extended Wednesday’s gains against a basket of its rivals on the Fed’s perceived hawkish stance. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.39 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.41 percent to $1.1452. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.302, down 0.71 percent on the day. The safe-haven Japanese yen strengthened 0.41 percent versus the greenback at 112.19 per dollar. Oil prices fell on concerns that the trade war will slow global growth and demand for crude and as U.S. crude inventories suggested ample supply. The Saudi-U.S. tension and falling Iranian exports kept the decline in check. “The real driver of this correction is concerns surrounding demand growth and trade issues,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The world has backed off its highs.” U.S. crude CLc1 fell 1.51 percent to $68.70 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $79.35, down 0.87 percent on the day. In the Treasuries market, the 10-year yield was little changed after earlier rising to a one-week high as the equities sell-off offset worries about the number of upcoming interest rate increases from the Fed. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 1/32 in price to yield 3.1748 percent, from 3.179 percent late on Wednesday. Metals fell on concern over Chinese growth.

2018-10-18,"(Updates with Engro statement) By Asif Shahzad and Kay Johnson ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Pakistan’s new government will renegotiate agreements for two liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals, the country’s petroleum minister said on Thursday, part of a wider investigation into deals struck by the previous government. Petroleum Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said the government of ousted premier Nawaz Sharif agreed to pay too much to Pakistan’s Engro Corp Ltd for at least one of the terminals. “The decision is that this will be renegotiated with the parties,” Khan told reporters on Thursday. Engro did not address the prospect of renegotiation in a statement late on Thursday. It responded to the minister’s suggestion of impropriety by saying the bidding for the contract was done “in an auditable and transparent manner”, adding that LNG imports helped ease Pakistan’s crippling electricity shortages. The rapid adoption of LNG infrastructure made Pakistan one of the industry’s fastest-growing markets in Asia, sparking interest from the world’s major energy producers and traders. Engro, Pakistan’s largest listed conglomerate, built the country’s first LNG terminal in 2015 and has said it will begin building another one starting in early 2019. It was not immediately clear if both LNG contracts the petroleum minister spoke of were with Engro, though it was the only company he named. Pakistan has two operational LNG terminals, one built by Engro, and several more planned. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government came to power in July, riding on a wave of anti-corruption rhetoric. Sharif was sentenced to 10 years in prison this year following his removal from office by the Supreme Court. His party denies all charges of corruption while it was in power from 2013. Petroleum minister Khan made no direct claim of corruption in the LNG deals but said the contracts gave a maximum return on equity of up to 44 percent, which he said was far above the industry standard. He implied that the government would take further action if it is not satisfied with future negotiations with Engro. “We will renegotiate with them, will sit with them, will talk with them, and...if it doesn’t work, then there are other remedies, which will be considered,” he said. Sharif’s former petroleum minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who became prime minister after Sharif was removed from office, is currently under investigation by the state anti-corruption body over an unnamed LNG deal. Abbasi, who led Pakistan’s push to develop LNG infrastructure to end electricity outages of up to 12 hours per day, denies any wrongdoing. Party officials say corruption cases against Sharif and other officials are a conspiracy by the judiciary and military to bring down their previous government. The army and courts deny any interference in politics.

2018-10-18,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as investors’ concerns returned to the impact an escalating trade row between China and the United States will have on oil demand growth and data showing ample supplies. Global benchmark Brent crude has fallen almost $8 per barrel since reaching a four-year high of $86.74 on Oct. 3, weakened by lower forecasts for global economic growth as the United States and China impose tariffs on billions of dollars of each others’ goods.  Brent crude settled at $79.29 per barrel, down 76 cents. U.S. crude was down $1.10, or 1.6 percent, at $68.65.  “The real driver of this correction is concerns surrounding demand growth and trade issues,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The world has backed off its highs.”  On Oct. 9 the International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, partly due to the toll trade policy tensions and the imposition of import tariffs were taking on commerce. It predicted 3.7 percent global growth in both 2018 and 2019, down from its July forecast of 3.9 percent growth for both years.  Earlier, Brent fell below $79 per barrel the day after a U.S. Energy Department report showed oil producers had put 22 million barrels in storage tanks over the past four weeks. U.S. refineries entering maintenance season, in which major plants go offline for four to six weeks, has also weighed on crude demand and prices.  “You’ve got supplies where they are and you’re in the time of year when you have refining turnarounds,” said Mike O’Donnell, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.  Investors also turned their attention to the impending loss of Iran’s crude exports after the United States re-imposes sanctions in early November. Saudi Arabia said this month it would ramp up production by 300,000 barrels per day to help offset a sharp reduction of Iran’s crude exports next month.  But investors remained skeptical any country has enough spare capacity to make up for loss of crude from Iran, one of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ largest producers, analysts said.

2018-10-18,"PARIS (Reuters) - French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA) cut its full-year market forecasts on Thursday and said a sales slowdown would worsen in the fourth quarter, blaming weaker Chinese vehicle demand and new emissions standards that have hit European registrations. Michelin’s own sales volumes are now expected to show only a “slight increase” for 2018, the company said. It had previously pledged to increase sales in line with more robust market growth expectations, in guidance reiterated on Sept. 13. The fallout from slowing car- and truck-tyre demand in China and a European auto registrations slump linked to tougher new emissions tests has proven worse than expected, Chief Finance Officer Marc Henry told reporters on a call.  “All of these markets are going to be in decline by comparison with the forecasts we had made,” he said. The company posted a 5.2 percent increase in third-quarter revenue to 5.62 billion euros ($6.44 billion) as it reported sales four days earlier than planned. But tire sales to carmakers fell 5 percent in China and Western Europe - where the tougher new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) has led to model approval delays and withdrawals. Michelin, which had earlier pledged to increase 2018 recurring operating profit, said its growth would amount to at least 200 million euros before exchange-rate effects. But it slashed 2018 market growth forecasts to 0.5 percent for car tires, instead of the previously forecast 1.5 percent; and to a 1.5 percent decline in truck tires rather than a 0.5 percent expansion. Truck tire demand is expected to shrink by 5-6 percent in the fourth quarter, Henry said, without giving any explanation for the earlier-than-scheduled results publication. The company nevertheless reiterated its 2018 target of 1.1 billion euros in positive structural free cash flow goal.

2018-10-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday for a second time asked the U.S. Supreme Court to put the brakes on a lawsuit filed by young activists who have accused the U.S. government of ignoring the perils of climate change. In the lawsuit, 21 activists, ages 11 to 22, said federal officials violated their rights to due process under the U.S. Constitution by failing to adequately address carbon pollution such as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 against former President Barack Obama and government agencies in a federal court in Eugene, Oregon. Both the Obama and Trump administration have failed in efforts to have the lawsuit thrown out. On July 30, the high court rejected an earlier application by the Trump administration, saying it was premature. Eugene, Oregon-based federal judge Ann Aiken on Monday issued another ruling allowing the case to move forward to trial on Oct. 29 if either the high court or the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals do not intervene.

2018-10-18,"GENEVA, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Rising U.S. crude oil exports to Europe and Asia have had a knock-on effect in the futures market, turning the U.S. West Texas Intermediate contract into a near-24 hour benchmark, exchange operator CME Group said. Owain Johnson, managing director for energy research and development at CME, said the shift has also led CME to introduce the first change to the quality of WTI crude since 1983, coming into force from January next year. “Ten to 20 percent of our daily volumes are trading in European and Asian hours... names that we never came across are now regulars. South Korea and China are the fastest-growing trading community on WTI,” Johnson said at the Argus Global Crude conference in Geneva, Switzerland. “You’re getting a 23-hour benchmark... The more liquidity on futures, the more liquidity on the options. Options are really starting to trade in depth and in Euro and Asian hours.” The CME shuts down for one hour every day for maintenance. Johnson said he sees a trend in which the biggest benchmarks are going global while smaller ones are withering away. U.S. shale and heavy Canadian crudes have had a major impact on the quality of crude for export. After refiners complained about blended grades dubbed “Franken-crudes”, the CME announced last year that five new tests would be conducted to ensure quality consistency. The tests are being introduced gradually and the industry must comply with them fully by January next year. “We wanted to ensure that the barrel at Cushing is a clean barrel that does not have too much blended high-metals Canadian material in it,” he said, referring to the traditional hub for WTI in Cushing, Oklahoma. The changes have already largely been adopted and priced in ahead of the official shift in January, he said. The CME has been launching new U.S. oil contracts for new crude grades as spreads to WTI that have been picked up quickly by the market, Johnson said. “They are some of the fastest-growing launches. New derivatives are very liquid for new U.S. grades. It’s trading very aggressively, mainly through brokers... and they’re popular with Asian and European importers,” he said. Furthermore, as the significance of landlocked Cushing wanes as a hub, the global exchanges are racing to introduce new contracts out of Houston. On Nov. 5, the CME will launch a deliverable contract called WTI Houston based off three terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Rival Intercontinental Exchange announced a similar delivered contract in July.

The firm’s former deputy chairman, Mohammed Mahfouz al-Ansari, and two other officials face a criminal trial on charges that they manipulated the company’s books and sent about $960 million into personal foreign bank accounts between 2011 and 2015. The firm, then known as Tri Ocean, has since been renamed Mog Energy. MENA and the source did not name the other two executies, giving only their initials, M.M.A and M.F.H. Tamer Mostafa Ragheb, the current deputy chairman of Mog Energy, was questioned during the prosecution’s investigation but was not a suspect, MENA and the source said. Ragheb’s statements to investigators led them to believe that the three defendants transferred over $18 million to personal bank accounts in Doha and Dubai between Feb. 2012 and September of that year, MENA said.

Stocks, already under pressure from rising borrowing costs, were further weighed by concern over a simmering U.S.-Sino trade war. Shanghai’s benchmark index closed at a near four-year low and China’s premier warned of risks to the economy. European shares were little changed and the S&P 500 was on track to fall for the ninth session in the past eleven. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting showed every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed that borrowing costs were set to rise further. That reinforced expectations that U.S. yields will rise further despite President Donald Trump’s view that the Fed is tightening too much. “If interest rates continue to move higher from their current levels, investors will become even more reluctant to buy the dips in stocks,” Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, wrote in a note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 45.49 points, or 0.18 percent, to 25,661.19, the S&P 500 lost 6.26 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,802.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 44.42 points, or 0.58 percent, to 7,598.28. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.04 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.37 percent. Emerging market assets were weighed by the rising dollar. “The last thing emerging markets, or the U.S. yield curve or equities, want is a reminder that U.S. rates are going to keep going up,” Rabobank analysts told clients in a note. Emerging market stocks lost 0.97 percent, while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.56 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.80 percent. The greenback slightly extended the previous day’s gains against a basket of its rivals on the Fed’s perceived hawkish stance. The dollar index rose 0.18 percent, with the euro down 0.09 percent to $1.1489. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.12 percent versus the greenback at 112.52 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3071, down 0.32 percent on the day. In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury Department said a recent depreciation of China’s yuan currency will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, and U.S. officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly intervene in the currency’s value. The yuan fell 0.16 percent to 6.9387 per dollar, its weakest level since January 2017. Oil prices fell as the fourth weekly increase in U.S. crude inventories suggested ample supply, while Saudi-U.S. tension and falling Iranian exports kept the decline in check. “Stocks are building,” said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix. “It’s a continuous trend. Week after week, it does start to add up.” U.S. crude fell 0.4 percent to $69.47 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.54, down 0.64 percent on the day. In the Treasuries market, the 10-year yield hit a one-week high on worries about the number of interest rate increases from the Fed. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.2013 percent, from 3.179 percent late on Wednesday. The 30-year bond last fell 15/32 in price to yield 3.3713 percent, from 3.346 percent late on Wednesday. Reporting by Rodrigo Campos, Karen Brettell and Richard Leong

2018-10-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices and calendar spreads have softened significantly this month as traders became more confident about the availability of supplies towards the end of the year and into early 2019. Iran’s exports have not declined as much as predicted a couple of months ago and it is now clear they will not fall to zero, even after U.S. sanctions are re-imposed next month. Refiners in Turkey, India and possibly China are reportedly negotiating with U.S. officials over waivers to enable them to continue purchasing at least some Iranian oil after Nov. 4. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers have boosted their exports in response to the earlier rise in prices and pressure from the United States to cool the market. Traders, meanwhile, have become more cautious about the consumption outlook for the rest of 2018/19, with most indicators pointing to a loss of economic momentum outside the United States. (Graphic: reut.rs/2yNy61I) As a result, most major forecasters are now predicting a significant acceleration in non-OPEC oil supplies in 2019 as well as slower growth in consumption, shifting the outlook from one of continuing deficits back towards a surplus. In part, the improved supply picture has come about because the surge in oil prices during August and September forced both the White House and Saudi Arabia to adapt their positions. The United States has softened its insistence on forcing Iran’s exports towards zero, while Saudi Arabia has ramped up its own exports in October and November to alleviate fears about a possible shortage. In effect, the oil market found the pain threshold for the U.S. administration, which lies at around $80 per barrel for Brent, and pushed prices high enough to enforce a partial course correction from policymakers. As the supply outlook has improved, traders have begun to scale back bets on a crude crunch occurring towards the end of the year. Hedge funds and other money managers sold futures and options linked to Brent prices equivalent to 21 million barrels in the two weeks ending on Oct. 9, after buying 172 million barrels over the previous five weeks. Portfolio managers have also sold contracts linked to WTI prices equivalent to 90 million barrels over the last five weeks, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges. Total hedge fund long positions in crude have fallen to 865 million barrels, from a recent high of 908 million in late September, while short positions have risen to 93 million barrels from 65 million. As hedge-fund buying has turned into selling, spot prices have come under pressure, with front-month Brent futures retreating from a four-year high of $86 on Oct. 3 to just over $80 on Wednesday and below that so far on Thursday. As hedge fund managers tend to concentrate their holdings in contracts close to expiry, which are more liquid, selling pressure has been most pronounced at the front end of the futures curve. Nearby futures prices have fallen much more heavily than contracts with longer to run before expiry, shifting the entire futures curve from a steep backwardation closer to flat. Brent’s six-month calendar spread has eased from a backwardation of more than $2 per barrel at the start of the month to just over $1 on Wednesday. (tmsnrt.rs/2OAMfKf). In the past, the Brent calendar spread has been a reliable indicator of the supply-demand balance, and the recent softening of the spread is consistent with an improved near-term outlook for global oil supplies.

2018-10-18,"* ABB looking at selling majority or minority stake - sources * Infrastructure funds, industry buyers are interested * ABB kept business two years ago despite shareholder pressure * Business could be worth around $11 billion By John Revill, Oliver Hirt and Arno Schuetze ZURICH/FRANKFURT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - ABB is exploring a sale of its Power Grids business, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, representing a U-turn by Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer who defied activist shareholders to keep the unit two years ago. ABB is examining various options for Power Grids, its second-largest but lowest-margin business, three sources said, with a decision likely by early next year. “The company is looking at separating its Power Grids business,” one source said. “A sale of a majority is the preferred option at moment, although selling a minority or spinning it off are also possible.” “Everyone agrees there needs to be changes,” another source said. Credit Suisse and investment banking boutique Dyal Co, led by former Goldman Sachs banker Gordon Dyal, are advising ABB on a deal for the unit, which analysts estimate could be worth around $11 billion. ABB declined to comment. Management and advisers are examining how Power Grids could be separated from the rest of ABB’s business, which runs from industrial robots to power transmission equipment, before the Swiss company’s board makes a decision. “The price will be decisive. If a sale creates no value for ABB there will be no deal,” the source added. Spiesshofer in October 2016 rejected calls from Cevian Capital, ABB’s second-largest shareholder, to separate Power Grids, which sells equipment like substations and transformers to utilities. Cevian had argued that the unit lacked synergies with the rest of ABB’s business, and that the company’s conglomerate structure made it too complex to run efficiently. Since then Power Grids has only slightly improved its performance. Its relatively low profitability compared to other divisions has weighed on ABB’s share price, which recently fell to its lowest level since December 2016. The company’s share price remains far short of the 35 Swiss francs which Spiesshofer said could be possible if the company retained Power Grids, and the level which Cevian said could be achieved by ABB and a separate listing of Power Grids together. “It’s been almost two years since the unfavourable decision (to keep Power Grids) and the share price has developed miserably,” Christer Gardell, managing director of Cevian, told Swedish daily Dagens Industri in August. “ABB must stop with explanations and whitewashes, now they simply have to deliver shareholder value.” Spiesshofer, who has led ABB since September 2013, hinted this year at a possible separation when he said ABB’s current organisation was not “cast in stone”. Power Grids employs 36,000 people and had sales of $10.4 billion last year. It had an operating profit margin of 9.7 percent during the second quarter, a decline of 40 basis points from a year earlier and outside its target range of 10 to 14 percent. If a deal is approved, ABB could concentrate on more profitable areas like electrification and automation. The company could also be interested in buying General Electric’s power conversion unit, the first source said. Infrastructure funds, which normally invest in public assets like toll roads and airports, are interested in acquiring a stake in Power Grids, while industrial companies including possible bidders from Asia could also enter the bidding, a second source said. ABB had been in discussions with China’s State Grid on the unit in the past, but no deal ever materialised, another source said.

2018-10-18,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's imports of U.S. energy: tmsnrt.rs/2OwMDcD By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 18 (Reuters) - It’s probably not the kind of success U.S. President Donald Trump had in mind, but his trade dispute with China has effectively killed off the burgeoning energy trade between the world’s two biggest economies. China’s imports of U.S. crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal have slowed to a trickle amid the escalating tit-for-tat tariff war. Perhaps the irony of the collapse in China’s energy imports from the United States was that this was the area most likely to deliver Trump’s much-sought lowering of the trade deficit between the pair. If China had continued to buy increasing volumes of U.S. crude, LNG and coal, this would have been far more effective at lowering the trade deficit than Trump’s chosen path of imposing tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China. Crude oil imports from the United States are expected to have dropped to zero in October, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. This is despite crude oil not being on the list of $60 billion of imports from the United States that China has now subjected to tariffs. A single cargo of 1 million barrels of crude is headed to China from the U.S. Gulf coast, and is scheduled to arrive in November, according to the ship-tracking data. China’s imports of U.S. crude peaked in June this year, when almost 14 million barrels, or about 466,000 barrels per day (bpd), arrived. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 bpd from the United States, representing about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. Similar to crude, no U.S. cargoes of LNG are scheduled to arrive in China in October, although one vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG facility in Louisiana is slated to arrive in November. In the first nine months of the year, 31 ships delivered a total of 2.2 million tonnes of LNG from the United States to China, representing about 6 percent of total imports, according to the vessel-tracking data. Exports to China were about 13 percent of total U.S. shipments of LNG in the first nine months of the year. As the trade dispute with China escalated, U.S LNG exports appear to have slipped, with the 1.58 million tonnes shipped in September and the 1.57 million tonnes in August being the two weakest months this year behind April’s 1.33 million tonnes. Turning to coal, it’s largely the same story as for crude and LNG, with U.S. exports to China plummeting after growing strongly over the past two years. No U.S. coal is scheduled to arrive in China this month, although three ships are due in November, with one of the cargoes being petcoke, according to the vessel-tracking data. U.S. coal exports to China have mainly been higher-quality coking coal used in steel-making, although a number of ships carrying thermal coal used in power stations have been tracked this year. China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal in the first nine months of the year, representing just 1.7 percent of the country’s total imports, but a somewhat larger 3.9 percent share of U.S. exports. In all three energy products, China is a bigger share of U.S. exports than the United States is of Chinese imports. This suggests that China may well find it easier to source alternative supplies than U.S. producers will find other buyers. The speed at which U.S. energy exports to China have gone from hero to zero may also be surprising, especially since the tariffs on coal and LNG were only recently imposed, and crude is still tariff-free. This may make it tempting to think that China will be able to rapidly ramp up imports of U.S. energy should the trade dispute be resolved. But the risk for U.S. energy exporters is that markets, once lost, are difficult to recover, especially if your customer has readily available alternative sources of supply.

2018-10-18,"(Repeats to additional customers) By Gary McWilliams and Henning Gloystein HOUSTON/SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - In the middle of a Sino-U.S. trade war, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company is turning toward Beijing for business at a time when most of Corporate America is looking elsewhere to avoid the threat of tariffs. Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China’s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet. Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon’s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company’s plans. That combination “will guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,” said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company’s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster. “China’s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,” the Exxon manager said. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2CwGQgT An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company’s LNG investments in China. Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon’s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing. Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides “a sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.” Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex. Exxon’s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals’ exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China’s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country’s closed markets. The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world’s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years. Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project in Guangdong province. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations. His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world’s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy. Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc is the only other foreign oil major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal. Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment. The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon’s in China in jeopardy. In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany’s BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor. The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2wDdglt China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities. That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects. But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China. “Major Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,” said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia. Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil. That is changing, in part because China’s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it. The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases. “LNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,” said Credit Suisse’s Kavonic.

The yuan fell to a two-month low as the U.S. Treasury refrained from naming China a currency manipulator, while at the same time increasing scrutiny of Beijing’s exchange-rate policy. China’s premier warned of risks to the economy from an escalating tariff war with the United States. European shares, though, largely shrugged off the disappointment in Asia. Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC both rose 0.3 percent and London’s FTSE traded 0.1 percent lower. A pan-European equity index rose 0.6 percent. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 25-26 meeting showed every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed that borrowing costs were set to rise further. That reinforces expectations that U.S. yields will rise further despite President Donald Trump’s view that the Fed is tightening too much. “Corporates have done incredibly well but it’s clear we are going into monetary tightening in the U.S. and that makes people worried about global debt having gone up so much in recent years,” said Peter Lowman, CIO at Investment Quorum, a UK wealth manager. At a time of simmering trade war tensions, “people are perhaps taking chips off (the) table and maybe going into cash and short-dated bonds,” he said. Overall, third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are seen growing 21.8 percent, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv. The greenback held on to gains on Thursday. Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar rose for a third consecutive day, trading broadly flat at 95.517. That checked emerging-market gains. “The last thing emerging markets, or the U.S. yield curve or equities, want is a reminder that U.S. rates are going to keep going up,” Rabobank analysts told clients in a note. The euro changed hands at $1.1518, holding steady versus the greenback, after losing 0.65 percent on Wednesday. The euro has lost just under 3 percent of its value versus the dollar over the last three weeks. Major currencies have shown limited reaction after the U.S. government late on Wednesday refrained from naming China as a currency manipulator. In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury Department said a recent depreciation of China’s yuan currency will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, and U.S. officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly intervene in the currency’s value. “The U.S. refrained from labelling China a currency manipulator, but dialed up the rhetoric against its currency practices,” said Sue Trinh, Head of Asia FX Strategy, RBC Capital Markets. The yuan fell 0.2 percent to 6.9443 per dollar in offshore trade. That is the weakest level since a 1-1/2-year low of 6.9587 touched in August. In Europe, an EU leaders’ summit with British Prime Minister Theresa May yielded little obvious progress on a Brexit deal being negotiated between Britain and the bloc. Sterling did, however, turn positive on Thursday after May confirmed she was open to discussing an extension of the transition period after Brexit. Oil steadied on Thursday as support from ongoing tensions over the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist offset a big drop overnight due to a jump in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery was up 1 cent at $69.56 a barrel by 0840 GMT, after falling 3 percent in the previous session to settle below $70 for the first time in a month.

2018-10-18,"(Adds comment from CEO, other details) By Fathin Ungku SINGAPORE, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Singapore water treatment firm Hyflux Ltd, which is in the midst of a court-supervised reorganisation, said Indonesia’s Salim Group and Medco Group had agreed to acquire 60 percent of the company for S$400 million ($290 million), a move that gives it a lifeline for its struggling business. The new joint venture called SM Investments Pte Ltd has also agreed to give Hyflux a loan of S$130 million, Hyflux and the two Indonesian firms said in a joint statement on Thursday. “The investor was identified by the company through a competitive bidding process undertaken by the company as part of its restructuring plans,” Hyflux said, adding that the investors would also give it a S$30 million loan ahead of the proposed equity investment to meet its working capital requirements. Loss-making Hyflux had been seeking strategic investors to raise funds even as it negotiated with other parties to sell its Singapore-based Tuaspring, its combined desalination and power plant, to help pay creditors. Malayan Banking Bhd is the project’s main lender. Hyflux’s Group Chief Executive Officer Olivia Lum, who founded the company in 1989 and has grown it into firm employing 2,300 people, said the new investment will enable Hyflux to tap into the Indonesian market. “Indonesia will be a big market for us,” she told a news conference. She said Hyflux would not need to sell Tuaspring but she did not give details. Hyflux has built two of Singapore’s desalination plants that can meet up to 25 percent of the city-state’s water needs. In the past few years, the company had expanded in the Middle East and Africa using debt to fund its growth. The company’s total liabilities stood at S$2.6 billion at the end of March. It had previously said it was reorganising its business after lower electricity prices hurt its finances. “With our experience and strong track record in owning and operating businesses in energy, renewables, utilities and gas across Southeast Asia, we are confident we can unlock the full potential of Hyflux,” said Medco Group’s founder Arifin Panigoro. Shares of the company, which went public in 2001, were last traded at S$0.21 in May this year versus a peak of S$2.876 in 2010. Hyflux started the process of a court-supervised reorganisation of its business in May to protect it against creditors as it restructured its debt.

2018-10-18,"* Hopes slim for oil flows after difficult talks * Tensions over Qatar, Iran add to difficulties * U.S. asks Saudi to raise output, wants lower oil price * Cost of maintaining Neutral Zone fields rises each year (Updates with Chevron comment) By Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will struggle to resume oil production from jointly operated fields any time soon due to operational differences and souring political ties between the previously close Gulf OPEC allies, sources familiar with the matter said. The two countries halted output from the jointly run oilfields - Khafji and Wafra - in the so-called Neutral Zone more than three years ago, cutting some 500,000 barrels per day or 0.5 percent of global oil supply. As oil prices rose to a four-year high above $85 per barrel this year, Washington has been pressing its top Gulf ally Riyadh to reduce crude prices by increasing production. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Kuwait last month to discuss a resumption of oil output from the zone. But the sources, who asked not to be identified as they are prohibited from discussing the issue publicly, said the talks failed to move the two countries closer to a deal as Kuwait resisted Riyadh’s push for greater control of the fields. “It did not go well because Kuwaiti sovereignty is non-negotiable,” one source told Reuters. Riyadh does not want Kuwaiti laws to apply to U.S. oil major Chevron, which operates the Wafra onshore field on behalf of the Saudi government, the source added. Another source said Saudi Arabia wanted a bigger say and more control in running oil operations in the zone. Prince Mohammed met Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and Crown Prince Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah but the visit was cut short from the originally planned two days to just a few hours on the night of Sept. 30, the sources said. Adding to the political friction were tensions between the two countries over the embargo of neighbouring Qatar and diverging views on relations with Saudi Arabia’s arch-foe Iran, the sources said. Kuwait is trying to mediate the embargo, which is being led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Doha last year, accusing it of financing terrorism. Qatar rejects the charges. Kuwait has sought to maintain neutrality, although the Emir’s efforts to mediate the rift have had little success so far. Kuwait, which has a sizeable Shi’ite Muslim minority, has also maintained dialogue with Shi’ite Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran back opposing sides in civil wars in Syria and Yemen. In a move that may further complicate relations with Riyadh, Kuwait this month signed a defence cooperation plan with Turkey in what it said was meant to strengthen bilateral ties. Turkey has sided with Qatar in the Gulf row and its relations with Riyadh have been strained due to Ankara’s close ties with Iran. “The (regional) situation is not stable, so every country should think how to protect itself,” Saleh Ashour, a member of the Kuwaiti parliament, told Reuters. Oil output in the Neutral Zone, which dates back to 1920s treaties establishing regional borders, is divided equally between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The Wafra field is operated by state-run Kuwait Gulf Oil Co and Chevron on behalf of Saudi Arabia. The Khafji field is operated by state oil giant Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Gulf Oil. Tensions have been simmering since the last decade, when Kuwait was angered by a Saudi decision to prolong Chevron’s Wafra concession until 2039 without consulting Kuwait. In 2014, Saudi Arabia closed Khafji, citing environmental issues. In 2015, Chevron shut Wafra citing difficulties in securing work permits and materials. “Saudi Arabian Chevron is focused on supporting operational activities to maintain readiness for production restart when that time comes,” a Chevron spokeswoman said. “Obviously a restart depends on the discussions between the two countries. But we’re ready. We are maintaining the equipment, we have put a lot of effort into keeping the pipelines in shape and keeping the key wells in shape.” Shutting output is expensive because it requires investments of tens of millions of dollars per year for maintenance, sources familiar with field operations said. The Neutral Zone “is the single biggest asset in the world which was deliberately stopped and hasn’t been producing for three years”, one of the sources said. “The more the restart is postponed the more it will cost to maintain it. And the more problematic it might be to restart the fields quickly and fully,” he added. Industry sources from both countries say that though Khafji and Wafra are not linked geographically, an agreement to bring one field back online would be tied to the other.

2018-10-18,"WARSAW, Oct 18 (Reuters) - State-run Polish gas firm PGNiG has agreed to buy Equinor’s 42.38 percent stake in the Tommeliten Alpha gas and condensate field in Norway for $220 million, as part of its plan to diversify supplies, PGNiG said on Thursday. Poland uses around 17 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year and imports more than half of that from Russia’s Gazprom . In order to reduce that reliance, Poland has increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries via a Baltic Sea terminal and also plans to build a gas pipeline to Norway via the Baltic Sea and Denmark by 2022 when the deal with Gazprom expires. PGNiG said the stake would entitle it to recoverable reserves at the Tommeliten Alpha field of around 52 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). “This latest gas field acquisition in Norway is of special importance to us,” PGNiG Chief Executive Piotr Wozniak said in a statement. “It means a significant increase in natural gas production in the region. It is from here that we plan to send gas to Poland via Denmark through the planned Baltic Pipe pipeline,” PGNiG said the deal would help it increase gas output in Norway by 0.5 bcm a year for the first six years of field production, which is expected to start in 2024. The company plans to increase its gas output in Norway to 2.5 bcm by 2022 from 0.55 bcm in 2017. The Baltic Pipe’s capacity will be 10 bcm a year.

2018-10-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Energy companies and green groups have written separate letters this week to Britain’s finance minister asking for the country’s strong carbon price to be maintained to prevent a rise in coal-fired power generation and greenhouse gas emissions. The letters, to British Finance Minister Philip Hammond, come ahead of Britain’s Oct. 29 budget and after the government said it was considering four carbon pricing options for Britain when it leaves the European Union next year. Energy companies SSE, Drax and Orsted urged the minister to maintain a strong carbon price which they said had been a fundamental “economic incentive for lower carbon and renewable generation to replace coal-fired generation.” Coal power plants produce double the carbon dioxide emissions of gas-fired power plants. The three companies have made significant investments in renewable power generation in Britain, and Drax has recently announced plans to buy a group of Scottish gas, hydro and pumped storage power plants from Spain’s Iberdrola.  However, some industrial groups have warned against high carbon prices in Britain saying it brings higher electricity prices and harms the country’s competitiveness. Britain’s carbon price is currently made up of two levies, a domestic carbon tax set at 18 pounds ($24) per ton, paid on top of obligations under the European Emissions Trading System, which forces companies to surrender one carbon permit for every ton of CO2 they emit. EU carbon prices have more than doubled this year to around 19 euros ($22) a ton, meaning the total carbon price for British companies is around 35 pounds a ton. In last year’s budget, when EU carbon prices were lower, the government said the total carbon price at that time, around 24-25 pounds per ton, was the right level, leading to concerns among companies and green groups the domestic tax could be lowered at the next budget. The high carbon price has helped to make coal generation less economic and encouraged companies to switch to gas generation, reducing Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions. “Given recent gas price rises, a higher total carbon price is now required to maintain this status quo,” said a separate letter to the ministry from green groups including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and WWF. Earlier in October, Britain’s National Grid said coal-fired power generation was likely to rise over the winter as high gas prices made coal power plants more profitable. Setting a price on carbon dioxide emissions is aimed at curbing pollution and helping Britain meet its target to cut emissions by 80 percent on 1990 levels by 2050. Britain is already half-way toward meeting this target, with much of the emissions reductions achieved attributed to a sharp fall in coal power generation.

2018-10-18,"(Adds details, background) By Julia Payne GENEVA, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s state oil firm NNPC has extended its crude-for-product swap contracts, the country’s main avenue to meet the bulk of  its fuel needs, until June 2019, sources familiar with the matter said. Despite having a refining capacity of about 445,000 barrels per day, its plants have been underperforming for years, making Africa’s biggest oil producer almost wholly dependent on imports to meet its domestic gasoline and diesel needs. Nigeria’s gasoline consumption is roughly 40 million litres per day in the nation of almost 200 million people. The west African country became increasingly reliant on NNPC for fuel imports via swaps after a currency devaluation and recession in the last few years, which priced independent importers out of the spot market. A spokesman for NNPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NNPC’s swap contracts currently account for about 70 percent of the country’s imports while 30 percent is done through the spot market, one of the sources added. The swap contracts, known as Direct Sale Direct Purchase, came into effect in July last year and were due to end after one year. They were already extended once earlier this year to December. NNPC paired up foreign trading firms with local partners to do the swaps. NNPC is separately in advanced discussions with some of the swap contract holders to invest in rehabilitating its refineries.

2018-10-18,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers backed a 35 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions from new trucks by 2030 on Thursday, pushing for ambitious measures to limit climate change despite fears over industry competitiveness. The move comes after EU nations last week agreed to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by the same year. The target will be the first CO2 standard for trucks in the EU, which currently has no limits on what accounts for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions. Bas Eickhout, the Green lawmaker shepherding the bill through the European Parliament, said the vote sent a clear signal that the bloc was serious about curbing global warming. The vote, which passed by 47 to 6 in the European Parliament’s Environment Committee, set tougher climate targets than those proposed by the EU executive in May. It had called for a 30 percent CO2 cut by 2030.  Parliament must still approve the assembly’s position in a vote next month. Talks with the bloc’s 28 governments on a final law, which will begin after parliament’s approval, are expected to be tougher as nations with big automotive industries fear stricter rules could hamper growth and cost jobs.    Before the vote, lawmakers were divided on what interim limits to pass for 2025, split between worries over the climate and industry competitiveness. They ultimately pushed for a tougher target of a 20 percent reduction by 2025 than the 15 percent drafted by the European Commission.    The committee also passed requirements for manufacturers to sell more zero- and low-emission vehicles, setting a target share of their new vehicle fleet of 5 percent by 2025 and 20 percent by 2030. Clean mobility group Transport & Environment said the measures should lead to the production of more fuel-efficient vehicles, helping to deliver on the EU’s goal to slash greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) has called for a far lower headline target cut of 16 percent of CO2 by 2030, warning tougher limits could eat into profits and cost jobs. EU regulators have been pushing for tougher regulation after Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) admission to U.S. regulators in 2015 that it had masked tailpipe exhaust using software in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide, most in Europe.

2018-10-18,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Gary McWilliams and Henning Gloystein HOUSTON/SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - In the middle of a Sino-U.S. trade war, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company is turning toward Beijing for business at a time when most of Corporate America is looking elsewhere to avoid the threat of tariffs. Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China’s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet. Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon’s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company’s plans. That combination “will guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,” said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company’s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster. “China’s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,” the Exxon manager said. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2CwGQgT An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company’s LNG investments in China. Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon’s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing. Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides “a sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.” Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex. Exxon’s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals’ exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China’s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country’s closed markets. The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world’s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years. Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project in Guangdong province. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations. His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world’s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy.

For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2wDdglt China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities. That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects. But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China. “Major Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,” said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia. Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil. That is changing, in part because China’s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it. The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases. “LNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,” said Credit Suisse’s Kavonic.

China’s stock markets were hit hard - its benchmark stock index fell to four-year lows - in a gloomy session for Asian equities and for the yuan which approached a two-month low. China’s premier warned of risks to the economy from an escalating tariff war with the United States. European shares, however, largely shrugged off the disappointment in Asia. London’s FTSE traded 0.1 percent higher and Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC both rose 0.3 percent. A pan-European equity index rose 0.4 percent. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 25-26 meeting showed every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further. That reinforces expectations that U.S. yields will rise further despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s view that the Fed was tightening too much. “Corporates have done incredibly well but it’s clear we are going into monetary tightening in the U.S and that makes people worried about global debt having gone up so much in recent years,” said Peter Lowman, CIO at Investment Quorum, a UK wealth manager. At a time of simmering trade war tensions “people are perhaps taking chips off table and maybe going into cash and short-dated bonds,” he said. Overall, third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are seen growing 21.8 percent, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv. The greenback bounced on Thursday. Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar gained for a third consecutive day, up 0.2 percent at 95.78. That checked emerging-market gains. “The last thing emerging markets, or the US yield curve or equities want is a reminder that US rates are going to keep going up,” Rabobank analysts told clients. The euro changed hands at $1.1518, holding steady versus the greenback, after losing 0.65 percent on Wednesday. The euro has lost just under 3 percent of its value versus the dollar over the last three weeks. Major currencies have shown limited reaction after the U.S. government late on Wednesday refrained from naming China as a currency manipulator. In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury Department said a recent depreciation of China’s yuan currency will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, but U.S. officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly intervene in the currency’s value. “The US refrained from labeling China a currency manipulator, but dialed up the rhetoric against its currency practices,” said Sue Trinh, Head of Asia FX Strategy, RBC Capital Markets. The yuan fell 0.2 percent to 6.9424 per dollar in the offshore trade, not far off 1-1/2-year low of 6.9587 touched in August. In Europe, an EU leaders’ summit with British Prime Minister Theresa May yielded little obvious progress on a Brexit deal being negotiated between Britain and the bloc. Sterling did, however, turn positive on Thursday after May confirmed she was open to discussing an extension of the transition period after Brexit. Oil steadied on Thursday as support from ongoing tensions over the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist offset a big drop overnight due to a jump in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery was up 1 cent at $69.56 a barrel by 0840 GMT, after falling 3 percent in the previous session to settle below $70 for the first time in a month.

2018-10-18,"HOUSTON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In the middle of a Sino-U.S. trade war, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company is turning toward Beijing for business at a time when most of Corporate America is looking elsewhere to avoid the threat of tariffs.  Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.M is placing big bets on China’s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet. Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon’s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company’s plans.  That combination “will guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,” said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company’s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster.  “China’s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,” the Exxon manager said. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2CwGQgT An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company’s LNG investments in China. Exxon said last month it would participate in the construction of an LNG import terminal in Huizhou, Guangdong region and provide supplies to it. This makes it only the second foreign major with such a stake in an LNG terminal.    Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon’s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing. Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides “a sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.” Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc TSLA.N this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex. Exxon’s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals’ exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China’s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country’s closed markets. The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world’s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years.   Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations. His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world’s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy.  Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc (BP.L) is the only other foreign major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal.  Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment.

The minutes from the Fed’s Sept. 25-26 meeting showed every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s view that the Fed was tightening too much. With very little enthusiasm coming from Asia, financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE to open 5 points higher, Frankfurt’s DAX to advance just 6 points, and Paris’s CAC to add 2 points. MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7 percent. China’s stock markets were hit hard, with the nation’s premier warning that the economy faces increasing downward pressure, amid worries over the impact of an escalating tariff war with the United States. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index shed as much as 2.6 percent to hit its lowest level in four years, while the blue-chip CSI 300 index dropped as much as 2.1 percent, not far from its more than two-year low marked previous day. China’s lending data released on Wednesday gave little reassurance for investors ahead of third quarter gross domestic product data set for release on Friday, that is expected to show the slowest growth since the global financial crisis. “The overall falling trend of total social financing growth remains unchanged, and the loosening of the credit situation that the market has been waiting for has not yet emerged,” analysts at Ping An Securities in Hong Kong said in a note. The rest of Asia also struggled, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index easing 0.7 percent and Japan’s Nikkei average closing down 0.8 percent. Data out earlier in the day showed Japan’s exports dropped for the first time since late 2016, hit by declines in shipments to the United States and China. The U.S. dollar and Treasury yields rose to its highest levels in a week on Wednesday. The dollar index, which measures its value against six major peers, rose as high as 95.765, its fresh one week-high. 10 year Treasury yield last stood at 3.207 percent, 2.8 basis points higher than the U.S. close. The euro changed hands at $1.1487, holding steady versus the greenback, after losing 0.65 percent on Wednesday. The euro has lost just under 3 percent of its value versus the dollar over the last three weeks. Major currencies have shown limited reaction after the U.S. government late on Wednesday refrained from naming China or any other trading partner as a currency manipulator, as it leans on import tariffs to try to cut a trade deficit with China, soothing investor sentiment in Asia. In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury Department said a recent depreciation of China’s yuan currency will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, but U.S. officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly intervene in the currency’s value. The yuan was steady at 6.9390 per dollar in the offshore trade, not far off 1-1/2-year low of 6.9587 touched in August. The onshore yuan fell to as low as 6.9422 at one point, the lowest level since January last year. But some investors remain wary of a slide towards the psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar. “The continued risk of a fresh bout of weakness (in the yuan) cannot be ignored” with U.S. Treasury yields beginning to creep higher again, Trump hinting at further tariffs on Chinese goods and the Chinese stocks hitting a multi-year lows, said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon. In Europe, the European Council meeting kicked off on Wednesday with a roundtable dinner, with British Prime Minister Theresa May’s address ahead of it, though expectations that anything substantial will come out of it have already been fading. “Hopes for Brexit deal has supported the pound for the past two months. So if there’s no meaningful development, other than longer transition period, the pound could come under short-term selling pressure,” said Tohru Sasaki, head of markets research at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with U.S. futures settling below $70 a barrel for the first time in a month, after U.S. crude stockpiles rose 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast, while exports dropped.

2018-10-18,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece expects to get final bids for a majority stake in its biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum (HEPr.AT) next month after a key regulatory decision on the process, a source close to the sale said on Thursday.  The country’s privatization agency has shortlisted Anglo-Swiss Glencore Energy (GLEN.L) and Switzerland’s Vitol Holding as potential buyers of a 50.1 percent stake in Hellenic that Greece and Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holdings are jointly selling. The sale is part of a privatization plan that Athens and its lenders have agreed under the country’s last bailout which ended in August. The country aims to raise 2 billion euros ($2.30 billion) from the asset sales plan this year and another 3 billion next year. An official close to the sale said that bids for Hellenic  were expected to be submitted “towards the end of November” after the country’s securities regulator decides whether the prospective buyer will have to make a mandatory offer to buy the remaining shares. Paneuropean Oil owns 45.5 percent and the Greek government holds a 35.5 percent stake in Hellenic which has a current market value of 2.1 billion euros, according to Refinitiv’s Eikon data. Greece and Paneuropean Oil want to maintain a stake of about 15 percent each in Hellenic after the sale. Under Greek law, an investor who acquires more than a third of a company’s shares needs to make a tender offer for the remaining stake unless the company is being privatized, which is the case with Hellenic. But the securities regulator’s legal advisers have argued that a mandatory offer will be needed since the stake is being sold jointly by the state and a private investor, the official said. The official said the regulator would decide on the issue “soon” and definitely before the final bids. “Investors want to know what level of financing will be needed.” ($1 = 0.8705 euros) Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou.

Woodside, operator and top stakeholder in Browse, expects the earlier final investment decision thanks to recent progress on technical contracts and commercial agreements for processing gas from the project, Woodside Chief Financial Officer Sherry Duhe said on Thursday. “It is something that technically we’re quite confident about at this point. And the progress that we’re making, in particular on getting very imminently to sign the preliminary agreements, is also supporting that as well,” Duhe told Reuters. Woodside is driving Browse and the $11 billion Scarborough project, also off northwestern Australia, looking to capitalise on an LNG supply gap expected to open up in the early 2020s. “It’s really about us having the confidence to proceed and knowing that the market is there,” Duhe said in an interview after the company released its quarterly production report. Browse, the biggest undeveloped gas resource off northwestern Australia, has been stuck on the drawing board for years as plans for onshore and floating LNG developments estimated at up to $45 billion were scrapped. The development cost has been slashed as Browse will now feed the existing North West Shelf LNG plant, rather than requiring a new plant to be built. And contractors have indicated there might be opportunities to trim the estimated $15 billion cost of the project, Duhe said. Royal Dutch Shell, BP and PetroChina, along with Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co, are Woodside’s partners in Browse. “BP supports developing the Browse resources as soon as possible and is working hard with its JV partners to achieve that,” a BP spokeswoman said. However, a Mitsui spokesman said the joint venture had yet to agree on a 2020 target for a final decision. Shell deferred to Woodside for comment, while Mitsubishi and Petrochina declined to comment. Woodside, Australia’s largest independent gas and oil producer, reported a 25-percent jump in third-quarter revenue to $1.16 billion, underpinned by rising output at the Wheatstone LNG project, run by Chevron Corp, and higher oil and LNG prices. Production for the quarter rose to 23.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) from 20.3 mmboe at the same time last year. In Myanmar, Duhe said Woodside had obtained “encouraging” results from an appraisal of the Shwe Yee Htun gas find, but did not set out timelines for further work on it.

2018-10-18,"BEIJING, Oct 18 (Reuters) - China’s Jiangsu province has pledged to take tougher measures to tackle air pollution over the next three years, targeting heavy industry, energy consumption and transportation in the east coast manufacturing hub. The promise comes as China’s environment ministry accused provincial officials on Wednesday of not properly enforcing anti-pollution policies, including by inflating cuts in coal consumption. Jiangsu is China’s second-largest steel producing province with around 140 million tonnes of steelmaking capacity and is home to a range of heavy industry. The province will aim to keep the concentration of hazardous floating particles, known as PM2.5, below 46 micrograms per cubic metre by 2020, according to an anti-pollution action plan issued by the provincial government. Last year, its PM2.5 reading was 49 micrograms. China’s official urban air quality standard is 35 micrograms, but the World Health Organization recommends levels of no more than 10 micrograms. Jiangus plans to cut steel capacity by 17.5 million tonnes by 2020, ban new capacity in the steel, coke, primary aluminium, casting cement and glass sectors, and shut down all independent coke plants near the Yangtze River and Tai Lake area. Companies in heavy industry will face production restrictions and need to move to designated industrial parks within time periods to be set by local government or face closure, the plan said. The province is also aiming to boost the use of cleaner-burning natural gas and will accelerate construction of facilities such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and storage tanks. Jiangsu is targetting natural gas consumption of of about 35 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2020, up from 21.7 bcm last year. Coal consumption, on the other hand, will be reduced and more than 2 gigawatts of small coal-fired power utilities will be phased out. The plan also targets switching some road transportation to rail and waterways. Lianyungang port will be asked to boost rail transport of iron ore to inland regions. While provinces in northern China are planning to implement winter pollution plans for a second year, Jiangsu said it will also roll out similar action during autumn. Jiangsu is already working with the nearby regions of Shanghai, Anhui and Zhejiang on an integrated plan to tackle pollution and will coordinate its efforts with Shandong province to the north.

The memorandum of understanding between the company and Zhejiang province included plans to invest in a new refinery and co-operate in crude oil supply, storage and trading, according to details released by the Zhoushan government after a signing ceremony in the city south of Shanghai. Zhejiang Petrochemical, 51 percent owned by textile giant Zhejiang Rongsheng Holding Group, is building a 400,000-barrels-per-day refinery and associated petrochemical facilities that was expected to start operations by the end of this year. This is the third such project in China that Saudi Aramco has set its sight on as it seeks to lock in long-term outlets for its crude oil and produce fuel and petrochemicals to meet rising demand in Asia and cushion the risk of a slowdown in oil consumption. Last month, Saudi Aramco signed a long-term deal with the Zhejiang project’s operator Zhejiang Rongsheng to supply crude oil. The oil giant had not yet finalised the size of its stake in the project and still needed to complete due diligence, Aramco’s Senior Vice President of Downstream, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, told Reuters on the sidelines of the event. Saudi Aramco expects to supply 170,000 barrels per day of Saudi crude to the refinery in Zhoushan when it starts operations, he said. The first crude carrier supplying the refinery should arrive in December or January, depending on when the project starts, he added. Aramco also owns part of the Fujian refinery-petrochemical plant with Sinopec and Exxon Mobil Corp, and has plans to build a 300,000-bpd refinery with China’s Norinco.

2018-10-18,"BEIJING/MANILA (Reuters) - Steelmakers in Tangshan, China’s biggest steel producing city, are boosting output as local officials have failed to issue precise orders on output curbs even though the city’s winter pollution restrictions took effect two weeks ago. The rising output means factories and steel plants are emitting more pollutants and Tangshan’s lack of guidance shows that the Chinese central government’s more nuanced approach to pollution curbs may not be working as intended. On Sept. 27, China’s Ministry of Environment and Ecology issued new winter anti-pollution plans that allowed provinces and cities to set their own industrial output curbs as a way to limit pollution, moving away from blanket cuts ordered last year. Tangshan finalised its own winter plan on Sept. 19 that would put companies into four categories based on their emissions output with the companies having to cut their output by between 30 percent and 70 percent based on the category they fall under. The plan will run from Oct. 1 to March 31, 2019. However, Tangshan has not issued a list of the sorted companies, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the matter, meaning no one knows their expected output curbs.  Without the guidance, at least two steel producers in Tangshan said they have been operating normally since the start of the month. “Everyone is still waiting for instructions, but no word has come out yet,” said one of the sources, a manager at Hebei Donghai Special Steel Co, a privately owned mill with annual capacity of 10 million tonnes. “Apart from recent emergency anti-smog measures and scheduled maintenance, we did not slow operations after the extended summer cuts expired in September,” said a manager for raw materials at Guofeng Iron and Steel Co which has annual capacity of 3 million tonnes.  A person at the Tangshan city government public relations department said that they would ask the relevant department about the issue when contacted on Wednesday by Reuters for a comment. The utilization rate at blast furnaces in Tangshan climbed 1.2 percentage points from late September to 61.59 percent on Oct. 12, the highest since late July, according to data compiled by Mysteel consultancy. As Tangshan mills ramp up steel output to chase strong prices, other producers could follow and supply from Hebei province - where Tangshan is located - could rise as it enforces more lenient cuts, said Richard Lu, an analyst at CRU consultancy. “Steel supply from Hebei might be higher than last year, but it is still uncertain if total supply across China will go up as well, since more regions would be included into the winter pollution campaign this year,” said Lu. Average profit margins at steel mills across China are over 1,000 yuan ($144) a ton, according to Huatai Futures. China last winter ordered mills in 28 northern cities to cut output by up to half, causing steel prices to rise 54 percent in 2017. This year prices are up 20 percent.  For 2018, the curbs will still cover the 28 cities though there are also draft rules to include another eight cities in the Yangtze River Delta and 11 cities in northwestern China. In Tangshan, the district of Guye ordered a cut of 50 percent of industrial capacity at its steel mills from Oct. 11 to Nov. 14, the district said in a statement last week.  The district will adjust the reduction rate after city authorities give detailed instructions, the statement said. Tangshan was ranked as China’s smoggiest city in September among 169 tracked by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the ministry said in a report on Thursday.

2018-10-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Turkey’s top refiner, Tupras, is in talks with U.S. officials to obtain a waiver allowing it to keep buying Iranian oil after Washington reinstates sanctions on the Islamic Republic’s energy sector in November, industry sources said. The United States is preparing to impose the new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry after Washington withdrew from a nuclear deal between Tehran and other global powers earlier this year, but is also considering offering waivers to some allies that rely on Iranian supplies. NATO member Turkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighbouring Iran has been one of its main sources of oil because of its proximity, the quality of its crude, and favourable price differentials. Turkey has already made efforts to cut its purchases ahead of the U.S. sanctions, but would prefer to keep up some level of Iranian oil imports past November, an industry source familiar with the matter said.  “They would like to be able to continue importing 3-4 cargoes a month, like they did during the previous sanctions round. But if the U.S. would tell them to stop, they will oblige and work towards achieving that,” the source said. A Tupras spokeswoman was not available for comment. Turkey’s Energy Ministry was not immediately available for comment. Turkey imported around 97,000 barrels per day of Iranian oil in August and 133,000 bpd in September, compared with just over 240,000 bpd in April, tanker tracking and shipping data showed. And in the first two weeks of October, Turkey has purchased three 1 million barrel-cargoes of Iranian oil - a level that would equate to about 97,000 bpd if it made no other purchases this month. CASE-BY-CASE Asked if Washington was negotiating with Turkey for a waiver, a State Department official said the department was prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a case-by-case basis. On Monday, Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative on Iran, did not comment directly about any talks on waivers with Turkey. But he told reporters countries seeking sanctions relief must “explain their specific and unique circumstances”.  Hook said those conversations were private, but he added the State Department was “trying to advance our national security goals and also taking into account the needs of our allies and partners around the world.” Refiners around the world are under pressure to avoid Iranian oil purchases because they want to maintain their access to the U.S. financial system - something they could lose if they flout the U.S. sanctions.  Indian refiners also cut imports of Iranian oil purchases last month in a sign they are preparing for November. Washington’s plan to impose sanctions on Iranian crude could strain already soured ties between the United States and Turkey - at odds over a host of issues from diverging interests in Syria to Ankara’s ambition of buying Russian defence systems. The release of an American pastor last week who had been in custody in Turkey for two years could signal a thaw in relations between the two NATO allies as Trump said he welcomed an end to the “harsh relationship” the countries had over the summer. But Turkey has been vocally opposed to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, and has said it will not cut trade ties with Tehran at the behest of other countries. During 2017, Iran was Turkey’s top crude oil source, accounting for 11.5 million tonnes of its total purchases nearing 26 million tonnes, followed by Iraq and Russia.

2018-10-18,"* Asian shares down; Chinese mainland stocks tumble * Treasury yields, dollar up after Fed minutes; Wall St stocks drop * Sept FOMC minutes show Fed united on rate hikes * U.S. report doesn’t label China as currency manipulator * WTI crude dips below $70/bbl after large stock build By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - China’s benchmark stock index skidded to four-year lows and dragged Asian equities down on Thursday, as renewed fears of a broadening economic impact from an escalating Sino-U.S. trade conflict sapped confidence. The dollar, however, was in fine fettle, hitting a one-week high after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting backed market expectations for borrowing costs to rise further. While the Fed’s policy outlook suggested the U.S. economy was humming along nicely, the spectre of rising dollar yields, which along with trade tensions were at the centre of last week’s global equities rout, dented appetite for risk. China’s stock markets were hit hard, with the nation’s premier warning that the economy faces increasing downward pressure. MSCI broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index shed as much as 2.2 percent to hit its lowest level in four years, while the blue-chip CSI 300 index dropped as much as 1.8 percent, not far from its more than two-year low marked previous day. Analysts at Pingan Securities said in a note that lending data released on Wednesday failed to reassure investors looking for more government support amid signs of slowing growth. “The overall falling trend of total social financing growth remains unchanged, and the loosening of the credit situation that the market has been waiting for has not yet emerged.” The rest of Asia also struggled, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index easing 0.4 percent and Japan’s Nikkei average slipping 0.7 percent. Data out earlier in the day showed exports from the world’s third-biggest economy dropped for the first time since late 2016, hit by declines in shipments to the United States and China. The U.S. dollar index and Treasury yields rose to its highest levels in a week on Wednesday. The dollar index, which measures its value against six major peers, last traded at 95.703, little changed on the day, after rising to a fresh one week-high earlier in the day. 10 year Treasury yield last stood at 3.210 percent, 2.8 basis points higher than the U.S. close. The euro changed hands at $1.1496, holding steady versus the greenback, after losing 0.65 percent on Wednesday. The euro has lost just under 3 percent of its value versus the dollar over the last three weeks. The minutes from the Fed’s Sept. 25-26 meeting showed every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s view that the tightenings have already gone too far. Major currencies have shown limited reaction after the U.S. government late on Wednesday refrained from naming China or any other trading partner as a currency manipulator, as it leans on import tariffs to try to cut a trade deficit with China, soothing investor sentiment in Asia. In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury Department said a recent depreciation of China’s yuan currency will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, but U.S. officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly intervene in the currency’s value. The yuan was steady at 6.9390 per dollar in the offshore trade, not far off 1-1/2-year low of 6.9587 touched in August. But some investors remain wary of a slide towards the psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar. “The continued risk of a fresh bout of weakness (in the yuan) cannot be ignored” with U.S. Treasury yields beginning to creep higher again, Trump hinting at further tariffs on Chinese goods and the Chinese stocks hitting a multi-year lows, said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon. In Europe, the European Council meeting kicked off on Wednesday with a roundtable dinner, with British Prime Minister Theresa May’s address ahead of it, though expectations that anything substantial will come out of it have already been fading. “Hopes for Brexit deal has supported the pound for the past two months. So if there’s no meaningful development, other than longer transition period, the pound could come under short-term selling pressure,” said Tohru Sasaki, head of markets research at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with U.S. futures settling below $70 a barrel for the first time in a month, after U.S. crude stockpiles rose 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast, while exports dropped. The West Texas Intermediate crude futures and Brent crude futures last traded at $69.79 and $80.07 a barrel, respectively.

2018-10-18,"(Adds comments from Braskem-Idesa throughout) By Diego Oré MEXICO CITY, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government will soon inherit a costly dilemma over an ethane supply contract between national oil company Pemex and a consortium led by a unit of Brazilian builder Odebrecht. Under the contract’s terms, Pemex has had to supply ethane well below current market prices. A hydrocarbon that comes from natural gas, ethane is used to make ethylene, which in turn is used to make the common plastic polyethylene at the Braskem-Idesa plant near the Gulf coast port of Coatzacoalcos. The plant is operated by the consortium in which Odebrecht’s unit Braskem has a 75 percent stake and Mexico’s Grupo Idesa holds the remainder. Energy aides to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, have said the contract is problematic, but have not yet said what the new government will do about it. “The contract with Braskem is very damaging to Mexico’s interests,” Sen. Armando Guadiana, of Lopez Obrador’s Morena party and the head of the Senate energy commission, told Reuters last week. Pemex is fully owned by the government. The Braskem-Idesa consortium told Reuters last week it has no plans to void the contract. If President-elect Lopez Obrador were to direct Pemex to cancel the contract, it would be forced to purchase from the consortium the sprawling Etileno XXI petrochemical facility currently valued at $1.26 billion, according to a contract annex seen by Reuters. In a written response, Braskem-Idesa disputed that valuation, saying it did not reflect the conditions of the agreement. The company declined to give an alternative purchase value, saying the contract was confidential. Pemex did not respond to questions about the valuation. Conversely, if the new government opted to stick to the deal, it could only hope for more favorable ethane prices that might reduce its losses. Under the terms of the 20-year-long contract, Pemex committed to selling ethane to Braskem-Idesa based on a formula that worked out to around 16 cents per gallon at the start of the deal in 2010. At the time, market prices for ethane were three times that, at 50 cents per gallon. Current ethane prices hover around 40 cents per gallon. A Pemex spokesman said the contract, which took effect in 2016, “responded to the market conditions of that time.” Braskem-Idesa said the formula was also used for other Mexico-based ethane consumers. Before the facility began operations in 2016, Pemex produced more ethane than it needed, forcing it to inject excess supply back into its natural gas pipelines. Pemex’s production of ethane this year averages 88,000 barrels per day (bpd), but this is now insufficient to supply its own Morelos and Cangrejera petrochemical facilities that require a combined 66,900 bpd, plus the Baskem-Idesa contract obligation of 66,000 bpd. As a result, Pemex was forced to turn to ethane imports this year for the first time as domestic oil and gas production continues to fall, costing Pemex some $50 million during the first half of 2018, according to Reuters calculations, due to the cost of imported ethane at market rates compared to the cheaper formula in the contract with the Braskem-Idesa consortium. If Pemex is left without enough ethane, it would have to shut down the so-called cracking plants at its two petrochemical facilities, and the cost of re-starting them after being idled one week would be some $2.6 million, according to comments from the head of Pemex’s ethylene unit, Alejandro Cruz, at a board meeting in December. In June, pricing agency Platts reported that Pemex entered into a $237.6 million contract with Swiss commodities trader Vitol to supply 720,000 tonnes of ethane to Pemex through 2020. Both Pemex and Vitol declined to confirm the deal. In 2016, Mexico’s federal auditor determined that Pemex ethane exports during a 10-month stretch of that year could have yielded the company more than $100 million had it not been for the Braskem-Idesa contract. Using official data, Reuters calculated a similar $100 million opportunity cost in 2017. Pemex declined to comment on the calculations. Braskem-Idesa said it was incorrect to speculate on opportunity cost or link such costs exclusively to the contract, citing wider problems at Pemex. The consortium said the contract was mutually beneficial, arguing that it helps cut Mexico’s reliance on foreign plastics. “We are not planning on undoing a positive contractual relationship that we’ve been building with Pemex and that brings benefits to all,” said Sergio Plata, head of institutional relations for Braskem-Idesa. Rocio Nahle, Lopez Obrador’s pick to be Mexico’s new energy minister, has said the incoming government will review the Braskem-Idesa contract for possible signs of corruption, part of a broader energy contract review. The consortium’s Plata said he was confident the contract will not be modified. Braskem-Idesa said the contract was the result of an auction process led by Pemex and that “it is false to allege corruption” in the awarding of the contract. The consortium’s Plata said he was confident the contract will not be modified. According to a transcript of a recent session of the board of directors of Pemex’s ethane unit, acting director Rodulfo Figueroa admitted that supplying the liquid is “the most serious problem” it faces. Lopez Obrador’s incoming transportation minister, Javier Jimenez Espriu, is an alternate member of the Grupo Idesa board of directors but told Reuters the contract was reviewed by the separate board of the Braskem-Idesa joint venture. Luis Miguel Labardini, a Mexico City-based energy consultant, said an even bigger problem for Pemex lies with whoever agreed to the contract’s terms in the first place. “We should give the benefit of the doubt to whoever negotiated this contract that they didn’t act in bad faith,” he said. “But they were negligent.” (Additional reporting by Marianna Parraga and Ana Isabel Martinez; Writing by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Clive McKeef)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-pemex-odebrecht/update-1-mexicos-next-government-faces-bind-in-pemex-ethane-deal-idUKL2N1WY047,18 Oct 2018,"Mexico's incoming government

2018-10-18,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - It’s probably not the kind of success U.S. President Donald Trump had in mind, but his trade dispute with China has effectively killed off the burgeoning energy trade between the world’s two biggest economies. China’s imports of U.S. crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal have slowed to a trickle amid the escalating tit-for-tat tariff war. Perhaps the irony of the collapse in China’s energy imports from the United States was that this was the area most likely to deliver Trump’s much-sought lowering of the trade deficit between the pair. If China had continued to buy increasing volumes of U.S. crude, LNG and coal, this would have been far more effective at lowering the trade deficit than Trump’s chosen path of imposing tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China. Crude oil imports from the United States are expected to have dropped to zero in October, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. This is despite crude oil not being on the list of $60 billion of imports from the United States that China has now subjected to tariffs. A single cargo of 1 million barrels of crude is headed to China from the U.S. Gulf coast, and is scheduled to arrive in November, according to the ship-tracking data. China’s imports of U.S. crude peaked in June this year, when almost 14 million barrels, or about 466,000 barrels per day (bpd), arrived. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 bpd from the United States, representing about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. Similar to crude, no U.S. cargoes of LNG are scheduled to arrive in China in October, although one vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG facility in Louisiana is slated to arrive in November. In the first nine months of the year, 31 ships delivered a total of 2.2 million tonnes of LNG from the United States to China, representing about 6 percent of total imports, according to the vessel-tracking data. (Graphic: reut.rs/2yLPIuJ) Exports to China were about 13 percent of total U.S. shipments of LNG in the first nine months of the year. As the trade dispute with China escalated, U.S LNG exports appear to have slipped, with the 1.58 million tonnes shipped in September and the 1.57 million tonnes in August being the two weakest months this year behind April’s 1.33 million tonnes. Turning to coal, it’s largely the same story as for crude and LNG, with U.S. exports to China plummeting after growing strongly over the past two years. No U.S. coal is scheduled to arrive in China this month, although three ships are due in November, with one of the cargoes being petcoke, according to the vessel-tracking data. U.S. coal exports to China have mainly been higher-quality coking coal used in steel-making, although a number of ships carrying thermal coal used in power stations have been tracked this year. China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal in the first nine months of the year, representing just 1.7 percent of the country’s total imports, but a somewhat larger 3.9 percent share of U.S. exports. In all three energy products, China is a bigger share of U.S. exports than the United States is of Chinese imports. This suggests that China may well find it easier to source alternative supplies than U.S. producers will find other buyers. The speed at which U.S. energy exports to China have gone from hero to zero may also be surprising, especially since the tariffs on coal and LNG were only recently imposed, and crude is still tariff-free. This may make it tempting to think that China will be able to rapidly ramp up imports of U.S. energy should the trade dispute be resolved. But the risk for U.S. energy exporters is that markets, once lost, are difficult to recover, especially if your customer has readily available alternative sources of supply.

2018-10-18,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers are expected to back a 35 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions from new trucks by 2030, EU sources said ahead of a vote on Thursday over new rules that seek to fight global warming without harming industry.     The target will be the first CO2 standard for trucks in the EU, which currently has no limits on what accounts for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions.        The vote in the European Parliament’s Environment Committee would set tougher climate targets than those proposed by the EU executive in May. It had called for a 30 percent CO2 cut by 2030.      The sources said the 35 percent target is backed by a majority of lawmakers in the committee, which tends to push for more ambitious climate legislation than the assembly as a whole.     However, lawmakers remained divided over how tough an interim 2025 target should be ahead of Thursday’s vote.     In a clash between worries over climate and competitiveness, left-leaning parties have banded together to push a more ambitious target of a 20 percent reduction by 2025 than what has been proposed by the bloc’s executive.      But the European People’s Party (EPP), the biggest party in the chamber, favours the European Commission’s original proposal of 15 percent by 2025.     “The big battle will be between what is going to be adopted for 2025,” said Bas Eickhout, the Green lawmaker in charge of seeing the proposal through Parliament.     The parliament groups will also face off over whether to require manufacturers to produce a certain amount of zero and low-emission vehicles, or to stick with a credit system as proposed by the EPP and Commission proposals.     A plenary session of parliament must still approve the assembly’s position in order to enter what would be tough talks with the bloc’s 28 governments on a final law, as nations with big automotive industries fear stricter rules could cost growth and jobs.     But Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) admission to U.S. regulators in 2015 that it had masked tailpipe exhaust using software in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide has galvanized EU regulators into tougher regulation.     Manufacturers have warned stricter rules - part of the bloc’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 - could slash into profits.     Earlier this month European Union nations agreed to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030.      The vote comes following Sweden’s Volvo (VOLVb.ST) warning on Tuesday that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions as an emissions control component it uses was degrading more quickly than expected, sending its shares lower.

The dollar index, which measures its value against six major peers, last traded at 95.654, little changed on the day, while 10 year Treasury yield last stood at 3.211 percent, 3.2 basis points higher than the U.S. close. The minutes from the Fed’s Septa 25-26 meeting showed every Fed policymaker backed raising interest rates last month and also generally agreed borrowing costs were set to rise further, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s view that the tightenings have already gone too far. Major currencies have shown limited reaction after the U.S. government late on Wednesday refrained from naming China or any other trading partner as a currency manipulator, as it leans on import tariffs to try to cut a trade deficit with China, soothing investor sentiment in Asia. In its semi-annual currency report, the U.S. Treasury Department said a recent depreciation of China’s yuan currency will likely exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, but U.S. officials found Beijing appeared to be doing little to directly intervene in the currency’s value. The yuan was steady at 6.9315 per dollar in the offshore trade, not far off 1-1/2-year low of 6.9587 touched in August. But some investors remain wary of a slide towards the psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar. “With U.S. Treasury yields beginning to creep higher again, President Trump hinting at further tariffs on Chinese goods and the CSI 300 trading at close to its lowest level since the summer of 2016, the continued risk of a fresh bout of weakness (in the yuan) cannot be ignored,” said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon. In Europe, the European Council meeting kicked off on Wednesday with a roundtable dinner, with British Prime Minister Theresa May’s address ahead of it, though expectations that anything substantial will come out of it have already been fading. “Hopes for Brexit deal has supported the pound for the past two months. So if there’s no meaningful development, other than longer transition period, the pound could come under short-term selling pressure,” said Tohru Sasaki, head of markets research at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with U.S. futures settling below $70 a barrel for the first time in a month, after U.S. crude stockpiles rose 6.5 million barrels, almost triple what analysts had forecast, while exports dropped. The West Texas Intermediate crude futures and Brent crude futures last traded at $69.79 and $80.08 a barrel, respectively.

2018-10-18,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - A week after Hurricane Michael battered Florida’s Gulf Coast with record fury, the full extent of devastation and loss of life remained unclear on Wednesday, as disruptions to phone, power and transportation systems hindered the disaster recovery. At least 30 people were killed, according to local authorities, when Michael plowed ashore as one of the fiercest hurricanes on record to strike the U.S. mainland, pulverizing a cluster of seaside towns along Florida’s northwestern Panhandle region.    Seven days later search crews continued combing through the wreckage of demolished neighbourhoods looking for any sign of additional victims in Panama City Beach, Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe, the communities closest to the storm’s landfall. Distribution of food and water to storm-stricken residents farther inland has been slowed by communication outages and storm-shattered roads blocked by toppled trees, power lines and other debris. Florida officials have not said how many people may be missing.  Teams of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were trying to reach more than 700 Florida residents reported unaccounted for by worried relatives and friends, said Matthew Marchetti, the organization’s co-founder. Most of that number, down from 2,100 people the group was trying to locate in the immediate aftermath of the storm, are from Panama City and many of them are elderly, disabled, impoverished or living alone, Marchetti said. He said the search had been hampered by spotty cell phone service in the devastated area, though authorities were making progress in restoring communications. High volumes of missing persons reports are not uncommon in the days following a natural disaster because so many survivors fail to check in with loved ones right away or lack the means to do so because of phone and power outages, authorities said. Nevertheless, at least 48,000 Florida residents in the 12 counties hardest hit by Hurricane Michael had registered for disaster assistance as of Wednesday with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA spokesman Ruben Brown told Reuters. That number represents about 7 percent of the population of the 12 counties designated by President Donald Trump’s federal disaster declaration as eligible for FEMA aid to individuals and households. Nearly a third, or more than 15,000 people, reported storm damage to their homes when they signed up with FEMA, though the full scope of property losses remained to be seen, Brown said. As of Wednesday, 286 families left homeless by the storm in Bay County, at the epicenter of the disaster, were approved for FEMA-furnished hotel vouchers, he said. Florida accounted for 20 of the known fatalities attributed to Hurricane Michael, with six more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to a Reuters tally of reports from county officials along the path of the storm. Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida were storm-related. As of Tuesday, FEMA had distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million litres of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, Brown said. The state government was distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott’s office said.  Nearly 155,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills.  At least 70 percent of customers in four mainly rural Florida Panhandle counties were without electricity on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the federal government said that 61.5 percent of cell sites remained out of service in Bay County. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some. Countless numbers of people in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage.

2018-10-18,"TOKYO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Thursday, steadying after a big drop overnight due to a jump in U.S. crude stockpiles and supported by ongoing tensions over the death of a prominent Saudi journalist. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery was up 17 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $69.92 a barrel by 0031 GMT, after falling 3 percent in the previous session to settle below $70 for the first time in a month. Front-month London Brent crude for December delivery was up 23 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $80.28, having ended down 1.7 percent. U.S. crude stocks rose 6.5 million barrels last week, the fourth straight weekly build, almost triple what analysts had forecast, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Inventories rose sharply even as U.S. crude production slipped 300,000 barrels per day to 10.9 million bpd last week due to the effects of offshore facilities closing temporarily for Hurricane Michael. U.S. lawmakers pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership over the disappearance of prominent Saudi critic and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, suggesting sanctions could be possible. Western pressure mounted on Riyadh to provide answers, but comments by President Donald Trump suggested the White House may not take additional action against the Saudis, particularly after Saudi Arabia said it will conduct an investigation. Investors worry Saudi Arabia could use oil supply to retaliate against critics. But Saudi Arabia has assured OPEC that it is “committed, capable and willing” to ensure there will be no shortage in the oil market, OPEC’s secretary-general said on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will struggle to resume oil production from jointly operated fields that produced some 500,000 barrels per day any time soon due to operational differences and souring political ties, sources said on Wednesday.

2018-10-18,"HOUSTON/SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - In the middle of a Sino-U.S. trade war, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company is turning toward Beijing for business at a time when most of Corporate America is looking elsewhere to avoid the threat of tariffs. Exxon Mobil Corp is placing big bets on China’s soaring liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand, coupling multi-billion dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet. Its gas strategy is moving on two tracks: expanding output of the super-cooled gas in places such as Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, and creating demand for those supplies in China by opening Exxon’s first import and storage hub, according to an Exxon manager and people briefed on the company’s plans. That combination “will guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our LNG for decades,” said the Exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity. One of the company’s top policy goals this year, the manager said, is building its Chinese client roster. “China’s natural gas demand is rising really fast, with imports soaring well over 10 percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand, including in petrochemicals,” the Exxon manager said. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2CwGQgT An Exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company’s LNG investments in China. Years in the making, the strategy delivers an added benefit: helping Exxon sidestep a global trade war. Exxon’s massive LNG projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique will not incur the 10 percent tariff China put on U.S. gas as part of the trade war between the Trump administration and Beijing. Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG tanker brokers Poten & Partners, which tracks LNG sales, said the deal provides “a sign that China is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as strategic.” Exxon is among the top ranked U.S. companies that are pushing ahead in China despite the trade dispute, but it is not alone. U.S. and European car makers are opening or expanding China plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs. Tesla Inc this month acquired a Shanghai site for a car and battery-manufacturing complex. Exxon’s Asian and African LNG will offer a cost advantage over U.S. rivals’ exports that face tariffs and greater transport, while China’s support for the project offers a rebuttal to Trump administration complaints about the country’s closed markets. The decision to expand its LNG production and open an import terminal in the world’s fastest growing LNG market is a step by Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years. Woods appeared holding discussions with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on state-run media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the LNG terminal and a massive chemical project in Guangdong province. Since becoming CEO last year, Woods has pushed Exxon to take greater risks, including in energy trading operations. His timing with LNG is key. Next year, China will become the world’s largest importer of natural gas, and its LNG imports are forecast to rise 70 percent by 2020, from 38.1 million tonnes last year, estimates Beijing consultancy SIA Energy. Exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal. State-run power company Guangdong Yuedian Group said on its website it will join the project. BP Plc is the only other foreign oil major with a stake in a Chinese LNG terminal. Yuedian did not respond to a request for comment. The multi-billion dollar bets still faces risks from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the Trump administration, which recently accused China of meddling in November elections and trying to recruit Americans to spy for it. But it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like Exxon’s in China in jeopardy. In addition to the LNG terminal, Exxon received approval for its first wholly-owned chemical plant in China, becoming one of two foreign firms including Germany’s BASF to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor. The terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about $9 billion to build, consultancy IHS Markit estimates. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2wDdglt China in 2017 embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating, a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities. That surge has injected new life into an LNG industry that suffered from plunging prices between 2014 and 2017, which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects. But with prices for LNG rising this year, major producers have boosted investment. In addition to Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell PLC this month gave the go-ahead to a $31 billion LNG Canada project that will export fuel primarily to China. “Major Independent Oil Companies such as Exxon aim for large-scale tier one positions, and in the LNG game that is Qatar, East Africa, and possibly some North American and Papua New Guinea projects,” said Saul Kavonic, oil and gas researcher for Credit Suisse in Sydney, Australia. Exxon and other LNG producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior. In the past, LNG was dominated by long-term supply contracts - especially with Japanese and South Korean buyers - that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula, usually priced off crude oil. That is changing, in part because China’s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy LNG at short-notice in the spot market whenever they need it. The shift away from such rigid price-supply deals is forcing producers to trade new LNG supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases. “LNG players are increasingly adopting an LNG portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers, with over 50 percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects,” said Credit Suisse’s Kavonic.
