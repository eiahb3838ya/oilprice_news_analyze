2018-12-17,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean law enforcement officials are investigating the delivery of Iranian crude oil to state energy company ENAP as a possible source of the noxious fumes that caused hundreds of people to seek hospital treatment in August, a prosecutors’ office told Reuters.  Police and prosecutors raided ENAP’s oil refinery and maritime port in Hualpen and Talcahuano, two adjoining towns 315 miles (505 km) south of Santiago, early on Monday, ENAP confirmed. Enrique Pena, a spokesman for the Bio Bio region prosecutors’ office, said the prosecutor was examining whether there was a link between the company’s transfer of Iranian crude oil to its refineries in Hualpen and Quintero, a town 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Santiago, with chemical intoxications in both areas.  “At this stage, it as a hypothesis we are looking at,” Pena said. A total of 508 people, most of them children, sought medical treatment in Quintero and nearby Puchuncavi in August after residents reported a strong smell in the air, according to Health Ministry figures seen by Reuters. The environment minister blamed a chemical leak and the environmental watchdog has said ENAP was responsible, something the company has denied. The Bio Bio prosecutors’ office gave no further details about intoxications it said had also taken place in August in Talcahuano.  ENAP denied there was any connection between the delivery of Iranian crude on Aug. 4 and the noxious fumes.  “We want to emphatically rule out any link between the unloading and treatment of Iranian crude oil with the episodes in the city of Talcahuano, as well as the emergency that happened in August and September in the Quintero area,” ENAP said in a statement.    “The whole process of picking up and unloading was carried out in a rigorous and professional way, and with due diligence,” ENAP added.  ENAP is the main oil refiner in Chile, which imports nearly all the fuel it consumes.   The United States reimposed sanctions on Iranian oil exports last month to punish Tehran for its involvement in several Middle Eastern conflicts, but relaxed restrictions for some of Iran’s biggest buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - amid fears of a price spike.

2018-12-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on Monday, with U.S. crude tumbling below $50 a barrel, on signs of oversupply in the United States and as investor concern over global economic growth and fuel demand grows. Brent crude oil LCOc1 fell 67 cents, or 1.11 percent, to settle at $59.61 a barrel after dropping to a session low of $58.83 a barrel.  U.S. crude CLc1 dropped $1.32, or 2.58 percent, to end the session at $49.88 a barrel and tumbled to a low of $49.09 a barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude futures settled below $50 for the first time since October 2017.  U.S. crude futures fell after inventories at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, rose by more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. Traders and market participants closely watch supplies at the hub because it is the delivery point for the futures contract and underpins nearly all other regional crude grades. “The Cushing number came in higher than anticipated. ... It’s definitely pointing to the concern that there’s more supply and demand is weakening,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  “A lot of the shale producers can’t make money where prices are right now, let alone below $50, so we’re going to see a cutback in some of the production estimates, but it takes time for that to happen .... right now we’re definitely following the continued weakness in momentum.”  Increasing concerns about weakening growth in major markets such as China and Europe have also dampened the mood in oil and other asset classes. Broad stock market declines in Europe and the United States on Monday dragged equity markets lower around the world, adding to a sell-off that has sent global shares near 17-month lows. Both U.S. crude and Brent crude benchmarks fell more than 30 percent from early October through the end of November as the supply glut inflated global inventories. But they have stabilized over the last three weeks, trading within fairly narrow ranges as oil producers promised to cut production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have agreed to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January, in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April.     United Arab Emirates energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei told reporters in Dubai on Monday that the oil market was correcting and he expected everyone to stick to the plan. Some investors doubt the planned cuts would be enough to rebalance markets, however. U.S. shale output is growing steadily, taking market share from the big Middle East oil producers in OPEC and making it harder for them to balance their budgets. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected to surpass 8 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday. As inventories at Cushing rise, front-month U.S. crude futures traded as much as 33 cents below the second month CLc1-CLc2, the widest level since October 2017.  Russian oil output has been at a record high of 11.42 million barrels per day (bpd) in December so far, an industry source familiar with the data told Reuters. Chinese oil refinery throughput in November fell from October, suggesting an easing in oil demand, while the country’s industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy continued to lose momentum.

2018-12-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Broad stock declines in Europe and the United States dragged world equity markets lower on Monday, adding to a sell-off that has sent global stocks near 17-month lows. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, slipped nearly 1.3 percent as declines in U.S. and European markets offset modest gains in Asia overnight. Wall Street’s Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 506.71 points, or 2.1 percent, to 23,593.8, the S&P 500 lost 54.09 points, or 2.08 percent, to 2,545.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 156.93 points, or 2.27 percent, to 6,753.73. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap U.S. companies fell 2.3 percent, pushing the index into the 20 percent decline from its highs that signals a bear market.  “If Santa Claus doesn’t turn up very soon, U.S. stocks may end this year in negative territory”, wrote Rabobank analysts as the Nasdaq remained the only benchmark in the black for the year, with the Dow and the S&P 500 down between 2 and 3 percent. In Europe, benchmark indexes from London and Milan to Paris and Frankfurt have lost between 10 percent and 17 percent so far this year.  Some investors had hoped for a bounce back before the holidays, but any “Santa Claus rally” has proven elusive so far. Since 1950, Wall Street has rallied by an average of 1.3 percent during the last five trading days of December, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. “Some investors whom we have spoken to had positioned themselves for a December rally and the path has been painful,” broker Bernstein said in a research note. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise U.S. interest rates again at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, but what matters more for investors will be whether it cuts its guidance on rate increases in 2019. The U.S. central bank now projects three more increases before 2020, but recent weak data and worries over Washington’s protectionist policies have fueled expectations the central bank will cut its guidance.  In China, where the economy has been losing momentum, investors will look to a speech by President Xi Jinping on Tuesday marking the 40th anniversary of China’s “reform and opening” policy. China is also expected to hold its annual Central Economic Work Conference later this week, where key growth targets and policy goals for 2019 will be discussed. The top decision-making body of the Communist Party, the Politburo, said last week that China will keep its economic growth within a reasonable range next year, striving to support jobs, trade and investment while pushing reforms and curbing risks. In foreign exchange markets, moves were moderate. The dollar paused near 18-month highs before the Fed meeting, after it gained from a rush into safe-haven assets due to the economic outlook.

2018-12-17,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Monday to a goal of cutting carbon emissions from cars by 37.5 percent in a decade, finally settling differences between vehicle-producing countries and environmentally-conscious lawmakers. The 28-nation bloc has been divided for months over how strict to be on CO2 emissions from vehicles as part of its push to reduce greenhouse gases overall by 40 percent by 2030. Germany, with the EU’s biggest auto sector worth some 423 billion euros ($480 billion) in 2017, had warned tough targets and the drive towards more electric cars could harm its industry and cost jobs. Representatives of the European Parliament and the EU countries finally struck a compromise on Monday, after nine hours of talks, to cut emissions from cars by 37.5 percent and vans by 31 percent by 2030 compared with 2021.  There was also agreement on an interim target of a 15 percent cut for both cars and vans by 2025. “This is an important signal in our fight against climate change,” said current EU president Austria’s Sustainability Minister Elisabeth Koestinger. But Brussels-based green lobbying group Transport & Environment expressed disappointment the deal was not even more ambitious. “Europe is shifting up a gear in the race to produce zero emission cars. The new law means by 2030 around a third of new cars will be electric or hydrogen-powered,” its clean vehicles director Greg Archer said. “That’s progress, but it’s not fast enough to hit our climate goals.” The compromise was tougher than the original EU executive proposal of an emissions decline of 30 percent compared to 2021. Germany had endorsed that, but a push by several EU countries, including the Netherlands and France, raised the target for EU countries to 35 percent. The EU Parliament had wanted 40 percent, so in the end, they split the difference. The German automobile association (VDA) said the new legislation would set high demands while doing little to promote or provide incentives for switching to electric vehicles. EU countries were among nearly 200 that agreed on Saturday to rules for implementing the 2015 Paris climate accord at a U.N. conference in Poland. “Today’s successful outcome is even more important in view of this weekend’s conclusions... in Katowice. It clearly shows, once again, our unwavering commitment to the Paris Agreement,” EU Climate Commissioner Arias Canete said. EU countries are separately considering the extent to which truck emissions should be cut, with a debate due on Thursday.

In North Dakota’s Bakken region, shale production is estimated to rise by 18,000 bpd to a record 1.46 million barrels per day. U.S. natural gas production, meanwhile, was projected to increase to a record 76.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in January. That would be up more than 1.1 bcfd over the December forecast and would be the 12th monthly increase in a row. A year ago in January output was 62.8 bcfd.

The Marshal Vasilevskiy came from Singapore with a cargo on board to commission the LNG import facility with the gas to be supplied to Kaliningrad’s gas system.

The European Commission, which raided the company in 2011 in a move that led to the opening of an investigation in 2013, said BEH had abused its dominance to hinder competitors. Bulgarian Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said Sofia had yet to receive the ruling and decide how to proceed, adding BEH and its units had three months to pay the fine. She criticised the Commission, the European Union’s competition enforcer, for demanding that Bulgaria should privatise BEH’s gas network operator Bulgartransgaz in order to reach an agreement and avoid a fine. “This is strategic infrastructure for the country, directly linked with the national security. We cannot allow compromises with our national security,” Petkova told reporters. The Commission said BEH blocked access to the domestic gas transmission network, the only gas storage facility in the country and the only import gas pipeline in Bulgaria. “Without access to this essential infrastructure, it was impossible for potential competitors to enter wholesale gas supply markets in Bulgaria,” the Commission said. “This prevented any development of competition and ensured a near monopoly for Bulgargaz.” Bulgargaz is BEH’s gas supply unit. The fine also covered Bulgargaz and Bulgartransgaz. The EU action is in line with its objective of having a single energy market in the 28-country bloc. $1 = 0.8821 euros

2018-12-17,"MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian judge said on Monday oil majors Eni (ENI.MI) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) were fully aware their 2011 purchase of a Nigerian oilfield would result in corrupt payments to Nigerian politicians and officials. Italy’s Eni and Shell bought the OPL 245 offshore field for about $1.3 billion (1.03 billion pounds) in a deal that spawned one of the industry’s largest corruption scandals. It is alleged that about $1.1 billion  of the total was siphoned to agents and middlemen. The Milan judge made the comment in her written reasons for the September conviction of Nigerian Emeka Obi and Italian Gianluca Di Nardo, both middlemen in the OPL 245 deal, for corruption. The pair were jailed for four years. “The management of oil companies Eni and Shell ... were fully aware of the fact that part of the $1.092 billion paid would have been used to compensate Nigerian public officials who had a role in this matter and who were circling their prey like hungry sharks,” judge Giusy Barbara said in her reasoning. “It was not mere connivance, but a conscious adhesion to a predatory project damaging the Nigerian state,” she added. She also said money was given to some managers of state-controlled Eni, the biggest foreign energy company in Africa. “Things look even more serious from an Italian point of view with the involvement of the country’s leading company, in which the Italian state is the biggest shareholder, with obvious reputational damage for the whole Italian community,” she said. Obi and Di Nardo have been tried separately from Eni and Shell, which also face corruption allegations over the same deal in a hearing that is expected to drag on for months. Eni said it would analyse the judge’s remarks, noting that a fuller account of the facts and evidence surrounding the deal would emerge only from the main trial.  The Italian company has previously denied any wrongdoing. At 1538 GMT, Eni shares were down 1.8 percent while Shell shares were 1.1 percent lower. Under the deal, Eni and Shell jointly acquired the OPL 245 field from a company owned by former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete, who was convicted of money laundering in an unrelated case in France in 2007. Shell said on Monday that neither Obi nor Di Nardo had worked for Shell, and that there was no basis to convict it or any of its former staff of alleged offences related to the deal. In her reasonings, the judge said two banks - Switzerland’s BSI and Lebanon’s Misr - had sent money transferred to them in the deal back for compliance reasons due to Etete’s reputation. Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi and four ex-Shell managers, including former Shell head of upstream Malcolm Brinded, are also accused of international corruption in the main trial. They have all denied any wrongdoing. Brinded’s lawyer referred requests for comment to Shell. Judge Barbara alleged that Shell executives, including Brinded, had known that Etete would keep part of the purchase price for himself and use the rest to “pay people”, including Nigerian politicians and public officials who had helped him to take possession of the field in 1998.

2018-12-17,"WARSAW, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Dutch start-up Lithium Werks BV is considering Poland and other European countries for a storage battery plant alongside the 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) one it plans to build in China, founder Kees Koolen told Reuters on Monday. Energy storage is becoming increasingly important as the use of intermittent renewable sources of power grows. Combining wind, solar and battery technology would bring down cost of renewable energy and help power grids balance supply and demand. Asian players such as CATL, Samsung and LG Chem have taken a lead in the market by locking in supply deals with manufacturers of electric cars, leaving Europe scrambling to catch up. Sweden’s Northvolt is aiming to build Europe’s biggest battery cell plant in its home market and said earlier this year it had also partnered with South Bay Solutions, a supplier of U.S. electric carmaker Tesla, to jointly set up a plant in Gdansk in Poland. Lithium Werks expects its Chinese project in the Yangtze River Delta to start operating in 2022, Koolen said in an interview. The company’s focus is on lithium iron phosphate batteries which are the size of shipping containers. They are quick to charge and suitable for a variety of uses, including solar and wind farms, as well as in the shipping industry. “If mankind is to reduce CO2 emission through using solar energy, wind farms, we would need to store this energy in a way other than oil or coal. I expect Europe alone will have 100-200 battery factories in 20 years time,” said Koolen, who was also involved in travel website Booking.com in its early days. “We’re considering Poland among several other European countries as a place for another factory,” Koolen added, without identifying any of the other European countries. Koolen said he was still working on project financing for the Chinese factory, on top of the money he has gathered from private investors from Asia and the United States.

2018-12-17,"(Repeats story from Sunday with no change to text) By David Alire Garcia MEXICO CITY, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Mexican state-run oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos will focus on existing shallow water assets and refining next year at the expense of riskier, deepwater projects under a new government that has vowed to turn around the ailing company. The 2019 budget blueprint presented on Saturday by officials of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador calls for some $23 billion (465 billion pesos) in discretionary spending for the company known as Pemex, up about 14 percent from this year. Almost half the Pemex budget is earmarked for exploration and production, mostly in shallow water and some onshore areas. Setting out his plans on Saturday, Pemex Chief Executive Octavio Romero said two previous governments had little to show for putting 41 percent of exploration funding into deep waters: “At best we’d have the first drop of oil by 2025,” he said. Mexican crude output has fallen for 14 straight years. Pemex aims to increase production by almost 50 percent by the end of the six-year term of Lopez Obrador, who wants to reduce Mexico’s dependence on imported fuels. To that end, the budget projects Pemex spending almost $2.5 billion on an oil refinery Lopez Obrador is building at the southern Gulf coast port of Dos Bocas. The facility aims to be able to process 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude. “Pemex’s E&P unit and refining will total 98 percent of all capital expenditures. All other subsidiaries will get scraps,” said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst. Another $245 million in funding is planned for upgrades to Pemex’s six existing domestic refineries. The plan cuts funding for units focused on fertilizers, ethylene, drilling services and its corporate offices. The budget also provides for about $6.2 billion in so-called non-discretionary spending to cover costs like debt servicing. Pemex has financial debts of some $106 billion, among other hefty obligations, fueling concern over its credit rating. Pemex is government-owned and the senior management is hand-picked by the president, including the chief executive and the chairman of the board, who is also the energy minister. Monroy identified two planned exploration and production outlays as “potential headaches” due to their complexity and cost: Chicontepec, a tight oil onshore project, and Lakach, a mostly natural gas deepwater scheme budgeted for $673 million. Lopez Obrador firmly opposed the 2013 constitutional overhaul championed by his predecessor, who ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly and allowed foreign and private producers to bid on developing oil and gas projects for the first time. The shakeup also allowed Pemex to form joint ventures, a common practice in the industry aimed at sharing risks and rewards that Lopez Obrador has yet to embrace - or reject. Earlier this month, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said two onshore auctions scheduled for February would be canceled. Mexico’s oil regulator later said auctions due at the same time for the right to partner with Pemex on seven onshore contracts had been postponed until next October. In the past three years, Pemex has inked three joint ventures, including one with Australia’s BHP Billiton for the deepwater Trion project. While Pemex cedes control on these projects, it attracts significant investment from partners without having to pledge much of its own funding during the initial phase. Lopez Obrador will need to authorize more Pemex joint ventures, also known as farm-outs, to reach his goal of boosting crude output to 2.6 million bpd in six years from 1.8 million now, said Raul Feliz, an economist at the CIDE think tank. “If Pemex has to do it all by itself with this level of funding, it won’t be enough,” he said.

2018-12-17,"FRANKFURT/BENGALURU/LONDON (Reuters) - SSE (SSE.L) and Innogy (IGY.DE) scrapped plans to merge their British energy retail operations on Monday after the industry regulator proposed a cap on consumer bills, leaving SSE searching for new options for its struggling business. This now at least clears the way for German utility E.ON (EONGn.DE) to consolidate Innogy’s loss-making British Npower division it will receive as part of a bigger breakup deal with Innogy’s parent RWE (RWEG.DE). The SSE-Innogy plan, more than a year in the making, collapsed after the companies failed to agree on new commercial terms in light of the proposed cap on energy bills. SSE and Innogy had warned last month the deal, which would have created Britain’s second biggest retail power provider behind Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, would be delayed. Britain’s “big six” energy suppliers have been squeezed by efforts to cap energy bills following a government promise to tackle “rip-off” prices. The level of the cap was tighter than expected and the performance of both companies’ retail businesses had changed since the tie-up was first announced, SSE CEO Alistair Phillips-Davies said during a call with journalists. As a result the deal was not in the best interests of its customers, employees and shareholders, SSE said. Phillips-Davies said SSE would take time to consider other options for its retail unit, including a standalone demerger and listing, an outright sale or an alternative transaction, but said no specific talks had taken place with any other potential buyers. A source close to the deal said that for now SSE is more likely to create a standalone retail business. Innogy cut its outlook for the current year as it will have to consolidate Npower again, adding this would also hit next year’s adjusted earnings before interest and tax by about 250 million euros (224.59 million pounds). Npower has struggled among competition from Britain’s near 60 smaller energy suppliers. An October report from regulator Ofgem said the company’s margin for supply energy was minus 5 percent. E.ON said the collapse of the SSE-Innogy venture had no fundamental impact on a bigger breakup deal, which will result in it taking over all of Innogy’s networks and retail activities, including Npower, and would also not delay it. E.ON and fellow German utility RWE agreed in March to break up Innogy and share out its assets, a complex transaction that is forecast to be completed by the end of 2019. Shares in E.ON, Innogy and SSE were all down 0.9 to 1.5 percent at 1220 GMT. Analysts said abandoning the deal was a positive move for SSE. “We see the options under consideration ... as more optimal for SSE than a merger with a troublesome Npower,” analysts at Jefferies said.  “E.ON would likely have to absorb Npower and would likely spend several painful years to re-structure and integrate it.” SSE’s latest talks with Innogy covered the potential impact of regulatory caps on tariffs, the new company’s requirement to post collateral against its credit exposure and its ability to obtain and retain an appropriate credit rating. “These implications meant the new company would have faced very challenging market conditions, particularly during the period when it would have incurred the bulk of the integration costs,” SSE said.

Rocka, 29, from Cancun, was among the thousands of foreign fans who thronged the city of Yekaterinburg in July for his team’s match against Sweden.  Despite Mexico losing 3-0 he stayed on, and Viva Mexico - the bar he set up with girlfriend Thaylin Mendez - opened at the end of November. “I made this bar for me.... (But) I think everybody who likes Latin music and Mexican food is going to be welcome,” Rocka said at a well attended launch party, as a DJ blared out pop and customers drank cocktails and danced. Nestled beneath the Ural mountains on the edge of Siberia, Yekaterinburg is the capital of a heavily industrialised region some 1,760 km (1,100 miles) east of Moscow. “Fate is so strange,” said Juan Manuel, one of three other Mexican fans who helped set up the bar, on opening night. “I don’t really want to go back to Mexico. I want to stay here.” Russia gave World Cup ticket holders visa-free travel for the duration of the tournament and then extended the visa waiver until the end of the year.

2018-12-17,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans to sue Volkswagen over the carmaker’s cheating of emissions tests, newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Monday. The federal state’s bodies, including police forces, purchased Volkswagen vehicles that were equipped with a device to rig diesel emissions tests and the paper quoted a state finance ministry spokeswoman as saying it was its “budgetary duty” to sue for damages. Baden-Wuerttemberg had sought to settle with VW but a deadline lapsed before a deal could be struck, the paper said. The state finance ministry, which is run by the German Greens, plans to lodge its claim before year-end, the paper added. “We have no knowledge of claims and therefore cannot comment on the content,” a VW spokesman told Reuters. He added VW did not see any merit in claims for damages because the cars in question were safe and roadworthy.  Following an engine software update to address the emissions issues, the vehicles were compliant with German road traffic regulator KBA’s rules, he said. Daily Rheinische Post said another regional state, North Rhine-Westphalia - also an owner of a fleet of VW cars - was considering suing VW for damages, citing the state’s justice minister.   VW said about 11 million diesel cars worldwide were fitted with a device that could cheat emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes. It has agreed to pay billions of dollars in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. It offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.

2018-12-17,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China hopes the United States can learn a lesson and “not blurt things out”, the foreign ministry said on Monday, after Zambia denied claims by a White House official that China is about to take over its state power utility to recover debt. U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Thursday that China’s quest for more power in Africa was evident in nations like Zambia, where China was poised to take over utility company Zesco to collect the $6-10 billion debt. Zambian presidential spokesman Amos Chanda told Reuters that China was not planning to take over Zesco and that the figure of between $6-10 billion given by Bolton was wrong. Zambia’s total external debt was now $9.7 billion including $3.1 billion owed to China, he said. Speaking in Beijing at a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said this wasn’t the first time a U.S. official had been caught out on this kind of issue, though she gave no details on that. “I hope the they can learn a lesson and reflect on things, and going forward not blurt things out again,” Hua said, without elaborating. Bolton had called the business practices of China and Russia in Africa “corrupt” and “predatory” and said the United States planned to counter their economic and political influence. In June, Zambia decided to delay all planned borrowing indefinitely, slowing down the accumulation of new debt amid worries about the risk of debt distress. President Edgar Lungu said last month Zambia was committed to improving the transparency of its debt management and would ensure that debt levels remain sustainable. The IMF rejected Zambia’s borrowing plans in February, saying they risked making its debt load harder to sustain. Finance Minister Margaret Mwanakatwe said last month the government plans to send a delegation to China by the end of this year to discuss Zambia’s debt and debt restructuring.

2018-12-17,"* Asian shares tick up, MSCI ACWI off 17-month low * China stimulus hopes underpin shares ahead of policy conference * Dollar supported ahead of Fed’s expected rate hike * Mexican peso gains after Lopez Obrador’s first budget * European shares seen almost flat By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Asian share markets ticked up on Monday as investors cautiously looked to whether key policy events in the United States and China could allay concerns about slowing global economic growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.25 percent. The CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares dipped 0.3 percent but managed to stay above its November low. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent while U.S. stock futures edged up 0.3 percent. European shares are expected to start little changed, with spread-betters looking at an almost flat opening for Britain’s FTSE and France’s CAC and slight rises in Germany’s DAX. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stocks covering 47 markets was up slightly after hitting the weakest close since July last year on Friday on mounting evidence of slowing growth in Europe and China. China’s economy has been losing momentum in recent quarters as a multi-year government campaign to curb shadow lending put increasing financial strains on companies in a blow to production and investment. Investors are now looking to a major speech by President Xi Jinping on Tuesday to mark the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening up. China is also expected to hold its annual Central Economic Work Conference later this week, where key growth targets and policy goals for 2019 will be discussed. The top decision-making body of the Communist Party, the politburo, said last week China will keep its economic growth within a reasonable range next year, striving to support jobs, trade and investment while pushing reforms and curbing risks. “It’s generally assumed that you will need to expand fiscal and monetary support to achieve those goals. The market sentiment is being supported by expectations that there could be an announcement in that direction after the economic work conference,” said Wang Shenshen, strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is seen as almost certain to raise interest rates at its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday, further enhancing the dollar’s yield attraction. At the same time, many market players also expect the Fed to lower its projections for future interest rate hikes given increasing headwinds to the economy. “You could argue that if the Fed lower estimates, that could be taken as a further sign of economic slowdown,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. “But given the fragile market sentiment, I would think it would be more dangerous if the Fed sticks to the view that it would raise rates three times next year.” On Wall Street on Friday, the S&P 500 lost 1.91 percent to 2,599.95, marking its lowest close since April 2. The benchmark has dropped 11.3 percent from its Sept. 20 record close - the worst performance since it fell more than 14 percent between May 2015 and January 2016. In the currency market, the dollar held firm after having touched a 19-month high against a basket of six other major rivals on Friday as the U.S. economy appeared to be in better shape than others. U.S. retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent increase in October. Still, some analysts said the dollar could be held back by the probability of a partial U.S. government shutdown as President Donald Trump and federal lawmakers disagree over funding for a border wall. The stopgap funding bill agreed earlier this month will expire on Dec. 21. The euro traded at $1.1307, having fallen to $1.1270 on Friday, its lowest level since Nov. 28. IHS Markit’s Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index slumped to 51.3, its weakest since November 2014, from a final November reading of 52.7. That was well below even the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters poll where the median expectation was for a modest rise to 52.8. The survey showed euro zone businesses ended the year in a gloomy mood, expanding their operations at the slowest pace in over four years as new orders growth all but dried up, hurt by trade tensions and violent protests in France. Sterling hovered near its 20-month low touched last week, as concerns grew that Britain was headed for a chaotic exit from the European Union. With just over 100 days until Britain leaves the bloc on March 29, Brexit remains up in the air with growing calls for a no-deal exit, a potentially disorderly divorce that business fears would be highly damaging, or for a second referendum. The pound traded at $1.2580, about a cent above Wednesday’s low of $1.2477. The yen was little moved at 113.45 per dollar. The biggest mover was the Mexican peso, which gained after Mexico’s new leftist government avoided major surprises in its closely watched first budget, sticking to fiscal promises made earlier to investors. The peso rose 0.7 percent to 20.102 on the dollar, edging near a key resistance of 20. Oil prices licked wounds after Friday’s falls on concerns about the global economy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures stood almost flat at $51.26 per barrel, after a loss of 2.7 percent last week.

2018-12-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of new oil and gas projects will rise five-fold next year from a 2015 trough but overall spending is still unlikely to be enough to meet future demand, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a report. Shaken by a sharp drop in oil prices in recent months, boards are generally expected to stick to spending discipline imposed following the 2014 price crash. Global investment in oil and gas production, known as upstream, is expected to reach around $425 billion next year, according to WoodMac analyst Angus Rodger. That compares with a total spending of $770 billion (612 billion pounds) in 2014, which dropped to $400 billion in 2016 and 2017. Although spending levels have slightly recovered since then, next year’s capital expenditure will still fall short of the $600 billion required to meet demand growth and to offset the natural decline of output from fields, Rodger told Reuters.     Oil and gas spending: tmsnrt.rs/2QRy7fY A handful of the world’s top oil companies, including U.S. giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron, said they would boost spending next year as they accelerate developments of highly-productive shale fields. But overall, companies will seek to maintain spending largely flat in order to return cash to investors after years of pain, Rodger said. Still, deep cost cuts introduced in recent years and lower rates for drilling rigs and services mean that companies can do more with their money. In 2019, the number of large new oil and gas projects is expected to reach up to 50, compared with 40 in 2018, and around 10 in 2015, according to WoodMac’s 2019 outlook. Large projects hold over 50 million barrels of oil or gas equivalent. Many of the new projects will be around gas, with a record number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects set to get the green light in 2019.  Those include the Arctic LNG-2 in Russia, at least one project in Mozambique and three in the United States, which would together require $50 billion, according to the report. “The stars are aligning on LNG sales contracts, corporate appetite, long-term demand and costs. But these are huge investments, and investor confidence could waver if we see signs of cost inflation, global recession and falling prices.” The LNG projects will target 100 trillion cubic feet of gas, up from 80 tcf in 2019 and 32 tcf in 2017. Spending could see a strong increase in 2020 if oil prices continue rising steadily and as rig costs are expected to rise, Rodger said. 2018 gas projects: tmsnrt.rs/2Pxhhyt Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Adrian Croft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-investment/new-oil-gas-projects-to-accelerate-next-year-report-idUKL8N1YI38S,17 Dec 2018,"The number of new oil and gas

2018-12-17,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Fractious climate change talks in Poland showed the limits of international action to limit global warming in a polarised world, putting the onus on individual governments, cities and communities to stop temperatures rising. Nearly 200 countries at the United Nations talks in Katowice - in the coal mining region of Silesia - saved the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement from disintegration on Saturday by agreeing a package of guidelines for its implementation. But it deferred rules on carbon credits — a spur to business — and lacked any firm commitment to strengthen countries’ emissions cut targets by 2020, when the agreement comes into force. As such it left the parties a long way from the Paris deal’s goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, let alone the cap of 1.5C needed to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species. The world is heading for a 3-5 C rise in temperatures this century, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization has said. The Paris Agreement is based on individual commitments and expectations for the Polish talks to produce much more than rules for how those would be measured had always been low: the unity built in Paris had been shattered by a wave of governments placing national agendas before collective action. Only a handful of country leaders were present in Katowice and the U.N. Secretary-General had to fly back to the meeting to urge progress. “Political will is missing,” Alden Meyer, director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit science advocacy group said as the conference staggered towards a finish delayed for more than 24 hours by last-minute wrangling over parts of the text. “But it provides the hooks for governments, cities, businesses, civil society etc to do the work to get (to the Paris Agreement goals),” he said. For conference president Michal Kurtyka it was a job well done. “Mission accomplished,” he wrote on Twitter. “Our children look back at our legacy and recognise that we took the right decisions at important junctures like the one we face today.” For nations already suffering from climate change the agreement, which did not make clear how pledged funding would be provided, was only just better than nothing. Simon Stiell, Environment Minister of Grenada in the Caribbean, told Reuters it “is barely scratching the surface of what we really require”. Investors said it would take more action at government level to persuade them to pump in the amount of money needed. “Those countries ... who push ahead with ambitious, long-term climate policies will be the ones to reap the investment and economic advantages of doing so,” said Stephanie Pfeifer, Chief Executive of Institutional Investors’ Group on Climate Change, noting the low-carbon transition was already underway. The United States, set to withdraw from the U.N. process at the behest of President Donald Trump, staged an event touting the benefits of burning fossil fuels, including coal, more efficiently, while back at home, Trump has termed the Paris deal “ridiculous”. A scientific report requested by the Paris signatories said the share of coal-fuelled power would have to be cut to under 2 percent by 2050, along with big cuts to other fossil fuels, to stop temperatures rising more than 1.5C and causing devastating floods, storms, heat waves and drought. The United States, as well as fellow oil producers Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait, refused to “welcome” the report, a term sought by countries seeking to focus minds on its findings. The final statement merely welcomed its timely completion and invited parties to make use of the information it contained. Yet the row over the report was far from the only one: China, India, Russia, Australia, Japan, Brazil and the European Union were all drawn into various rifts, although China won some praise for helping to overcome concern, especially from the United States, that it would sidestep any rules. “I think they have come a long way in recognising they need to provide confidence,” Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said of the Chinese negotiators. Describing Washington as “out of touch”, Morgan noted the rules agreed in Poland nevertheless bound all countries, including the United States until its planned withdrawal in 2020, an achievement in itself. “But that doesn’t´t substitute for the need to build ambition,” she said. Poland, hosting its third U.N. climate conference, came in for criticism for its commitment to coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels. The meeting’s final statement merely “noted” Warsaw’s call for a “just transition” allowing communities dependent on coal more time to adjust. The appointment of Kurtyka, Poland’s deputy environment minister, to preside over the talks appeased some campaigners angered by the government’s previous choice, former environment minister, Jan Szyszko. Szyszko had expressed doubts that global warming is manmade in the past and increased logging in the ancient forest of Bialowieza, declared illegal by the European Union’s top court. However, Kurtyka’s job was complicated by Poland’s environment minister saying he did not want discussion about raising ambition at the talks and Poland’s president vowing not to let anyone “murder coal mining”. A focus on technicalities in the first week was interpreted by campaigners as a pretext to avoid discussions on pledging deeper emissions cuts. Kurtyka got countries to focus on the guidelines near the end of the second week, but there was no collective action to harmonise or improve disparate pledges. “Each delegation has its own domestic interests ... Our role, as the presidency, is to find balance, which ensures reaching a compromise,” Adam Guibourge-Czetwertynski, Poland’s chief negotiator, said in the second week of talks. Poland’s ruling party, the nationalist-minded Law and Justice (PiS), wants to scale back the share of coal in electricity production from 80 percent to 60 percent by 2030. But the production of hard coal is expected to be stable for decades, although 72 percent of Poles think it should be gradually phased out to reduce emissions, according to a survey by state-controlled pollster CBOS in November. Katowice, the heart of Poland’s coal region, is among the most polluted cities in Europe, because many people heat their homes by burning low quality coal, which is the cheapest. Residents say they have no choice. “No climate decisions, even the best ones, will change the content of our wallets,” said Maria Ligeza, an 83-year-old Katowice citizen. “Without help, people will be still burning what they have.” Additional reporting by Bate Felix and Wojciech Zurawski; editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-accord/rpt-analysis-climate-talks-pass-baton-in-race-to-stop-global-warming-idUKL8N1YL0B6,17 Dec 2018,"Fractious climate

2018-12-17,"SINGAPORE/HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam’s jet fuel demand will surge to a record this year as its tourism industry attracts a wave of new visitors and the country’s airlines are rapidly expanding. The country is on track to have 38 million international passengers and 16 million visitors this year, according to data from CAPA Centre for Aviation. That is up from 18 million passengers and 8 million visitors in 2015, according to the data.  “Aviation demand in Vietnam is booming... Fuel consumption in Vietnam will reach a record high this year and will keep rising for the years to come,” said Tran Hoai Nam, vice president of Vietjet, Vietnam’s biggest private airline. He added Vietnam’s growth in foreign arrivals was the highest in Southeast Asia, rising 8.7 percent annually.     The surge in traffic has translated into a rush of jet fuel demand in Vietnam. Through November, the country has imported 1.87 million tonnes of the fuel, according to customs data, equal to 14.8 million barrels, and up 18 percent from the same period last year. “For 2018, jet fuel demand in Vietnam is estimated to be increased by about 20 to 25 percent in comparison with 2017, mostly due to the increase in consumption of the international flights,” said a Hanoi-based trader at one of country’s jet fuel suppliers, who asked to remain unidentified due to company policy.  Vietnam currently consumes about 18 million barrels of jet fuel per year, according to data from Petrolimex Aviation.  By 2035, Vietnam will have 150 million airline passengers per year, nearly four times what it was in 2015, according to a 20-year forecast from the International Air Transport Association (IATA).   Over the same period, India will have 442 million passengers, 3.6 times what it was in 2015, while China will have 1.3 billion passengers, 2.7 times what it was in 2015, IATA said. In November, Vietnam issued an aviation licence to Bamboo Airways, which would be the country’s fifth airline after Vietnam Airlines HVN.HNO, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, Vietjet Aviation VJC.HM and Vietnam Air Services Co. Bamboo is expected to launch its first flights within weeks. It signed a provisional deal in July to buy 20 of the wide-body 787-9 jets from U.S. manufacturer Boeing (BA.N) and agreed a memorandum of understanding with Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) for up to 24 of the narrow-body A320neo jets in March. VietJet, which currently operates 60 Airbus jets, has signed a $6.5 billion (5.2 billion pounds) agreement to buy 50 new jets. GRAPHIC: Vietnam large passenger jet orders: tmsnrt.rs/2SFttz1 Vietnam’s jet fuel imports will continue to surge as the country only has two refineries, Dung Quat in the central province of Quảng Ngãi and Nghi Son in Thanh Hoa province, near to the capital Hanoi, which only started operations this year.  “Both Dung Quat and Nghi Son refineries are primarily catered towards the production of gasoline and diesel, and thus, jet fuel yield is relatively low at 5 percent,” said Peter Lee, an analyst at Fitch Solutions Macro Research. Nghi Son, once fully operational, will produce about 4.6 million barrels of jet fuel per year, said a source at the refinery. Dung Quat can produce as much as 2.3 million barrels per year, according to the company website. “Vietnam will be reliant on imports to meet most of its jet fuel demand going forward,” Lee added. Vietnam imports most its jet fuel from refineries in Singapore, Thailand and China, trade data showed. Despite the steep growth outlook for Vietnam’s aviation sector, passenger growth might may be uneven as the country grapples with capacity constraints at its airports. Vietnam’s biggest airport Tan Son Nhat, serving Ho Chi Minh city in the south, receives about 10 million more passengers per year than it is designed to serve.  The government is planning a second international airport at Long Thanh, 40 km (24 miles) east of Ho Chi Minh City, that will serve 25 million passengers a year starting in 2025.

Investors are now looking to a major speech by President Xi Jinping on Tuesday to mark the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening up. In the currency market, the dollar held firm after having touched a 19-month high against a basket of six other major rivals on Friday as the U.S. economy appeared to be in better shape than others. U.S. retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent increase in October. Against that backdrop, the U.S. Federal Reserve is seen as almost certain to raise interest rates at its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday, further enhancing the dollar’s yield attraction. At the same time, many market players also expect the Fed to lower its projections for future interest rate hikes given increasing headwinds to the economy. “You could argue that if the Fed lower estimates, that could be taken as a further sign of economic slowdown,”said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. “But given the fragile market sentiment, I would think it would be more dangerous if the Fed sticks to the view that it would raise rates three times next year.” The euro traded at $1.1307, having fallen to $1.1270 on Friday, its lowest level since Nov. 28. Sterling hovered near its 20-month low touched last week, as concerns grew that Britain was headed for a chaotic exit from the European Union. With just over 100 days until Britain leaves the bloc on March 29, Brexit remains up in the air with growing calls for a no-deal exit, a potentially disorderly divorce that business fears would be highly damaging, or for a second referendum. The pound traded at $1.2580, about a cent above Wednesday’s low of $1.2477. The yen was flat at 113.36 per dollar. Oil prices licked wounds after Friday’s falls on concerns about the global economy.

2018-12-17,"SINGAPORE, Dec 17 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged up on Monday amid a fall in drilling activity in the United States, but lingering concerns about weaker economic growth in major economies kept a lid on gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.35 per barrel at 0010 GMT, up 0.3 percent, or 15 cents, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. “Despite OPEC and Russia agreeing to reduce oil production by a further 1.2 million barrels per day at the recent OPEC meeting, prices have fallen as the market awaits evidence that the cuts will balance the market,” ANZ Bank said on Monday. “Even a fall in the rig count couldn’t dispel these concerns.” U.S. drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to Dec. 14, pulling the total count to the lowest since mid-October at 873, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies have agreed to curb output from January by 0.8 million barrels per day (bpd), while non-OPEC allies contribute an additional 0.4 million bpd of cuts, in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April. “Oil markets have been struggling for direction post-OPEC with traders reading between the headlines and watching U.S. inventory numbers to gauge shale output,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. “The more OPEC tries to cut supply and drive prices higher the bigger the door opens for U.S. shale producers.” Growing concerns about weakening growth in major economies such as China and Europe also dampened the mood in markets for oil and other asset classes. Chinese oil refinery throughput in November fell from October, suggesting an easing in oil demand, while the country’s industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy continued to lose momentum. Meanwhile, French business activity plunged unexpectedly into contraction this month, retreating at the fastest pace in over four years, while Germany’s private sector expansion slowed to a four-year low in December.
