2018-04-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks across the globe rose on Monday, helping lift oil prices, but shares on Wall Street ended far from their highs after the FBI raided the offices of President Donald Trump’s long time lawyer. Cohen has been at the centre of a controversy surrounding payment to a porn star who has alleged that she had sex once in 2006 with Trump and was paid money shortly before the 2016 election to keep quiet about it. The U.S benchmark S&P 500 stock index gave back some of the day’s gains after the news on Cohen and ended up 0.3 percent after rising as 1.9 percent during the session.   Global equity markets came under pressure last week as the United States and China threatened each other with tens of billions worth of import tariffs but stocks rallied earlier on Monday on views that the trade spat was cooling off.  Financial markets could be whipsawed again Tuesday though as Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to deliver a speech. “The speech is fraught with market peril,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. “You make sure you have no position before a speech that important. He could really stir the pot.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 46.34 points, or 0.19 percent, to 23,979.1, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,613.16 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 35.23 points, or 0.51 percent, to 6,950.34. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.17 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.37 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.09 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.84 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.51 percent. Earlier Russian stock indexes and the rouble both fell sharply after the United States hit Russian companies and officials with new financial sanctions to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.  The dollar-denominated RTS stock market index .IRTS slid 11.4 percent, its largest single-day drop since December 2014, while the rouble RUB= was 4.2 percent weaker against the dollar, the biggest such move since January 2015.  The U.S. dollar slipped against a basket of currencies on persistent worries about the U.S.-China trade conflict while the euro rose following comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that were deemed supportive of the common currency. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.29 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.01 percent to $1.2318. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01 percent versus the greenback to 106.77 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= last traded at $1.4126, down 0.02 percent on the day. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 1.98 percent to $63.29 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $68.55, up 2.15 percent on the day.  “Once again we find the oil market being swept up in broader market sentiment,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. “After Friday’s flight from risk, the positive mood in equities to start the week is encouraging a rebound in oil, with a weakening dollar providing a further shot in the arm.” Oil traders were also watching for the possibility of a U.S. military response to the reported use of chemical weapons in Syria on Saturday. The suspected chemical weapons attack late Saturday night killed at least 60 people had been killed and more than 1,000 injured in several sites in Douma, a city near the capital Damascus, according to a Syrian aid organisation.  U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed ahead of another set of large auctions this week. The U.S. Treasury is set to auction $30 billion in U.S. 3-year notes on Tuesday, $21 bln in reopened 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $13 billion in reopened 30-year bonds on Thursday. The U.S. federal fiscal deficit will balloon over the next few years mainly because of deep tax cuts approved in December by congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Monday. The deficit will grow to $804 billion in fiscal 2018, which ends on Sept. 30, up from $665 billion in fiscal 2017, the CBO said, despite expectations of stronger near-term economic growth than the agency previously forecast.  Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.7808 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Friday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 2/32 in price to yield 3.0142 percent, from 3.017 percent late on Friday. Spot gold XAU= added 0.2 percent to $1,335.87 an ounce.

2018-04-09,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday said it had achieved its goal of powering all of the company’s facilities with renewable energy, a milestone that includes all of its data centers, offices and retail stores in 43 countries.  The iPhone maker also said nine suppliers had recently committed to running their operations entirely on renewable energy sources like wind and solar, bringing to 23 the total number to make such a pledge. Major U.S. corporations such as Apple, Wal-Mart Inc (WMT.N) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have become some of the country’s biggest buyers of renewable forms of energy, driving substantial growth in the wind and solar industries.  Alphabet’s Google last year purchased enough renewable energy to cover all of its electricity consumption worldwide. Costs for solar and wind are plunging thanks to technological advances and increased global production of panels and turbines, enabling companies seeking to green their images to buy clean power at competitive prices. “We’re not spending any more than we would have,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives, said in an interview. “We’re seeing the benefits of an increasingly competitive clean energy market.” Renewable energy projects that provide power to Apple facilities range from large wind farms in the United States to clusters of hundreds of rooftop solar systems in Japan and Singapore. The company has also urged utilities to procure renewable energy to help power Apple’s operations. Encouraging suppliers to follow suit in embracing 100 percent renewable energy is the next step for Apple. The suppliers that pledge to use more clean energy know they will have “a leg up” against competitors for Apple’s business, Jackson said. “We made it clear that over time this will become less of a wish list and more of a requirement,” she said.

2018-04-09,"LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - British power generator Drax could end production at its coal plants ahead of a government imposed deadline of 2025, the company’s CEO said on Monday. * “We’re exploring options for repowering our remaining coal units to use sustainable biomass and gas which we believe could help us to become coal free even earlier than the 2025 deadline,” Drax CEO Will Gardiner said in a statement. * The statement came as the company signed up to the international Powering Past Coal Alliance, launched last year by Britain and Canada to urge companies and nations to phase out coal use for power generation. * Britain in 2015 announced it would end “unabated” coal-fired power generation - plants without technology to capture and store carbon emissions - by 2025 as a part of efforts to meet climate targets. * Drax has converted three of its six power plant units in Yorkshire in the north of England to burn wood pellets, and plans to convert a fourth unit to biomass later this year. * Drax said it could replace the remaining two units with gas plants and up to 200 megawatts of battery storage. * Since Britain introduced a tax on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2013, coal power generation in the country has plummeted. * The country last year saw its first day of coal-free power generation since the industrial revolution in the 19th century.

2018-04-09,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari confirmed on Monday he will seek another term in elections next year, ending months of speculation about his future after bouts of ill health. The 75-year-old said he would seek his party’s presidential ticket to contest elections in February 2019 during a closed door meeting of the national executive committee of his All Progressives Congress (APC) party. He flew to Britain for talks with Prime Minister Theresa May a few hours later. The announcement by Buhari, a northern Muslim who became the first opposition candidate to defeat an incumbent at the ballot box, was widely expected although stocks on the Nigerian market fell 1.01 percent on Monday to a three-month low.  “It takes away the concern of an open race which would have fuelled uncertainty,” said a Lagos-based equity sales analyst. The bond market shrugged off the announcement with the 10-year benchmark debt unchanged at 13.64 percent from its previous session after one trade on Wednesday, traders said. Buhari took office in May 2015 after vowing to improve security and crackdown on endemic corruption, but Africa’s top oil producer fell into its first recession in 25 years in 2016, largely caused by low crude prices and militant attacks in the Niger Delta, and its recovery remains fragile.  After spending five months in Britain last year being treated for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups in Africa’s most populous nation and other critics said he was unfit for office and his administration was beset by inertia. If Buhari is selected to contest the presidential election, it is not clear whom he would face. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP), which prior to the former general’s 2015 victory had held power since Nigeria adopted civilian rule in 1999, has yet to select a candidate.  “The president said he was responding to the clamour by Nigerians to recontest in 2019, adding that he wanted to give NEC the honour of notifying them first,” Buhari’s spokesman Garba Shehu said in an emailed statement. Antony Goldman, of Nigeria-focused PM Consulting, said although Buhari’s party - a broad coalition of groups which largely united to oust the PDP - was riven by divisions, it was nevertheless likely that he would become the APC candidate. “With the PDP weak and still discredited, incumbency is still a powerful factor,” said Goldman. “It would be a huge surprise if he was not the APC’s candidate and the candidate to beat in 2019,” Goldman added. Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and erstwhile Buhari ally, quit the APC in November and rejoined the PDP. He is the most high profile figure to say he is prepared to run in 2019.   The PDP, in a statement, described the president’s announcement as an internal affair within the ruling party.  “Until he becomes the candidate of the APC, we will not spend precious time on his mere show of interest,” said spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan.  Nigeria’s political parties must select their presidential election candidates by Oct. 7.  Buhari led a short-lived military regime that was overthrown in a coup in 1985. His election victory three years ago was in large part due to his military credentials and his vow to end the Islamist militant Boko Haram insurgency.  The insurgents have lost most of the territory the size of Belgium that they held in northeast Nigeria in late 2014 but continue suicide bomb attacks and kidnappings in the northeast.  Other security challenges - militant attacks in the Niger Delta oil production heartland as well as communal violence between nomadic herdsmen and settled farmers, plus a resurgence of separatist sentiments, have flared up during his tenure.

2018-04-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Monday, supported by a rebound in the stock market as concerns of a trade war between the United States and China eased.  Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $1.54 to settle at $68.65 a barrel. Brent prices gained 2.3 percent on the day, its largest daily percentage gain since March 21. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures gained $1.36 to settle at $63.42, a 2.2 percent gain, its largest daily percentage rise since March 23.  “Once again we find the oil market being swept up in broader market sentiment,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. “After Friday’s flight from risk, the positive mood in equities to start the week is encouraging a rebound in oil, with a weakening dollar providing a further shot in the arm.” The U.S. stock market broadly rose more than 1 percent as strength in technology shares and a softer stance by U.S. policymakers on China trade tariffs powered a rebound from last week’s selloff. Crude futures have recently tracked with equities. Oil prices fell about 2 percent on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China over Twitter, reigniting fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Market participants also focussed on an air strike on a Syrian air base over the weekend. Syria and Russia blamed Israel for carrying out an attack on a Syrian air base near Homs on Monday which followed reports of a poison gas attack by President Bashar al-Assad’s forces on a rebel-held town. The Pentagon formally denied a Syrian state television report that the U.S. military had fired missiles at a Syrian government air base.    Concerns surrounding the implications of heightened conflict in Syria, whose main ally is Russia, drove oil prices higher, analysts said.  “It’s more instability in the global oil market and concerns about supply globally in a pretty strong demand environment,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment manager Tortoise Capital in Leawood, Kansas. Prices have been supported so far this year by healthy demand and supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which started in 2017 to rein in oversupply and prop up prices. In physical oil markets, OPEC’s No. 2 producer Iraq said on Monday that it will keep prices steady for its May crude supplies. WTI’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 recently has widened to its largest since January, reflecting some of the investor caution over rapidly expanding U.S. output. However, production from the prolific Permian basin may already be outpacing pipeline takeaway capacity and could prompt producers to slow down drilling.

2018-04-09,"OTTAWA, April 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s Liberal government is under pressure to push through the expansion of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific province of British Columbia. But the company said it would scrap plans to nearly triple the Trans Mountain pipeline’s capacity unless various legal challenges could be resolved by May 31. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s federal government approved the project. Why has this issue arisen? The minority left-leaning New Democratic government in British Columbia, citing the risks of a major spill, opposes the project. This year it proposed new rules to temporarily block increased shipments of crude while it examined oil spill preparedness and response. British Columbia is also asking the provincial courts to rule on whether it has the power to control oil shipments on environmental grounds. Who has jurisdiction over pipelines? While the federal government has the authority to grant permits for major pipelines, the 10 provinces have wide-ranging powers over natural resource development. Ottawa says British Columbia does not have the right to block the pipeline. The provinces guard their jurisdictions and federal governments tend to think carefully before picking fights, preferring instead to rely on negotiations. What has the federal government done so far? Ottawa has taken a cautious line, insisting the project will be built while urging British Columbia to back down. Trudeau has spoken separately to British Columbia premier John Horgan and his Alberta counterpart, Rachel Notley, who backs the expansion and is threatening sanctions against British Columbia unless it reconsiders. What can Trudeau do now? Trudeau, asked what the government would do, told reporters on Monday that Ottawa is examining a range of options but gave no further details. A possible step is for Trudeau to convene a meeting between Horgan and Notley to thrash out a compromise that would allow Kinder Morgan to restart work. However, Horgan insists he will not change his mind. Warren Mabee, an environment and energy expert at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, said Trudeau was unlikely to be too forceful, especially given that he does not want to harm the prospects of federal Liberal legislators in a national election set for October 2019. “It runs the risk of alienating voters in British Columbia and I don’t think this government is prepared to do that,” he said by phone. What more could the government do, in theory at least? Ian Blue, a lawyer with Gardiner Roberts and an expert in energy and constitutional law, said Ottawa could warn British Columbia that if it took further actions under provincial laws to block the pipeline, the federal government would step in and disallow those laws. This provision in the Canadian constitution has not been used since the 1940s. In an extreme situation, using an article in the criminal code, the government could deploy the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and troops to maintain a barrier between protestors and construction workers. Ottawa last took such a move in 1990 when it sent in troops and police to help quell an aboriginal protest near Montreal. “These things never end well, that’s the difficulty with them. The question is, how much do you want get the pipeline built and how much do you want to assert federal authority?” Blue said by phone. What else could delay the project? First Nations bands, environmental groups and local municipalities have launched a legal challenge against the project, saying Canada failed in its duty to consult them. Hearings at the Federal Court of Appeal ended in October and there is no firm deadline for a judgment. A decision in a similar case involving an Enbridge pipeline project took about eight months. Whichever side loses would most likely appeal to the Supreme Court, a move that would cause lengthy delays.

2018-04-09,"(Reuters) - U.S. natural gas prices could rise in 2018 after utilities pulled the second biggest amount of gas from storage on record over the winter, even though the season was slightly warmer than normal. That left total stockpiles about 20 percent below usual at the end of the heating season on March 31, and will require companies to add 16 percent more gas than usual into storage this summer just to get inventories back to normal levels before next winter. Some analysts think the market is putting too much weight on rising production to refill inventories this year, and is not worried enough about a projected increase in domestic demand and exports. “We feel the current market has become far too complacent and that prices are simply too low to account for demand growth and the amount of gas needed in storage for the next winter heating season,” Martin King, director institutional research at GMP FirstEnergy in Calgary, said in a recent report. Prices for gas at the Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana have averaged less than $3 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) since 2015, versus more than $5 over the prior 10 years, and are expected to remain below $3 through at least 2024 based on current futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. “If prices were to stay at (their current) $2.70 level over the course of the summer, that would boost coal to gas switching. We see prices having to move closer to $3.00/mmBtu this summer in order to lower these power burn levels and allow adequate storage refills ahead of winter,” analysts at Barclays, a bank, said in a recent note. Electric companies can switch between burning more gas or coal in power plants depending on which fuel is cheaper. U.S. utilities likely pulled 2,463 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas from inventories during the November-March heating season, according to a poll of analysts by Reuters, the most since the “Polar Vortex” winter of 2013-2014 and the second highest on record. [NGAS/POLL] One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Analysts forecast total inventories by the end of October 2018 - the start of the next heating season - will rise to 3,654 bcf, compared with 3,817 bcf last year, a level that “should be of increasing concern to the market,” King at GMP FirstEnergy said. If the amount of gas in storage on Nov. 1, 2018, is below normal, a cold winter could cut inventories to below 1,000 bcf by the end of March 2019. That would be the smallest amount of gas in storage since the end of March 2014, despite expected record production. U.S. dry gas production is projected to rise to an all-time high of 81.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2018, but U.S. consumption is also expected to hit an all-time high of 78.2 bcfd in 2018. With exports rising to record highs as well, it does not leave a lot of extra gas to go into storage.

2018-04-09,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oklahoma regulators forced an oil and gas producer to reduce operations on a well used for disposing saltwater following a large earthquake over the weekend that set off a series of seismic activity in the state, Matt Skinner, spokesman for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), said on Monday.  The temblors occurred near Perry, Oklahoma, in the northwestern part of the state, within an area singled out by regulators for the frequency of earthquakes from oil and gas production activities.  The first quake occurred on Saturday, registering at magnitude 4.6, and was followed by several others, including a magnitude 4.5 earthquake that hit near Perry early Monday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  The OCC forced M M Energy Inc to reduce operations on Saturday on a disposal well in the area from 17,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 5,000 bpd, Skinner said. “This is an ongoing situation, and further actions are possible,” the OCC wrote in a notice issued midday Monday.  A representative for M M Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The reduction will be phased in with the final volume reached no later than 30 days, Skinner added.  It was unclear whether the directive had impacted production.  Disposal wells have been blamed for an uptick in earthquakes across the state in recent years, which topped out at 903 magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes in 2015 versus just 35 quakes per year in 2012, according to the Oklahoma Geological Survey. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has since issued tougher regulations on oil and gas operators in affected areas in a bid to curb the quakes. The frequency of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes fell to just over 300 last year.  Perry, Oklahoma, is about 50 miles from Cushing, a town sometimes referred to as the “Pipeline Crossroads of the World” and home to massive storage tanks. Currently, about 35 million barrels of oil are held in Cushing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  A spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners, which owns about 12 million barrels of capacity at Cushing, said its pipelines and terminals were operating normally on Monday. Enbridge Energy Partners, which has about 20 million barrels of storage, also said there was no impact to its operations, and Blueknight Energy Partners said operations were normal.  Phillips 66 said its Ponca City refinery about 40 miles from Perry was not affected.

2018-04-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Five Republican senators on Monday called on President Donald Trump to temporarily halt the use of biofuels policy waivers for small oil refineries, after reports the Environmental Protection Agency had issued a recent wave of such exemptions. The group of lawmakers, which includes Senators Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa and John Thune of South Dakota, said the EPA waivers are “undermining” the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, a law that requires biofuels like ethanol to be added to the nation’s fuel, which Trump has said he supports. “We therefore urge you to call on the EPA to cease all RFS waiver action until the agency’s administration of the RFS can proceed in a more transparent and impartial manner,” the senators said in a letter dated April 9. The request comes as Trump is scheduled to meet with EPA head Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue on the issue later on Monday. An EPA source told Reuters last week that the agency had issued 25 small refinery exemptions, relieving the plants of their requirements to blend biofuels last year. Reuters also reported that Andeavor, one of the country’s largest refiners, also received EPA exemptions from the biofuels law for three of its smallest refineries. In the past, the EPA has issued between six and eight waivers from the RFS per year to small refining operations of less than 75,000 barrels per day that can demonstrate they are struggling financially to comply, according to a former official familiar with the waiver program under past administrations.  But refiners have applied for the waivers in larger numbers after a federal appeals court ruling last year that said the EPA must expand the guidelines for approving them.  They have also been encouraged to apply by the Trump administration’s recent efforts to broker a deal between the oil and corn industries to reduce the costs of the RFS, industry sources said. Those talks have not yielded a deal.     “The EPA is using its small refinery waiver in an unprecedented manner to benefit some of the largest refineries in the nation, including Andeavor, which posted profits of approximately $1.5 billion last year,” the senators wrote. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The RFS requires refiners to blend biofuels, or purchase blending credits from other companies - a policy intended to help farmers, and cut pollution and fuel imports.

2018-04-09,"PARIS (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco will sign eight deals worth $10 billion (£7.07 billion) with French firms on Tuesday, the chief executive of the state-run oil giant said on Monday - the main contracts expected to be sealed during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to France. The powerful young prince who is behind modernising reforms in Saudi Arabia is on a three-day trip at a time when relations between the two countries have become more complicated, including over how to address Iran’s role in the region. Amin Nasser told Saudi-run Al Arabiya TV on Monday that his company would finalise the accords on Tuesday. A Saudi-France economic forum is due to take place on Tuesday with an official signing ceremony in the afternoon. Aramco and French oil major Total plan to sign an agreement to expand their joint venture refinery in Saudi Arabia, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on April 5. Total declined to comment and Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The prince is not due to sign mega-contracts in France as he did in the United States and Britain in the past month. A French presidency statement said the two leaders would work on a strategic document that would lead to contracts by the year’s end, when Macron travels to Saudi Arabia.  French officials dismiss suggestions that the lack of lucrative accords reflects a weakening in the relationship. They say a new “method” of working together does not depend on eye-catching new business. They will also formally agree on Tuesday to cooperate on a massive tourism project that showcases Saudi history, part of the prince’s efforts to wean the country off a dependency on oil exports, open up its society and push social reform.  The two countries also said the Paris National Opera would help the kingdom develop a national orchestra. Saudi Minister of Culture and Information Awwad Alawwad said the kingdom would officially participate for the first time in the Cannes Film Festival next month, with nine short films. Prince Mohammed on Monday pulled out of touring a mega-campus for tech startups in Paris, an official in the French prime minister’s office said - a visit that was meant to highlight deepening Franco-Saudi technology ties. Prince Mohammed, 32, and President Emmanuel Macron, 40, both paint themselves as champions of their nations’ plugged-in younger generation. The prince’s decision to skip a visit to Station F, Europe’s largest start-up incubator, founded by billionaire Xavier Neil, is likely to disappoint Macron, especially after the crown prince met technology titans in Silicon Valley last week. France nurtured closer ties with the Sunni-ruled kingdom under president Francois Hollande, who was tough on Iran in nuclear negotiations and whose policies on conflicts across the Middle East broadly overlapped with Saudi positions.  However, Hollande’s successor has sometimes viewed Prince Mohammed’s uncompromising efforts to counter Iran’s growing regional influence as counter-productive, diplomats say.  “The president speaks to everyone, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, Qatar....” the French presidency said in a statement after the two dined on Sunday night at the Louvre museum.

2018-04-09,"* Rouble and Russian stocks sink on sanctions * Dollar steadies, major currencies hold tight ranges * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates prices, changes dateline from previous LONDON) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street led global stocks higher on Monday as the beaten down tech sector rallied, also lifting oil prices, while investors kept an eye on a U.S.-China trade spat. Large-cap U.S. tech companies rose 2.6 percent but are still down more than 7 percent from a record high hit four weeks ago. The United States and China have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. China stepped up its attacks on the Trump administration on Monday, saying Washington was to blame for the frictions and repeating it was impossible to negotiate under “current circumstances.” The comments came after U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday predicted China would take down its trade barriers, and expressed optimism that both sides could resolve the issue through talks. “This is not going to happen tomorrow, and given the mercurial nature of the U.S. administration, the whole issue could well disappear before anything really happens,” ACLS Global chief strategist Marshall Gittler said. “Many market participants may be starting to think that this is just a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing in the end. But ... you never know, U.S. trade policy is in the hands of someone totally unpredictable.” The next big focus will be a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 368.12 points, or 1.54 percent, to 24,300.88, the S&P 500 gained 41.7 points, or 1.60 percent, to 2,646.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 141.45 points, or 2.05 percent, to 7,056.56. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.17 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.08 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.12 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.91 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.51 percent. Russian stock indexes and the rouble both fell on Monday after the United States hit Russian companies and officials as part of an aggressive round of new sanctions to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The dollar-denominated RTS stock market index slid 11.4 percent, its largest single-day drop since December 2014, while the rouble was 3.6 percent weaker against the dollar, the biggest such move since October 2015. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies on persistent worries about the U.S.-China trade conflict while the euro rose following comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that were deemed supportive of the common currency. The dollar index fell 0.25 percent, with the euro up 0.28 percent to $1.2316. The Japanese yen weakened 0.02 percent versus the greenback to 106.94 per dollar, while Sterling last traded at $1.4132, up 0.30 percent on the day. U.S. crude rose 2.08 percent to $63.35 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.51, up 2.09 percent on the day. “Once again we find the oil market being swept up in broader market sentiment,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. “After Friday’s flight from risk, the positive mood in equities to start the week is encouraging a rebound in oil, with a weakening dollar providing a further shot in the arm.” Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.7972 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Friday. The U.S. Treasury is set to auction $30 billion in U.S. 3-year notes on Tuesday, $21 bln in reopened 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $13 billion in reopened 30-year bonds on Thursday. “The combination of conciliatory Trump tweets (regarding China) on the trade front and the looming long-end supply ostensibly make it difficult to be constructive on Treasuries as the week gets underway,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The 30-year bond last fell 10/32 in price to yield 3.0335 percent, from 3.017 percent late on Friday. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,335.14 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.18 percent to $1,338.50 an ounce. Copper rose 0.98 percent to $6,835.00 a tonne.

2018-04-09,"RIO DE JANEIRO, April 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - B razil’s government has been told that development projects, including hydropower dams, in protected areas can no longer go ahead without the prior approval of lawmakers. Last week’s ruling by the supreme court followed the use by the government in recent years of the controversial “provisional measure”, a legal instrument that allowed the president to approve projects by reducing the size of protected areas. Campaigners said the decision should ensure the country’s forests and reserves, including the Amazon rainforest, were better protected. “This decision puts an end to a spree of provisional measures in the name of environmental de-protection,” said Mauricio Guetta, a lawyer at Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), an advocacy group. In recent years, the government has used the measure to open up protected areas for controversial projects, including building two of Brazil’s largest hydropower dams - the Jirau and Santo Antonio - in the Amazon. The use of the measure to shrink protected areas with immediate effect had brought “irreversible consequences, irreversible damage to the environment,” Guetta told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. The eight-judge bench ruled unanimously that using the provisional measure to reduce the size of protected areas for any reason was unconstitutional. It followed a lawsuit in which the court heard the measure had been used in 2012 to allow trees in six protected areas of the Amazon to be felled to make way for five hydropower dams. “The (provisional measure), later converted into law, reduced the level of environmental protection by deactivating large areas in a protected territorial space without respecting due legislative process,” supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes said in a statement. The court said the ruling would not affect the five hydropower plants in question because the provisional measure had already been enacted in law, and some are operating. Guetta said the ruling meant any changes to protected areas must be first approved by law, and local communities should be properly consulted about projects planned on their land. “The government has been trying to reduce by more than 1 million hectares the area under conservation in the southern part of Amazonas state. Now this initiative is officially vetoed because of the supreme court’s decision,” he said. Environmentalists say increasing swathes of land, including the Amazon forest, are being felled for grazing and cropland, and for development projects. Deforestation in the Amazon fell in the August 2016 to July 2017 monitoring period for the first time in three years, although the 6,624 square kilometres (2,557 square miles) cleared of forest remains well above the low recorded in 2012 and targets for slowing climate change.

2018-04-09,"AL-MOKHA, Yemen (Reuters) - High-tech radar units stretch along the quay of this tiny Yemeni port and underwater fortifications have been built to block attacks from unmanned boats packed with explosives.  Once a thriving coffee exporting hub, al-Mokha is now a heavily guarded forward naval base from which the United Arab Emirates monitors shipping lanes and the movements of the Houthis, their foes in a conflict that has sparked a humanitarian crisis in one of the world’s poorest countries.  “They cannot get close to this port anymore, they will be under fire,” said a UAE soldier loading an anti-aircraft gun onto a patrolling warship.  Winning and keeping control of Yemen’s ports in the Red Sea, no matter how small, is of paramount importance to the UAE, a key partner in the Saudi-led coalition that has overseen the  effort to wrest the coast from the Iran-aligned Houthis as part of a strategy to box them in around the capital, Sanaa. Dotted along one of the most important trade routes for oil tankers heading from the Middle East to Europe, the ports - also vital entry points for Yemen’s food imports and aid - are too strategic to lose. Gulf government officials familiar with UAE and Saudi thinking said capturing the coast would block the Houthi supply lines and push them towards the negotiating table.  Maintaining that military presence would be a key condition for any political resolution of the conflict, they said.      “Saudi Arabia and UAE are very worried about Iran’s influence, so they are seeking to keep some military presence on the Yemeni coasts even if the civil war ends,” said a Yemeni official who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.  A spokesman for the coalition did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment. The coalition, which intervened in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has not made major gains in Yemen since February 2017, when it seized al-Mokha. But the war shows no signs of abating. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have spent billions of dollars on the effort at a time when deficits caused by low oil prices have forced them to introduce austerity and cut spending.  Saudi Arabia’s military spending hit record highs of 224 billion riyals ($59.73 billion) in 2017, according to finance ministry documents, against a budget of 191 billion. Military spending of 210 billion riyals has been approved for 2018. The Houthis control Yemen’s most populated areas, including Sanaa in the north and the main port of Hodeidah, and the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition control the rest. The Houthis have launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, including Riyadh, over the last year and in late March fired a short-range ballistic missile towards a facility of Saudi oil company Aramco in Najran. Aramco said at the time its plants and facilities were not affected.      In the most recent incident, a Saudi oil tanker was attacked off Hodeidah on April 4. The Saudis blamed the Houthis but the Houthis said their target was a warship. The latest attacks could complicate a new U.N. push to end the war. A special envoy is visiting the region this month.  At least 10,000 people have been killed and another 53,000 injured in the conflict, leaving thousands with disabilities that prevent them from physical work, according to the United Nations. Three million people were forced to flee their homes, including two million who remain displaced.  Millions are living with the threat of mass starvation and disease, including the world’s worst cholera outbreak with more than 1 million suspected cases.     (For a graphic on Yemen coastal offensive, click tmsnrt.rs/2ExAt9H) The UAE trained, armed and paid the thousands of fighters from the southern provinces who captured the southern port of al-Mukalla from al-Qaeda militants and the port city of Aden from the Houthis. They also hold Hawlaf Port on the Socotra Island and the strategic Perim island. They now want to take control of Hodeidah, which handles the bulk of Yemen’s imports including fuel, medicine and aid, saying the Houthis are using the port to smuggle weapons from the Sunni coalition’s arch-foe, Shi’ite Iran. The Houthis, a predominantly Shi’ite community from the mountainous north, deny they are being helped by Iran.  “The Houthi strongholds are largely in more mountainous areas and — as history tells us — it is far easier to hold the Yemeni coasts than it is to take the centre,” said Adam Baron, a Yemen expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. A coalition commander declined to comment on the advance on Hodeidah because he didn’t want to talk about military strategy. UAE-backed forces are approaching Hodeidah from the south, with the Gulf state supervising the advance from al-Mokha, some 75 km north of the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait that is the gate into the Red Sea from the Gulf of Aden. The fighting has reached al-Jarahi district, some 100 km (60 miles) from Hodeidah, meaning the coalition has never been closer to the more densely populated coastal areas as it is now.  Another campaign has been launched from the north along the coastal border with Saudi Arabia in Hajja province to hem in the Houthis and cut off trading maritime routes. On a recent visit to al-Mokha, a squad of young Yemeni fighters chewed the narcotic green leaf qat and took selfies in front of modern armoured vehicles used by UAE troops. Dead coral, left by massive waves, lay scattered across the empty quay.     The thin frames of the Yemeni and Sudanese troops manning towers and checkpoints barely filled their uniforms, a stark contrast to the Gulf Arabs in their crisp Marines-style outfits. But their morale appeared to be good.  “We are the special forces,” said one Yemeni fighter proudly. Western countries have urged the coalition to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. They also acknowledge Riyadh’s argument that it needs to defend itself from Houthi cross-border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence. “My major concern is that I have not heard anything that made me think that there has been sufficient steps taken to protect civilian lives should the fighting reach another densely populated area like Hodeidah,” said Kristine Beckerle, Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch.

2018-04-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United Nations’ shipping agency is under pressure this week to agree on a plan to cut carbon emissions from the sector, following years of slow progress, but the strategy could fall well short of what is required to limit global warming.  The shipping sector, along with aviation, avoided specific emissions cut targets in a global climate pact agreed at the end of 2015, which aims to limit a global average rise in temperature to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius from 2020. Shipping accounts for 2.2 percent of world CO2 emissions, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the U.N. agency responsible for regulating pollution from ships. This is around the amount emitted by Germany, according to the latest EU data available, and is predicted to grow significantly if left unchecked.  The European Commission estimates that air and marine transportation could contribute as much as a third of all emissions by 2050. The IMO is meeting in London this week to develop a initial strategy to cut emissions. A final plan is not expected until 2023. The strategy should include a global emissions reduction goal for the sector which is in line with temperature limits agreed under the global climate deal and a list of short-, mid- and long-term measures to ensure this goal is met. A spokesman for the European Commission said EU countries, along with the Marshall Islands, support a goal of cutting emissions by 70 to 100 percent by 2050, compared with 2008 levels. Norway has proposed a 50 percent cut by 2050, while another proposal backed by Japan - which is also chairing this week’s talks - and other countries aims for a 50 percent cut by 2060. These targets would not be ambitious enough to keep global temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees C, some environmental groups and countries argue.  Countries such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Panama are also opposed to the EU’s proposal of a loftier target, sources say. A report by the OECD’s transport think tank International Transport Forum last week said the maritime sector could be de-carbonised fully by as early as 2035. The 70-100 percent reduction proposal from some European countries is unlikely to achieve broad support, said the chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), which represents more than 80 percent of the world’s merchant fleet. “While ICS does not fully agree with them in every respect, alternative proposals made by China and Japan merit serious consideration and could form the basis of a possible compromise,” said ICS chairman Esben Poulsson. The Marshall Islands, the second largest flag registry in the world, is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Its environment minister David Paul said on Monday there was “simply no credible reason to hesitate any longer”. The IMO has adopted mandatory rules for new vessels to boost fuel efficiency as a means of cutting CO2 from ship engines. There have been discussions for years on wider CO2 cuts but progress has been slow, prompting calls for potential unilateral measures to be taken at regional or national level. IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim said last week “postponing the adoption of the initial strategy, to a future session..., should not be an option”. IMO members have set themselves a deadline to adopt the initial strategy at this week’s meeting, but they could still postpone it to a later meeting if no decision is reached. “This week is really crucial for the credibility of IMO,” said member of the European Parliament Bas Eickhout in a report by British-based research group InfluenceMap released on Monday. “If this week they fail again, countries will have to take their own actions,” he added. InfluenceMap said Japan represented “potentially the largest obstruction” to an ambitious climate policy at the IMO.  “Despite backing a slightly less negative position as compared to Brazil, Panama and Argentina, Japan has opposed binding GHG (greenhouse gas) targets,” it said in the report.  editing by David Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/imo-emissions/preview-u-n-shipping-agency-under-pressure-to-tackle-growing-co2-emissions-idUKL8N1RM4LY,09 Apr 2018,"The United Nations' shipping

2018-04-09," (In this March 28 story, corrects paragraph 7 to show Permanent Portfolio funds have $2.7 billion in assets under management, not $17 billion) By David Randall NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fund managers have begun to ditch so-called FANG stocks that powered the U.S. stock market to record highs in January and are slowly rotating into commodity-related shares and other value stocks which typically outperform in late-cycle recoveries.  Portfolio managers holding shares of Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, and Google-parent Alphabet Inc say they are increasingly concerned that the data scandal that has sent shares of Facebook down nearly 15 percent year-to-date will spill over into all of the FANG stocks, imperiling the broad market’s momentum at a time when there are no clear companies or sectors to take their place.  On Tuesday, an index which tracks the FANG stocks along with six other mega-cap technology stocks tumbled 6.3 percent, the biggest decline since September 2014.  Facebook rose as much as 1.5 percent in early trading Wednesday before falling into the red, one day after sources told Reuters that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify before Congress. Amazon.com dropped 4 percent, while Netflix fell 5 percent. Google-parent Alphabet was slightly positive. “There are legitimate concerns over the business models of these companies, and I expect that they will be ironed out in legislation” that will likely eat into their profit margins, said Michael Cuggino, a portfolio manager of the $2.7-billion Permanent Portfolio funds.  Cuggino, who would not say whether he was selling any of his shares in Facebook, said that commodity and industrial stocks look more attractive now given rising inflation and continued global economic growth.  Each FANG company rose more than 33 percent last year, helping power the S&P 500 to a nearly 20-percent gain. Yet those gains have left the broad S&P 500 trading at a high trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 21.7, leaving it overpriced despite a boost to margins from the Republican-led corporate tax cut at the end of 2017. “Rising volatility and changing market leadership are now pointing towards the possible conclusion that the stock market peaked in late January 2018,” said Douglas Kass, president of Seabreeze Capital Management.  The S&P 500 is now down 2.2 percent for the year, and down nearly 10 percent below the high of 2872.87 it reached on Jan. 26. Fund managers say that the high valuation of FANG stocks and the likelihood of regulation are pushing them into traditional value stocks like energy and defense companies. Connor Browne, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said that he sold his shares of Netflix and Amazon.com last year after both companies blew through his price targets. He used those gains instead to increase positions in energy stocks such as pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners LP and crude oil shipping company Overseas Shipholding Group Inc that stand to benefit from the recovery in the price of oil.  “We noticed that in all of this excitement over the FANGs taking over the world, there are parts of the economy that seem really out of favor and offer more compelling opportunities,” he said.  Even after the selloff, FANG stocks continue to trade at higher valuations than the broad market. Netflix trades at a P/E of 210 and Amazon.com trades at a P/E of 327. Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet, both of which have been directly linked with privacy concerns, now trade at valuations near 52-week lows. The overhang of increased government oversight has sunk the fortunes of large technology companies in the past. Microsoft Corp reached a settlement in an antitrust case with the Department of Justice in 2002 that lasted until 2011, contributing to a long period of underperformance that kept the stock below the high it reached in 1999 until 2016. Since then, the stock is up nearly 60 percent on the strength of its cloud-based services. Margaret Patel, a senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Funds, said that she has been adding to defense stocks like Raytheon Co that should benefit from increasing military spending in both the U.S. and overseas. At the same time, she is increasing her exposure of non-FANG technology stocks like Adobe Systems Inc and Microsoft that have been hurt by the recent sell-off in the sector.  “It’s very hard to see another sector that still has all the fundamental drivers for growing much faster than any other sector,” she said.

2018-04-09,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday denied President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort’s latest request to loosen the terms of his bail conditions, saying some of the assets he offered to post as collateral are too tied up and cannot be used to meet a $10 million bond obligation. The denial by Amy Berman Jackson, a U.S. District Court judge for the District of Columbia, means that Manafort will for now continue to remain on house arrest and be required to wear an electronic monitoring device. Manafort is facing two indictments in different federal courts brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of Mueller’s wide-ranging probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Manafort is accused of a wide range of offences, from conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent in connection with his lobbying for the pro-Russia Ukrainian government, to bank fraud and filing false tax returns.  He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. But since Manafort’s arrest last October, he has struggled to come up with $10 million in assets he can post as a bond, in exchange for lifting his house arrest conditions. That is because some of the homes he offered to pledge are already posted as collateral for other mortgage loans, such as his condo in Alexandria, Virginia. The judge on Monday said he is no longer able to post one of his New York properties, because it is now tied to pending bank fraud charges against him in the other case in the Eastern District of Virginia.  Those bank fraud charges are “not under the jurisdiction of this court and could give rise to remedies outside of this court’s control,” she wrote. She also said he was not allowed to post funds from a bank account owned by his daughter and son-in-law, Andrea and Christopher Shand. She noted that the account has “already been seized” and that a co-owner of it is “neither the defendant nor a blood relative of the defendant.” Jackson said that Manafort can try once again to resubmit a new package that is valued at $10 million and contains unencumbered assets. Russia has denied meddling in the U.S. election, although American intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded that was the case. President Donald Trump has repeatedly denied there was any collusion between his election campaign and Russia. Reporting by Sarah N.

2018-04-09," LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds trimmed their bullish position in crude oil and fuels in the most recent week after increasing it significantly over the previous fortnight. But the overall reduction conceals a sharp shift away from U.S. light crude (WTI) and towards the international marker Brent, according to an analysis of position data published by regulators and exchanges. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by 43 million barrels in the week to April 3. Portfolio managers cut their net long position in WTI (NYMEX and ICE) by 48 million barrels while trimming their net long in Brent by just 4 million barrels. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2GPRVs8) The fall in WTI net length was the largest one-week reduction since the end of August, when hurricanes disrupted the U.S. refining system, and continues a trend evident in recent weeks. Funds have been steadily cutting their exposure to WTI over the last two months while maintaining a strong bullish position in Brent. The net long position in WTI has fallen by 105 million barrels since it peaked on Jan. 23 even as the net position in Brent has risen by an extra 27 million barrels over the same period. The result is that the position in Brent now looks exceptionally stretched while positioning in WTI looks far less lopsided. Fund managers now hold almost 21 long positions in Brent for every short position, a record imbalance, up from a ratio of 11:1 on Jan. 23. By contrast, funds hold fewer than nine long positions in WTI for every short, down from a ratio of almost 12:1 in late January. The shift in relative positioning between WTI and Brent mirrors the changing calendar spreads at the front end of the futures curve. The front-month calendar spread in WTI has gradually eased from backwardation towards contango since the start of February. Crude stocks have been increasing around the WTI delivery point at Cushing and there are reports of spreading pipeline bottlenecks throughout the West Texas/Permian region. By contrast, Brent calendar spreads have remained firmly in backwardation, and recently tightened again after softening during much of the last three months. Hedge funds are being drawn from WTI towards Brent in the search for roll yield (long positions have a positive yield in a backwardated market but cost money to maintain in a contango market). With oil prices having been basically flat since December, roll yield is becoming increasingly important to portfolio managers. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-04-09,"BAKU (Reuters) - Azerbaijan’s long-serving Ilham Aliyev is expected to easily win re-election for seven more years on Wednesday in a vote boycotted by major opposition parties which accuse him of authoritarian rule and suppressing political dissent. The country’s huge energy reserves and its strategic location along the Caspian Sea means it is viewed by Europe as an important alternative to Russian energy supplies. Opposition parties say they are staying away from Wednesday’s vote because of Aliyev’s sustained crackdown on dissent during his rule and because they say the results will be rigged. The 56-year-old Aliyev, in power since 2003 when he succeeded his father, and his supporters deny allegations of democratic abuses and election fraud.   His opponents say Aliyev benefits too from only muted criticism from Europe because of his country’s perceived strategic value and the risk of stirring instability in the region. Aliyev brought forward the date of the vote to April 11 from Oct. 17, a move his allies said was necessary to avoid presidential and parliamentary elections clashing in 2025. Seven other candidates are running in Wednesday’s election, which will be observed by international monitors, including the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE) but critics have expressed doubts about how genuine the other candidates are.  “Many ODIHR (OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights) interlocutors said they do not expect the election to be genuinely competitive, claiming that those who stand against the incumbent in this election either do not present a political alternative or even actively support him,” ODIHR said in a March 29 report. The main opposition parties say the vote is illegal and are boycotting it.  “We are certain that the election results will be rigged and Ilham Aliyev will be announced the winner again,” Jamil Hasanly, head of the National Council of Democratic Forces, the Azeri opposition coalition, told Reuters.     After taking power from his father Heydar in 2003, Aliyev cemented his position with two referendums, one in 2009 which scrapped a two-term presidential limit, and another in 2016, which extended the head of state’s term of office to seven years from five. The opposition say these steps are illegal and undemocratic.     Aliyev has tried to strike a balance between big regional power Russia and the West, notably on energy policy. His rule benefited from an economic boom fuelled by oil exports, but a slump in global oil prices in the last three years has weakened the Azeri manat currency and shrunk the economy.     Many people in Azerbaijan are struggling on low incomes and amid a growing gap between rich and poor tensions are rising with neighbouring Armenia over a territorial conflict that caused a war in the 1990s. “I’m sure that the election results do not depend on the choices of voters and that’s why I’m not going to vote,” said Sanubar Aliyeva, a 56-year-old housewife, whose two adult sons are unemployed.

2018-04-09,"(adds details, background) BRUSSELS, April 9 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s state-owned energy firm Naftogaz will go to court to try to seize Gazprom’s assets in Europe after the Russian energy firm failed to make a payment ordered by an international tribunal, Naftogaz’s deputy chief said on Monday. Gazprom is refusing to pay Naftogaz more than $2.5 billion under a Stockholm arbitration ruling meant to conclude a long legal battle that has run alongside Ukraine’s broader political stand-off with Russia. “For us it’s clear that they won’t do that (pay) so we will start arresting their gas and other assets of Gazprom in Europe, not in Ukraine. We will go to courts in Europe,” Natogaz’s chief commercial officer Yuri Vitrenko told Reuters in Brussels. However, Naftogaz will not seek to seize Russian gas transiting through Ukraine to European clients, he added, saying: “We don’t want to create any kind of political ambiguity here in the EU that Ukraine is not a reliable transit country.” Gazprom is appealing against the Stockholm ruling and is seeking to cancel a 2009 gas transit contract with Ukraine, escalating a dispute which the European Union says could threaten gas flows. Naftogaz said it expected talks with Gazprom later this week to be the last before it files fresh complaints with the Stockholm arbitration tribunal. Among other issues, it wants compensation for Gazprom’s refusal to supply gas this winter. The EU and Western clients had hoped the Stockholm arbitration would resolve one of the many thorny disputes between Kiev and Moscow. Instead, the two sides are raising the stakes amid tricky discussions over future gas transits through Ukraine when the current contract expires at the end of 2019. Vitrenko said it was likely Gazprom would entirely halt gas flows through Ukraine, re-routing them through two major new pipelines to the north and south. “It is absolutely likely that in 2020 there will be no transits through Ukraine and Gazprom will be okay in terms of meeting their minimal contractual obligations,” he said. “We know that Mr Putin wants to punish Ukraine and that’s why he will do it.” (Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel @AdeCar; Editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Mark Potter)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-ukraine-gas-naftogaz/update-1-ukraines-naftogaz-will-go-after-gazprom-assets-in-europe-idUKL8N1RM3FN,09 Apr 2018,"Ukraine's state-owned energy

2018-04-09,"BAGHDAD, April 9 (Reuters) - Iraq’s top court will begin hearings in May on the legality of oil exports from Kurdistan, which are at the centre of a row between the semi-autonomous region and Baghdad. The oil dispute is the main hurdle to normalising relations between the central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of northern Iraq which conducted an October referendum on independence despite Baghdad’s opposition. The Supreme Federal Court said in a statement on Monday it has asked to hear the opinions of officials including the central government’s prime minister, oil minister and finance minister, in addition to the KRG’s prime minister, on May 6. Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi had asked the court to issue a ruling that bans independent oil exports from the KRG, which started in 2014, through a pipeline across Turkey. The KRG says the Iraqi Constitution recognises the legality of its existence and contains no article specifically forbidding it from developing oil resources on its territory. International energy firms including Exxon Mobil, DNO, Dana Gas, Rosneft and Genel are among companies with agreements with the KRG to operate in the Kurdistan region.

2018-04-09,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Spot Asian LNG price vs. Santos share price: tmsnrt.rs/2IzAAUD By Clyde Russell SINGAPORE, April 9 (Reuters) - The revised $10.4 billion bid by Harbour Energy for Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer Santos Ltd looks at first glance like a winning hand, but it’s still probably got the odds stacked against it. The U.S. private equity firm’s fourth bite at the Santos cherry since August last year values the Adelaide-based company at a 28 percent premium to the close on April 2, and is 43 percent higher than the first attempt. Recognising that this is a serious bid, Santos’ board has decided to “engage further with Harbour”, the company said in a statement to shareholders. This is sensible, but shareholders should consider whether they want to sell out just as Santos is finally starting to reap the benefits of its investments, and the prospects for further improvement are getting brighter. The Harbour offer values Santos at A$6.50 a share, a level the company last traded at in July 2015, at a time when the price of LNG and crude oil was falling, putting the company under pressure just as its massive Gladstone LNG plant in Australia’s Queensland state was starting up. When Santos was last at A$6.50 a share, Brent crude oil was around $58 a barrel and the spot price of Asian LNG was about $7.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). These prices matter for the bid as the bulk of Santos’ revenue is either in oil-linked longer-term LNG contracts, spot LNG prices, or in crude for the company’s small oil output. Brent crude ended last week at $67.74 a barrel and spot LNG was about $7 per mmBtu, although it’s worth bearing in mind that LNG prices typically are weakest during the shoulder seasons between the winter and summer peak demand periods. Spot LNG prices surged to $11.50 per mmBtu in early January, the highest in more than three years, as China bought additional cargoes to meet winter demand. While future spot LNG prices are uncertain, the chances are that China will continue to boost its imports as part of efforts to reduce the use of polluting coal for winter heating. On crude oil, the success of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies in draining global inventories and boosting prices has led to a market consensus that prices are more likely to rise than fall over the medium term. This means that Santos is likely to receive higher revenues for its LNG from the Gladstone plant and its share in LNG operations in Darwin and Papua New Guinea, as well as for its domestic natural gas and oil output in Australia. It’s these revenue streams that Harbour Energy is eyeing, and it must be taking the view that Santos’ share price has yet to reflect the brighter medium and longer term outlook. For this reason the revised offer may not quite be enough, especially if Santos’ existing major shareholders and the analysts they rely on start to re-rate the stock in line with expectations for higher crude and LNG prices. The Santos share price did kick higher on the new Harbour Energy bid, jumping more than 5 percent after the revised offer, but at its close of A$5.88 on April 6, it’s still some way below the indicative value of the offer. Rather than reflect that Harbour Energy is overpaying, this likely shows that investors don’t believe the bid will clear the regulatory hurdles in its way. The deal will be subject to Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which may have concerns about a key domestic oil and gas producer falling into foreign hands. Even if the board does greenlight the deal, the chances are that the Liberal Party-led federal government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will decline final approval. Domestic energy policy is a hot button issue in Australia, with consumers and industry angry and disillusioned at sharply rising prices for electricity and natural gas. Any suggestion that a private equity company buying Santos would somehow be bad for consumers and industry would put tremendous pressure on a government that is trailing the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls. And it wouldn’t be hard to make such an argument as it’s likely that Harbour Energy is focused on the LNG jewels in the Santos crown and not that interested in developing domestic natural gas supply. Also, a debt-laden deal carries the risk of massive cost-cutting, with related job losses, another issue that would be exceedingly touchy in Adelaide, a city still reeling from the loss of Australia’s motor car assembly plants. These factors make it unlikely that Harbour Energy’s offer will get over the line, at least in its current form. It’s possible that it could win political approval, if Harbour Energy agrees to whatever conditions are placed on the deal, but it’s also possible that Santos’ shareholders may want the offer sweetened a little more.

The two countries have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars of tariffs, but officials in President Donald Trump’s administration have stressed the tariffs are not yet in place and the dispute could be resolved through talks. Trump’s chief economic adviser, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in an interview on Sunday the ongoing spat “might turn out to be very benign”. On Sunday, Trump appeared to echo this, tweeting that any tariffs would be reciprocal and that he saw a “Great future for both countries!”. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.11 percent, helped by Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index rising 0.23 percent. U.S. stocks look likely to continue the trend, with S&P 500 futures pointing to a 0.6 pct opening rise for the index. “Never ending escalation is not guaranteed ... as China has shown willingness to negotiate in recent months,” JPMorgan analysts said, also noting the two countries made significant progress on trade agreements when Trump visited China in November 2017. But the issue could dominate markets for the foreseeable future given the lengthy public discussion period on U.S. tariff proposals mean the earliest they might be imposed is somewhere around late July or early August. “This is not going to happen tomorrow, and given the mercurial nature of the U.S. administration, the whole issue could well disappear before anything really happens,” ACLS Global chief strategist Marshall Gittler said. “Many market participants may be starting to think that this is just a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing in the end. But ... you never know, U.S. trade policy is in the hands of someone totally unpredictable.” The next big focus will be a speech by Chinese President Xi at the Boao Forum on Tuesday. Russian stock indexes and the rouble both fell on Monday after the United States hit Russian companies and officials as part of an aggressive round of new sanctions to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The dollar-denominated RTS stock market index slid 9.2 percent, its worst single day since December 2014, while the rouble was 2.8 percent weaker against the dollar, the biggest such move since June 2017. Shares in some Russian companies targeted by the new sanctions, notably those associated with Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, plunged on Monday. Hong Kong-listed shares in Deripaska’s aluminium producer Rusal tumbled by nearly half after the company said it could default on some of its debt due to the sanctions. Elsewhere in currency markets, the dollar steadied on the safe haven yen at 107.11, just short of the recent six-week peak of 107.49. The euro was down slightly at $1.2267, and above the recent trough of $1.2212, while the dollar index was 0.1 percent firmer at 90.218. Oil prices edged up with Brent crude futures for June up 0.61 percent to $67.51 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 gained rose 0.32 percent to $62.25 a barrel.

2018-04-09,"LAGOS, April 9 (Reuters) - Nigerian energy company Neconde has launched an arbitration case against Royal Dutch Shell , the West African firm’s chief executive said, alleging the oil major continued to lift crude and failed to remit funds after a lease had been sold. The oilfield in question, Oil Mining Lease (OML) 42, is also at the centre of corruption allegations. Shell filed a criminal complaint against a former employee in late March over suspected bribes in the $390 million sale of the field. Neconde CEO Frank Edozie told Reuters the company bought a stake in OML 42 from Shell in April 2011. He alleged the oil giant continued to produce crude there until the petroleum ministry approved Neconde’s licence in November that year. “It was producing and lifting crude although the asset had, by deed of transfer, moved to Neconde. Shell lifted the crude and held the proceeds - nothing was given to Neconde. That is the matter we are taking to the court of arbitration in the UK,” he said. Edozie, who spoke with Reuters at his company’s headquarters in Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos, said Neconde launched the arbitration case in London late last year in an attempt to recoup money. He did not disclose the sum being sought. Edozie did not provide precise figures when asked how much crude was allegedly produced, lifted and sold improperly by Shell. A Shell spokesperson said there was “arbitration between Neconde and Shell”. No further details were given. Experts say arbitration disputes, which are held in private, often take years to resolve but can also be withdrawn quickly if a deal is reached privately. Neconde Energy last week said it purchased its stake in OML 42 following a competitive bidding round and made no payments to a former Shell employee or other companies to facilitate the purchase. A Shell spokesperson said the decision to file a criminal complaint against its former employee over the sale was unconnected to the arbitration case. Neconde’s CEO also said the company was “under significant pressure to keep up with payments to banks” and was holding talks to restructure its debt and raise equity. “We are looking for between $500 million and $600 million,” said Edozie, adding that the energy firm was dealing with a consortium of lenders. He said financiers on the OML 42 acquisition included international lenders: Africa Finance Corp, FBN Bank UK, Glencore and Afrexim. Guaranty Trust Bank, Diamond Bank, Fidelity Bank and Access Bank were domestic banks in the mix. Edozie said the company had been in talks with lenders to refinance its loans. “We are in the market for debt, then we are on a journey to proof of the asset,” he added. Edozie said crude production at the oilfield stood at around 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) and it aimed to increase that to 110,000 bpd by the end of 2018.

Nigeria’s Forcados terminal is ramping up after a temporary shutdown on the Trans Forcados Pipeline, Shell said on Friday. “We lost production due to downtime, therefore we felt that we are better off barging than putting our crude in the pipeline,” he said.

2018-04-09,"(Adds Russia comments) BERLIN, April 9 (Reuters) - Germany on Monday condemned the suspected use of chemical weapons in a opposition-held town outside Damascus, saying the circumstances pointed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government being responsible for the attack. The German government also urged Russia to “give up its blockade mentality at the U.N. Security Council” and facilitate an investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The Syrian government denied using any such weapons. “Those responsible for the use of poison gas ... must be held to account,” German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference. “With this use of poison gas, the circumstances point to the Assad regime’s responsibility,” he added. “The regime’s actions are abhorrent.” Germany also criticised Russia, which entered the war on Assad’s side in 2015 and has blocked a number of motions related to Syria in the U.N. Security Council. “Russia must give up its blockade mentality in the U.N. Security Council with regard to an investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria,” Seibert said. “It must contribute constructively to a clarification.” “The Syrian regime would, without Russian and also Iranian support, not be able to keep up its approach of a ruthless, purely military solution to the conflict,” Seibert added.

2018-04-09,"LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - The United Nations’ shipping agency is under pressure this week to agree on a plan to cut carbon emissions from the sector, following years of slow progress, but the strategy could fall well short of what is required to limit global warming. The shipping sector, along with aviation, avoided specific emissions cut targets in a global climate pact agreed at the end of 2015, which aims to limit a global average rise in temperature to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius from 2020. Shipping accounts for 2.2 percent of world CO2 emissions, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the U.N. agency responsible for regulating pollution from ships. This is around the amount emitted by Germany, according to the latest EU data available, and is predicted to grow significantly if left unchecked. The European Commission estimates that air and marine transportation could contribute as much as a third of all emissions by 2050. The IMO is meeting in London this week to develop a initial strategy to cut emissions. A final plan is not expected until 2023. The strategy should include a global emissions reduction goal for the sector which is in line with temperature limits agreed under the global climate deal and a list of short-, mid- and long-term measures to ensure this goal is met. A spokesman for the European Commission said EU countries, along with the Marshall Islands, support a goal of cutting emissions by 70 to 100 percent by 2050, compared with 2008 levels. Norway has proposed a 50 percent cut by 2050, while another proposal backed by Japan - which is also chairing this week’s talks - and other countries aims for a 50 percent cut by 2060. These targets would not be ambitious enough to keep global temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees C, some environmental groups and countries argue. Countries such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Panama are also opposed to the EU’s proposal of a loftier target, sources say. A report by the OECD’s transport think tank International Transport Forum last week said the maritime sector could be de-carbonised fully by as early as 2035. The 70-100 percent reduction proposal from some European countries is unlikely to achieve broad support, said the chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), which represents more than 80 percent of the world’s merchant fleet. “While ICS does not fully agree with them in every respect, alternative proposals made by China and Japan merit serious consideration and could form the basis of a possible compromise,” said ICS chairman Esben Poulsson. The Marshall Islands, the second largest flag registry in the world, is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Its environment minister David Paul said on Monday there was “simply no credible reason to hesitate any longer”. The IMO has adopted mandatory rules for new vessels to boost fuel efficiency as a means of cutting CO2 from ship engines. There have been discussions for years on wider CO2 cuts but progress has been slow, prompting calls for potential unilateral measures to be taken at regional or national level. IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim said last week “postponing the adoption of the initial strategy, to a future session..., should not be an option”. IMO members have set themselves a deadline to adopt the initial strategy at this week’s meeting, but they could still postpone it to a later meeting if no decision is reached. “This week is really crucial for the credibility of IMO,” said member of the European Parliament Bas Eickhout. “If this week they fail again, countries will have to take their own actions,” he added.

2018-04-09,"* Govt approval mandatory for fuel price changes under new rule * Widodo ‘very concerned’ about inflation -deputy minister * Move follows coal price cap, hold on fuel, power prices (Adds comment from second economist) By Wilda Asmarini and Tabita Diela JAKARTA, April 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia plans to regulate prices of non-subsidised vehicle fuels as part of efforts to control inflation and boost people’s purchasing power, Deputy Energy Minister Arcandra Tahar said. President Joko Widodo won international praise and sovereign bond rating upgrades for Southeast Asia’s largest economy after cutting government fuel spending by more than 90 percent and shifting the burden of petroleum subsidies to Pertamina shortly after taking office in 2014. But Indonesia still subsidises some fuels and the government said in March it would cap domestic coal prices and keep fuel and electricity prices unchanged until the end of 2019, an election year. Widodo’s latest energy policies contrast with his earlier moves to eliminate subsidies and have raised concerns among some economists. Non-subsidised fuel prices are currently set by retailers, but under a planned regulation the government would have the right to decide whether retailers can change fuel prices, Tahar told reporters on Monday. “The government is very concerned with the rate of inflation,” he added, referring to adjustments to fuel prices by all retailers, excluding aviation fuel and industrial fuels. “The direction from the president was that (fuel) price increases must take into account inflation going forward,” Tahar said, referring to retail fuels. The government plans to meet retailers and issue a regulation on the matter “as quickly as possible” that will become effective immediately, he said. Susyanto, secretary of Indonesia’s Oil and Gas Directorate, said that under the proposed regulation, “every time there’s an increase it will be obligatory to obtain prior government approval”. Indonesia’s fuel retailers include Shell, Total, AKR Corporindo, and state-owned energy company Pertamina. A second regulation would soon be issued to improve distribution of “Premium” (RON 88) gasoline after shortages emerged in some areas, Tahar said. A spokesman for Pertamina said the company had not received information about the move. A Jakarta-based spokesman for Shell did not respond to a written request for comment on the matter. The government’s concern is that household consumption growth remains below 5 percent, below average for Indonesia, Permata Bank economist Joshua Pardede said, referring to recent central government data. “The hope is that by managing administered prices it can boost private consumption,” Pardede told Reuters. Widodo has been grappling with an economy that has refused to respond to conventional policies to kick-start growth. That could dent his re-election chances in 2019, especially with a budget that won’t stretch to lavish government spending. “The preliminary conjecture is that this is an effort to save (Widodo’s) electability,” Bhima Yudistira Adhinegara, an economist at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef), told Reuters, referring to recent declines in consumer confidence. Net oil importer Indonesia’s fuel subsidies have been blamed for creating a false economy, widespread smuggling and corruption. Pricing controls have dented the finances of Pertamina and state electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), and reduced their spending capacity. Pertamina’s losses from government-price-controlled fuel sales had reached 3.9 trillion rupiah ($283.43 million) as of February, and this amount could swell to 5 trillion rupiah by June, Adhinegara said.

2018-04-09,"PARIS/LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese energy and utility group EDP (EDP.LS) said there had been no contact with Engie (ENGIE.PA) after France’s BFM Business reported on its website that French utility Engie was examining a possible bid. Engie said it had no comment to make on the BFM Business report, which quoted sources close to Engie.  EDP said in a statement that “no contacts have been established, nor have there been any negotiations with a view to consolidating operations.” EDP shares were up 3.8 percent at 3.2 euros in at 0955 GMT after gains of over 5 percent earlier in the session, while Engie shares dipped 0.4 percent. At that price, EDP has a stock market capitalisation of around 11.7 billion euros ($14.4 billion), while Engie has a market capitalisation of around 33 billion euros. There were reports last year that Spain’s Gas Natural GAS.MC was seeking a merger with EDP, but the company denied there were any talks at the time. China Three Gorges, EDP’s largest shareholder, has continued to raise its stake in EDP since reports of Gas Natural’s interest. The Chinese power company last boosted its holding in EDP, to 26.27 percent, in October.  The European utilities sector received a jolt last month when Germany’s top utilities announced plans to break up Innogy (IGY.DE), whose assets will be divided among parent RWE (RWEG.DE) and rival E.ON EONGnDE.  BFM Business added that any final decision as to whether or not to go ahead with a bid would not be made until Engie’s new chairman Jean-Pierre Clamadieu formally took up his position in May. Clamadieu had said in February that Engie should consider acquisition opportunities. Last month, Engie said its three-year transformation plan had been completed ahead of schedule, as it returned to profit after two years of losses and posted a higher-than-expected dividend.

2018-04-09,"PARIS, April 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday pulled out of touring a mega-campus for tech startups in Paris, an official in the French prime minister’s office said, a visit that was meant to highlight deepening Franco-Saudi tech ties. The powerful young prince who is behind modernising reforms in Saudi Arabia is on a three-day trip to France at a time when relations between the two countries have become more complicated, including over how to address Iran’s regional role. He is not expected to sign mega contracts in France as he did during visits to the United States and Britain over the last month. “It has been decided to keep working on defining Franco-Saudi entrepreneurial projects before envisaging a high-level visit,” the Matignon source said. Prince Mohammed, 32, and President Emmanuel Macron both paint themselves as champions of their nations’ plugged-in youths with a modernising message that has resonated strongly with younger Saudis and French citizens. Prince Mohammed’s decision to skip a visit to Station F, Europe’s largest startup incubator founded by billionaire Xavier Neil, is likely to disappoint Macron, especially after the crown prince met with technology titans in Silicon Valley last week. Station F is headed by an Iranian-American, Roxanne Varza, who previously worked at TechCrunch France and Microsoft Ventures.

The two countries have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars of tariffs, but officials in President Donald Trump’s administration have stressed the tariffs are not yet in place and the dispute could be resolved through talks. Trump’s chief economic adviser, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in an interview on Sunday the ongoing spat “might turn out to be very benign”. In a Twitter post on Sunday Trump appeared to echo this, saying any tariffs would be reciprocal and that he saw a “Great future for both countries!”. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.24 percent, helped by Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index that rose 0.5 percent. “Never ending escalation is not guaranteed ... as China has shown willingness to negotiate in recent months,” said analysts at JPMorgan, who also noted the two countries made significant progress on trade agreements when Trump visited China in November 2017. But the issue could dominate markets for the foreseeable future given the lengthy public discussion period on U.S. tariff proposals mean the earliest they might be imposed was somewhere around late July or early August. “This is not going to happen tomorrow, and given the mercurial nature of the U.S. administration, the whole issue could well disappear before anything really happens,” said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global. “Many market participants may be starting to think that this is just a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing in the end. But ... you never know, U.S. trade policy is in the hands of someone totally unpredictable.” The next major hurdle will be a speech by Chinese President Xi at the Boao Forum on Tuesday. Russian stock indexes and the rouble both fell on Monday after the United States hit Russian companies and officials as part of an aggressive round of new sanctions to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The dollar-denominated RTS stock market index was down 4.5 percent, its worst single day in over a year, while the rouble was 0.9 percent weaker against the dollar. Shares in some Russian companies targeted by the new sanctions, notably those associated with Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, plunged on Monday. Hong Kong-listed shares in Deripaska’s aluminium producer Rusal tumbled by nearly half after the company said it could default on some of its debt due to the sanctions. Elsewhere in currency markets, the dollar steadied on the safe haven yen at 107.07, just short of the recent six-week peak of 107.49.

2018-04-09,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines is looking to seal a pact with China within a few months to jointly explore for oil and gas in a part of the busy South China Sea waterway claimed by both countries, a Philippine official said on Monday. In February, the two countries agreed to set up a special panel to work out how to jointly explore for offshore oil and gas in areas both sides claim, without needing to address the touchy issue of sovereignty. “We’re trying to see if we can achieve an agreement, hopefully within the next couple of months,” Jose Santiago Santa Romana, Philippine ambassador to the People’s Republic of China, told a news conference held on China’s island province of Hainan. There is political willingness to land a deal, but both parties could take as much time as needed to ensure the goals are met, Santa Romana said at the event, aired live on Facebook, adding that the Philippines aimed to boost its energy security. Beijing claims most of the South China Sea, a key trade route with areas believed to hold large quantities of oil and natural gas. Parts of it are subject to competing claims from Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, besides the Philippines. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday flew to China for the Boao Forum for Asia, and will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday. Last month, the Philippines identified two areas in the South China Sea where joint exploration for oil and gas may be undertaken with China. But any potential deals between Manila and Beijing should be agreed with a company and not the Chinese government, the presidential spokesman said. The idea of joint development dates from 1986, but disputes and the sovereignty issue have kept it from materialising. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that portions of the contested areas were part of the Philippines’ 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone, and Manila had sovereign rights to resources there. China refuses to recognise the ruling.

Rolls CEO Warren East has been trying to streamline the company during his nearly three years in charge as part of a turnaround plan to counter declines in some of its older aero-engine programmes and plunging demand for oil equipment.

Helping was news North Korea had told the United States for the first time that it was prepared to discuss denuclearization when their leaders meet. There was more confusion than reaction to reports, which the Pentagon quickly denied, that U.S. forces had struck at sites in Syria. Trump said on Sunday there would be a “big price to pay” after medical aid groups reported dozens of people were killed by poison gas in a besieged rebel-held town. For now, investors in Asia were encouraged that E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were still up 0.6 percent, while NASDAQ futures rose 0.8 percent. European bourses looked set to open firmer with FTSE futures up half a percent and Germany 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan responded by rising 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei put on 0.5 percent and Hong Kong 1.1 percent. Caution had been the watchword after Trump claimed on Sunday that China would take down its trade barriers because it was “the right thing to do.” Trump late Thursday threatened to slap $100 billion more in tariffs on Chinese imports, while Beijing said it was fully prepared to respond with a “fierce counter strike”. Analysts warned the drama would be a long-running one given the lengthy public discussion period on U.S. tariff proposals meant the earliest they might be imposed was somewhere around late July or early August. “This is not going to happen tomorrow, and given the mercurial nature of the U.S. administration, the whole issue could well disappear before anything really happens,” said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global. “Many market participants may be starting to think that this is just a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing in the end.

Some hope the looming earnings season will be strong enough to provide fundamental support for stocks, with analysts tipping the fastest quarterly profit growth in seven years. Bonds gave back some of their safety gains with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt nudging up to 2.797 percent, though that compared to a top of 2.8380 last week.

2018-04-09,"(Repeats story published on Friday) * Oil firms see big profits, offshore suppliers struggle * Turn to offshore wind, modification of platforms * Will continue to keep costs under control * Graphic-Oil services index vs crude: reut.rs/2GwIphf By Nerijus Adomaitis STORD, Norway, April 6 (Reuters) - Rising more than 20 metres above the sea, Statoil’s Aasta Hansteen platform towers over the Stord shipyard in western Norway, representing the height of engineering in the offshore oil sector. It will probably be the last platform of its kind to leave here. Nearby is what the future is more likely to hold for yard owner Kvaerner: the rusty Njord A platform, which it built two decades ago, is back for a refit so it can continue production in the North Sea for another 20 years. Oil companies posted bumper profits in the fourth quarter, benefiting from rising crude prices and cost cuts made during the slump years between 2014 and 2017, but they have made it clear in recent months that they will not let costs rise again. For Statoil, this has meant calling time on giant oil platforms and instead looking to build more modest installations and, where possible, revamp existing infrastructure. For hundreds of suppliers, from oil services firms to rig owners or engineering companies, this means coming to terms with the fact that industry spending may not rebound as it has after previous downturns. As well as cutting their own costs further, they must adapt by finding alternative sources of revenue in the Norwegian sector, one of the world biggest offshore markets and viewed as a global bellwether. For Kvaerner, which like many peers relies on Statoil for much of its revenue, the focus is to expand business areas that are currently small but which it expects to offer the best paths to growth in the new industry reality. These activities include decommissioning and recycling platforms, refitting existing ones and building smaller, unmanned platforms, the company said in its fourth-quarter report last month. “In the traditional oil platform market, we expect that it will level out in the short term, but decline over the longer term,” Kvaerner CFO Idar Eikrem told Reuters. At the Stord yard, set in a fjord surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Kvaerner cut its cost base by 20-25 percent during the oil market slump, but that might not be enough. “We still need to chase cost cuts, even now. We are competitive now, but we will not be tomorrow if we keep on ‘charging’, as we used to say,” Steinar Roegenes, the yard’s managing director, told Reuters. The writing is on the wall globally. Last year, 16 out of 24 offshore projects sanctioned by oil companies worldwide were expansions of “brownfield” sites that have already been developed rather than new projects, according to a report published on Thursday by energy consultancy WoodMackenzie. The consultancy did not provide comparative figure for previous years, but said it was seeing “significantly smaller projects, alongside a greater appetite for brownfield and expansion projects”. “Not only are these projects less risky than greenfield developments, they also tend to be less capital-intensive and are quicker to bring onstream, offering a quicker payback and better returns on development dollars,” the consultancy said. “We should continue to see operators favouring a ‘leaner and meaner’ path in 2018.” Like Kvaerner, other offshore suppliers are also diversifying in Norway. Oil services firm Aker Solutions bought a 5 percent stake in California-based Principle Power, which builds foundations for floating offshore windmills, for an undisclosed sum in February, with a view to increase it to 10 percent at the end of the year. “We see a major opportunity in offshore floating wind where demand is growing in the transition to a low-carbon future,” Aker Solutions CEO Luis Araujo said. Subsea 7, which specialises in building and laying oil and gas installations on the seabed, is expanding into renewables, by installing offshore wind farms. It is bidding for tenders installing offshore wind mills in Britain, Germany, France, among others, following its work installing the turbines of the Beatrice wind farm, Scotland’s largest offshore wind park. “In the ... medium to long term the renewable business is, without any doubt, a growing business,” Subsea 7 CEO Jean Cahuzac said on a call with analysts on March 1. Any shifts by Statoil have huge repercussions in Norway, where it dominates an offshore oil sector, which accounts for more than 100,000 jobs and has an annual turnover in the region of $50 billion. Kvaerner, for example, relied on the oil major for about 60 percent of its 6.5 billion Norwegian crowns ($831 million) revenue last year. Aker Solutions, which drew more than half of its 22.5 billion crowns revenue from Norway, said Statoil was one of its top clients. Statoil said in February said new types of offshore installations could reduce capital spending by 30 percent and operating costs by 50 percent compared to conventional oil platforms - meaning less money for suppliers. That spells an end to behemoths like Aasta Hansteen, which is the world’s largest spar-type platform and has a 200 metre-long cylindrical hull, most of which is submerged. “The Aasta Hansteen platform was decided in 2012,” Margareth Oevrum, Statoil’s head of technology, projects and drilling, told Reuters during a visit to the platform. “Had we decided it today, we would have built it smaller.” ($1 = 7.8503 Norwegian crowns) Additional reporting by Liz Hampton in Houston; Editing by

2018-04-09,"(Repeats April 6 story with no change to text) * Gasoline floating storage seen at over 400,000 tonnes in April * European exports to West Africa, United States already rising By Libby George and Ahmad Ghaddar LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - Gasoline stored in ships off Europe’s coast has ballooned to more than 400,000 tonnes, putting pressure on the continent’s traders to compete for buyers once summer demand starts. Several vessels have joined the three initially booked to store fuel off Europe’s ports in mid-March, and brokers said even barges have held cargoes of gasoline for three to four weeks as the volumes traded in Europe hit record levels last month. The tankers Torm Tevere, Ridgebury John B and STI Clapham are now parked off Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub, where on-land stocks hit a record 1.387 million tonnes last week, according to figures from PJK International. Fuel in vessels, rather than in tanks on land, is typically the most expensive way to store fuel, so notable volumes of floating storage only build when the market is oversupplied. Volumes off the coast of Europe have risen from just over 250,000 tonnes in mid-March. Traders said the atypical floating fuel stores will target hungry buyers in the United States and the Middle East as the former restock following maintenance and the latter stock up before Ramadan. Already, some cargoes that had been parked off Europe’s coast, such as the Nan Lin Wan, are sailing for buyers in New York Harbor. Expectations that prices in the coming months will rise above the current levels also created the market condition, known as contango, that allowed traders to make money storing the fuel in these tankers. Profits for gasoline have also risen significantly since late last month as the market shifted to summer-quality fuel — and sellers cleared their backlog of winter grades. Industry monitor Genscape showed a spike in the amount of gasoline booked to sail from Europe to West Africa and the Americas in the week to March 30, rising to more than 700,000 tonnes for the former and more than 400,000 tonnes for the latter. But analysts said the owners of the fuel - and refineries in Europe - could run into trouble if demand does not come in particularly strong over the summer. “We’re just dealing with the fact that there is a fair amount (of fuel) out there,” said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research with consultancy Energy Aspects. “ARA stocks are full. There’s not the same sort of pull from the Middle East, and China is still exporting.” Chinese state energy giant CNPC said it had sold its first ever gasoline to the Americas, an indication of the ample supply in Asia that has also seen top trader Vitol store gasoline on tankers. Cargo tracking firm Kpler said that there is Korean gasoline on the Marlin Ammolite heading for Ecuador, and Chinese gasoline aboard the BW Wren en route to Mexico, underscoring the coming fight for buyers.

2018-04-09,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The revised $10.4 billion bid by Harbour Energy for Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer Santos Ltd looks at first glance like a winning hand, but it’s still probably got the odds stacked against it. The U.S. private equity firm’s fourth bite at the Santos cherry since August last year values the Adelaide-based company at a 28 percent premium to the close on April 2, and is 43 percent higher than the first attempt. Recognising that this is a serious bid, Santos’ board has decided to “engage further with Harbour”, the company said in a statement to shareholders. This is sensible, but shareholders should consider whether they want to sell out just as Santos is finally starting to reap the benefits of its investments, and the prospects for further improvement are getting brighter. The Harbour offer values Santos at A$6.50 a share, a level the company last traded at in July 2015, at a time when the price of LNG and crude oil was falling, putting the company under pressure just as its massive Gladstone LNG plant in Australia’s Queensland state was starting up. When Santos was last at A$6.50 a share, Brent crude oil was around $58 a barrel and the spot price of Asian LNG was about $7.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). These prices matter for the bid as the bulk of Santos’ revenue is either in oil-linked longer-term LNG contracts, spot LNG prices, or in crude for the company’s small oil output.  Brent crude ended last week at $67.74 a barrel and spot LNG was about $7 per mmBtu, although it’s worth bearing in mind that LNG prices typically are weakest during the shoulder seasons between the winter and summer peak demand periods. Spot LNG prices surged to $11.50 per mmBtu in early January, the highest in more than three years, as China bought additional cargoes to meet winter demand. While future spot LNG prices are uncertain, the chances are that China will continue to boost its imports as part of efforts to reduce the use of polluting coal for winter heating. On crude oil, the success of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies in draining global inventories and boosting prices has led to a market consensus that prices are more likely to rise than fall over the medium term. This means that Santos is likely to receive higher revenues for its LNG from the Gladstone plant and its share in LNG operations in Darwin and Papua New Guinea, as well as for its domestic natural gas and oil output in Australia. It’s these revenue streams that Harbour Energy is eyeing, and it must be taking the view that Santos’ share price has yet to reflect the brighter medium and longer term outlook. For this reason the revised offer may not quite be enough, especially if Santos’ existing major shareholders and the analysts they rely on start to re-rate the stock in line with expectations for higher crude and LNG prices. The Santos share price did kick higher on the new Harbour Energy bid, jumping more than 5 percent after the revised offer, but at its close of A$5.88 on April 6, it’s still some way below the indicative value of the offer. Rather than reflect that Harbour Energy is overpaying, this likely shows that investors don’t believe the bid will clear the regulatory hurdles in its way. The deal will be subject to Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which may have concerns about a key domestic oil and gas producer falling into foreign hands. Even if the board does greenlight the deal, the chances are that the Liberal Party-led federal government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will decline final approval. Domestic energy policy is a hot button issue in Australia, with consumers and industry angry and disillusioned at sharply rising prices for electricity and natural gas. Any suggestion that a private equity company buying Santos would somehow be bad for consumers and industry would put tremendous pressure on a government that is trailing the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls. And it wouldn’t be hard to make such an argument as it’s likely that Harbour Energy is focused on the LNG jewels in the Santos crown and not that interested in developing domestic natural gas supply. Also, a debt-laden deal carries the risk of massive cost-cutting, with related job losses, another issue that would be exceedingly touchy in Adelaide, a city still reeling from the loss of Australia’s motor car assembly plants. These factors make it unlikely that Harbour Energy’s offer will get over the line, at least in its current form. It’s possible that it could win political approval, if Harbour Energy agrees to whatever conditions are placed on the deal, but it’s also possible that Santos’ shareholders may want the offer sweetened a little more.

2018-04-09,"(Repeats Sunday’s story with no changes) OSLO, April 8 (Reuters) - Norway’s private-sector trade unions reached a deal on Sunday with employers over wages, pensions and other compensation, averting the outbreak of major strikes, a state-appointed mediator said after five days of negotiations. Almost 35,000 employees had been scheduled to go on strike if no agreement was found, and a conflict could eventually have escalated to include more than 200,000 workers. A strike would immediately have idled aluminium smelters, fertiliser plants, ship yards and chemical factories, and could eventually have been extended to hit output of oil and gas, unions said ahead of the talks. The deal remains subject to a vote by labour union members, mediator Nils Dalseide told reporters. The agreement gives workers an estimated average pay rise of 2.8 percent in 2018, slightly more than the maximum 2.7 percent employers had said they were willing to pay. Some adjustments were also made to pensions for low-paid workers, although a union demand for more wide-ranging pension reform was rejected and will be subject to a future government study. A separate claim of compensation for travel-related expenses was resolved, unions said.

Analysts warned the drama would be a long-running one given the lengthy public discussion period on U.S. tariff proposals meant the earliest they might be imposed was somewhere around late July or early August. “This is not going to happen tomorrow, and given the mercurial nature of the U.S. administration, the whole issue could well disappear before anything really happens,” said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global. “Many market participants may be starting to think that this is just a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing in the end.

2018-04-09,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada (KML.TO) on Sunday suspended most work on a C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) oil pipeline expansion that has become the focus of protests, a move underscoring uncertainty over major energy projects in Canada. Company Chairman Steve Kean said he would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which takes crude from Alberta’s oil sands to a facility in the Pacific province of British Columbia, unless the various legal challenges could be resolved by May 31. The announcement was a blow to the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which approved the project and says it is in the national interest.  The project - considered crucial for an oil industry hit by transportation bottlenecks - is fiercely opposed by British Columbia’s left-leaning New Democratic government, many municipalities, some aboriginal groups, and environmental activists concerned about possible oil spills. “We will be judicious in our use of shareholder funds. In keeping with that commitment, we have determined that in the current environment, we will not put KML shareholders at risk on the remaining project spend,” Kean said in a statement.  The firm is currently carrying out preliminary work and has not started construction. Many in the energy industry are concerned about whether any new pipelines can be built in Canada, which sits on the world’s third largest proven reserves of crude and is the single largest exporter of energy to the United States. Although the federal government has the power to approve major pipelines, the 10 provinces enjoy broad responsibility for resource development. That can result in deadlock when a province opposes a decision made by Ottawa. “This is not good. I think the key point is it shows a lack of confidence in our political and regulatory system,” said Tim Pickering, president of Auspice Capital in Calgary, Alberta. Last October, TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) abandoned its C$15.7 billion Energy East pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic Coast amid mounting regulatory hurdles. The inability to get oil to ports for export means Canadian crude has been trading at a discount of up to $25 a barrel this year, costing Alberta’s heavy oil producers C$30 million to C$40 million in revenue per day. Federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said in a statement that “with all our partners, we continue to consider all available options.”  Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said she was very optimistic the project would go ahead and repeated calls on Trudeau’s government to do more to ensure it would be built. “Alberta is prepared to be an investor in the pipeline. If we take that step, we will be a significantly more determined investor - this pipeline will be built,” she told reporters. Trudeau visited the oil sands on Friday and reiterated the government’s determination that the expansion go ahead. British Columbia’s government proposed environmental rules this year that were seen as a direct attack on the project. It later edged back from a pledge to block increased shipments of crude oil through the province, which had sparked a trade war with Alberta. “British Columbians expect their government to stand up for their interests and our coast, and to do everything we can to protect our land and waters, our coastal communities and our local economies,” Premier John Horgan said in a statement. Mike Hudema, climate campaigner with Greenpeace Canada, said: “The writing is on the wall, and even Kinder Morgan can read it. Investors should note that the opposition to this project is strong, deep and gets bigger by the day.” Additional reporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver and Bhanu Pratap in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio and Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline/update-3-kinder-morgan-halts-most-work-on-disputed-canada-pipeline-expansion-idUKL1N1RL0EL,09 Apr 2018,"Kinder Morgan Canada on

U.S. WTI crude futures were at $62.17 a barrel at 0019 GMT, up 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their previous settlement. Brent crude futures were at $67.23 per barrel, up 12 cents, or 0.2 percent. Oil prices fell about 2 percent on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China, reigniting fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that could hurt global growth. “While it’s possible an escalating trade war could dent global growth sentiment, the real fear is that China, if pushed hard enough, could slap a tax on U.S. oil imported into China,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. In physical oil markets, OPEC’s number two producer Iraq said on Monday that it is keeping prices for its crude supplies in May steady. In the United States, drillers added 11 rigs looking for new production in the week to April 6, bringing the total count to 808, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. As a result, U.S. exports have soared in recent months, “more than offsetting the Venezuelan supply disruption” as a result of the economic crisis in the South American OPEC-member, Innes said. Despite this, oil prices have generally been supported by healthy demand as well as by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started in 2017 in order to rein in oversupply and prop up prices.

2018-04-09,"KUALA LUMPUR, April 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Obesity rates among children in Asia-Pacific are rising at a rapid rate, and more action is needed to encourage healthier lifestyles and ease pressure on fledgling healthcare systems, researchers said. The number of overweight children under five rose 38 percent between 2000 and 2016 in the region, and the problem is growing, said Sridhar Dharmapuri, a food safety and nutrition officer at the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Bangkok. “The rate of growth in obesity in Asia-Pacific is higher than in many other countries,” Dharmapuri told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “While the United States leads the way on obesity rates, the number of overweight children in Asia-Pacific is rising rapidly, and many countries in this region are now among the most health-threatened in the world.” Adult obesity rates are highest in the United States, Mexico, New Zealand and Hungary, and lowest in Japan and South Korea, according to a report on member states by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. But the rapid rise in obesity among young people in Asia-Pacific is worrying because overweight children are at higher risk of becoming obese as adults and then developing serious health problems like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and liver disease. Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand are among the most overweight countries in Southeast Asia, while Samoa, Tonga and Nauru are the most overweight in the Pacific. Australia also has high rates of obesity. Many of these nations are also struggling to tackle malnutrition among their citizens. The cost to the Asia-Pacific region of citizens being overweight or obese is $166 billion a year, a recent report by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) said. Rising wealth levels over the last 20 years have played a major role in the rise in obesity levels, researchers say. “The region has undergone economic growth, so food has become available at a relatively cheaper price,” said Matthias Helble, an economist at the ADBI in Tokyo. “For the last 20 years the economic growth has been almost uninterrupted,” said Helble, who has researched obesity levels in the region for three years. The “obesity time bomb” will be discussed by the 46 member governments attending the FAO conference for Asia and the Pacific, which starts in Fiji from Monday. In addition to consuming more, as economies have grown, people in Asia-Pacific have moved away from farming into manufacturing, and then to service sector jobs - which are more sedentary, researchers said. Cities in Asia-Pacific have also seen unprecedented growth over the last two decades; this year more than half the region’s population will for the first time be urban, the United Nations has estimated. City-dwellers in Asia-Pacific can spend hours commuting - due to poor transport systems and infrastructure - and when they finally reach home they have little time to cook. Many opt to eat out. This new lifestyle has caused a rise in the consumption of convenience and processed foods, which often contain excess fats and more salt and sugar, researchers said. People in the region also struggle to maintain a balanced diet, said Dharmapuri, with meals often lacking vegetables. “The diet is largely rice-based,” he said. “On anybody’s plate, rice takes up between 50-70 percent of the space.” When people are overweight they often suffer from other health problems, economists said, and this is likely to put pressure on public healthcare systems that are only just being established in many Asia-Pacific nations. Absenteeism from work is also higher among obese people, said Helble, adding that overweight people often die earlier than those who lead healthy lives, so have a shorter productive life. “The term ‘obesogenic environment’ has been used to describe an environment that promotes obesity among individuals and populations,” Elizabeth Ingram of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - a government statistics agency - said by email. “It includes physical, economic, political, and sociocultural factors.” Fixing the problem will likely take years, and researchers said a joint effort by business and governments was needed. Better labeling on foods to promote healthier options, education about healthier diets and lifestyles, and even healthier school meals would improve the situation, analysts said. “Being obese can also be seen as a sign of prosperity, because you have enough food to show your wealth through the fact that you have a lot to eat,” said Helble. Sugar taxes, which have been introduced or are being discussed in the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia, are also one way to change people’s mindset, he added. Building more sports facilities at schools and ensuring urban planners include recreational areas for cities and make them more walkable and less polluted, is also crucial. Governments must work with retailers, like in Singapore, to create a coordinated approach on packaging and promote a balanced diet, researchers said. Working with retailers to ban unhealthy and sweet foods from checkout areas, and pushing street vendors to switch from fried foods to healthier, more traditional options, are also key. And countries should adopt a “farm to fork” approach, which encourages farmers to diversify what they grow and be less reliant on growing just rice, said Dharmapuri. ""In some Pacific island countries, it's actually easier to buy soft drinks and processed foods than buy fruits and vegetables,"" said Dharmapuri. ""It's almost a delicacy to have a vegetable in a restaurant."" (Reporting by Michael Taylor, Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2018-04-09,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s coalition government on Monday lost a 30th straight major opinion poll, a symbolic defeat that intensifies pressure on him after he used the same milestone to oust his predecessor. The latest widely watched Newspoll, published in The Australian newspaper, showed the Liberal-National coalition trailing the opposition Labor Party 52-48 on a two-party preferred basis, a margin that would deliver Turnbull an election defeat. Although Australia is a year away from a general election, the Newspoll leaves Turnbull facing questions about his future.  Three Australian prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since 2010, dumped by colleagues after their popularity began to wane. Once widely popular, Turnbull has fallen out of favour after a wave of scandals, including the resignation of his former deputy after revelations he was expecting a child with his former press secretary, and an eligibility crisis that saw the government temporarily lose its parliamentary majority. A surge by right-wing minor parties and factions of his own party has forced Turnbull to embrace conservative policies, damaging his reputation as a liberal. There was some good news for the embattled leader with a Fairfax/Ipsos poll published by The Australian Financial Review over the weekend showing that many Australians have grown weary of a revolving-door leadership.  Some 62 percent of those surveyed said they wanted Turnbull to remain prime minister. Senior government lawmakers have also backed Turnbull. “Malcolm Turnbull retains the confidence of the vast majority of our party room,” Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, deputy leader of the Liberal Party, told Sky News. Even former prime minister and party leader Tony Abbott, ousted by Turnbull in September 2017, and who has led much of the criticism of him, set a conciliatory tone. “The point I’d make is that we shouldn’t obsess over polls. I never did. I don’t think that others should,” Abbott told reporters in Victoria state.  However, Abbott took the opportunity to sharpen his criticism of the government’s refusal to build a coal-fired power station.  Australia’s electricity supply business has becomes a hot political issue following a string of blackouts and price spikes. “We should be the party of low power prices and that means more coal-fired power generation,” Abbott said.
