2018-03-25,"(Reuters) - International oil trader Vitol was hurt by a drop in profit last year due to tough market conditions prompted by the recovery in oil prices, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the results.  Vitol posted net income of $1.5 billion (1.06 billion pounds) in the year ending December, down from more than $2 billion in 2016, one of its best years on record, the newspaper reported. The privately held commodity trader found it difficult to make money from storing cheap barrels of crude and selling them later, the FT said.      The fall in full-year net income does not include gains from assets sales worth $300 million, the report said.     The Swiss-based company, which does not publicise its entire financial information, has earlier benefited from market volatility and opportunities to lock in profit in 2016 by storing oil and selling futures contracts for delivery at higher prices.  However, the FT said results have diminished due to a shift to “backwardation” - where price of a commodity for future delivery is lower than the spot price.  During 2016, Vitol consolidated and expanded its presence in the retail sector by increasing its stakes in existing ventures while also adding Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) aviation business in Australia. Vitol declined to comment on the FT report.

2018-03-25,"(Adds details) By Hamid Ould Ahmed ORAN, Algeria, March 25 (Reuters) - Algeria plans to offer tax incentives in a planned new energy law to attract more investment and is in discussion with foreign energy firms including BP and Anadarko to exploit its shale gas reserves, officials said on Sunday. OPEC member Algeria is a key gas supplier to Europe, but growing domestic consumption has been hitting energy exports, the main source of the state budget. In a bid to reverse the fall, the energy ministry has started drafting amendments to the energy law, promising more incentives for foreign investors. “We will remove all obstacles, wage a battle against bureaucracy and change tax procedures,” Energy Minister Mustapha Guitouni told a gas and gas conference in the western city of Oran. “The amendment is required by our energy security,” he said. “The current system must change. We will intensify consultations with our partners.” The law has been in the works for years and is seen as key to attracting more investment but no draft or details have been presented yet. In the latest bidding round in 2014, Algeria awarded only four of 31 blocks on offer after a disappointing auction in 2011 as foreign firms balked at the terms. Algeria was already preparing to exploit shale gas to boost output after failed attempts in the past years due to protests by residents of affected areas over fears of pollution. “Evaluation studies on shale gas potential are going on. This will take 5 to 10 years,” he said, without providing further details. Arezki Hocini, the head of the National Agency for the Valorization of Hydrocarbon Resources (Almaty), said Algeria had already started discussions with oil majors including BP and Anadarko to help evaluate and exploit shale gas. “We hope these discussions will lead to talks over possible contracts,” he told reporters, without providing details. While seeking to attract foreign investors state-run oil and gas company Sonatrach is also trying to expand abroad, mainly in the Middle East, Guitouni said. “Egypt is interested in working with us,” he said, without elaborating. Sonatrach earlier this year signed an agreement with Iraqi companies to form joint ventures for gas projects. Sonatrach had already started operations in Peru and neighbouring Libya, Niger and Mali. Algeria has been talking for years about opening up the energy sector but some in the political elite have resisted this.

2018-03-25,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing and 33 other northern Chinese cities have issued smog alerts for the next few days as industrial output ramps up again after the end of winter restrictions, China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said on Sunday. The Chinese capital late on Saturday declared its third orange pollution alert of 2018 and the second this month. An orange alert is the second-highest warning behind red in China’s four-tier system. The alert, which requires industrial factories to limit output by 30 percent to 50 percent, will be in operation for March 26-28. Other cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding region, including Zhengzhou and Shijiazhuang, have also put orange alerts in place until March 28 and will take prompt measures to reduce emissions, the ministry said on its official WeChat account. The Chinese government ordered 28 northern cities to impose special restrictions on polluting industries, such as steel and aluminum, during the winter heating season that ran from mid-November to mid-March, but these have mostly been lifted.  Emissions from residential heating have dropped with the end of the heating season, but “industrial production and transportation of goods have increased significantly”, the ministry said.  Beijing achieved the biggest reduction in average pollution among the 28 cities from October to February, the ministry said last week. The capital’s first orange alert this year ran from Jan. 13 to Jan. 15. The second was for March 12-14. It has issued no red alerts so far this year.

2018-03-25,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Nearly a third of the 25 top U.S. shale oil producers have paid or pledged to pay dividends this year, according to Reuters review of financial filings, the largest number since the shale boom took off a decade ago.  Oil prices CLc1 have risen by over a third in the past year, giving shale producers more revenue to respond to investor calls for improved shareholder returns. Investors in shale have seen thin returns despite booming production, as shale firms have used profits to invest in raising output more rather than returning cash to shareholders. Seven U.S. independent shale producers, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), have boosted quarterly dividends this year, financial disclosures show. That’s a change from just two years ago, when eight of the 25 largest shale firms cut payouts as oil prices CLc1 plunged. “Investors are using a large megaphone as they talk to the industry about returns, and it’s on the minds of a lot of CEOs,” Travis Stice, chief executive of shale producer Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O), said in an interview.     Diamondback last month announced a 12.5-cent quarterly dividend, becoming the first U.S. shale oil company to start a payout since the oil price downturn began in 2014, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Shares of the Midland, Texas-based company, which operates in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, are up about 11 percent since the move.  “You’re going to see more shale producers focus on dividends,” said Leigh Goehring of G&R Associates, a New York-based energy investment research firm. “Shareholders are demanding it and a trend is forming.”  Since January, 11 shale producers have disclosed plans to spend $3.5 billion on stock buybacks.Oil producers this week will meet investors at an industry conference in New Orleans, a gathering that energy firms often use to outline annual production goals and to shape investor expectations for first-quarter results. Calls are likely for more companies to begin offering payouts through dividends or share repurchases. The outlook for continued production gains and the impact of rising service costs also will be on investors’ agenda.     “There does seem to be increasing evidence of financial prudence in the industry,” said Andy McConn of oil consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Twelve of the 25 largest shale firms do not have quarterly payouts, choosing instead to reinvest cash in drilling and other projects. Parsley Energy Inc (PE.N) and Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N) are among the largest of that group, focusing on driving growth in the largest- and second-largest U.S. shale fields, respectively. That may change as more of their peers focus on payouts. “Investors are looking for improving results, better returns and operational performance,” said Maynard Holt, chief executive of energy investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

2018-03-25,"ASHGABAT (Reuters) - Turkmenistan is voting in a parliamentary election on Sunday, with a choice of three parties and some independents, but all the candidates are ultimately loyal to President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, leader of the gas-rich nation. One of the candidates is the president’s son, Serdar Berdymukhamedov, regarded by observers as a potential successor to the 60-year-old leader, who is referred to by local people as  Arkadag, or Protector. Although the vote takes place against the backdrop of foreign currency shortages brought on by a drop in gas exports, there are no opposition parties in the former Soviet republic of six million.  Polling stations greeted voters with national music and dance shows, and snacks. “The election is a real holiday for us, which will bring peace, prosperity and stability,” said Maskat Muratdyrdyev, 26, head of a provincial polling station not far from Ashgabat. Official data shows almost a quarter of registered voters had cast their ballots by 9 a.m. (0400 GMT), within the first two hours of voting. Not everyone was enthusiastic, though. “I have three kids to feed, gasoline prices have gone up and everything has become more expensive,” said taxi driver Mergen, 36, who said he would not vote. “I think they will deal with the election without me.” There are 284 candidates contesting 125 seats in the single-chamber legislature, whose main job is to rubber-stamp bills drafted by the cabinet. Another legislative body in the predominantly Muslim nation is the Halk Maslahaty, or People’s Council, chaired by the president, which has more powers than parliament and consists of deputies elected by local councils. However, the position of parliament speaker is important, because holders of the office become acting president if the head of state is unable to carry out his work. Some observers have tipped Serdar Berdymukhamedov, 36, to eventually become speaker and the designated successor to his father, who has run the country since 2007 and is the centre of an extravagant personality cult. A golden statue of the president riding a horse stands in the centre of Ashgabat. In a symbolic move, Serdar Berdymukhamedov, who had worked as a diplomat before becoming an MP in 2016, attended a summit of Central Asian leaders in Kazakhstan this month that his father skipped. Turkmenistan’s economy depends heavily on exports of natural gas and Russia was its main customer for decades, thanks to Soviet-era pipelines. But Moscow halted purchases of Turkmen gas in 2016, leaving as the main buyer China, which has built its own pipeline from scratch. The Ashgabat government is building a new pipeline through neighbouring Afghanistan to Pakistan and China in an attempt to open up additional export markets.

2018-03-25,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China pledged on Sunday to press ahead with market opening and reforms while reiterating that it will treat domestic and foreign firms equally and protect intellectual property rights. The pledge on reform and equal treatment came from Vice Premier Han Zheng, at a time there are increasing prospects of a trade war with the United States. Han, making his first speech since being named executive vice premier earlier this month, told the China Development Forum in Beijing that China needs to “open even wider to the outside world,” and would do so via its Belt and Road Initiative.   China is fully aware that economic globalization is “irreversible,” said Han, adding that unilateralism and trade protectionism served nobody’s interests. Also at the forum, He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said China “will deepen supply-side structural reforms and work hard to eliminate ineffective supply”.  Earlier this month, the NDRC said China, the world’s biggest steel and coal producer, would cut its annual steel capacity by around 30 million tonnes and coal capacity by about 150 million tonnes this year. China will also promote international capacity cooperation as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, which Beijing considers to be a modern-day ‘silk road’, and widen access to the Chinese market, including the financial, telecom and education sectors, He said. It will also “give equal protection to property rights of all ownership types by law,” and strengthen protection of intellectual property rights, said He, adding that China would better integrate its financial sector and real economy.  John Frisbie, president of the U.S.-China Business Council told Reuters China “has been promising market-opening measures and protection of intellectual property for some time, but what the U.S. business community is waiting for is action.” The United States launched a complaint against China at the World Trade Organization on Friday, part of a package of trade measures announced by President Donald Trump on Thursday over China’s alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property.. China’s Ministry of Commerce said on Friday it opposed U.S. unilateralism and protectionism after Washington unveiled plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods following an intellectual property probe. Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple (AAPL.O), who is co-chairing the forum, told the meeting the business community “has always supported the idea that open markets foster new ideas and allow entrepreneurship to thrive.”  “The strongest companies and economies are those that are open - those that thrive on diversity of people and ideas,” said Cook, who on Saturday called for “calm heads” in the brewing U.S.-China trade dispute.

2018-03-25,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Almost a month after a deadly earthquake, Papua New Guinea is struggling to get aid to desperate survivors, having allocated just a fraction of its relief funds, while a rent dispute left disaster officials briefly locked out of their offices. The scale of the emergency is testing the finances and capacity of one of the world’s poorest countries, disaster and relief officials say, after the magnitude 7.5 quake rocked its remote mountainous highlands on Feb. 26, killing 100 people.  (For a graphic on 'Papua New Guinea quake' click tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR) Thousands of survivors have walked to remote airstrips and jungle clearings, awaiting helicopters bringing supplies of food, water and medicines, aid agencies and authorities say. “To date, we do not have any money to do all the necessary things,” Tom Edabe, the disaster coordinator for the hardest-hit province of Hela, said by telephone from Tari, its capital. “(The) government is trying to assist and have budgeted some money, but to date we have not received anything...we have only been given food, and non-food items supplied by other NGOs.” Continuing aftershocks rattle residents, who have to collect water brought by daily rainstorms to ensure adequate supplies,   Edabe, the disaster coordinator, said. “The biggest thing that people need, apart from food, is water,” said James Pima, a helicopter pilot and flight manager at aviation firm HeliSolutions in the Western Highlands capital of Mt. Hagen, about 170 km (100 miles) from the disaster zone.   “They don’t have clean water to cook or drink ... they are standing there staring. The expression on their faces is blank.” His firm’s three helicopters fly relief missions “fully flat-out every day,” Pima added. Destruction to roads and runways means authorities must rely on helicopters to fly in relief. But while nimble, the craft can only carry smaller loads than fixed-wing aircraft and cannot fly during the afternoon thunderstorms. The logistics problems wind all the way to PNG’s disaster center, where officials told Reuters they had been locked out of their office in Port Moresby, the capital, for two days last week after the government missed a rental payment. “That was correct, Monday and Tuesday,” a spokeswoman said. In a joint report with the United Nations published on Friday, the agency cited “lack of quality data” about food shortages, limited aircraft assets and “significant gaps” in sanitation support as being the biggest problems it faced.      The office of Prime Minister Peter O’Neill did not respond to emailed questions from Reuters. On his website, O’Neill has previously said, “There will be no quick fix, the damage from this disaster will take months and years to be repaired.” The government had approved relief funds amounting to 450 million kina ($130 million), O’Neill said initially, but a later statement mentioned only 3 million kina in initial relief - or less than 1 percent - had been allocated to the worst-hit areas. In its November budget, the government made plans to rein in spending and trim debt projected to stand at 25.8 billion kina in 2018. The impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner, after the quake forced a shutdown of Exxon Mobil Corp’s liquefied natural gas project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices. The firm is still assessing quake damage at its facilities. O’Neill last week hit out at critics of the aid effort for playing “political games,” while thanking Australia and New Zealand for military aircraft that provided assistance beyond the capacity of PNG’s own defense forces. His political opponent, former Prime Minister Mekere Morauta, had called the government’s response “tardy” and inadequate. “Relief sources say mobile medical centers and operating theaters are needed urgently, and that only international partners can supply them,” Morauta said last week. Foreign aid pledges of about $49 million have come in from Australia, China, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand and the United States, says the United Nations, most of it provided by private companies. Exxon and its partner, Oil Search Ltd, say they have provided $6 million in cash and kind for quake relief. Local officials say the scale of destruction, with villages buried by landslides and provincial towns flattened, has overwhelmed authorities in Papua New Guinea, which straddles the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire. “Policemen are still struggling because there is no support flying in and out,” said Naring Bongi of the quake-damaged police station in the Southern Highlands capital of Mendi.  “There is not enough food to supply care centers, they need fresh water,” he added.
