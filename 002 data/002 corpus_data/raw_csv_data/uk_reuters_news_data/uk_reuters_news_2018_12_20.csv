2018-12-20,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ministers from European Union countries agreed on Thursday to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from trucks and buses by 30 percent by 2030, albeit with the potential to review this in 2022, the EU’s Austrian presidency said. Environment ministers struck the deal, balancing the interests of Germany and the continent’s largest auto sector with other countries, such as Sweden, which pushed for a sharper cut.  The countries, collectively known as the Council, will still have to negotiate next year with the European Parliament, which envisages a tougher 2030 target of a 35 percent cut. The government representatives also agreed on Thursday to an interim target of a 15 percent reduction by 2025, relative to 2019 levels. The parliament is pushing for 20 percent. The EU currently has no limits on emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, unlike other countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada. Trucks account for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions. Curbs on the transport sector, the only one in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate accord. The EU agreed on Monday on targets for cutting emissions from cars and vans. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) has lobbied for far lower reduction targets for trucks of 7 percent by 2025 and 16 percent by 2030. ACEA has said that the potential for electrifying truck fleets is far lower than for cars and that it would only really work for short trips within cities, but not for long-haul transit.  Volkswagen’s (VW) (VOWG_p.DE) truck brand MAN has warned the new CO2 limits could cost tens of thousands of jobs. Germany is home to the largest truck producer, Daimler. Other manufacturers in Europe include Volvo, Italy-based Iveco, Paccar and Scania, also part of Volkswagen.

2018-12-20,"* Uganda says tax on sale about $167 million * Tullow says deal should not attract substantial taxes * Uganda says plans licensing round in 2020 (Adds Tullow comment) By Elias Biryabarema KAMPALA, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Uganda’s energy minister said on Thursday she had given Tullow Oil conditional approval to sell part of its stake in Ugandan oilfields to France’s Total and China’s CNOOC but only after $167 million of tax on the deal is paid. London-listed Tullow agreed early last year to sell Total most of its stake in Ugandan fields for $900 million but CNOOC later exercised its pre-emption rights to buy half of the Tullow assets on sale. “I gave conditional consent for this transaction, subject to payment of tax obligations, as assessed by the Uganda Revenue Authority of about $167 million,” Energy Minister Irene Muloni told a news conference. The three firms currently each hold a 33.3 percent stake in the fields and Tullow is now selling 21.5 percent of its stake, which will be split equally between Total and CNOOC. Tullow spokesman George Cazenove said in an emailed statement Tullow believed it should not have to pay the assessed Ugandan tax. “As Tullow has stated on a number of occasions, we believe that this deal should not attract substantial tax liabilities and that this position is supported by Uganda’s tax laws,” he said. “Tullow and its partners remain in discussions with the Government of Uganda on this matter and the deal will only complete when those negotiations are brought to a satisfactory conclusion.” Muloni said after the deal is finalised, Tullow would be a non-operator and Total would be the operator in the northern part of License Area 2, while CNOOC Uganda would be the operator of the southern part of the area. “Given the above progress, we now expect the licensed companies to undertake the final investment decision for the upstream projects before June 2019,” she said. Uganda discovered commercial crude oil deposits in the west of the country near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. The start of commercial production has been repeatedly delayed due to a lack of required infrastructure such as a refinery and an export pipeline. The government said last month that it now expects oil production to start in 2021, a year later than previously expected. Muloni said the government also planned to do another licensing round for vacant blocks in 2020, but the number of blocks that would be auctioned has yet to be determined. Muloni said Uganda’s gross crude reserves had also been revised downwards after new reservoir analyses, to 6 billion barrels from 6.5 billion previously. Recoverable reserves remained at 1.4 billion barrels. Ugandan fields also held 500 billion cubic feet of natural gas, she said. The oil firms are expected to spend between $15 billion and $20 billion to develop Ugandan fields and the associated infrastructure and the East African country is banking on that investment and potential proceeds from crude exports of about 200,000 barrels per day to drive growth.

2018-12-20,"NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - World equity markets continued a weeklong slide on Thursday amid investor concerns after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it was set on its interest rate-hiking path next year even amid signs global economic growth is stuttering. The Fed’s move on Wednesday to largely adhere to its plan for additional rate hikes over the next two years raised worries for market participants from Asia to Europe, as major indexes fell to their lowest in two years and investors flocked to the relative safety of government debt. European shares fell 0.9 percent, with benchmark indexes in Germany, Britain and France all hitting their lowest since late 2016. Indexes in Japan and South Korea fell into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from recent highs, joining benchmark indexes in Shanghai and Hong Kong. MSCI’s global equity index fell to its lowest since May 2017, shedding nearly 0.8 percent as it headed for a fifth straight day of losses. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger ‘put’ from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 139.99 points, or 0.6 percent, to 23,183.67, the S&P 500 lost 8.49 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,498.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.73 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,630.09. The Fed on Wednesday stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it considers robust, and hiked key overnight lending rates as expected by 0.25 percent point. It said “some further gradual” rate hikes would be needed in the year ahead, with policymakers projecting two rises on average next year instead of the three predicted in September. Although largely in line with expectations, that tweak did little to soothe investor concerns over slowing world growth, U.S. trade tensions with China, and tightening monetary conditions for companies in the world’s biggest economy. The equity losses added to the worst year for world stocks since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent. Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off global stock markets this year, with emerging markets trampled flat by a charging dollar. The angst in equity markets pushed investors towards the safety of government bonds. German 10-year government bond yields, the euro zone benchmark, fell to their lowest in nearly seven months. Other high grade euro zone bond yields also fell. Benchmark 10-year U.S. notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.7654 percent, from 2.776 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices, meanwhile, slumped as worries about oversupply and worldwide demand for energy pushed prices back towards their lowest levels in over a year. U.S. crude fell 2.5 percent to $46.92 per barrel, while Brent fell 2.1 percent to $56.04 per barrel. “Growth concerns continue to percolate in the background, and you can see that with oil prices coming off,” said Alvin Tan, an foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale. The dollar index fell 0.55 percent, with the euro up 0.54 percent to $1.1436.

2018-12-20,"(Repeats with no changes) * World stocks take biggest beating since 2008 * Dollar up nearly 6 percent, emerging markets shredded * Oil takes late plunge, metals hit hard * Few places to hide, gold and U.S. govt debt have lost By Marc Jones LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Traders will be glad to see the back of 2018. Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off world stocks, emerging markets have been trampled flat by a charging dollar and even gold and U.S. government bonds have lost money. A grisly combination of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in former hot spots has wiped 10 percent off MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index — its first double-digit loss in any year since the 2008 global financial crisis. Many places have fared far worse. Top Chinese shares have fallen 25 percent into ‘bear’ territory, export bellwether Germany has shed 16 percent, and Turkey and Argentina have led emerging markets losses, down 45 and 50 percent respectively. Add in a wild 35 percent plunge in oil prices since September, rises in Italian, Greek and now French borrowing costs that show euro zone worries remain alive, and a full scale cryptocurrency collapse, and it has been unequivocally brutal. “After 10 years of low interest rates and quantitative easing I think we have to understand how some of this leverage in the market can unwind,” said Allianz Global Investors fund manager and global strategist Neil Dwane. “What was a virtuous circle on the way up can become a vicious one on the way down.” A fair bit of the year’s pain has stemmed from swift move up in U.S. interest rates and a pumped-up dollar, which has had its best year in three years. As a result, the euro, pound, Canadian and Aussie dollars and Swedish crown have all lost between 5 and 10 percent and though the Japanese yen comes out largely unscathed, emerging markets certainly haven’t. Argentina’s peso and Turkey’s lira have slumped 50 and 30 percent, while India’s rupee, South Africa’s rand, Brazil’s real and Russia’s rouble are all down between 10 to 15 percent. China’s yuan is in the red for a fourth year in five. Emerging market shares meanwhile have haemorrhaged almost 17 percent and JP Morgan's EM local currency bond index has lost nearly 8 percent. tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh Dalton Investments emerging market portfolio manager Pedro Zevallos said the big falls meant many markets, including China were now cheap. “But right now it honestly feels like catching a falling knife.” “And my concern going into next year is that the dollar will continue to strengthen.” As well as the escalation in global trade tensions this year there has been the realisation among investors that the big central banks aren’t thinking about stimulating the economy anymore — they’re trying to rebuild their arsenals in case of recession. But the year hasn’t been a complete write-off everywhere. While the S&P 500 and Dow Wall Street bellwethers are down the most since 2008, at around 5 percent their losses aren’t too bad, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is clinging on for its 10th consecutive year of gains. The FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) have had rollercoaster year. As a group, they are ending 2018 worth roughly $2.8 trillion — more or less where they started it, but down some $800 billion or 24 percent from their late August peak. There has been a big parting of the ways too. While Amazon and Netflix have surged 33 and 45 percent, repeated scandals over data misuse and fake news propagation have slashed 19 percent off Facebook shares. Asia’s equivalent BAT group, made up of Badia, Alibaba and Tencent, have all down somewhere between 18 and 25 percent. With China also the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has contributed to the respective 17 and 23 percent declines in the price of copper and zinc, used in things like pipes and galvanised steel. The big cryptocollapse has seen Bitcoin crash 72 percent. There are now over 2,000 other digital currencies in circulation but their value has plummeted to $128 billion from over $800 billion in January. But even traditional safe-havens have failed to provide much in the way of protection. Another four U.S. interest hikes have cost Treasury bond holders nearly 2 percent despite a better last few months and the euro’s fall puts German Bunds down 2.3 percent in dollar terms. Gold is 4 percent less precious. Italy’s government bonds meanwhile have plunged 9 percent after an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its huge bond-buying programme will end this year. “The question as we look into 2019 and 2020 is how much worse the trade/tech cold war and Brexit get,” Allianz’s Dwayne said. “That could tells us that maybe we are not going to see a traditional downturn but a significant one.” Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets-2018/rpt-graphic-markets-suffer-worst-year-since-global-financial-crisis-idUKL8N1YP2H3,20 Dec 2018,"Traders will be glad to see the

2018-12-20,"(Repeast earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Forecasting the year-ahead outlook for commodities, while popular among analysts, is a bit of a mug’s game at the best of times, but the view for 2019 is made even more complicated by one volatile factor: Donald Trump. While there are other drivers of commodity prices next year, the mercurial U.S. president looms large over the sector, and the actions of his administration will either amplify or partially nullify the established trends. Before trying to decipher Trump’s likely actions it’s worth looking at the trends likely to move commodity markets in 2019. Chief among these is increasing concern about slower global economic growth, with particular worries over China, the world’s second-largest economy and the biggest importer of commodities. There are roughly two schools of thought on China, the first being that the country will have to endure lower growth and tighter credit conditions as it struggles to overcome U.S. tariffs on its exports and slower growth in other trading partners. The second is that once again Beijing will successfully manage to open the spending taps and the subsequent raft of infrastructure and construction projects will keep commodity demand healthy and economic growth above the 6 percent level. The second scenario would be supportive for imports, and prices, for bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal, and for industrial metals, most notably copper. However, it’s also worth noting that much of what Beijing is likely to do is dependent on how its trade dispute with the United States unfolds. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping appeared to reach some sort of detente at the recent G20 meeting in Argentina, but it’s still an open question as to whether this can morph into an agreement acceptable to both sides. The pattern of the dispute so far has been dictated by Trump, who has alternated between ramping up rhetoric and calming it down, which does little more than create opportunities for volatility traders. The real question to be answered is whether both China and the United States are prepared to weather the pain of an extended trade dispute. It’s likely to be the case that the country upon which the most tariffs are imposed, in this case China, will feel the economic cost first. But the United States will also eventually feel the fallout through higher costs of goods, rising inflation, lower consumer spending and a loss of competitiveness in industries no longer exposed to international rivals. How these dynamics play out largely depend on Trump’s actions. The U.S. leader may come under increasing pressure from within his Republican Party to reach an accommodation with China if the economy starts to slow and the equity markets continue their recent downward trend. Trump has staked much of his presidency’s success on delivering a strong economy with high returns for investors, and if this is challenged it may force him to seek ways to maintain economic momentum. However, Trump is also likely to be distracted by his mounting legal difficulties and by the takeover of the House of Representatives by the Democratic Party. The threat of legal action and further investigations into his affairs, as well as his friendliness toward Saudi Arabia and Russia, also are a major factor likely to influence crude oil. The Trump administration effectively kicked the can on its re-imposition of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme down the road until April, when the import waivers granted to Tehran’s biggest customers are set to expire. This is likely to ignite debate over whether the crude oil market will tighten if Trump does end the waivers allowing Iran to export, or whether U.S. shale output will be enough to keep the market in surplus. The interplay between Trump, embattled Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian strong man Vladimir Putin will also be key for the actions taken by the world’s three largest oil producers. The trouble for analysts is that there is no way to be certain how all the factors around Trump will develop. His legal woes may amount to little, or they may lead to his impeachment and removal from office. Trump may reach a deal with China that ends the tariff war, or he may not and it could escalate. He may really crack down on Iran’s oil exports, or he may not. In some ways, commodity markets have become unwitting hostages to the man likely to be regarded as the most controversial political leader of his time.

2018-12-20,"* Europe indexes fall to lowest in two years * Oil falls 4 percent * Tokyo, Seoul bourses join Chinese benchmarks in bear market * Fed seen less dovish than hoped (Updates prices, adds strategist comment) By Tom Wilson LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - World equity markets slipped on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve dashed investor hopes of a more dovish policy outlook, worsening worries of a recession as signs grow that global economic growth is stuttering. Jitters over the Fed’s move to largely keep guidance for additional hikes over the next two years spread from Asia to Europe, where major indexes fell to their lowest in two years and investors flocked to the relative safety of government debt. European shares fell 0.9 percent, with bourses in Germany, Britain and France all hitting their lowest levels since late 2016. MSCI’s global equity index fell to its lowest since May 2017, shedding as much as 0.7 percent as it headed for a fifth straight day of losses. By midday GMT it was down 0.3 percent. The Fed on Wednesday stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it views as strong, hiking key overnight lending rates, as expected, by 0.25 percent points. It said “some further gradual” rate hikes would be needed in the year ahead, with policymakers projecting two rises on average next year instead of the three predicted in September. Although largely in line with expectations, that tweak failed to soothe a cocktail of market fears over slowing world growth, U.S. trade tensions with China, and tightening monetary conditions for companies in the world’s biggest economy. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8 percent. Indexes in Japan and South Korea fell into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from the highest point of the last year, joining bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger ‘put’ from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. The angst in equity markets saw investors flock towards the safety of government bonds. German 10-year government bond yields, the euro zone benchmark, fell to their lowest in nearly seven months. Other high grade euro zone bond yields also fell. Bund yields followed those of U.S. Treasuries, which sank to more than eight-month lows. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield had earlier fallen as low as 2.750 percent, a level last seen in early April. Oil prices, meanwhile, slumped by more than 4 percent as worries about oversupply and worldwide demand for energy pushed prices back towards their lowest levels in over a year. “Growth concerns continue to percolate in the background, and you can see that with oil prices coming off - that’s a macro story,” said Alvin Tan, an foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale. “You can see this in the U.S. yield curve flattening even further after the Fed.” The rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in yields of long-dated bonds rekindled worries of an inversion between short-yield bonds and 10-year yields - historically a fairly reliable indicator that a recession is brewing. The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.656 percent, just 0.097 percent less than the 10-year yield. The equity losses added to the worst year for world stocks since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent. Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off world stocks this year, with emerging markets trampled flat by a charging dollar. Still, the dollar fell against major currencies after the Fed’s decision to a one-month low, losing ground because of perceptions of a more hawkish position than anticipated. The greenback fell 0.8 percent against its rivals to 96.258. On a daily basis, it is set for the biggest percentage drop in six weeks. The euro gained 0.8 percent to $1.1472, boosted by news that Italy had struck a deal with the European Commission over its contested 2019 budget and some solid trade data this week. In other announcements by central banks, Japan kept its policy settings unchanged, as expected. Britain also kept rates steady, while Sweden raised rates for the first time in over seven years, pushing its currency up against the dollar.

2018-12-20,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Oil producer group OPEC plans to release a table detailing output cut quotas for its members and allies such as Russia in an effort to shore up the price of crude, OPEC’s secretary-general said in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday.  Mohammad Barkindo said to reach the proposed cut of 1.2 million barrels per day, the effective reduction for member countries was 3.02 percent.  That is higher than the initially discussed 2.5 percent as OPEC seeks to accommodate Iran, Libya and Venezuela, which are exempt from any requirement to cut. He commended Saudi Arabia for pledging to cut to 10.2 million barrels per day from January, a deeper reduction than allocated. Sources had initially said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would not publish individual quotas. “In the interests of openness and transparency, and to support market sentiment and confidence, it is vital to make these production adjustments publicly available,” Barkindo told members in the letter. “I would urge Your Excellencies to kindly make positive announcements reinstating your countries’ commitment to implementing the agreed decisions.

Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off world stocks, emerging markets have been trampled flat by a charging dollar and even gold and U.S. government bonds have lost money. A grisly combination of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in former hot spots has wiped 10 percent off MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index — its first double-digit loss in any year since the 2008 global financial crisis. Many places have fared far worse. Top Chinese shares .CSI300 have fallen 25 percent into 'bear' territory, export bellwether Germany .GDAXI has shed 16 percent, and Turkey and Argentina have led emerging markets losses, down 45 and 50 percent respectively. Add in a wild 35 percent plunge in oil prices since September, rises in Italian, Greek and now French borrowing costs that show euro zone worries remain alive, and a full scale cryptocurrency collapse, and it has been unequivocally brutal. “After 10 years of low interest rates and quantitative easing I think we have to understand how some of this leverage in the market can unwind,” said Allianz Global Investors fund manager and global strategist Neil Dwane. “What was a virtuous circle on the way up can become a vicious one on the way down.” A fair bit of the year’s pain has stemmed from swift move up in U.S. interest rates and a pumped-up dollar .DXY, which has had its best year in three years. As a result, the euro EUR=, pound GBP=, Canadian and Aussie dollars CAD=AUD= and Swedish crown SEK= have all lost between 5 and 10 percent and though the Japanese yen JPY= comes out largely unscathed, emerging markets certainly haven't. Argentina's peso ARS= and Turkey's lira TRY= have slumped 50 and 30 percent, while India's rupee IDR=, South Africa's rand ZAR=, Brazil's real BRL= and Russia's rouble RUB= are all down between 10 to 15 percent. China's yuan is in the red for a fourth year in five. Emerging market shares meanwhile have haemorrhaged almost 17 percent and JP Morgan’s EM local currency bond index has lost nearly 8 percent.  Dalton Investments emerging market portfolio manager Pedro Zevallos said the big falls meant many markets, including China were now cheap. “But right now it honestly feels like catching a falling knife.” “And my concern going into next year is that the dollar will continue to strengthen.”  As well as the escalation in global trade tensions this year there has been the realisation among investors that the big central banks aren’t thinking about stimulating the economy anymore — they’re trying to rebuild their arsenals in case of recession. But the year hasn’t been a complete write-off everywhere. While the S&P 500 and Dow Wall Street bellwethers are down the most since 2008, at around 5 percent their losses aren’t too bad, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is clinging on for its 10th consecutive year of gains. The FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) have had rollercoaster year. As a group, they are ending 2018 worth roughly $2.8 trillion — more or less where they started it, but down some $800 billion or 24 percent from their late August peak. There has been a big parting of the ways too. While Amazon (AMZN.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) have surged 33 and 45 percent, repeated scandals over data misuse and fake news propagation have slashed 19 percent off Facebook (FB.O) shares. Asia’s equivalent BAT group, made up of Badia (600865.SS), Alibaba (BABA.K) and Tencent (0700.HK), have all down somewhere between 18 and 25 percent.  With China also the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has contributed to the respective 17 and 23 percent declines in the price of copper and zinc, used in things like pipes and galvanised steel. The big cryptocollapse has seen Bitcoin BTC=BTSP crash 72 percent. There are now over 2,000 other digital currencies in circulation but their value has plummeted to $128 billion from over $800 billion in January. But even traditional safe-havens have failed to provide much in the way of protection. Another four U.S. interest hikes have cost Treasury bond holders nearly 2 percent despite a better last few months and the euro’s fall puts German Bunds down 2.3 percent in dollar terms. Gold is 4 percent less precious. Italy’s government bonds meanwhile have plunged 9 percent after an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its huge bond-buying programme will end this year. “The question as we look into 2019 and 2020 is how much worse the trade/tech cold war and Brexit get,” Allianz’s Dwayne said. “That could tells us that maybe we are not going to see a traditional downturn but a significant one.”  Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets-2018/graphic-markets-suffer-worst-year-since-global-financial-crisis-idUKL8N1YO5N9,20 Dec 2018,"Traders will be glad to see the

2018-12-20,"* Europe indexes fall to lowest in two years * Oil falls 3.4 percent * Japan, Korea bourses join Chinese benchmarks in bear market * Fed seen less dovish than hoped (Changes dateline, adds quote, updates prices) By Tom Wilson LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - World equity markets slumped on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve dashed investor hopes of a more dovish policy outlook even as signs grow that global economic growth is stuttering. Jitters over the Fed’s move to largely keep guidance for additional hikes over the next two years spread from Asia to Europe, where major indexes fell to their lowest in two years and investors headed for the relative safety of government debt. European shares fell 1.2 percent, with bourses in Germany, Britain and France all hitting their lowest since December 2016. MSCI’s global equity index fell to its lowest since May 2017, shedding 0.4 percent as it headed for a fifth straight day of losses. The Fed raised key overnight lending rate rates by 0.25 percent point as expected to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent. It said “some further” rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead, with policymakers projecting two rises on average next year instead of the three predicted in September, a change largely in line with expectations. But that minor revision could not soothe market fears over a further U.S. economic slowdown on the back of trade tensions with China, a waning boost from tax cuts and tightening monetary conditions for companies. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger ‘put’ from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Oil prices fell more than 3 percent, erasing most of their gains from the day before and heading back towards their lowest levels for more than a year amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had earlier dropped 1 percent and Japan’s Topix joined Shanghai and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng in bear market territory, defined as down more than 20 percent from recent high. The concerns in equity markets saw investors flock to the safety of government bonds. German 10-year government bond yields fell to their lowest in nearly seven months, and other high grade euro zone bond yields also fell. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield had earlier fallen as low as 2.750 percent, a level last seen in early April. U.S. junk bonds sold off sharply, with their ETFs falling 0.9 percent, the biggest decline since March 1. A rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in the long-date yield rekindled worries of an inversion in the yield curve, where shorter-debt yields become higher than longer-term ones. Historically, an inversion between short-yields, such as three-month and two-year yields, and 10-year yields has been seen as a fairly reliable indicator of a recession down the road. The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.656 percent, just 0.097 percent less than the 10-year yield. The dollar fell against major currencies, losing ground after perceptions the Fed was more hawkish than anticipated. The dollar fell 0.4 percent against its rivals to 96.68 and within a whisker of a 9-day low of 96.554 hit in the previous session. “The impact of (the Fed’s) decision, especially for foreign countries, depends on how much the dollar will go up,” former ECB vice president Vitor Constancio said. The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.1429, slightly off a high of $1.14395 hit before the Fed’s policy announcement. In other announcements by central banks, Japan kept its policy settings unchanged, as expected. Sweden’s currency jumped more than one percent against the dollar on Thursday after the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than seven years. Britain is also due to make a policy announcement later in the day, with analysts expecting the Bank of England to keep rates steady. Reporting by Tom Wilson and Sujata Rao;

2018-12-20,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China and the United States will hold more talks on trade in January, China said on Thursday, following detailed discussions about the issues to be tacked in the negotiations. Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng expressed confidence in a “successful implementation” of a consensus reached at Dec. 1 talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Argentina. Gao said the two sides had been in close contact since then, including a vice-ministerial level call on Wednesday, when they went over arrangements for more talks and the issues of trade balances and the protection of intellectual property rights. “The two sides will arrange consultations including meetings and calls at any time as needed to promote the implementation of the consensus of the heads of state,” Gao told reporters in Beijing. He did not elaborate on who would lead the next talks or where they would be held. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had reportedly said earlier that China and the United States were planning to hold meetings in January to “document an agreement” on trade. Trump administration officials have not disclosed any plans for face-to-face meetings since the Trump and Xi talks. The potential for trade cooperation between the two countries was huge and the nature of win-win cooperation would  not change, Gao said.  Trump and Xi Jinping agreed in Argentina to a truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal.

2018-12-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Thursday it has temporarily suspended emissions trading system processes related to Britain as from Jan. 1 next year until there is clarity on the terms of the country’s departure from the EU. As a result, from Jan. 1 Britain will not be able to auction carbon permits, allocate them for free to operators, or exchange international credits for as long as the suspension remains in place, the Commission said.  “To prevent the temporary issuance and circulation of marked permits until there is clarity on whether or not a withdrawal agreement will be ratified and enter into force, the Commission has decided... to temporarily suspend the acceptance by the Union Registry of all processes for the UK relating to free allocation, auctioning and the exchange of international credits,” the Commission said in a statement. From January, any carbon permits issued by Britain will have to be identified by a country code (“marked”). The Commission said the transfers of permits already in circulation in and out of accounts held by UK operators will not be affected by the suspension. Britain already said on Wednesday that it will not be auctioning permits in the first quarter next year. If a withdrawal agreement on Britain’s exit from the EU is ratified the suspension will be lifted, the Commission said. This amendment to the Registry Regulation has been submitted to the European Parliament and the European Council for approval.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.1 percent, with Australian shares also declining 1.3 percent to a two-year closing low. Markets across the region are nearing gloomy milestones, with Japan’s Topix and South Korea’s KOSPI falling into a bear market, which means they are down more than 20 percent from their recent highs, to join Shanghai and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng. Financial spread-betters expect London’s FTSE Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC to fall between 1.2 and 1.4 percent when they open. Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.8 percent to close at its lowest since September 2017. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 fell 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, while the Hang Seng was off 1.1 percent. In New York, U.S. S&P 500 Index lost 1.54 percent to hit its lowest level since September 2017. U.S. stocks are on pace for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. “I think the Fed may be underestimating other factors at play,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa in the Unites States. “Trade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I’d expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues,” he said. The Fed raised key overnight lending rate rates by 0.25 percent point as expected to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent. It said “some further” rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead, with its policymakers projecting two rate hikes on average next year instead of three they saw back in September, a change that was also largely in line with expectations. But the slight revision was not enough to ease market fears over a further U.S. economic slowdown on the back of trade tensions, a waning boost from tax cuts and tightening monetary conditions for companies. U.S. junk bonds sold off sharply, with their ETFs falling 0.9 percent, the biggest decline since March 1. As investors flocked to the safety of government bonds, the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to as low as 2.748 percent, a level last seen in early April. A rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in the long-dated yield rekindled worries of an inversion in the yield curve, where shorter-debt yields become higher than longer-term ones. Historically, an inversion between short-yields, such as three-month and two-year yields, and 10-year yields has been seen as a fairly reliable indicator of a recession down the road. “We expect additional rate hikes will invert the three-months to 10-year yield curve which is a reliable signal for a bear market for stocks and a coming recession for both the U.S. and the rest of the world,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. “So, seriously something to keep a close eye on. We do expect a very difficult year for investors.” The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.654 percent, just 0.103 percentage point less than the 10-year yield. As one 25 basis point rate hike would likely invert the yield curve, many market players are sceptical whether the Fed can raise rates at all next year. Fed funds futures are now pricing in only about a 50 percent chance of one rate hike. The dollar initially gained as the Fed was seen as more hawkish but it lost steam against other safe-haven currencies, such as the yen. The greenback slipped 0.6 percent to its 7-1/2-week low of 111.865, while the euro also gained a tad to $1.1397 . The Chinese yuan weakened after China’s central bank introduced a targeted lending measure on Thursday to support growth in a slowing economy. The onshore yuan was trading at 6.902 per dollar, 0.1 percent weaker on the day, having earlier weakened to 6.915 per dollar. On Thursday, Japan kept its policy settings unchanged, as expected. Later in the day, UK and Sweden will make policy announcements. Both are expected to keep their policies on hold, though the Swedish central bank’s decision is seen as a close call, with some analysts expecting a rate hike. Oil prices fell on Thursday to erase most of their gains from the day before, resuming declines seen earlier in the week amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy. The front-month U.S. crude contract dropped 2.1 percent to $47.18 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude futures were down 1.5 percent at $56.39 per barrel.

2018-12-20,"(Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity is on the brink of doubling in 2019, which will boost the super-cooled fuel’s influence on the U.S. natural gas market, where volatility surged in 2018 after several years of slumber. LNG exports have been the fastest growing source of U.S. natural gas demand since the country started ramping up exports in 2016, and is expected to expand deliveries in coming years as several more export terminals enter service. Its imprint is being felt in the U.S. gas futures NGc1 market, which in November experienced its longest stretch of extreme volatility in nine years due to demand, low inventories and unseasonably cold U.S. weather. LNG currently accounts for just a small amount of overall domestic gas demand. But as the country opens more facilities for export to meet growing needs abroad, analysts said more ups and downs in prices are expected. “As LNG exports increase, so will future gas prices,” said Tom DiCapua, managing director of wholesale energy services at Con Edison Energy, a provider of energy management services, including the purchase of gas, for power plants owned by several companies. Prices at the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana hit $4.929 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in November - their highest in four-and-a-half years. That was also well above the five-year average from 2013-17 of $3.25/mmBtu. The United States is on track to export about a trillion cubic feet of LNG by year-end, or about 3 percent of overall U.S. gas demand in 2018.  But LNG exports are expected to rise to 5 percent of overall U.S. gas demand in 2019 and to 10 percent in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), boosting LNG’s potential to affect prices. “LNG exports will be one of the most bullish demand factors for U.S. natural gas prices over the coming two years, when several terminals are set to come online,” Raymond James analyst Muhammed Ghulam said. There are three LNG export terminals presently in operation in the United States. Those include Corpus Christi in Texas, which shipped its first cargo in December. Three more terminals are expected to enter service in 2019, boosting U.S. LNG export capacity to 8.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas, making it third largest in the world behind Australia and Qatar.  U.S. production is expected to rise 11 percent to a record 83.3 bcfd in 2018, the biggest year-over-year increase since 1951, according to EIA projections. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Investment decisions are imminent on another three U.S. Gulf Coast projects worth an estimated $20 billion, in 2019, while several other facilities are in the planning stages in the Pacific Northwest. “The first half of 2019 will be an especially busy one for the U.S.,” said Alex Munton, Americas LNG analyst at energy consultant Wood Mackenzie. Some consumers say there may not be enough gas production and pipeline capacity to support growing domestic markets in addition to LNG exports. “Pressure on U.S. gas prices at peak demand mounts with every additional LNG export,” said Paul Cicio, president of Industrial Energy Consumers of America, an industry lobby group. He said the United States should not approve new LNG export terminals until the government determines the country can first meet domestic demand. Houston-based Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), the biggest U.S. buyer of natural gas, said its LNG exports are not causing market volatility. “Cheniere’s demand is not variable, it is steady,” Cheniere spokesman Eben Burnham-Snyder said. “We’ve encouraged more natural gas production and pipeline development in basins all across the country because of our consistent demand for natural gas.” Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by David Gaffen, G Crosse",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-lng-prices/analysis-rising-lng-demand-to-exert-more-pull-on-u-s-natgas-prices-idUKL1N1Y91D9,20 Dec 2018,"U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export

2018-12-20,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Forecasting the year-ahead outlook for commodities, while popular among analysts, is a bit of a mug’s game at the best of times, but the view for 2019 is made even more complicated by one volatile factor: Donald Trump. While there are other drivers of commodity prices next year, the mercurial U.S. president looms large over the sector, and the actions of his administration will either amplify or partially nullify the established trends. Before trying to decipher Trump’s likely actions it’s worth looking at the trends likely to move commodity markets in 2019. Chief among these is increasing concern about slower global economic growth, with particular worries over China, the world’s second-largest economy and the biggest importer of commodities. There are roughly two schools of thought on China, the first being that the country will have to endure lower growth and tighter credit conditions as it struggles to overcome U.S. tariffs on its exports and slower growth in other trading partners. The second is that once again Beijing will successfully manage to open the spending taps and the subsequent raft of infrastructure and construction projects will keep commodity demand healthy and economic growth above the 6 percent level. The second scenario would be supportive for imports, and prices, for bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal, and for industrial metals, most notably copper. However, it’s also worth noting that much of what Beijing is likely to do is dependent on how its trade dispute with the United States unfolds. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping appeared to reach some sort of detente at the recent G20 meeting in Argentina, but it’s still an open question as to whether this can morph into an agreement acceptable to both sides. The pattern of the dispute so far has been dictated by Trump, who has alternated between ramping up rhetoric and calming it down, which does little more than create opportunities for volatility traders. The real question to be answered is whether both China and the United States are prepared to weather the pain of an extended trade dispute. It’s likely to be the case that the country upon which the most tariffs are imposed, in this case China, will feel the economic cost first. But the United States will also eventually feel the fallout through higher costs of goods, rising inflation, lower consumer spending and a loss of competitiveness in industries no longer exposed to international rivals. How these dynamics play out largely depend on Trump’s actions. The U.S. leader may come under increasing pressure from within his Republican Party to reach an accommodation with China if the economy starts to slow and the equity markets continue their recent downward trend. Trump has staked much of his presidency’s success on delivering a strong economy with high returns for investors, and if this is challenged it may force him to seek ways to maintain economic momentum. However, Trump is also likely to be distracted by his mounting legal difficulties and by the takeover of the House of Representatives by the Democratic Party. The threat of legal action and further investigations into his affairs, as well as his friendliness toward Saudi Arabia and Russia, also are a major factor likely to influence crude oil. The Trump administration effectively kicked the can on its re-imposition of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme down the road until April, when the import waivers granted to Tehran’s biggest customers are set to expire. This is likely to ignite debate over whether the crude oil market will tighten if Trump does end the waivers allowing Iran to export, or whether U.S. shale output will be enough to keep the market in surplus. The interplay between Trump, embattled Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian strong man Vladimir Putin will also be key for the actions taken by the world’s three largest oil producers. The trouble for analysts is that there is no way to be certain how all the factors around Trump will develop. His legal woes may amount to little, or they may lead to his impeachment and removal from office. Trump may reach a deal with China that ends the tariff war, or he may not and it could escalate. He may really crack down on Iran’s oil exports, or he may not. In some ways, commodity markets have become unwitting hostages to the man likely to be regarded as the most controversial political leader of his time.

As investors flocked to the safety of government bonds, the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell below its May 29 low of 2.759 percent to as low as 2.750 percent, a level last seen in early April. A rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in the long-date yield rekindled worries of an inversion in the yield curve, where shorter-debt yields become higher than longer-term ones. Historically, an inversion between short-yields, such as three-month and two-year yields, and 10-year yields has been seen as a fairly reliable indicator of a recession down the road. “We expect additional rate hikes will invert the three-months to 10-year yield curve which is a reliable signal for a bear market for stocks and a coming recession for both the U.S. and the rest of the world,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. “So, seriously something to keep a close eye on. We do expect a very difficult year for investors.” The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.656 percent, just 0.097 percent less than the 10-year yield. As one 25 basis point rate hike would likely invert the yield curve, many market players are sceptical whether the Fed can raise rates at all next year. Fed funds futures are now pricing in only about 50 percent chance of one rate hike. The dollar bounced back against major currencies after the Fed was perceived to be more hawkish than anticipated.

China’s yuan weakened in early Asian trade after the country’s central bank left its short-term borrowing rates unchanged on Thursday, choosing not to follow its U.S. counterpart. The yuan weakened past the 6.91-to-the-dollar level after the People’s Bank of China introduced a targeted lending measure to support growth in a slowing economy and last traded at 6.9079 per dollar, 0.2 percent softer on the day.

U.S. stocks are on pace for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. “I think the Fed may be underestimating other factors at play,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa in the Unites States. “Trade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I’d expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues,” he said. The Fed raised key overnight lending rate rates by 0.25 percent point as expected to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent.

The front-month U.S. crude contract had fallen 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.39 per barrel by 0129 GMT, nearly offseting gains of 96 cents chalked up on Wednesday. International benchmark Brent crude futures were down 66 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $56.58 per barrel, after climbing almost 2 percent the session before. “Wednesday’s recovery was short-covering. Investors quickly moved their attention to deteriorating fundamentals in the oil markets including more signs of slowing economic growth next year, record production and the lack of confidence with OPEC’s pledge to curb production,” said Xi Jiarui, chief oil analyst at consultancy JLC. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. Oil prices are down more than 30 percent from peaks seen in October. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Volatility in crude prices this week has driven investors to shut their positions and is draining liquidity from the market, Xi said. Total market open interest in U.S. crude contracts had fallen to 2.063 million contracts as of Thursday, up from a record of 2.71 million in May. “It has been a tumultuous week in oil markets and traders may opt to shut it down after the last big risk event of the year with year-end position-squaring likely to kick-in today,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA. Innes was referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting of 2018, at which it suggested the U.S. economy no longer needed the central bank’s support either through lower-than-normal interest rates or by maintaining a massive balance sheet. But U.S. inventory data offered some support to WTI prices. U.S. crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive decrease. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 4.2 million barrels, versus expectations of a 573,000-barrel increase, the EIA said. Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market’s proxy for diesel.

2018-12-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - British North Sea-focused oil and gas producers, Oranje-Nassau Energie (ONE) and Dyas, have agreed to merge to expand production, the privately-owned companies said on Thursday. The merged group, ONE-Dyas, will operate alongside a group of several relatively large independent oil producers that entered the North Sea in recent years, including private equity-backed Chrysaor and Neptune. The tie-up will enable ONE-Dyas “to pursue further growth opportunities,” according to the statement. The two Netherlands-based firms expect to have a joint production in 2019 of 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), they said. Dyas holds stakes in several major British North Sea fields including Nexen-operated Buzzard, Premier Oil-operated (PMO.L) Catcher and Total-operated (TOTF.PA) Elgin Franklin. ONE also holds stakes in Buzzard, Elgin Franklin and Breagh. The company will be led by Robert Baurdoux, the current Chief Executive Officer of Dyas while ONE’s current CEO Alexander Berger will act as executive director. Under the agreement, ONE will own 51 percent of the shares in the combined group while SHV Holdings, Dyas’s parent company, will hold the remaining 49 percent. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019. The two had a combined production of over 40,000 boed in 2017, according to their websites.

2018-12-20,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ministers from European Union countries agreed on Thursday to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from trucks and buses by 30 percent by 2030, albeit with the potential to review this in 2022, the EU’s Austrian presidency said. Environment ministers struck the deal, balancing the interests of Germany and the continent’s largest auto sector with other countries, such as Sweden, which pushed for a sharper cut.  The countries, collectively known as the Council, will still have to negotiate next year with the European Parliament, which envisages a tougher 2030 target of a 35 percent cut. The government representatives also agreed on Thursday to an interim target of a 15 percent reduction by 2025, relative to 2019 levels. The parliament is pushing for 20 percent. The EU currently has no limits on emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, unlike other countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada. Trucks account for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions. Curbs on the transport sector, the only one in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate accord. The EU agreed on Monday on targets for cutting emissions from cars and vans. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) has lobbied for far lower reduction targets for trucks of 7 percent by 2025 and 16 percent by 2030. ACEA has said that the potential for electrifying truck fleets is far lower than for cars and that it would only really work for short trips within cities, but not for long-haul transit.  Volkswagen’s (VW) (VOWG_p.DE) truck brand MAN has warned the new CO2 limits could cost tens of thousands of jobs. Germany is home to the largest truck producer, Daimler. Other manufacturers in Europe include Volvo, Italy-based Iveco, Paccar and Scania, also part of Volkswagen.

2018-12-20,"* Uganda says tax on sale about $167 million * Tullow says deal should not attract substantial taxes * Uganda says plans licensing round in 2020 (Adds Tullow comment) By Elias Biryabarema KAMPALA, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Uganda’s energy minister said on Thursday she had given Tullow Oil conditional approval to sell part of its stake in Ugandan oilfields to France’s Total and China’s CNOOC but only after $167 million of tax on the deal is paid. London-listed Tullow agreed early last year to sell Total most of its stake in Ugandan fields for $900 million but CNOOC later exercised its pre-emption rights to buy half of the Tullow assets on sale. “I gave conditional consent for this transaction, subject to payment of tax obligations, as assessed by the Uganda Revenue Authority of about $167 million,” Energy Minister Irene Muloni told a news conference. The three firms currently each hold a 33.3 percent stake in the fields and Tullow is now selling 21.5 percent of its stake, which will be split equally between Total and CNOOC. Tullow spokesman George Cazenove said in an emailed statement Tullow believed it should not have to pay the assessed Ugandan tax. “As Tullow has stated on a number of occasions, we believe that this deal should not attract substantial tax liabilities and that this position is supported by Uganda’s tax laws,” he said. “Tullow and its partners remain in discussions with the Government of Uganda on this matter and the deal will only complete when those negotiations are brought to a satisfactory conclusion.” Muloni said after the deal is finalised, Tullow would be a non-operator and Total would be the operator in the northern part of License Area 2, while CNOOC Uganda would be the operator of the southern part of the area. “Given the above progress, we now expect the licensed companies to undertake the final investment decision for the upstream projects before June 2019,” she said. Uganda discovered commercial crude oil deposits in the west of the country near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. The start of commercial production has been repeatedly delayed due to a lack of required infrastructure such as a refinery and an export pipeline. The government said last month that it now expects oil production to start in 2021, a year later than previously expected. Muloni said the government also planned to do another licensing round for vacant blocks in 2020, but the number of blocks that would be auctioned has yet to be determined. Muloni said Uganda’s gross crude reserves had also been revised downwards after new reservoir analyses, to 6 billion barrels from 6.5 billion previously. Recoverable reserves remained at 1.4 billion barrels. Ugandan fields also held 500 billion cubic feet of natural gas, she said. The oil firms are expected to spend between $15 billion and $20 billion to develop Ugandan fields and the associated infrastructure and the East African country is banking on that investment and potential proceeds from crude exports of about 200,000 barrels per day to drive growth.

2018-12-20,"NEW YORK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - World equity markets continued a weeklong slide on Thursday amid investor concerns after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it was set on its interest rate-hiking path next year even amid signs global economic growth is stuttering. The Fed’s move on Wednesday to largely adhere to its plan for additional rate hikes over the next two years raised worries for market participants from Asia to Europe, as major indexes fell to their lowest in two years and investors flocked to the relative safety of government debt. European shares fell 0.9 percent, with benchmark indexes in Germany, Britain and France all hitting their lowest since late 2016. Indexes in Japan and South Korea fell into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from recent highs, joining benchmark indexes in Shanghai and Hong Kong. MSCI’s global equity index fell to its lowest since May 2017, shedding nearly 0.8 percent as it headed for a fifth straight day of losses. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger ‘put’ from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” said Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 139.99 points, or 0.6 percent, to 23,183.67, the S&P 500 lost 8.49 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,498.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.73 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,630.09. The Fed on Wednesday stuck by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it considers robust, and hiked key overnight lending rates as expected by 0.25 percent point. It said “some further gradual” rate hikes would be needed in the year ahead, with policymakers projecting two rises on average next year instead of the three predicted in September. Although largely in line with expectations, that tweak did little to soothe investor concerns over slowing world growth, U.S. trade tensions with China, and tightening monetary conditions for companies in the world’s biggest economy. The equity losses added to the worst year for world stocks since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent. Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off global stock markets this year, with emerging markets trampled flat by a charging dollar. The angst in equity markets pushed investors towards the safety of government bonds. German 10-year government bond yields, the euro zone benchmark, fell to their lowest in nearly seven months. Other high grade euro zone bond yields also fell. Benchmark 10-year U.S. notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.7654 percent, from 2.776 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices, meanwhile, slumped as worries about oversupply and worldwide demand for energy pushed prices back towards their lowest levels in over a year. U.S. crude fell 2.5 percent to $46.92 per barrel, while Brent fell 2.1 percent to $56.04 per barrel. “Growth concerns continue to percolate in the background, and you can see that with oil prices coming off,” said Alvin Tan, an foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale. The dollar index fell 0.55 percent, with the euro up 0.54 percent to $1.1436.

2018-12-20,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s biggest utility Enel (ENEI.MI) is “very close” to selling its stake in solar joint venture EF Solare to partner F2i for around 200 million euros ($229 million), a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Enel and F2i currently own 50 percent each of EF Solare, Italy’s biggest solar power operator with more than 400 megawatts of installed capacity across 130 plants. Enel and F2i declined to comment. In July F2i, an infrastructure fund partly owned by state lender CDP, said it had expressed its intention to acquire Enel’s stake. F2i, which also has investments in transport and broadband infrastructure, bought Terra Firma’s solar farms in Italy earlier this year for 1.3 billion euros to become Europe’s third largest solar player. Enel, which controls Spain’s Endesa (ELE.MC), is one of the world’s biggest green energy producers. It is looking to free up resources in Italy to develop greenfield projects.

2018-12-20,"(Repeats with no changes) * World stocks take biggest beating since 2008 * Dollar up nearly 6 percent, emerging markets shredded * Oil takes late plunge, metals hit hard * Few places to hide, gold and U.S. govt debt have lost By Marc Jones LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Traders will be glad to see the back of 2018. Nearly $7 trillion has been wiped off world stocks, emerging markets have been trampled flat by a charging dollar and even gold and U.S. government bonds have lost money. A grisly combination of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in former hot spots has wiped 10 percent off MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index — its first double-digit loss in any year since the 2008 global financial crisis. Many places have fared far worse. Top Chinese shares have fallen 25 percent into ‘bear’ territory, export bellwether Germany has shed 16 percent, and Turkey and Argentina have led emerging markets losses, down 45 and 50 percent respectively. Add in a wild 35 percent plunge in oil prices since September, rises in Italian, Greek and now French borrowing costs that show euro zone worries remain alive, and a full scale cryptocurrency collapse, and it has been unequivocally brutal. “After 10 years of low interest rates and quantitative easing I think we have to understand how some of this leverage in the market can unwind,” said Allianz Global Investors fund manager and global strategist Neil Dwane. “What was a virtuous circle on the way up can become a vicious one on the way down.” A fair bit of the year’s pain has stemmed from swift move up in U.S. interest rates and a pumped-up dollar, which has had its best year in three years. As a result, the euro, pound, Canadian and Aussie dollars and Swedish crown have all lost between 5 and 10 percent and though the Japanese yen comes out largely unscathed, emerging markets certainly haven’t. Argentina’s peso and Turkey’s lira have slumped 50 and 30 percent, while India’s rupee, South Africa’s rand, Brazil’s real and Russia’s rouble are all down between 10 to 15 percent. China’s yuan is in the red for a fourth year in five. Emerging market shares meanwhile have haemorrhaged almost 17 percent and JP Morgan's EM local currency bond index has lost nearly 8 percent. tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh Dalton Investments emerging market portfolio manager Pedro Zevallos said the big falls meant many markets, including China were now cheap. “But right now it honestly feels like catching a falling knife.” “And my concern going into next year is that the dollar will continue to strengthen.” As well as the escalation in global trade tensions this year there has been the realisation among investors that the big central banks aren’t thinking about stimulating the economy anymore — they’re trying to rebuild their arsenals in case of recession. But the year hasn’t been a complete write-off everywhere. While the S&P 500 and Dow Wall Street bellwethers are down the most since 2008, at around 5 percent their losses aren’t too bad, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is clinging on for its 10th consecutive year of gains. The FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) have had rollercoaster year. As a group, they are ending 2018 worth roughly $2.8 trillion — more or less where they started it, but down some $800 billion or 24 percent from their late August peak. There has been a big parting of the ways too. While Amazon and Netflix have surged 33 and 45 percent, repeated scandals over data misuse and fake news propagation have slashed 19 percent off Facebook shares. Asia’s equivalent BAT group, made up of Badia, Alibaba and Tencent, have all down somewhere between 18 and 25 percent. With China also the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has contributed to the respective 17 and 23 percent declines in the price of copper and zinc, used in things like pipes and galvanised steel. The big cryptocollapse has seen Bitcoin crash 72 percent. There are now over 2,000 other digital currencies in circulation but their value has plummeted to $128 billion from over $800 billion in January. But even traditional safe-havens have failed to provide much in the way of protection. Another four U.S. interest hikes have cost Treasury bond holders nearly 2 percent despite a better last few months and the euro’s fall puts German Bunds down 2.3 percent in dollar terms. Gold is 4 percent less precious. Italy’s government bonds meanwhile have plunged 9 percent after an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its huge bond-buying programme will end this year. “The question as we look into 2019 and 2020 is how much worse the trade/tech cold war and Brexit get,” Allianz’s Dwayne said. “That could tells us that maybe we are not going to see a traditional downturn but a significant one.” Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets-2018/rpt-graphic-markets-suffer-worst-year-since-global-financial-crisis-idUKL8N1YP2H3,20 Dec 2018,"Traders will be glad to see the

2018-12-20,"(Repeast earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Forecasting the year-ahead outlook for commodities, while popular among analysts, is a bit of a mug’s game at the best of times, but the view for 2019 is made even more complicated by one volatile factor: Donald Trump. While there are other drivers of commodity prices next year, the mercurial U.S. president looms large over the sector, and the actions of his administration will either amplify or partially nullify the established trends. Before trying to decipher Trump’s likely actions it’s worth looking at the trends likely to move commodity markets in 2019. Chief among these is increasing concern about slower global economic growth, with particular worries over China, the world’s second-largest economy and the biggest importer of commodities. There are roughly two schools of thought on China, the first being that the country will have to endure lower growth and tighter credit conditions as it struggles to overcome U.S. tariffs on its exports and slower growth in other trading partners. The second is that once again Beijing will successfully manage to open the spending taps and the subsequent raft of infrastructure and construction projects will keep commodity demand healthy and economic growth above the 6 percent level. The second scenario would be supportive for imports, and prices, for bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal, and for industrial metals, most notably copper. However, it’s also worth noting that much of what Beijing is likely to do is dependent on how its trade dispute with the United States unfolds. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping appeared to reach some sort of detente at the recent G20 meeting in Argentina, but it’s still an open question as to whether this can morph into an agreement acceptable to both sides. The pattern of the dispute so far has been dictated by Trump, who has alternated between ramping up rhetoric and calming it down, which does little more than create opportunities for volatility traders. The real question to be answered is whether both China and the United States are prepared to weather the pain of an extended trade dispute. It’s likely to be the case that the country upon which the most tariffs are imposed, in this case China, will feel the economic cost first. But the United States will also eventually feel the fallout through higher costs of goods, rising inflation, lower consumer spending and a loss of competitiveness in industries no longer exposed to international rivals. How these dynamics play out largely depend on Trump’s actions. The U.S. leader may come under increasing pressure from within his Republican Party to reach an accommodation with China if the economy starts to slow and the equity markets continue their recent downward trend. Trump has staked much of his presidency’s success on delivering a strong economy with high returns for investors, and if this is challenged it may force him to seek ways to maintain economic momentum. However, Trump is also likely to be distracted by his mounting legal difficulties and by the takeover of the House of Representatives by the Democratic Party. The threat of legal action and further investigations into his affairs, as well as his friendliness toward Saudi Arabia and Russia, also are a major factor likely to influence crude oil. The Trump administration effectively kicked the can on its re-imposition of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme down the road until April, when the import waivers granted to Tehran’s biggest customers are set to expire. This is likely to ignite debate over whether the crude oil market will tighten if Trump does end the waivers allowing Iran to export, or whether U.S. shale output will be enough to keep the market in surplus. The interplay between Trump, embattled Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian strong man Vladimir Putin will also be key for the actions taken by the world’s three largest oil producers. The trouble for analysts is that there is no way to be certain how all the factors around Trump will develop. His legal woes may amount to little, or they may lead to his impeachment and removal from office. Trump may reach a deal with China that ends the tariff war, or he may not and it could escalate. He may really crack down on Iran’s oil exports, or he may not. In some ways, commodity markets have become unwitting hostages to the man likely to be regarded as the most controversial political leader of his time.
