2018-04-18,"(Adds company no comment, background) HOUSTON, April 18 (Reuters) - Motiva Enterprises will shut a small crude distillation unit over the weekend at the largest U.S. crude oil refinery, sources familiar with plant operations said on Wednesday. Motiva will shut the 80,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) VPS-2 crude distillation unit (CDU) at its 603,000-bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery as early as Friday, the sources said. Motiva spokeswoman Angela Goodwin declined to comment. VPS-2 will be shut for about a month of work, the sources said. Two sulfur recovery units will also be shut while VPS-2 is down. This is the second time this year Motiva has shut a crude distillation unit at the Port Arthur refinery. Motiva shut the 325,000-bpd VPS-5 CDU was for a month-long overhaul between early February and early March. The Port Arthur refinery’s three CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock to all other units. During the work on VPS-2, Motiva may also change the catalyst on a hydrotreating unit, the sources said.

2018-04-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain plans to ban the sale of plastic straws and other single use products and is pressing Commonwealth allies to also take action to tackle marine waste, the office of Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May said. It said drink stirrers and cotton buds would also be banned under the plans. May has pledged to eradicate avoidable plastic waste by 2042 as part of a “national plan of action”. “Plastic waste is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world, which is why protecting the marine environment is central to our agenda at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting,” May said in a statement ahead of a Commonwealth summit on Thursday. Leaders from the Commonwealth - a network of 53 countries, mostly former British colonies - are meeting in London this week. May is looking to deepen ties to the Commonwealth as Britain seeks to boost trade and carve out a new role in the world ahead of the country’s departure from the European Union in March next year.     Britain will commit 61.4 million pounds ($87.21 million) at the summit to develop new ways of tackling plastic waste and help Commonwealth countries limit how much plastic ends up in the ocean. “We are rallying Commonwealth countries to join us in the fight against marine plastic,” May said. “Together we can effect real change so that future generations can enjoy a natural environment that is healthier than we currently find it.” The statement said environment minister Michael Gove would launch a consultation later this year into the plan to ban the plastic items. It gave no details who the consultation would be with.

2018-04-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended mixed on Wednesday while most other global shares rose, as investors were drawn to riskier assets because of upbeat earnings from companies in Europe and the United States. The U.S. dollar clung to gains amid fading concerns over a global trade war, while oil soared on a reported decline in U.S. crude inventories and the possibility of supply disruptions.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe touched its highest since March 21 and was last up 0.43 percent. The index was supported by a higher open on Wall Street following the latest batch of earnings. Morgan Stanley shares rose 3 percent after the bank reported a 40 percent jump in quarterly profit, driven by its trading business. Its shares ended the day up only 0.4 pct, however. “Earnings continue to progress on the positive side and commodities are also on the rise; that should give the markets another boost,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. Stocks bounced around, dipping after a Federal Reserve report saying that robust business borrowing, rising consumer spending and tight labor markets indicate the U.S. economy remains on track for continued growth, with trade war risks the one big outlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 38.56 points, or 0.16 percent, to 24,748.07, the S&P 500 gained 2.25 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,708.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.14 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,295.24. Investors appeared to be focusing on fundamentals after weeks dominated by geopolitical tensions, including the prospect of trade wars and more missile strikes in Syria. “The safety trade that we have experienced seems to have ended,” said Cardillo. Shares of International Business Machines Corp tumbled more than 7.5 percent after its profit margins fell short of Wall Street expectations. European shares firmed amid strong company results, including those from French food group Danone, private healthcare provider Mediclinic and Dutch oil and chemical storage company Vopak.

2018-04-18,"(Reuters) - SunPower Corp (SPWR.O) on Wednesday said it would buy U.S. solar panel maker SolarWorld Americas, expanding its domestic manufacturing as it seeks to stem the impact of Trump administration tariffs on panel imports. The White House cheered the deal, saying it was proof that Trump’s trade policies were stimulating U.S. investment.  Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The news sent SunPower’s shares up 12 percent on the Nasdaq to their highest level since before President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels in January. “The time is right for SunPower to invest in U.S. manufacturing,” Chief Executive Tom Werner said in a statement. SunPower is based in San Jose, California but most of its manufacturing is in the Philippines and Mexico. The company had lobbied heavily against the solar trade case brought last year by U.S. manufacturers, including SolarWorld, which said they could not compete with a flood of cheap imports. The deal is a win for the Trump administration’s efforts to revive U.S. solar manufacturing through the tariffs. SunPower will manufacture its cheaper “P-series” panels, which more directly compete with Chinese products, at the SolarWorld factory in Hillsboro, Oregon, it said. It will also make SolarWorld’s legacy products. “This is great news for the hundreds of Americans working at SolarWorld’s factory in Oregon and is further proof that the president’s trade policies are bringing investment back to the United States,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in an emailed statement. The announcement comes as SunPower is seeking an exemption from tariffs on its higher-priced, more efficient panels manufactured overseas. It has argued to the U.S. Trade Representative, which will make a decision on exemptions in the coming weeks, that those products should be excluded because there is no U.S. competitor that makes a similar product. In a note to clients, Baird analyst Ben Kallo said the SolarWorld deal would enable the company to compete against Chinese imports should SunPower’s products not receive an exemption. But he added that skeptics “may question the company’s ability to generate profits with U.S. manufacturing.” The deal will inject much-needed capital into SolarWorld’s long-suffering manufacturing plant and give it the support of a major market player. SunPower is one of the largest solar companies in the world and is majority owned by France’s deep-pocketed oil giant Total SA (TOTF.PA).  The U.S. arm of Germany’s SolarWorld AG SWVKk.F opened the Hillsboro factory in 2008 as it sought to capitalize on surging solar demand in the United States. But its start coincided with a dramatic increase in the production of cheaper solar products in Asia, and SolarWorld struggled to compete.  Twice, in 2012 and 2014, trade cases brought by SolarWorld prompted the U.S. Commerce Department to slap import duties on solar products from China and Taiwan. Yet prices on solar panels continued their free fall, and just three years later, in 2017, the company joined rival Suniva in asking for new tariffs. SolarWorld called the outcome “ideal” for its hundreds of employees in Hillsboro. During the trade case and after the tariffs were announced, the solar industry’s trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, argued that the tariffs would not be enough to keep SolarWorld and Suniva afloat. Indeed, Suniva’s future remains uncertain after a U.S. bankruptcy court judge this week granted a request by its biggest creditor that will allow it to sell a portion of the company’s solar manufacturing equipment through a public auction.   SunPower shares were up 87 cents, or 10.4 percent, at $9.22 in mid-day trade on the Nasdaq. The stock hit a high of $9.75 earlier in the session, its highest since late 2017.

2018-04-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures jumped nearly 3 percent on Wednesday on a decline in U.S. crude inventories and after sources signalled top exporter Saudi Arabia wants to see the crude price closer to $100 a barrel. OPEC’s new price hawk Saudi Arabia would be happy for crude to rise to $80 or even $100, three industry sources said, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to a supply-cutting deal even though the agreement’s original target is within sight. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled at $73.48 a barrel, up $1.90, or 2.7 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 gained $1.95, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $68.47 a barrel, their highest since late 2014. Prices were supported as U.S. oil stockpiles fell across the board last week with gasoline and distillates drawing down more than expected on stronger demand, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S] Crude inventories dropped by 1.1 million barrels as a result of a decline of 1.3 million barrels per day in net crude imports. “This may be one of the most bullish reports in some time, with the across-the-board declines in inventories,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “Beyond the headlines, gasoline demand was very strong, virtually summer-like, and crude oil exports are climbed back towards 2 million bpd at 1.75 million.” Buying in anticipation of the report started late Tuesday, said Brian LaRose, a technical analyst with United-ICAP. The market also found support in expectation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ production cuts will be sustained. OPEC and 10 rival producers have curbed output by a joint 1.8 million bpd since January 2017 and pledged to do so until the end of this year.  OPEC’s ministerial committee tasked with monitoring the group’s supply-cutting deal with non-OPEC countries, led by Russia, meets in the Saudi city of Jeddah on Friday. “Despite an oil price of over $70 per barrel and the fact that the oversupply has been eliminated, a phase-out of the production cuts will not be on the agenda,” Commerzbank oil analyst Carsten Fritsch said. Oil has been supported by the perception among investors that tensions in the Middle East could lead to supply disruptions, including renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran, as well as falling output in crisis-hit Venezuela. Dutch bank ING said in a note to clients that Brent had risen back above $70 in April “due to geopolitical risks along with some fundamentally bullish developments in the market”. It raised its average 2018 price forecast for Brent to $66.50 from $60.25, and its 2018 WTI forecast to $62.50 from $57.75. For next year, however, ING expects lower prices due to rising U.S. crude output, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016.

2018-04-18,"ATHENS (Reuters) - The Greek government submitted a bill to parliament on Wednesday opening the way for the country’s dominant power utility PPC to begin selling coal-fired plants in May, a move strongly opposed by workers who have threatened strikes in protest.  Athens has agreed with its foreign creditors that Public Power Corp. (PPC) (DEHr.AT), which is 51 percent state-owned, will sell plants equal to about 40 percent of its coal-fired capacity this year. Greece, which is implementing reforms in exchange for loans from the European Union, will divest the capacity to comply with a European court ruling which said that PPC had abused its dominant position in the coal market. The draft legislation, which says PPC must launch an international tender by May 31, was submitted to parliament after EU antitrust regulators approved Greek measures to open up the coal market on Tuesday. GENOP-DEH, PPC’s main labour union, which calls the planned sale a “national crime”, has threatened to start rolling 48-hour strikes once the bill is submitted to parliament. The units to be sold are Meliti I and the yet-to-be-built Meliti II in northern Greece along with another two units in the southern Greek town of Megalopolis. PPC will transfer the units to two subsidiaries which will then be spun off from the group.  In a market test conducted by the European Commission’s directorate general for competition, 15 investors expressed interest in acquiring the plants. PPC said last month that several Chinese firms were among the possible suitors and that it had hired PwC and HSBC as consultants on the sale. According to the bill, workers at the units to be sold will not be laid off for six years. The GENOP-DEH union, which said the planned sale was “the final straw hurting irreversibly the state’s interests”, sent a letter to parliament this week urging lawmakers to reject the bill. “PPC’s assets constitute national wealth,” said GENOP, which fears job losses. “We call on you, with a sense of duty ... to prevent PPC’s breakup.” Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou and George Georgiopoulos; Editing by Adrian Croft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-publicpower-plants/greece-submits-bill-on-coal-fired-plants-sale-union-threatens-strikes-idUKL8N1RT5FU,18 Apr 2018,"The Greek government submitted

2018-04-18,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) is considering using a chemical marking system to help trace oil products smuggled out of the country, its chairman said on Wednesday. Mustafa Sanalla also called on a European Union naval mission to combat smugglers by seizing their ships in the Mediterranean, said the United Nations should consider sanctioning smugglers, and urged Libya to reform massive subsidies that allow fuel to be sold for as little as 2-3 U.S. cents per litre.  “The fuel smugglers and thieves have permeated not only the militias which control much of Libya, but also the fuel distribution companies which are supposed to bring cheap fuel to Libyan citizens,” Sanalla told an inaugural Oil and Fuel Theft conference in Geneva.  “The huge sums of money available from smuggling have corrupted large parts of Libyan society,” he said, according to a text of his speech. The state-run NOC was looking at adding molecular markers to subsidised fuel, to help Libyan and international law enforcers including Europol, CEPOL and Interpol identify smugglers, Sanalla said. Fuels can be tracked by using chemical markers that bind to fuel molecules. Smuggling networks have flourished amid the political turmoil and armed conflict that developed following Libya’s 2011 uprising. Groups are often involved in multiple types of smuggling, making huge profits from illicit sales of fuel and the transfer of migrants towards Europe. Between 30 and 40 percent of fuel refined in Libya or imported into the country is stolen or smuggled, according to the NOC. Libyan vessels smuggle mainly diesel to international ships offshore, while gasoline is diverted to roadside sellers or smugglers who operate across Libya’s land borders. The practice costs the Libyan state one billion Libyan dinars per year, or $750 million at the official exchange rate, the NOC estimates. Action taken so far — including Italian prosecution and U.S. sanctions against smuggling networks and a ditch and berm built by Tunisia on its border with Libya — had “not been enough to create a major disincentive for the fuel smugglers”, Sanalla said. Though local officials say they are trying to crack down on fuel smuggling, fuel is still allocated to inoperational or “ghost” petrol stations. Prices are among the lowest in the world, though rampant smuggling means petrol shortages are common and Libyans often pay a higher, black market price.    “Fuel smugglers are well-armed, and well-resourced. And every day their grip on regions of Libya – and also on neighbouring countries who receive smuggled and stolen Libyan fuel – becomes stronger and more institutionalised,” Sanalla said. He called for the mandate of the EU’s naval mission, Operation Sophia, to be extended to combat the smuggling of refined fuel as well as oil, saying that much of the illegal activity could be traced by radar or satellite and was concentrated at Hurd’s Bank anchorage just outside Maltese territorial waters.

2018-04-18,"LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Gene-editing technologies that alter mosquitoes’ DNA could prove critical in the fight against malaria, Bill Gates said on Wednesday, and ethical concerns should not block progress in such gene-modifying research. Speaking at the Malaria Forum conference in London, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist said that while gene editing raises “legitimate questions”, that should not jeopardize exploration of tools such as CRISPR gene editing and so-called “gene drive” technologies.  “I’m very energized about the potential of gene drive. (It’s) the kind of breakthrough we need to support,” Gates said. “It may prove critical here.” Gene drive technologies alter DNA and drive self-sustaining genetic changes through multiple generations by overriding normal biological processes. CRISPR technology enables scientists to find and modify or replace virtually any gene. The techniques are being explored across science - from human medicine to livestock- and crop-breeding. In mosquitoes that transmit malaria, genetic alterations can be used to induce infertility to reduce populations, or alter the insects’ ability to carry and pass on the malaria parasite. The technologies can be extremely powerful, but they are also controversial, since such genetically engineered organisms released into the environment could have an unknown and irreversible impact on the ecosystem. Asked in a interview with Reuters about that controversy, Gates said there were understandable concerns about safety and efficacy that would need to be addressed in research and trials. But he countered: “Malaria itself is quite controversial - it kills about 400,000 kids a year. So we’re definitely not on the side of malaria.” He also noted that at their summit in January, leaders of the African Union endorsed gene drive research as part of the fight against a disease that continues to kill their people. “They spoke out to say that, for them, getting rid of malaria is worth using innovative science,” Gates said. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned late last year that global progress against malaria had stalled and could be reversed if momentum in the fight to wipe it out was lost. The disease infected around 216 million people in 91 countries in 2016, an increase of 5 million cases over the previous year. It killed 445,000 people, about the same number as in 2015, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in babies and young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Gates told the Forum that his almost 20 years of involvement in global efforts to beat malaria had been both gratifying, in terms of progress, and tough, in terms of suffering he witnessed. He described seeing a child in a hospital in Tanzania convulsed with seizures due to cerebral malaria. “With the state of science and the wealth of the world, that really should be an affront,” he said. “We really shouldn’t accept that this disease can continue.” Gates said that ending malaria for good would take many years and a range of tools both new and old - from bednets and mosquito traps to a new vaccine and next generation gene tools.  He said he thought it unlikely that creating gene drives in malaria-spreading mosquitoes would have a major impact on the wider ecosystem because it would only target a few species and suppress their populations for a period of time. “None of these (gene technology) constructs will actually wipe out the species,” he said. “It will evolve back.

2018-04-18,"April 18 (Reuters) - SunPower Corp on Wednesday said it would buy U.S. panel maker SolarWorld Americas, dramatically expanding its domestic manufacturing as it seeks to stem the impact of Trump administration tariffs on solar imports. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The news sent SunPower’s shares up 12 percent on the Nasdaq, hitting their highest level since before President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels in January. SunPower is based in San Jose, California but most of its manufacturing is in the Philippines and Mexico. The company had lobbied heavily against the solar trade case brought last year by U.S. manufacturers, including SolarWorld, which said they could not compete with a flood of cheap imports. Last month, SunPower asked the Trump administration to exempt a segment of its solar panel imports from new tariffs, saying that would benefit its plan to expand its U.S. panel manufacturing. The SolarWorld facility in Hillsboro, Oregon, will be retrofitted to produce SunPower’s panels but will continue to make SolarWorld’s legacy products as well. SolarWorld, which is a division of Germany’s SolarWorld AG , called the outcome “ideal” for its hundreds of employees in Hillsboro. SunPower shares were up 92 cents, or 11 percent, at $9.23 in mid-day trade on the Nasdaq. The stock hit a high of $9.75 earlier in the session, its highest since late 2017.

2018-04-18,"* Oil breaks above $72 as supply concerns build * Dollar steady as solid earnings support U.S. stocks (Updates with U.S. markets; changes byline, dateline, previous LONDON) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - World equity markets climbed to approach a four-week high on Wednesday, as investors’ appetite for the riskier asset was boosted by upbeat earnings from companies in Europe and the United States. The U.S. dollar clung to gains amid fading concerns over a global trade war, while a reported decline in U.S. crude inventories and the possibility of supply disruptions pushed oil prices higher. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.56 percent, the highest since March 21, and on track for a third straight session of gains. The index was supported by a higher open on Wall Street on Wednesday, following the latest batch of earnings. Morgan Stanley shares rose 3 percent after the bank reported a 40 percent jump in quarterly profit, driven by its trading business. “Earnings continue to progress on the positive side and commodities are also on the rise, that should give the markets another boost,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. Investors appeared to be focusing on fundamentals after weeks dominated by geopolitical tensions. “The safety trade that we have experienced seems to have ended,” said Cardillo. Shares of International Business Machines Corp tumbled 7.3 percent after its profit margins fell short of Wall Street expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.93 points, or 0.05 percent, to 24,799.56, the S&P 500 gained 9.17 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,715.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.05 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,306.15. European shares firmed amid strong company results, including those from French food group Danone, private healthcare provider Mediclinic and Dutch oil and chemical storage company Vopak. Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.32 percent at 1,496.62. The U.S. dollar held steady versus a basket of major currencies as solid company results and fading concerns about a trade war helped keep a lid on safe-haven demand for the greenback. The dollar found support from relatively stronger economic data than those seen in Europe and other developed markets. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was 0.07 percent higher at 89.58. Trading across U.S. government bond maturities was range-bound on Wednesday, with yields little changed in spite of gains in the equity market. “The reaction in the bond market seems to be a lot more muted relative to the big moves we’ve seen in the equities rally in the past few sessions. Generally, the bond market seems to be under-reacting to both the sell-off and the rally,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York. The U.S. 10-year note was down 9/32 in price to yield 2.8469 percent, up from a yield of 2.814 percent on Tuesday. Oil extended gains, rising more than $1 on a reported decline in U.S. crude inventories and after sources signalled top exporter Saudi Arabia wants to see the crude price closer to $100 a barrel. Brent crude oil futures were 1.9 percent higher at $72.95 a barrel, while U.S. WTI crude futures were up 2.2 percent at $68.06. Gold prices rose to a one-week high on technical trading and as the dollar held steady. Spot gold was up 0.3 percent at $1,351.01 an ounce. Additional reporting by Kate Duguid in NEW YORK, Sruthi

Ionic Materials provides research and development services and focuses on developing advanced materials targeting high energy density batteries that it says are safer and cheaper than traditional ones.  “We have decided to invest in Ionic Materials in order to keep a closer look on this technology which may represent one of the most promising path for the development of solid-state batteries,” Total said, declining to say how much shares of the company it has acquired.

2018-04-18,"PARIS (Reuters) - A report prepared for the European Commission has questioned the economic viability of plans to build a huge gas pipeline between Spain and France designed to boost security of supply in Europe, five sources told Reuters.  The Commission has long backed the 3 billion euro ($3.7 billion) Midi-Catalonia (Midcat) pipeline that would more than double the amount of gas that can be piped across the Pyrenees mountains that border the two nations. French gas grid Terega, owned by Italy’s Snam, (SRG.MI) and Spain’s Enagas (ENAG.MC) want to invest in the project, which has strong support from European Union Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete, a Spanish national.   But the project has faced opposition from French energy regulator CRE, who says Midcat would push up consumer prices without improving security. French gas network firm Engie-owned GRTgaz (ENGIE.PA) also questions the need for the pipeline. Now a study by Poyry, a consultancy appointed to assess the first phase of Midcat for the Commission, indicates the project is unlikely to be economically viable.  It said it would only achieve “financially viability ... in scenarios with a tight LNG market”. The study says the 120-km (75-mile) STEP pipeline across the Pyrenees - the first and central part of the broader Midcat project - would only be viable if LNG prices over a long period remained significantly higher than pipeline gas prices. Specialists say that is unlikely.  The report, seen by Reuters, will be the basis for a Commission discussion on Wednesday of priority EU infrastructure plans termed Projects of Common Interest (PCI). The Commission has declined requests to release the report, citing commercial confidentiality, and did not respond to a request for comment. Poyry declined to comment. Terega infrastructure director Michel Boche said the STEP pipeline would cost 442 million euros of which 290 million for Terega and 152 million for Enagas. The firms have sent an investment proposal to the CRE. In October they will present the case to the European Union, which could provide subsidies of up to 50 percent.  Regulated network operators typically earn around a 5.5 percent return on their asset base on such projects.  Boche said the expected flow would be mainly from France to Spain but the interconnector would be reversible in case of need. Last winter, gas flowed from Spain to France only about two days, to boost Britain’s gas supplies during a cold spell.  Many experts question the need for another interconnector, saying that existing cross-Pyrenees pipelines are already underutilised, even during periods of high demand. “If there were a real demand for Midcat, the market would already have built those interconnectors,” said one of the sources familiar with the Poyry report. The project has attracted critics. “The Midcat project is not coherent with the EU’s climate commitments and its promises to reduce reliance on fossil energy,” said Michele Rivasi, a French member of the European Parliament. Friends of the Earth Europe’s Antoine Simon said STEP was designed as a precursor to a bigger 3 billion euro investment in the Midcat pipeline across France and the Iberian peninsula.  “STEP is a reasonable project that responds to the desire of the heads of state of France, Spain and Portugal to strengthen our gas interconnections and boost security of supply in Europe,” Terega’s Boche said.  Spanish European MP Xabier Benito Ziluaga said Midcat made no economic sense and that Madrid backed the plan to support its gas industry. “It is a project based on private interests, not on public interest or objective evidence,” he said.

2018-04-18,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Winter storms and overcapacity in fracking equipment are expected to limit oilfield service companies’ revenue and profit gains in the first quarter, postponing Wall Street expectations for a strong pickup in results to the second half of this year. Companies that provide services and equipment to the oilfield sector have spent the past year eyeing a comeback, as oil prices recovered to around $67 a barrel from lows around $26 a barrel two years ago. Some companies expanded fracking capacity in anticipation of stronger demand. While a few were able to swing to a profit last year, many are still struggling to raise prices for their services.  Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield service firm, is expected to report on Friday that it earned 37 cents per share, up about 12 cents from a year earlier but off 11 cents from the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton, which in February warned that weather-related delays of frack-sand deliveries could cut 10 cents per share from its profit, is anticipated to report earnings of 41 cents per share, up 37 cents from a year ago but down 12 cents from the final quarter of 2017. General Electric’s Baker Hughes is expected to post a profit of six cents per share, down from 15 cents in the fourth quarter. “There were substantial improvements in the second half of last year, but we took a surprising pause in the fourth and first quarters due to winter impacts,” said Colin Davies, a senior research analyst at Bernstein. The headwinds have prompted banks to cut price targets for some oilfield service companies. Last week, JP Morgan lowered its target prices for some of the largest oilfield services firms by $2 per share. The companies that frack wells will face greater scrutiny this quarter, analysts say, as investors worry about the rapid expansion of U.S. hydraulic-fracturing fleets. Keane Group, Liberty Oilfield Services and ProPetro have announced plans to expand their fleets. In March, shares of ProPetro fell by almost 13 percent after the company missed a profit estimate and said it would add two fleets to its pressure pumping offerings.   “The pricing tailwind for pressure pumpers feels like it has lost a lot of momentum” said Byron Pope, a managing director at investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Keane is forecast to post a profit of 22 cents per share, down 12 cents from the prior quarter but up from a loss of 34 cents in the same period last year. Sequentially, its revenues are anticipated to be flat at $502.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-04-18,"(Adds details, comments, recasts first paragraph, adds prices) April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. oil stockpiles fell across the board last week with gasoline and distillates drawing down more than expected on stronger demand, sending crude prices to fresh three-and-a-half-year highs. Crude inventories fell 1.1 million barrels in the week to April 13, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 1.4 million barrels. Gasoline stocks dropped by 3 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 227,000-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles decreased 3.1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 268,000-barrel draw, the EIA data showed, putting overall inventories of these products, which include diesel, heating oil and jet fuel, at levels not seen seasonally since 2014. “This may be one of the most bullish reports in some time, with the across-the-board declines in inventories,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “Gasoline demand was very strong, virtually summer-like.” Oil prices rallied, with U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) hitting a high of $68.45 a barrel, the highest since December 2014. As of 10:46 a.m. EDT (1446 GMT), the benchmark was up $1.65, or 2.5 percent, at $68.17 a barrel. Brent futures gained $1.53, or 2.1 percent, to $73.11 a barrel, after hitting $73.30, highest since November 2014. Refining runs fell, as some plants powered down for seasonal maintenance, but the drop in gasoline points to reasonably solid demand, with overall motor gasoline demand up 0.7 percent in the last four weeks compared with the same period a year ago. Distillate product demand was down 2 percent from the same time period a year ago, but jet fuel demand rose 5.3 percent. Refinery crude runs fell by 70,000 barrels per day as utilization rates fell by 1.1 percentage points to 92.4 percent of total capacity, the EIA data showed. Crude stocks were also reduced as a result of net crude import declines, which fell by 1.3 million bpd last week. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI fell by 1.1 million barrels, EIA said.

2018-04-18,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece launched an international tender on Wednesday to sell a majority stake in its biggest oil refiner, Hellenic Petroleum (HEPr.AT), as agreed under its third international bailout. The Greek privatisation agency said at least 50.1 percent of Hellenic will be sold, in one of the biggest asset sales under Athens’ privatisation scheme launched in 2010, and interested investors must submit expressions of interest by May 18. In the tender document published on its website, the privatisation agency said the sale will be an all-cash transaction. Major shareholders Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holding and the Greek government agreed this month to divest at least 50.1 percent of Hellenic, which is Europe’s third biggest oil refiner based on its market value of 2.6 billion euros ($3.2 billion).  The exact size of the stakes to be sold will not be disclosed until short-listed investors are invited to submit binding offers, the agency said. Paneuropean Oil owns 45.5 percent of Hellenic and the Greek government holds a 35.5 percent stake. Suitors need to have at least three years of experience in the oil and gas industry, while in the case of a consortium, at least one member must meet this requirement. Asset sales have been a pillar of Greece’s three international bailouts since 2010 and progress in key privatisations, including Hellenic Petroleum, will determine whether Athens can meet its bailout target to raise 2 billion euros from the scheme this year. Another big ticket item is the sale of a majority stake in the country’s gas grid DESFA. Athens on Monday asked a consortium led by Italy’s Snam (SRG.MI), the highest bidder, to further improve its offer. The consortium is expected to decide on its bid by Thursday when the privatisation agency’s board is due to meet, a source close to the process told Reuters on Wednesday.

2018-04-18,"(Adds details on debt) By George Obulutsa NAIROBI, April 18 (Reuters) - Sub-Saharan Africa is on course for economic growth of 3.1 percent this year, the World Bank said on Wednesday, marginally slower than it previously forecast but faster than last year thanks to rising commodity prices. By 2020 growth in the region should pick up to 3.7 percent, it said. Sub-Saharan African economies were hit hard by a crash in commodity prices which slowed growth, slashed government revenues and weakened several of the continent’s currencies. Growth was 1.5 percent in 2016, the lowest in more than two decades, before rising to an estimated 2.6 percent last year. “While Nigeria, South Africa, and Angola are expected to see a gradual pick-up in growth, economic expansion will continue at a solid pace in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and strengthen in most of East Africa,” the bank said in its Africa’s Pulse report for April. “These forecasts are predicated on the expectations that oil and metals prices will remain stable, expansion in global trade will stay robust, and external financial market conditions will continue to be supportive.” In January, the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report forecast growth in sub-Saharan Africa would rise to 3.2 percent in 2018. Nigeria, South Africa and Angola make up about 60 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s annual GDP. The bank said Nigeria was experiencing a recovery in oil output but hurdles in non-oil industries and services would be a drag on activity. “In Angola, the revisions reflect the expectation that a more efficient foreign exchange allocation system, increased availability of foreign exchange due to higher oil prices, rising natural gas production, and improved business sentiment would help support the rebound in economic activity,” the bank said. “In South Africa, slowing inflation and improving business confidence are expected to help sustain the ongoing recovery in domestic demand, especially in investment.” The bank said that while growth prospects were encouraging, there were still hurdles ahead. “Growth in the non-oil industrial sectors has yet to pick up, underscoring the low structural transformation in the region; employment opportunities are lagging; public debt relative to GDP is rising; and poverty is widespread,” the report said. It added that African countries in debt distress doubled to eight in the last five years, while those at high risk of going into debt distress had jumped to 18 from eight in the same period. The main risk to growth in the region was the possibility of a collapse in commodity prices, with a slowdown in China being a likely cause due to interest rate hikes or trade tensions with the United States. “A collapse in oil and metals prices would severely undermine efforts at fiscal consolidation, derailing progress in reining in the region’s debt burden,” the World Bank said.

2018-04-18,"MOSCOW, April 18 (Reuters) - The Russian energy ministry has proposed changes to a draft oil production law that it says could boost production by around 900,000 tonnes per year, First Deputy Energy Minister Alexei Texler said on Wednesday. Debate about the law has dragged on for years, as the Finance Ministry expressed concerns the changes could reduce state revenues. Oilfields, especially in West Siberia, have become increasingly depleted and the new tax regime is seen as an incentive to produce more oil in a country which is heavily dependent on sales of energy for state revenue. Russia’s parliament has approved the new profit-based tax on the oil industry on a first reading. Currently, taxes are based on production - via a mineral extraction tax - and exports. The new tax will initially cover four groups of oilfields, including new deposits in far-flung regions of East Siberia, fields which enjoy a lower export duty, and some highly-depleted fields in West Siberia. The new taxes, at least on an initial stage, will be applicable to only limited number of fields, depending on how big their reserves are. Texler said the ministry had proposed increasing quotas for the groups of oilfields eligible for the new tax from 50 million tonnes of reserves to 150 million tonnes, and the changes would be debated in the second, crucial, reading. In addition, the new proposal would raise the limits for a single oilfield, to which the new taxation could be applicable, to 20-30 million tonnes of reserves from 10 million tonnes to increase the scope for the taxation. The proposals would boost production of oil by 900,000 tonnes per year (18,000 bpd), Texler said. He didn’t say, to which level. The law is expected to be implemented starting from 2019. A forecast published in September by the economy ministry, saw Russian oil production rising to 553 million tonnes per year in 2019-2020. Lawmakers must approve the draft in three readings before it is sent it to the upper house of parliament and then President Vladimir Putin for signature.

2018-04-18,"OSLO (Reuters) - Offshore oil driller Seadrill SDRL.OL plans to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late June or early July to catch the rising wave of rig market activity, its chief executive told said on Wednesday. The company won U.S. court approval on Tuesday for its multi-billion dollar debt restructuring plan after reaching a deal with more than 40 banks, unsecured creditors and shipyards. “The confirmation is the most significant milestone in the process, and now we need to implement the plan over 60 to 90 days. Obviously, we would like to do it as fast as possible,” CEO Anton Dibowitz told Reuters.  Seadrill plans to expand relations with Schlumberger (SLB.N), the world’s largest oil services firm, and other suppliers to the global oil and gas industry, although the company had no immediate consolidation plans, he added. Seadrill is already cooperating with Schlumberger in India to offer integrated drilling services. “Equally, we are in discussions with all major oil service companies, and if there are opportunities that makes sense for both of us, we will certainly entertain that,” Dibowitz said. Seadrill was forced to seek bankruptcy court protection from creditors after a sharp drop in oil prices in 2014 cut oil firms’ appetite for exploration, pushing rates for rigs down and leaving many idle. Oil companies have since returned to the market, hiring rigs to explore for offshore oil and gas deposits after crude prices have traded above $60 a barrel since November. Brent LCOc1 was trading at $72 at 1303 GMT.  Out of 51 rig marketed by Seadrill, which include rigs owned by its non-consolidated entities, such as Seadrill Partners (SDLP.N), 31 rigs are currently employed. Seadrill said the approved plan, which extends maturities of $5.7 billion in bank debts, converts $2.3 billion of unsecured bonds to equity and injects $1 billion in new debt and equity, would enable the company to take advantage of a market recovery. “We are fully confident that it (the drilling market) would recover within the next five years, and now we have a runway that we needed in order to see that,” Dibowitz said. Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen will retain control of Seadrill with a stake of just under 30 percent in the restructured company, up from 24 percent previously.  Fredriksen, whose business empire includes the largest salmon farmer Marine Harvest MHG.OL and oil tanker firm Frontline (FRO.OL), is committed to remaining a long-term stakeholder, Dibowitz said. He added that Fredriksen “was absolutely integral to striking the deal with the banks, and I expect that he will continue to be the anchor shareholder going forward.” Dibowitz, Seadrill’s CEO since July 2017, said he expected to remain at the helm of the company after its restructuring.

The Qatari index surged 1.1 percent as Commercial Bank gained 3.8 percent. It reported a 345 percent year-on-year jump in first-quarter net profit to 405 million riyals ($111 million). The average forecast from analysts polled by Reuters was 329.5 million riyals. Doha Bank, which is to announce its first-quarter earnings next Sunday, climbed 3.4 percent. Qatari banks’ earnings so far in the reporting season have generally been strong, suggesting the impact on them of the embargo imposed by other Arab states on Qatar has largely faded. In Saudi Arabia, the index gained 0.6 percent, rising for a fifth straight day. The market is bullish because of expectations for foreign fund inflows in the coming two years as the kingdom joins emerging market indexes. PetroRabigh was the biggest gainer, surging 7.9 percent to its highest level since October 2014. It will go ex-dividend next Wednesday. With a trailing price-earnings ratio of about 17 times and a dividend yield of 1.8 percent, the stock is no longer cheap by some measures. “The anticipated fund flows are large so a lot of stocks are just moving on momentum now,” said one Saudi fund manager, adding that even though many valuations were looking rich, the market might still have the energy to rise further. Telecommunications firm Zain Saudi closed 3.6 percent higher in its heaviest trade since April 2017, although it came well off its intra-day high. Dubai’s index sank 1.4 percent as Emaar Properties slipped 3.6 percent. The stock has been dragged down this year by the weakness of the Dubai real estate market. Strong bank earnings failed to boost stocks. Dubai Islamic Bank dropped 1.8 percent after reporting a 17 percent rise in quarterly net profit, while the biggest bank, Emirates , fell 0.5 percent despite posting a 27 percent increase in quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates. In Egypt, the blue chip index slid 0.5 percent as major financial services firm Pioneers Holding plunged 10 percent to 9.58 Egyptian pounds after saying it would increase its capital by 30 percent.

2018-04-18,"(Adds IMF comment) LUANDA, April 18 (Reuters) - The IMF indicated on Wednesday that it was receptive to a request from Angola for non-financial assistance to help it implement economic reforms. Africa’s second-largest crude producer continues to suffer from lower oil prices, which have caused a dollar liquidity squeeze that has made it difficult for foreign companies to repatriate profits and discouraged many from investing. The finance ministry said on Tuesday it wanted a deal with the IMF known as a Policy Coordination Instrument that “will help to improve the external credibility of our country with positive impact on the ability to attract Foreign Direct Investment”. In a statement, the ministry said it was seeking help in implementing its “Macroeconomic Stabilisation Plan” - effectively the economic policy of the new government. The IMF confirmed receipt of the request, saying it “stands ready to help Angola address its economic challenges by supporting a comprehensive policy package”. The statement explained that while the Policy Coordination Instrument does not involve any IMF financing, the policies supported under it must meet the same standard as those required under a standard IMF loan. President João Lourenço, who took over last September after 38 years of rule by José Eduardo dos Santos, has said he wants to bring about an economic miracle in Angola by opening up to foreign investment and diversifying away from oil. Oil accounts for over 90 percent of exports by sub-Saharan Africa’s third largest economy. A severe shortage of dollars has deterred foreign investment; on the streets of the capital Luanda, a dollar goes for nearly twice the official rate. However, a devaluation of some 30 percent to the dollar this year has gone some way to closing the gap with the street rate. Angola has been trying to persuade international banks to rekindle dollar correspondent relationships with the country, which were cut over the past few years due to perceived compliance risks in doing business there. “The government of President Lourenço has taken important steps toward improving governance and restoring macroeconomic stability,” the IMF statement added.

2018-04-18," LONDON (Reuters) - The shocks from the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Oleg Deripaska and his UC Rusal aluminium empire are still rolling through the market. After Rio Tinto last week flagged it was declaring force majeure on some raw material contracts, it warned today of potential “adjustments” to its aluminium guidance this year due to the sanctions. Some of Japan’s major trading houses, meanwhile, have asked Rusal to stop shipping aluminium for fear of secondary sanctions. Japan imports around 300,000 tonnes of Russian aluminium every year, equivalent to around 16 percent of its total import needs. Aluminium’s previously well-filled supply chain is starting to crack along multiple fault lines. As supply fears grow, the market’s attention is turning to China as a potential source of aluminium. There are almost a million tonnes of the stuff sitting in warehouses registered with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE). That metal will flow out of China if the price is right. But China’s role as supplier of last resort is heavily laden with irony given the political push back against its exports of aluminium products. The world’s largest producer is also suffering from its own supply-chain turbulence. (Graphic on London and Shanghai aluminium relative price performance: tmsnrt.rs/2JWSBO3) In London the price of aluminium has been on a rocket-propelled charge since the U.S. Treasury announced the sanctions on April 6. At a current $2,527 per tonne London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month aluminium has gained over $500 in the space of under two weeks. That has opened up a widening gap with Shanghai prices, which have reacted only mutedly to the excitement in London. However, still higher prices will be needed for Chinese aluminium to leave the country and fill the supply gaps opening up in the rest of the world, according to analysts at CRU. That’s because exports of primary metal from China are subject to a 15 percent export tax, unlike exports of products which qualify for VAT rebates. Depending on market dynamics in both London and Shanghai, CRU is looking for prices to approach $3,000 to unlock the 991,780 tonnes of metal sitting in ShFE warehouses. But this is what will be necessary if Rusal’s own exports out of Russia are blocked. CRU was already anticipating a supply shortfall of around 1.8 million tonnes outside of China before the sanctions, according to CRU’s head of primary and products research, Eoin Dinsmore. Throw in the potential loss of 200,000-230,000 tonnes of monthly exports from Russia and there would be “a critical need” for Chinese metal. Goldman Sachs agrees, arguing that a complete cessation of Rusal exports could lift prices to as high as $3,200. (“Quantifying upside risks from Russian Sanctions”, April 18, 2018). The bank’s view is that Rusal will be restructured to bypass sanctions and allow both production and exports to continue but it has still lifted its price forecasts to factor in the uncertainty. The irony here is that China is already a huge exporter, not of primary aluminium but rather of aluminium in the form of semi-manufactured products. Indeed, such has been the flood of products out of the country that up to now the big issue for everyone else has been how to stop China exporting so much not how to stimulate it to export more. The United States has led the political push back against Chinese product exports, which rose another 4 percent last year to an annual record of 4.24 million tonnes. President Donald Trump has signed off on a 10-percent import tax on all imports of aluminium with China firmly in the administration’s sights. Separately, the United States is still slapping anti-dumping duties on specific Chinese products. Aluminium foil has already been hit with swingeing countervailing duties and the net has just been widened to include aluminium alloy sheet. This is the dilemma for the rest the world. It now desperately needs Chinese exports of primary metal to rebalance the market but simultaneously still needs lower exports of products. China’s own aluminium production sector, meanwhile, is experiencing plenty of its own turbulence. The closure last year of “illegal” capacity, meaning that operating without all the correct permits, and mandated curtailments at some plants during the winter smog campaign have slowed production growth to just 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018. It’s true that the winter heating season cuts have disappointed aluminium bulls. But the environmental pressure on the aluminium smelting sector shows no signs of letting up any time soon. Adding new uncertainty is a draft proposal from the National Development and Reform Commission targeting aluminium producers drawing their power from captive coal plants and stipulating retroactive power payments to the government. Hongqiao, the world’s largest aluminium producer and one that is heavily reliant on coal, could be particularly vulnerable. At this stage the proposal is no more than that and there is likely plenty of wriggle-room for such a big industrial powerhouse and employer. But the key takeaway here is that Beijing’s scrutiny of its aluminium sector is only getting sharper as it targets both excessive capacity and polluting industries. At any other time in recent history China’s giant smelter sector could have been relied upon to lift production in response to rocketing prices. Right now, however, price is only part of a more complex landscape defined by “illegal” capacity closures, winter curtailments and, now, the longer-term viability of coal as a source of the power needed to produce the metal. The global aluminium industry continues to pay the price of Chinese excess. With over half of the world’s aluminium production concentrated in one country, there is no cushion outside of China to compensate for diminished flows of metal from Rusal. Moreover, what is clearly available right now in China, namely the million tonnes sitting in Shanghai warehouses, is trapped behind China’s export tax. What is flowing in ever increasing quantities out of China is in the wrong form for the rest of the world, which now needs more primary aluminium and less product. This problematic reliance on China has been growing for many years but it’s taken the hit on the largest non-Chinese producer to expose the dysfunctional nature of the global aluminium supply chain. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Louise Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/aluminium-sanctions-ahome/column-china-the-highly-problematic-saviour-of-the-global-aluminium-market-andy-home-idUKL8N1RV3XH,18 Apr 2018,* London and Shanghai aluminium prices: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JWSBO3,"COLUMN-China, the highly problematic saviour of the global aluminium market?

2018-04-18,"(Adds quote, context) CAIRO, April 18 (Reuters) - Egypt will keep ports running for 24 hours a day, up from 16 currently, to cut “long waiting times” for shipments, Transportation Minister Hesham Arafat said on Wednesday as the country tackles an issue that has cost it millions of dollars. Grain traders over the last year have added hefty premiums on shipments headed to Egypt, the world’s largest wheat buyer, partly as a result of soaring demurrage fees - costs borne by suppliers if they fail to unload their ships on time. Traders say the high demurrage fees have resulted from congestion at Egypt’s ports and what they describe as a tedious inspection process stalling their vessels, prompting them to add risk premiums of up to $500,000 on individual cargoes. Egypt’s state grain buyer GASC set new tender terms in February to cap demurrage fees after major suppliers shunned state wheat tenders. Arafat said the extended port hours would come at no added cost to shippers. He did not specify when the new hours would take effect or how long the new policy would remain in place. Traders said under the current system, shippers could pay for additional time at the port beyond the regular 16 hours. One Cairo-based trader called the new hours a “good move” to avoid extra costs, but said much of the current problem was also tied to a lack of storage space at Egypt’s crowded ports, something the new policy would not correct. “Some of the storage areas inside the port don’t have enough space to discharge the whole quantities,” he said.

2018-04-18,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek ferries remained docked at the country’s ports on Wednesday as seamen, marine engineers and ship cooks walked off the job to protest against planned government reforms which they say will further hurt their labour rights.  The 24-hour strike was organised by Greece’s seamen federation (PNO), which said the leftist-led government was preparing a reform allowing non-European flagged transport ships to sail in Greece, leading to job losses for Greek crews. The reform is coming on top of pension cuts, rising unregistered labour and work without any insurance, PNO said. PNO said later on Wednesday that the strike would be extended until Friday morning. “No more blows against our sector,” it said in a statement.   Passenger traffic was slow at Piraeus port on Wednesday morning. Traffic has been picking up as the summer, the top tourism season for the Mediterranean country, approaches. Marine unions have strongly resisted reforms liberalising the shipping sector, which along with tourism is a pivotal industry for Greece, a country of proud seafarers and shipowners.  Since its worst debt crisis in decades broke out in 2010, Greece has sold management rights and majority stakes at its two largest ports, as demanded by its foreign lenders, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

2018-04-18,"BURE, France (Reuters) - The 82 residents of the French village of Bure lived a quiet life until the government began testing the feasibility of storing nuclear waste there. Now Bure is rocked by protests as a final decision on the project looms. For the past 20 years, French nuclear waste agency Andra has tested the stability of the clay of the northeastern village to see if it could hold radioactive waste for hundreds of thousands of years.  Andra is preparing a formal request for next year to build the 25 billion euro ($31 billion) facility to hold waste from the reactors of state-owned utility EDF. French nuclear regulator ASN has already said the plan is sound and deep geological storage is the safest way to protect future generations from radioactive waste.  But a police van at the main square is testimony to rising tensions and demonstrations that have at times blocked the area where Andra wants to dig. “Life will become unbearable here with the nuclear waste and all the demonstrators,” said Bure mayor Gerard Antoine, who breeds beef cattle.  Antoine approved the installation of Andra research facilities two decades ago but said he now regrets that decision and would say no if he were asked today.  Hundreds of demonstrators who built a camp nearby were kicked out by police in February but say they are there for the long run and will fight the project until the government changes its plans.              “We are heading straight for ... a nuclear disaster, that’s why we’re against it,” said Jean-Marc Fleury, a local elected official with an environmentalist party.      Police are maintaining a heavy presence while protesters have regrouped in and around a house in the Bure village centre. The future Cigeo site is designed to cover an area of 600 hectares and have 250 kilometres of underground galleries where nuclear waste would be buried in huge rust-proof cylinders.  Andra, which carried out research work via a research laboratory 500 metres underground, wants to start work on the site in 2022 and complete it by 2030. “We’re not going to do deep burial of (nuclear) waste if we had any doubt that it would leak or contaminate the environment,” said Andra spokesman Mathieu Saint Louis. “The ultimate goal with an underground installation such as this one is precisely to protect ourselves from the danger of (nuclear) waste.” For now, spent fuel from French nuclear reactors is stored in pools next to the reactors before it is shipped to state-owned nuclear fuel group Orano’s recycling plant in La Hague, western France.  But La Hague is not designed for long-term storage and France does not have a solution 40 years after investing heavily in nuclear energy. Other countries that use nuclear power face the same problem. The Bure site is designed so that nuclear waste could be retrieved for the first 100 years if scientists find a better solution than burying it. Otherwise, the underground galleries will be permanently sealed with concrete. Anti-nuclear activists say deep geological storage does not offer perfect guarantees against radiation leakage in ground water. They want the waste moved to underground facilities that are just a few metres deep, to monitor it better.

MSCI’s index of world stocks was up 0.3 percent at 1203 GMT, while the top index of euro zone stocks rose 0.3 percent, having touched its highest since Feb. 5, when a spike in volatility amplified a sell-off in global equity markets. S&P 500 futures sparked higher, rising 0.4 percent by 1203 GMT as investors digested the latest batch of U.S. results with Morgan Stanley shining. The bank’s shares climbed in pre-market trading after a record jump in quarterly profits, up 40 percent thanks to a strong trading boost. It kept the pace set by Goldman Sachs which reported a surge in profits on Tuesday, also driven by a sharp increase in trading as market volatility rose. Analysts have downgraded their European earnings estimates ahead of the first-quarter results season, while U.S. companies are expected to deliver stellar results. Investors were watching Europe’s earnings season for signs of strain from a stronger euro, with Continental providing an early indication the currency’s rise was hurting exporters. The tyre maker fell 4.3 percent, driving a pullback in Germany’s DAX, after a negative hit to earnings from exchange rates forced it to lower its outlook. But a fall in the S&P 500 volatility gauge reflected investors’ renewed confidence in the resilience of equity markets. The VIX edged down, near a six-week low. “Volatility has come down because expectations are very strong for the earnings season and the market is happy to see some hard data,” said Laurent Godin, equity analyst at Indosuez Wealth Management. Britain’s FTSE 100 stood out with much stronger gains. It was up 0.9 percent after an unexpected fall in British inflation to a one-year low dented the pound — good news for its high percentage of overseas revenue earners. While investors were refocusing on fundamentals after weeks dominated by geopolitical tensions, the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) survey of fund managers showed signs of caution. Investors cut their equity allocation to an 18-month low and increased their cash balances. “Just like they were chasing the market up in January, investors have gradually started to sell,” said Clark Fenton, chief investment officer at Agilis Investment Management. “I think that gives the market scope to rally a bit more as positioning has lightened up.” TRANS-ATLANTIC YIELD GAP WIDENS, CURRENCIES MUTED Fund managers named the threat of trade war as the biggest “tail risk” in BAML’s survey, while they were less concerned about inflation causing convulsions in bond markets. Monetary tightening, proceeding at a different pace on either side of the Atlantic, was making its mark on bond markets. The gap between U.S. and German two-year bonds reached its widest in nearly 30 years, reflecting the diverging monetary policy outlook. “In some ways I am sort of surprised that it hasn’t mattered more,” said Agilis’ Fenton, referring to the trans-Atlantic divergence. “I would have thought it would have helped European equity prices more on a relative basis.” The U.S. yield curve - the gap between U.S. 2-year and 10-year government bond yields — flattened back slightly, having fallen to a low of 41.8 basis points overnight. “I would worry if [the curve] got inverted. It’s probably a bit premature to get too bent out of shape about it now,” said Fenton. The rise in short-dated yields has pushed the real yield on U.S. two-year Treasuries above the S&P 500 dividend yield for the first time in 10 years. tmsnrt.rs/2JSYMCO Currency market movements, outside of a sliding sterling, were restrained. The euro was stuck at $1.2362, after topping out at $1.2413 overnight, while the dollar index hovered at 89.5. The yen pulled back to 107.23 against the dollar, pushed down by signs of progress in talks between South and North Korea. Strong metals prices, boosted by supply concerns after U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminium giant Rusal, helped send Europe’s basic resources stocks surging 2.1 percent. Oil prices also continued their relentless rise. Brent crude futures were up 86 cents at $72.44 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 95 cents to $67.48 a barrel. *****For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘LIVE/‘ in the search bar***** Reporting by Helen Reid

2018-04-18,"PARIS (Reuters) - Oil company Total (TOTF.PA) said it will buy a majority stake in French electricity retailer Direct Energie DIREN.PA in a 1.4 billion euro ($1.73 billion) deal that beefs up its challenge to state-owned market leader EDF (EDF.PA). The deal is part of Total’s strategy to grow its low-carbon energy assets to 20 percent of total assets by 2035 from 5 percent today and comes as other global oil and gas majors also shift to more renewable energy and electricity.  “This friendly takeover is part of the group’s strategy to expand along the entire gas-electricity value chain and to develop low-carbon energies,” CEO Patrick Pouyanne said.  Shortly after being appointed CEO in 2014 Pouyanne said electricity will be the energy of the 21st century. Since then Total has bought upstart power vendor Lampiris, battery specialist Saft and renewable energy firm Eren, putting together an a mini-electricity utility.  With Direct Energie, Total has acquired the biggest independent challenger to French market leader EDF, as well as a portfolio of gas-fired and renewable energy power plants.  Rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) made a similar move in February, buying British-based retail power provider First Utility, which serves around 825,000 homes.  Shell also supplies power to industrial customers in Britain and has recently acquired a solar power company in the country.  Several oil majors are also entering the business of electric vehicle charging in order to hedge their petrol stations businesses. “Total was already ahead of its peers in terms of M&A spending on renewables and other clean technologies. This deal shows it is serious (about this strategy),” said Wood Mackenzie research director Valentina Kretzschmar. Total will pay the controlling shareholders of Direct Energie 1.4 billion euros for 74.33 percent of its capital. Direct Energie’s board has unanimously approved the takeover. Once the deal is completed, Total will launch a tender offer for the rest of Direct Energie’s shares at the same price of 42 euros per share, a 30 percent premium over the April 17 close and a 24 percent premium over its three-month average price. The offer values Direct Energie at about 12.5 times 2018 core earnings, Total said. Total - which first entered the French retail power market in 2016 with the Lampiris acquisition - has 1.5 million French electricity clients and will add 2.6 million more with the deal. It is targeting over 6 million customers in France and more than 1 million in Belgium by 2022. Total is one of several newcomers in French power retailing, which was opened to competition a decade ago, but EDF still dominates with a market share of about 85.5 percent. Gas and power utility Engie (ENGIE.PA) had 3.8 million electricity clients in France at the end of December. Direct Energie CEO Xavier Caïtucoli told Reuters that Pouyanne had asked him to remain as head of Direct Energie as it is integrated into Total. No decision had been taken on whether to keep the Direct Energie name or to switch to the Total brand.  The deal will add Direct Energie’s 1.35 gigawatts (GW) of installed generation capacity to Total’s 900 megawatts (MW). Direct Energie also has a development pipeline of 2.4 GW of mainly renewable energy capacity. Total revised it aims to have a global capacity of 5 GW of installed capacity within five years to 10 GW after the deal.     Direct Energie shares surged 30.5 percent to 42.08 euros, while Total shares were up 1 percent.

2018-04-18,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia would be happy to see crude rise to $80 or even $100 a barrel, three industry sources said, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to an OPEC supply-cutting deal even though the agreement’s original target is within sight.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other producers began to reduce supply in January 2017 in an attempt to erase a glut. They have extended the pact until December 2018 and meet in June to review policy. OPEC is closing in on the original target of the pact - reducing industrialized nations’ oil inventories to their five-year average. There is no indication yet, however, that Saudi Arabia or its allies want to wind down the supply cut. Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has emerged as OPEC’s leading supporter of measures to boost prices, a change from its more moderate stance in earlier years. Iran, once a keen OPEC price hawk, now wants lower prices than Saudi Arabia. Industry sources have linked this shift in Saudi Arabia’s stance to its desire to support the valuation of state oil company Aramco ahead of the kingdom’s planned sale of a minority stake in an initial public offering. The supply cut has helped boost oil prices this year to $73 a barrel, the highest since November 2014. Oil began a slide from above $100 - a price that Saudi Arabia endorsed in 2012 - in mid-2014, when growing supply from rival sources such as U.S. shale began to swamp the market. But the kingdom wants the rally to go further. Two industry sources said a desired crude price of $80 or even $100 was circulated by senior Saudi officials in closed-door briefings in recent weeks. “We have come full circle,” a separate high-level industry source said of the change in Saudi thinking. “I would not be surprised if Saudi Arabia wanted oil at $100 until this IPO is out of the way.”  Once the Aramco share sale is done, Riyadh would still want higher prices to help fund initiatives such as Vision 2030, an economic reform plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “Saudi Arabia wants higher oil prices and yes, probably for the IPO, but it isn’t just that,” an OPEC source said.  “Look at the economic reforms and projects they want to do, and the war in Yemen. How are they going to pay for all that? They need higher prices.”  To be sure, OPEC and Saudi Arabia have no official price target and say the objective of the production cut is to balance supply and demand, and reduce the inventory glut. But guidance on preferred price levels comes from officials speaking off the record, and from industry sources who have discussed the issue with Saudi officials. “I personally think that now $70 is the floor for oil prices,” a second OPEC source said. “But OPEC is unlikely to make any changes in June, maybe by the end of the year. The market still needs support.” OPEC and its partners meet on June 22 to review policy and before then a ministerial monitoring panel gathers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on April 20. By OPEC’s parameters, the deal has worked. Oil stocks in developed economies in February stood a mere 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average, down from 340 million barrels above in January 2017. The cuts have been even bigger than those specified in the deal, thanks in part to a slide in Venezuelan production due to an economic crisis in the South American country. Compliance has reached 150 percent, according to OPEC, meaning the organization’s members have cut production by about 1.8 million barrels per day, 600,000 bpd more than pledged. Few OPEC sources call for an exit strategy. Most officials are talking of introducing additional inventory metrics to assess the success of the deal, and of a need to support investment in new production to avert any supply crunch. The impression is that oil prices are seen as not yet high enough to encourage sufficient oil investment. “We will know what will be the good price when the market is balanced and we have enough investments,” the United Arab Emirates’ energy minister, Suhail al-Mazroui, told Reuters last week. “We need to have more investments coming.” The Jeddah meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee is unlikely to change the parameters for assessing the deal’s success, Mazroui and other OPEC officials said, and sources see little chance of a major tweak in June. “Even if we reach the five-year average before June, it does not mean we just go and open the taps,” a third OPEC source said. “We have to test it.”  Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/opec-oil/exclusive-opecs-new-price-hawk-saudi-arabia-seeks-oil-as-high-as-100-sources-idUKL8N1RU50O,18 Apr 2018,"Top oil exporter Saudi

2018-04-18,"NAIROBI, April 18 (Reuters) - Sub-Saharan Africa is on course for economic growth of 3.1 percent this year, the World Bank said on Wednesday, marginally slower than it previously forecast but faster than last year thanks to rising commodity prices. By 2020 growth in the region should pick up to 3.7 percent, it said. Sub-Saharan African economies were hit hard by a crash in commodity prices which slowed growth, slashed government revenues and weakened several of the currencies on the continent. Growth was 1.5 percent in 2016, the lowest in more than two decades, before rising to an estimated 2.6 percent last year. “While Nigeria, South Africa, and Angola are expected to see a gradual pick-up in growth, economic expansion will continue at a solid pace in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and strengthen in most of East Africa,” the bank said in its Africa’s Pulse report for April. “These forecasts are predicated on the expectations that oil and metals prices will remain stable, expansion in global trade will stay robust, and external financial market conditions will continue to be supportive.” In January, the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report forecast growth in sub-Saharan Africa would rise to 3.2 percent in 2018. Nigeria, South Africa and Angola make up about 60 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s annual GDP. The bank said Nigeria was experiencing a recovery in oil output but hurdles in non-oil industries and services would be a drag on activity. “In Angola, the revisions reflect the expectation that a more efficient foreign exchange allocation system, increased availability of foreign exchange due to higher oil prices, rising natural gas production, and improved business sentiment would help support the rebound in economic activity,” the bank said. “In South Africa, slowing inflation and improving business confidence are expected to help sustain the ongoing recovery in domestic demand, especially in investment.” The bank said that while growth prospects were encouraging, there were still hurdles ahead. “Growth in the non-oil industrial sectors has yet to pick up, underscoring the low structural transformation in the region; employment opportunities are lagging; public debt relative to GDP is rising; and poverty is widespread,” the report said. The main risk to growth in the region was the possibility of a collapse in commodity prices. “A possible trigger could be a slowdown in Chinese growth, given the risks posed by interest rate hikes or trade tensions with the United States,” the World Bank said. “A collapse in oil and metals prices would severely undermine efforts at fiscal consolidation, derailing progress in reining in the region’s debt burden.” (Reporting by George Obulutsa; Editing by Susan Fenton)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/africa-economy/sub-saharan-africas-economic-growth-to-quicken-to-3-1-pct-in-2018-world-bank-idUKL8N1RU30E,18 Apr 2018,"Sub-Saharan Africa is on

2018-04-18,"* CNOOC likely to auction more LNG next month - exchange official * Volume small, but Shanghai exchange aims to build liquidity * Shanghai market launched in 2015 (Add prices for the auction) BEIJING, April 18 (Reuters) - China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) on Wednesday sold cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on a domestic exchange for the first time, the latest step by China to boost supplies of the clean fuel as the nation shifts away from coal. CNOOC sold 60,000 tonnes of LNG for delivery in July at prices between 3,380 yuan ($537.80) to 3,390 yuan per tonne. It sold another 30,000 tonnes for November delivery at between 4,200 yuan and 4,210 yuan per tonne through an auction on the Shanghai Petroleum and Gas Exchange, an official at the exchange and a source briefed on the auction details said. Prices for November delivery was 200 yuan lower than the spot LNG prices in the same period last year, the source said. Eighteen bidders took part with the total volume sold within 30 minutes and 12 companies won the bidding, two sources said. “Interest in the auction was very strong,” he said. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. He would not disclose the identity of the interested parties. Though the volume is tiny compared to the nearly 70 million tonnes of natural gas China imported last year, the auction could help Chinese industrial buyers avoid the shortages that occurred this past winter. Ahead of the winter, China moved millions of residential customers from coal heating to gas heating as part of its fight against air pollution. Supplies, however, were not enough to meet the new demand and industrial users were interrupted to make residential supply available. Buying forward supplies through auctions like the Shanghai Exchange’s would give factories a chance to lock in prices and gas ahead of the winter heating season. More auctions would also help build liquidity on the Shanghai Exchange. CNOOC is likely to hold another auction next month, the exchange official said. China is the world’s third-biggest consumer of natural gas. The exchange official would not disclose the cargo prices, but said they were “relatively low” compared with market expectations. Shanghai launched its electronic platform in 2015 to create a pricing benchmark for China’s burgeoning gas market. It faces potential competition from a rival in Chongqing. Trading volumes on the Shanghai Exchange were thin during its first two year, but picked up last year ahead of the gas crunch this past winter.

2018-04-18,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The governor of Japan’s Niigata prefecture, home to the world’s largest nuclear power plant, resigned on Wednesday, saying he hoped to avoid political turmoil over an impending magazine article about his relations with women.  News that the governor, Ryuichi Yoneyama, intended to resign sent shares of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc (Tepco) surging as investors bet his departure could make it easier for the utility to restart its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, which is in Niigata prefecture. Japan has had few reported “#MeToo” cases about sexual harassment involving public figures but Yoneyama’s resignation came on the same day Japan’s top finance bureaucrat resigned on after a magazine said he had sexually harassed several female reporters. The official denied the allegation.  Yoneyama, like his predecessor, is opposed to a restart of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant and has been a block to attempts to get the station going by the utility, which also owns the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear station. Yoneyama told Reuters last year a better understanding of the Fukushima disaster of 2011 was needed before he would sign off on a restart at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa.  Tepco shares closed 4 percent higher on Wednesday after media reported Yoneyama would resign. The broader market rose about 1.4 percent. Yoneyama, who is single, said it was possible that some of the presents and money he had given to women he dated could be misinterpreted and that he was resigning to avoid further political turmoil over the issue. “It really hurts me that I can’t complete the task of tackling the safety of the nuclear plant,” he told a news conference. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s largest nuclear power plant and restarting the site’s seven reactors is crucial to Tepco’s recovery plans in the wake of the meltdowns at its Fukushima plant in 2011. Tepco has approval from regulators to start two reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, but the company needs to carry out further work before the restarts. While not a legal requirement, the sign off of the governor is also required.

2018-04-18,"OSLO (Reuters) - Several wind farm projects in Sweden are under threat due to the government’s decision to reserve more airspace for its armed forces, according to two companies and an industry lobby group.  In November, the government said its air force had labelled more airspace as low-flying zones in order to protect its operations from the expanding wind power industry. The move, to avoid planes colliding with wind turbines, has created uncertainty for a number of planned wind farms. Sweden’s largest utility, Vattenfall [VATN.UL], said the decision affected at least four of its projects, which together could generate around 1 gigawatt (GW) of power.  “Such projects would lose the permits and couldn’t be built,” spokesman Peter Stedt said, referring to two of the projects that have been approved. In all, some 2.8 GW of planned wind power production could be cancelled, according to industry lobby Svensk Vindenergi, equivalent to 42 percent of Sweden’s current wind production. Around 1 GW of that relates to wind farms with permits, and 1.8 GW to projects awaiting approval, it said. Eolus Vind, which builds wind farms and has projects under consideration in the affected areas, said it needed more clarity from authorities. “Clarification is important so that developers do not spend money on projects that have a low chance of being permitted due to the views of the armed forces,” said spokesman Johan Hammarqvist. The government said projects that have been approved should not be affected.  “Plants that already have permits to build should normally not be affected by the new low-flying areas,” Energy Minister Ibrahim Baylan told Reuters. Sweden aims to meet its energy needs without producing global warming carbon dioxide by 2040, and defence interests should be balanced with energy targets, he added. But Svensk Vindenergi said several companies with approved farms will have to reapply for permits because they need to build turbines that are higher than originally planned, and are therefore at risk of being refused. “Many of the permitted parks have a maximum height of 150 metres. In general, at least 200 metres is needed to reach the wind needed to be able to realise the project with today’s low price on electricity and certificates,” said Hallberg. Some projects could still be considered in the newly designated areas, the armed forces said. “In some cases the thorough analysis that is always performed might conclude that a wind power project can coexist in some specific areas,” its press office told Reuters. According to Svensk Vindenergi, the government’s decision affects 45 percent of Sweden’s territory, up from 30 percent previously.   The energy ministry and the armed forces did not provide their own calculations of the area affected, with the military saying the information was classified.

MSCI’s index of world stocks was last up 0.2 percent, while European stocks showed signs of fatigue after a strong start. The top index of euro zone stocks rose 0.2 percent, having touched its highest since Feb. 5, when a spike in volatility amplified a sell-off in global equity markets. S&P 500 futures also reduced gains slightly. It was last up 0.1 percent as investors awaited the next batch of U.S. results, with all eyes on Morgan Stanley after Goldman Sachs reported a surge in profits on strong trading gains. Reflecting earnings optimism, the dollar index climbed 0.2 percent, recovering from a three-week low hit on Tuesday. Analysts have downgraded their European earnings estimates ahead of the first-quarter results season, while U.S. companies are expected to deliver stellar results. Investors were watching Europe’s earnings season for signs of strain from a stronger euro, with Continental providing an early indication the currency’s rise was hurting exporters. The tyre maker fell 4.3 percent, driving a pullback in Germany’s DAX, after a negative hit to earnings from exchange rates forced it to lower its outlook. But a fall in volatility gauges reflected investors’ renewed confidence in the resilience of equity markets. The S&P 500 volatility gauge hovered around a six-week low. “Volatility has come down because expectations are very strong for the earnings season and the market is happy to see some hard data,” said Laurent Godin, equity analyst at Indosuez Wealth Management. Britain’s FTSE 100 stood out with much stronger gains. It was up 0.7 percent after an unexpected fall in British inflation to a one-year low dented the pound — good news for its high percentage of overseas revenue earners. While investors were refocusing on fundamentals after weeks dominated by geopolitical tensions, the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) survey of fund managers showed signs of caution. Investors cut their equity allocation to an 18-month low and increased their cash balances. “Just like they were chasing the market up in January, investors have gradually started to sell,” said Clark Fenton, chief investment officer at Agilis Investment Management. “I think that gives the market scope to rally a bit more as positioning has lightened up.” TRANS-ATLANTIC YIELD GAP WIDENS, CURRENCIES MUTED Fund managers named the threat of trade war as the biggest “tail risk” in BAML’s survey, while they were less concerned about inflation causing convulsions in bond markets. Monetary tightening, proceeding at a different pace on either side of the Atlantic, was making its mark on bond markets. The gap between U.S. and German two-year bonds reached its widest in nearly 30 years, reflecting the diverging monetary policy outlook. “In some ways I am sort of surprised that it hasn’t mattered more,” said Agilis’ Fenton, referring to the trans-Atlantic divergence. “I would have thought it would have helped European equity prices more on a relative basis.” The U.S. yield curve - the gap between U.S. 2-year and 10-year government bond yields — flattened back slightly, having fallen to a low of 41.8 basis points overnight. “I would worry if [the curve] got inverted. It’s probably a bit premature to get too bent out of shape about it now,” said Fenton. The rise in short-dated yields has pushed the real yield on U.S. two-year Treasuries above the S&P 500 dividend yield for the first time in 10 years. tmsnrt.rs/2JSYMCO Currency market movements, outside of a sliding sterling and recovering dollar, were restrained. The euro was stuck at $1.2362, after topping out at $1.2413 overnight. The yen pulled back to 107.24 against the dollar. The safe-haven currency was pushed down by signs of progress in talks between South and North Korea. Gold fell by a fraction, to $1,345.22 an ounce. Strong metals prices, boosted by supply concerns after U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminium giant Rusal, helped send Europe’s basic resources stocks higher. Oil prices also continued their relentless rise. Brent crude futures were up 49 cents at $72.06 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 57 cents to $67.09 a barrel. *****For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘LIVE/‘ in the search bar***** Reporting by Helen Reid

2018-04-18,"ATHENS, April 18 (Reuters) - Greek ferries remained docked at the country’s ports on Wednesday as seamen, marine engineers and ship cooks walked off the job to protest against planned government reforms which they say will further hurt their labour rights. The 24-hour strike was organised by Greece’s seamen federation (PNO), which said the leftist-led government was preparing a reform allowing non-European flagged transport ships to sail in Greece, leading to job losses for Greek crews. The reform is coming on top of pension cuts, rising unregistered labour and work without any insurance, PNO said. “The planned dismantling and the annihilation of our legal rights, and the continuing effort to ruin Greek seamen, cannot and will not stay unanswered,” PNO said, promising to escalate labour action. Ferry companies have announced changes to their service schedules and passenger traffic was slow at Piraeus port on Wednesday morning. Traffic has been picking up as the summer, the top tourism season for the Mediterranean country, approaches. Marine unions have strongly resisted reforms liberalising the shipping sector, which along with tourism is a pivotal industry for Greece, a country of proud seafarers and shipowners. Since its worst debt crisis in decades broke out in 2010, Greece has sold management rights and majority stakes at its two largest ports, as demanded by its foreign lenders, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The Greek state is considering concession deals for the development of about 850 small ports and marinas.

2018-04-18,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors are investigating current and former employees of Volkswagen-owned sports car maker Porsche, including a management board member, as part of their inquiries into emissions manipulations, they said on Wednesday.  Around 10 premises in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg were searched by around 160 officials, the prosecutor’s office in Porsche’s home town of Stuttgart said in a statement. “The three suspects include a member of the management board and a member of Porsche AG’s higher management. The third suspect is no longer employed at Porsche AG,” it said. The searches form part of an investigation into employees of Porsche AG suspected of fraud and fraudulent advertising tied to manipulated emissions control systems of diesel passenger cars, the prosecutors said. A spokesman for Porsche confirmed the searches, but declined to provide further details.  More than 2-1/2 years after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to cheating emissions tests on diesel engines in the United States, the carmaker and some of its brands continue to be investigated by authorities.   Earlier this year, German prosecutors widened a probe of Porsche’s sister brand Audi, which developed a 3.0 liter V6 diesel engine used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche models found to have been equipped with illicit software.        Two Audi sites were also searched on Wednesday, Stuttgart prosecutors and an Audi spokesman said. The searches were at Audi’s sites in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm, Audi said.

European stocks rose in early trading, pushing MSCI’s index of world stocks up 0.2 percent to its highest since March 22. The top index of euro zone stocks rose 0.4 percent to its highest since Feb. 5, when a spike in volatility amplified a sell-off in global equity markets. A gauge of volatility on the EuroSTOXX 50 fell to its lowest since Jan. 26, reflecting investors’ renewed confidence in the resilience of equity markets. The S&P 500 volatility gauge hovered around a six-week low. Analysts have downgraded their European earnings estimates ahead of the first-quarter results season, while U.S. companies are expected to deliver stellar results. “Volatility has come down because expectations are very strong for the earnings season and the market is happy to see some hard data,” said Laurent Godin, equity analyst at Indosuez Wealth Management. Gains in Europe followed a strong bounce in Asian markets after four straight days of losses, while Chinese stocks tumbled even after the central bank unexpectedly announced it would cut the cash banks must hold as reserves. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3 percent as investors awaited the next batch of U.S. results, with all eyes on Morgan Stanley after Goldman Sachs reported a surge in profits on strong trading gains. The dollar index climbed 0.3 percent. An unexpected fall in British inflation to a one-year low weighed on the pound and pushed up the FTSE 100 stock index. The figures could lead investors to pull back bets that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in May. While investors were refocusing on fundamentals after weeks dominated by geopolitical tensions, the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers showed signs of caution. Investors cut their equity allocation to an 18-month low and increased their cash balances, while reducing their exposure to the highly-valued tech sector. “Just like they were chasing the market up in January, investors have gradually started to sell,” said Clark Fenton, chief investment officer at Agilis Investment Management. “I think that gives the market scope to rally a bit more as positioning has lightened up.” TRANS-ATLANTIC YIELD GAP WIDENS, CURRENCIES MUTED Fund managers named the threat of trade war as the biggest “tail risk” in BAML’s survey, while they were less concerned about inflation causing convulsions in bond markets. Monetary tightening, proceeding at a different pace on either side of the Atlantic, was making its mark on bond markets. The gap between U.S. and German two-year bonds reached its widest in nearly 30 years, reflecting the diverging monetary policy outlook. “In some ways I am sort of surprised that it hasn’t mattered more,” said Fenton, referring to the trans-Atlantic divergence. “I would have thought it would have helped European equity prices more on a relative basis.” The gap between U.S. two-year and 10-year government bond yields widened slightly in early trading, having fallen to a low of 41.8 basis points overnight. “I would worry if [the curve] got inverted,” said Fenton, adding: “It’s probably a bit premature to get too bent out of shape about it now.” The rise in short-dated yields has pushed the real yield on U.S. two-year treasuries above the S&P 500 dividend yield for the first time in 10 years. tmsnrt.rs/2JSYMCO Currency market movements were restrained. The euro was stuck at $1.2356, after topping out at $1.2413 overnight, while the dollar index was barely moved at 89.538. The yen, which is pushed up in times of market stress, inched back to 107.34 against the dollar, helped by signs of progress in talks between South and North Korea. Gold fell by a fraction, to $1,345.00 an ounce. Strong metals prices, boosted by heightened concerns over aluminium supply after U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminium giant Rusal, helped send basic resources stocks higher. Oil prices continued their relentless rise. Brent crude futures were up 50 cents at $72.07 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 48 cents to $67.00 a barrel.

2018-04-18,"LUANDA, April 18 (Reuters) - Angola’s finance ministry said it had requested non-financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund to help it implement economic reforms, as Africa’s second-largest crude producer continues to suffer from a lower oil price. The agreement, known as a Policy Coordination Instrument, “will help to improve the external credibility of our country with positive impact on the ability to attract Foreign Direct Investment,” the finance ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday. The ministry said it wanted help in implementing the Macroeconomic Stabilisation Plan, which is effectively the economic policy of the new Angolan government, but did not say what form this should take. President João Lourenço, who took over last September after 38 years of rule by José Eduardo dos Santos, has said he wants to bring about an economic miracle in Angola by opening up to foreign investment and diversifying away from oil which accounts for over 90 percent of exports. Lourenço is trying to resolve a dollar liquidity squeeze that has made it difficult for foreign companies to repatriate profits and discouraged many from investing in sub-Saharan Africa’s third-largest economy. On the streets of Luanda, a dollar goes for nearly twice the official rate. A devaluation of around 30 percent to the dollar this year has gone some way to closing the gap with the street rate. Angola has been trying to persuade international banks to rekindle dollar correspondent relationships with the country, which were cut over the past few years due to perceived compliance risks in doing business there.

2018-04-18,"DUBAI/RIYADH, April 18 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has put on hold privatisation plans for King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh, the kingdom’s second biggest airport, sources familiar with the matter said. The Gulf Arab state is launching a privatisation drive as part of wider economic reforms aimed at boosting efficiency, easing pressure on state finances and diversifying the oil dependent economy. In July, sources told Reuters that Goldman Sachs was hired by the government to manage Saudi Civil Aviation Holding Company’s (SAVC) plans to sell a minority stake in Riyadh airport. “Right now they are looking at the plan again because it is starting to look more like a concession rather than privatisation,” said one source familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is not yet public. Another source familiar with the deal said the privatisation is on hold, without elaborating. Neither source gave a timeline. Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the issue when contacted by Reuters. A Saudi aviation authority spokesman was not immediately available for comment. SAVC Chairman Faisal Hamad al-Sugair had said in December that the goal was for airports in the kingdom to be “corporatised”, or turned into private companies, in 2018 and that privatisation would follow later. Officials have highlighted transport as a priority sector for privatisation, however the process has taken time to get underway. The kingdom had said in November 2015 it expected to begin privatising airports in the first quarter of 2016. The airport privatisation plan is expected to move faster than those for more complex sectors such as healthcare and electricity, one of the sources said. The Saudi government has said that it planned to raise about $200 billion through its privatisation programme in coming years, in addition to some $100 billion through the planned sale of a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE.

2018-04-18,"* NW Shelf LNG close to agreeing tariff for Browse gas * LNG market seen short on supply by 2021, Woodside says * Woodside aims to slash Senegal $3 bln oil project cost * Woodside Q1 revenue up 30 pct (Recasts with CEO comments on Browse, LNG, Senegal) By Sonali Paul April 18 (Reuters) - The long-delayed Browse gas project off Western Australia has gained key support, with partners in the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant aiming to agree on a tariff by end-June to handle Browse gas, Woodside Petroleum’s chief executive said on Wednesday. Browse is seen as a key source of growth for Woodside but has been stuck on the drawing board for years as plans for onshore and floating LNG development estimated at $30 billion to $45 billion were scrapped. The plan now is to develop the giant gas field to feed the North West Shelf plant, Australia’s biggest LNG plant, when its current gas source runs dry in the 2020s. “We’ve picked up momentum over the last couple of months around Browse and some of it is now a realisation, in particular on behalf of the North West Shelf partners, that Browse needs to be the anchor tenant for the North West Shelf over the next 25 years,” Woodside CEO Peter Coleman told Reuters. The NW Shelf joint venture partners “are very much aligned now” on completing tariff talks “by the end of the second quarter”, he said. Woodside’s North West Shelf partners are BP, BHP Billiton, Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan’s Mitusbishi Corp and Mitsui & Co . Once the tariff is set, Woodside and its Browse partners - most of which overlap with stakeholders in the North West Shelf - will be in a stronger position to move ahead with planning how to develop the field. A final investment decision could come earlier than the current target of 2021. “The opportunity for us is to bring that forward to be able to meet market — general consensus now says the market’s going to be short by 2021,” Coleman said. Just two years ago, the market had been expected to remain in oversupply until around 2023, but that has changed following a sharp jump in gas demand in China. Woodside is also pushing ahead with an oil project off Senegal, where its partners are Cairn Energy and FAR Ltd , while a dispute with FAR over Woodside’s acquisition of a 40 percent stake in the project enters arbitration. Cairn and FAR have said the first phase of the SNE development is expected to cost around $3 billion, however Woodside is looking to cut that cost by “quite a lot”, Coleman said. It has invited offers for a floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) and other equipment for the project. Coleman spoke to Reuters after Woodside reported a 30 percent rise in first-quarter revenue to $1.17 billion from a year earlier on increased output and higher LNG prices. Output rose to 22.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) from 21.4 mmboe in the March quarter last year, helped by a ramp-up in production at the Wheatstone LNG project, run by Chevron, in Western Australia.

2018-04-18,"(Reuters) - An Indian push to connect more cities via airports as an expanding middle class increasingly takes to the skies is set to help propel the country’s demand for jet fuel to record highs this year. That rapid growth in appetite for aviation fuel means the country’s refiners are far less likely to send cargoes abroad, tightening markets from Asia to Europe.  Years of breakneck economic expansion have helped India become the world’s fastest growing major domestic aviation market, according to the International Air Transport Association. That has been underpinned by ambitious government plans to overhaul the nation’s infrastructure, including a push to build airports and offer airlines incentives to fly to smaller cities. “The country’s air transport sector has huge potential to grow in the long-term given its large geographical expanse and growing consumer affluence,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, a Singapore-based analyst at energy consultancy FGE. For graphic on India jet fuel demand click reut.rs/2vj8QSl Average monthly demand for jet fuel could break through 700,000 tonnes this year, up from 2017’s record 623,000 tonnes and from 566,000 tonnes in 2016, several industry analysts estimated. That would be an annual growth rate of around 12 percent, comparable to what China achieved during its main boom years in the early 2000s. India used 2.02 million tonnes of aviation fuel from January-March this year, up 9.4 percent from a year earlier, the latest government data showed.  FGE forecasts a 10.5-percent year-on-year increase in Indian demand for jet fuel in 2018, while energy consultancy Trifecta expects growth of 12-15 percent.  Under a flagship government scheme, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is set to invest 175 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) in upgrading airport infrastructure over 2019-20. “Both passenger and freight miles should benefit from the state-led build out in related infrastructure and improving domestic interconnectivity,” said Emma Richards, a senior oil and gas analyst in London at BMI Research. In a round of bidding for air routes concluded earlier this year, the AAI awarded over 400,000 kilometers per week to connect smaller cities, known as ‘Tier 2’ destinations. Top Indian carrier Interglobe Aviation, which operates as IndiGo and won most of the tenders, said new routes would include flying from Bhopal in central India to Nashik in the west.  India’s domestic air traffic for the first two months of 2018 jumped nearly 22 percent from the year before to 22.2 million passengers, according to data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The country’s top five busiest airports - Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata - handled 31.9 million passengers this January and February, up 15.3 percent from the same period last year. Indian oil refineries such as Reliance Industries and Essar Oil are significant exporters of petroleum products including jet fuel. Thomson Reuters data shows India is one of the top three Asian suppliers of jet fuel. But exports are set to slow as local demand surges. “Domestic demand growth will certainly limit its ability to service other markets in the region,” said Richards at BMI. Already, India’s monthly exports dropped by more than 7 percent year-on-year in 2017. To deal with rising consumption, India’s refineries are expanding. India’s Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals - a joint venture between Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum - in April signed an initial deal with Saudi Aramco to build a huge refinery in the western state of Maharashtra.    Reliance Industries, operator of the world’s largest refinery, plans to expand its oil processing capacity by over 40 percent by 2030.

Chinese markets struggled even as Beijing boosted liquidity in the banking system. Shanghai blue chips hit an eight-month low before recouping losses. Late Tuesday, the PBOC unexpectedly announced it would cut the cash banks must hold as reserves in a move that frees up lending for small firms but falls short of a broad monetary easing. Mainland Chinese shares buckled after the United States banned American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan bounced 0.5 percent, though that followed four straight sessions of losses. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 1.2 percent, with investors waiting for any developments on trade as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. European shares are seen rising, with spread-betters expecting 0.2-0.3 percent gains in Britain’s FTSE , France’s Cac  and Germany’s Dax . E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent after robust earnings from Netflix, Goldman Sachs and healthcare companies fuelled optimism about what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in seven years. Profits at the 48 S&P500 companies that have announced earnings so far have risen 28.7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. The Dow ended Tuesday up 0.88 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 1.06 percent and the Nasdaq 1.78 percent. “The three main U.S. indexes turned positive on the year, which seems to suggest to me that markets are entering risk-on mode from risk-off,” Kagawa said. Yet there were signs of caution in the latest BofA Merrill Lynch survey of fund mangers which found investors squirreling more funds away into cash, while cutting their equity allocation to an 18-month low. The outlook for the global economy also darkened with just a net 5 percent of fund managers expecting stronger growth in the next 12 months -  the lowest since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in June 2016. While the IMF left its global growth forecasts unchanged for 2018 and 2019 on Tuesday, it judged medium-term risks were to the downside - citing financial vulnerabilities, geopolitical strains and tariffs. “The global narrative has quickly shifted from synchronous global growth, upgraded growth and glimmers of inflation in early 2018 to a focus on tariffs and protectionist rhetoric,” said Robert Rennie, head of financial markets strategy at Westpac. “We ultimately believe that we will see a negotiated solution, but there is still a long way to go and further bouts of volatility and headline risk seem assured.” Worries about the longevity of the U.S. economic expansion were one reason the Treasury curve was at its flattest in a decade and why some interest-rate curves were starting to price in rate cuts for 2020. The air of uncertainty was keeping currencies restrained. The euro was stuck at $1.2370, after topping out at $1.2413 overnight, while the dollar index was barely moved at 89.538.

2018-04-18,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Midcat seen key for independence from Russia gas exports * Experts say existing cross-border infrastructure underused * Teregas, Enagas want to invest in pipeline plan * French regulator questions need for project By Geert De Clercq PARIS, April 17 (Reuters) - A report prepared for the European Commission has questioned the economic viability of plans to build a gas pipeline connecting Spain and France, designed in part to help reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian piped gas, five sources told Reuters. The Commission has long backed the 3 billion euro ($3.7 billion) Midi-Catalonia (Midcat) pipeline that would more than double the amount of gas that can be piped across the Pyrenees mountains that border the two nations. French pipeline operator Terega, owned by Italy’s Snam, and Spain’s Enagas want to invest in the project, which they say would give Europe greater access to Spain’s numerous liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. Midcat is also supported by European Union Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete, a Spanish national. But the project has faced opposition from French energy regulator CRE, who says Midcat would push up consumer prices without improving security. French gas network firm Engie-owned GRTgaz has also questioned the need for the pipeline. Now a study by Poyry, a consultancy appointed to assess the first phase of Midcat for the Commission, indicates the project is unlikely to be economically viable. It said it would only achieve “financially viability ... in scenarios with a tight LNG market”. It said such tightness in the gas market could be caused by a sharp fall in Algerian gas supplies to Europe, a scenario that sources said was unlikely. Experts said existing gas infrastructure across the Pyrenees is already underutilised, even during periods of high demand. “If there were a real demand for Midcat, the market would already have built those interconnectors,” said one of the sources familiar with the Poyry report. The report, which has not been published by the Commission but which was seen by Reuters, will be the basis for a Commission discussion on Wednesday of priority EU infrastructure plans termed Projects of Common Interest (PCI). The Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Poyry declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Terega said: “The project is in line with European objectives to reinforce flexibility and security.” The project has attracted criticism from politicians and environmental activists. “By pouring billions of public money into new fossil gas infrastructure, Europe would wave goodbye to the Paris agreement,” Friends of the Earth Europe’s Antoine Simon said. Spanish European Parliament member Xabier Benito Ziluaga said Madrid backed the plan to support its gas industry. His French colleague Michele Rivasi, who also opposes the plans, told Reuters: “The Midcat project is not coherent with the European Union’s climate commitments and its promises to reduce reliance on fossil energies.” ($1 = 0.8089 euros) Additional reporting by Alissa de Carbonel

2018-04-18,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will amend the guidelines for a A$5 billion ($3.9 billion) fund that offers loans to build infrastructure in the country’s north so it can offer greater support to a broader range of projects, a government minister said on Wednesday. The changes will aid a bid to develop Australia’s sparsely populated, yet resource-rich northern region, opening the fund to more projects after some, such as a proposed coal mine by Indian conglomerate Adani Enterprises (ADEL.NS), ran into political hurdles. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) was introduced in 2016, but its rules had proved too restrictive, said Minister for Northern Australia Matt Canavan. “There’s a strong pipeline of projects but it has been challenging to get them to financial close, so that’s why some of these rules are being changed,” Canavan told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio. The government will remove a requirement that means NAIF can fund only 50 percent of a project, while the types of infrastructure that can be backed will also be broadened. “The changes now make it absolutely clear that we are able to consider smaller projects, where they meet our mandatory criteria,” NAIF chief executive Laurie Walker said in a statement. Canavan said NAIF had 90 projects in the pipeline relating to energy generation and gas pipelines, transport, tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, water infrastructure and communications “I am confident that many of the projects currently under consideration by the board of NAIF will quickly be given the tick of approval once these changes are made,” he told ABC Radio. The changes will not, however, revive Adani’s giant coal mine, which has faced strong opposition on environmental grounds, Australia’s Treasurer Scott Morrison said. “It’s off the table. They made that decision. This change in no way resuscitates that,” Morrison told reporters in Sydney. Adani had hoped for government funding to help build a 400 km (250 mile) rail line connecting its proposed mine with a Pacific Ocean port. Australian state leaders will also keep their ability to veto any NAIF loan, which scuttled Adani’s plans, Morrison said. The amendments come just over 12 months out from Australia’s next federal election where the ruling coalition government will seek to win favor with voters on its economic record. Australia’s north, which has been home to a rise of right-wing parties such as Pauline Hanson’s One Nation, is shaping up as a key battleground and contains many of the ruling Liberal/National coalition government’s least secure seats.

The air of uncertainty was keeping currencies restrained. The euro was stuck at $1.2370, after topping out at $1.2413 overnight, while the dollar index was barely moved at 89.538. The dollar did nudge modestly higher on the yen to 107.25 , helped by signs of progress in U.S. talks with North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State nominee and CIA Director Mike Pompeo made a secret visit to North Korea and met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to discuss a planned summit with President Trump. In commodity markets, gold was a fraction easier at $1,344.11 an ounce. Oil prices firmed with Brent crude futures up 32 cents to $71.90 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 33 cents to $66.85 a barrel.

2018-04-18,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The city of Yanan, a major wind power base in northwest China’s Shaanxi province, has introduced a lottery system to decide which wind projects will go ahead this year, a sign that grid constraints are forcing local governments to restrict capacity. China has been aggressively developing alternative power as part of its efforts to cut pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Grid-connected wind power reached 163.7 gigawatts (GW) last year, up 10.1 percent on the year and amounting to 9.2 percent of total generating capacity. But capacity expansion has outpaced grid construction, and large numbers of wind, solar and hydropower plants are unable to deliver all their power to consumers as a result of transmission deficiencies, a problem known as curtailment.  According to a Yanan planning agency notice seen by Reuters, the city was given permission to build 900 megawatts of wind capacity this year, but 1,300 megawatts (or 1.3 GW) have already been declared eligible for construction, forcing authorities to whittle down the total number of projects. “After study it was decided that the lottery method should be used to determine what plans will be submitted (for approval) to the provincial development and reform commission,” it said.         The authenticity of the document was confirmed by a local municipal government official. He declined to give his name or provide details.         China aims to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy mix to around 15 percent by the end of the decade, up from 12 percent in 2015.  But while renewable power has grown rapidly, around 80 GW of wind capacity was still unable to transmit electricity to consumers in 2015. Wasted wind power amounted to around 12 percent of total generation in 2017, according to the energy regulator.          An environmental group is currently suing grid companies in the northwest for failing to fulfill their legal obligation to maximize purchases of local renewable power. To try to prevent waste, China has drawn up guidelines aimed at preventing new plant construction in regions already suffering from surplus capacity.  It also released draft guidelines last month for a new renewable energy certificate system that will force regions to meet mandatory clean electricity utilization targets. The scheme is expected to help alleviate curtailment.

2018-04-18,"(Repeats story that originally ran on Tuesday.) By John Kemp LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Trade and investment restrictions are proliferating around the world, driven by a combination of security concerns and protectionist pressures. In each instance, policymakers can usually cite a justification of why trade and investment restrictions are necessary. But taken together, a thickening web of restrictions on cross-border transactions is imposing a growing burden on business as well as complicating supply chains. The United States and China have threatened to hit each other with tariffs covering up to $300 billion of bilateral trade in a dispute over intellectual property and technology transfers. The United States has already imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of steel, aluminium and solar panels from China, citing concerns about unfair trade. China has responded with its own anti-dumping duties on imported sorghum from the United States and is investigating other products. U.S. officials have raised security concerns about telecommunications switch gear from Chinese firm Huawei and sought to exclude it from the United States market. The United States has also suspended export licences linked to Chinese telecoms company ZTE, while Britain has warned companies not to install any more ZTE equipment on the country’s network. ZTE is accused of violating secondary sanctions on the supply of equipment to Iran and North Korea, but there are also broader concerns about its equipment being used for spying and cyber-warfare. The U.S. government has pledged to restrict Chinese investment and acquisitions in sensitive high-technology sectors. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has already been applying heightened scrutiny to transactions involving Chinese firms. In turn, China’s antitrust authorities have started to slow down merger approvals involving western companies operating in the Chinese market. The United States has also hit Russian companies and individuals with multiple rounds of sanctions in a dispute over Ukraine. In many cases, the United States has imposed secondary sanctions, which apply extraterritorially and aim to catch businesses for transactions that occur wholly outside the country. The European Union has implemented its own sanctions on Russia, though it has generally refrained from extraterritorial application. The United States and the EU are both readying further sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic missile programme and regional activities. The United States, the EU, China and other nations are enforcing sanctions on North Korea (including secondary sanctions) for nuclear-related activities. The United States also appears to be preparing sanctions on Venezuela. Enthusiasm for sanctions is spreading, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates imposing an economic boycott on Qatar (including a secondary boycott). Sanctions represent a relatively low-cost way of inflicting economic pain on an adversary and have become the instrument of choice for foreign policymakers (“The art of sanctions: a view from the field”, Nephew, 2018). The result is a rapidly growing sanctions-industrial complex led by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, security services and financial regulators in the United States and the European Union. The sanctions-industrial complex also includes a growing army of specialist compliance firms and compliance officers embedded within businesses. In addition to the sanctions-industrial complex, a growing number of regulators and trade authorities show an increasing propensity to favour greater restrictions. The Office of the United States Trade Representative, the U.S. Department of Commerce, CFIUS, and the departments responsible for antitrust policy all show a rising preference for protection rather than openness. HIGH-WATER MARK? For most of the period since 1945 and especially since the end of the Soviet Union, the main thrust has been towards greater openness on trade and investment. The dismantling of trade and investment barriers was embodied by eight rounds of successful trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade culminating in the ambitious Uruguay Round (1986-1994). But the liberalisation thrust has stalled in recent years with the failure to conclude any new multilateral trade agreement for almost a quarter of a century. The high-water mark of globalisation may have passed. Now trade and investment barriers are rising, rather than falling. Liberalisation, openness to trade and cross-border investment have few defenders within the U.S. and European political class. Left-wing politicians and labour unions blame trade liberalisation for stagnating wages and incomes in the advanced economies. Right-wing politicians and security hawks fear liberalisation, investment and technology transfer is strengthening potential adversaries. Sanctions experts, financial regulators, intelligence agencies and foreign policy specialists all increasingly employ trade and investment restrictions as their first-choice policy instrument. Traditional mechanisms for resolving trade and investment disputes through the GATT/WTO are ill-equipped to handle the new round of restrictions citing national security and foreign policy concerns. Complying with the ever-increasing number of restrictions is becoming increasingly difficult for businesses operating across national frontiers and is causing a growing number of distortions. Setting aside the question of whether restrictions are justified in individual cases, there are broader questions about the economic impact of the proliferating barriers: (1) If increasing openness to trade and investment was a major driver of improved efficiency and living standards in the post-1945 period, does its retreat threaten to slow economic growth? (2) Can the spreading web of trade and investment restrictions, often imposed at short notice, be consistent with a rules-based and predictable trading system that facilitates cross-border transactions? (3) If the global trade and investment regime becomes less predictable, will the growth in international trade and investment slow or even go into reverse? (4) Sanctions are generally treated as an extension of foreign policy, a traditional area reserved for executive authority, with minimal legislative and judicial oversight: does that raise concerns about due process? Policymakers are rapidly embracing trade and investment restrictions for a range of reasons, ranging from trying to raise wages to protect strategic sectors and national security concerns. But their enthusiasm for trade and investment barriers arguably threatens the foundations of the post-1945 international economic system and could end up doing more harm than good.

2018-04-18,"* Nikkei leads Asia shares higher as earnings lift Wall St * Eyes on China markets after PBOC cuts bank reserve requirements * IMF sticks with global growth call but sees mounting risks * U.S. yield curve flattens as investors fret on economic outlook By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, April 18 (Reuters) - Asian shares crept ahead on Wednesday after Wall Street took heart from upbeat corporate earnings, though nagging concerns about trade barriers and the global growth outlook kept currencies and bonds subdued. Dealers were anxious to see if a surprise policy move by the China’s central bank late on Tuesday might help soothe Shanghai markets after a couple of days of sharp losses. The PBOC will reduce the cash banks hold as reserves in a move that frees up lending for small firms but falls short of a broad monetary easing. The Shanghai index hit a near one-year low on Tuesday after the United States banned American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2 percent in early trade, though that follows four straight sessions of losses. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.6 percent, with investors waiting for any developments on trade as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent after robust earnings from Netflix, Goldman Sachs and healthcare companies fuelled optimism about what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in seven years. The Dow ended Tuesday up 0.88 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 1.06 percent and the Nasdaq 1.78 percent. Yet there were signs of caution in the latest BofA Merrill Lynch survey of fund mangers which found investors squirreling more funds away into cash, while cutting their equity allocation to an 18-month low. The outlook for the global economy also darkened with just a net 5 percent expecting stronger growth in the next 12 months - the lowest since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in June 2016. While the IMF on Tuesday left its global growth forecasts unchanged for 2018 and 2019, it judged medium-term risks were to the downside - citing financial vulnerabilities, geopolitical strains and tariffs. “The global narrative has quickly shifted from synchronous global growth, upgraded growth and glimmers of inflation in early 2018 to a focus on tariffs and protectionist rhetoric,” said Robert Rennie, head of financial markets strategy at Westpac. “We ultimately believe that we will see a negotiated solution, but there is still a long way to go and further bouts of volatility and headline risk seem assured.” Worries about the longevity of the U.S. economic expansion were one reason the Treasury curve was at its flattest in a decade and why some interest-rate curves were starting to price in rate cuts for 2020.

2018-04-18,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian government expects to secure Congressional approval for the privatization of utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6.SA), known as Eletrobras, by the end of May, political affairs minister Carlos Marun said on Tuesday. A bill laying out how Eletrobras will be privatized by diluting state control with a capital increase via a secondary offer of shares is currently being debated in committee. A temporary decree authorizing the sale is also before lawmakers. Marun said another decree was being drawn up to include Eletrobras in the National Privatization Plan which will allow for the funding of studies on the sale of Eletrobras. The government hopes to raise 12 billion reais ($3.5 billion) from the privatization, which would help it meet its targets in controlling the primary fiscal deficit this year if the plan does not run into opposition by lawmakers worried  about losing votes in the October general election. Marun said the government’s goal was to avoid resistance to the privatization of Eletrobras in Congress with a transparent plan that would be “vaccinated” against political intrigue. “We will make it clear in the text that the capitalization of Eletrobras will only happen with the approval of Congress,” he told reporters. The sale of Eletrobras would likely be Brazil’s largest privatization since mining firm Vale SA (VALE3.SA) was sold by the government 20 years ago.  Eletrobras is Latin America’s largest power company, holding dozens of subsidiaries with operations in power generation, transmission and distribution across Brazil.

2018-04-18,"* U.S. crude stocks down by 1 mln barrels at 428 mln barrels -API * Supply risks in Middle East, Venezuela also support crude By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, April 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Wednesday, lifted by a reported fall in U.S. crude inventories and by the ongoing risk of supply disruptions. Brent crude oil futures were at $71.90 per barrel at 0117 GMT, up 32 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 33 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $66.85 a barrel. In the United States, crude inventories fell by 1 million barrels last week, to 428 million barrels, according to a weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday. Official weekly U.S. data will be published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. Outside the United States, oil markets have been receiving general support due to a sense that there were high risks of supply disruptions, including a potentially spreading conflict in the Middle East, renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran and falling output as a result of political and economic crisis in Venezuela. “Oil prices are holding near three-year highs (reached earlier in April) for the time being, and with inventories back in line with normal levels, the supply glut of the last few years appears to be over,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. Beyond voluntary supply restriction aimed at propping up prices led by the producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) since 2017, O’Loughlin said falling output in Venezuela due to its political and economic turmoil was supporting prices. “OPEC production is currently lower than expected as a result of large declines in Venezuelan output caused by a deterioration in the economic situation there,” he said. Dutch bank ING said in a note to clients that Brent had risen back above $70 per barrel in April “due to geopolitical risks along with some fundamentally bullish developments in the market”. The bank therefore raised its average 2018 price forecast for Brent to $66.50 a barrel from $60.25. ING raised its 2018 WTI forecast to $62.50 per barrel from $57.75. For next year, however, ING expects lower prices due to rising U.S. crude output, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to over 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd). C-OUT-T-EIA The structure of the Brent and WTI forward price curve also points to a tighter market in 2018. The premium for June 2018 over June 2019 prices for Brent and WTI is $5.5 and $6 per barrel, respectively, a market structure known as backwardation in which it is attractive for producers and traders to sell crude immediately instead of keeping it in storage for later sale.

2018-04-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Costa Coffee pledged on Wednesday to recycling half a billion coffee cups a year by 2020 and said it seeks to become the first chain to guarantee it recycles the same number of cups as it puts onto the market. Less than 1 percent of coffee cups are recycled in Britain, which has led to politicians calling for a “latte levy” on disposable cups. Britain has resisted those calls and instead encourages voluntary measures to limit cup use. Costa said there was a misconception that coffee cups could not be recycled, and that while the process was more costly, it had reached agreements with five waste disposal firms to guarantee more cups would be recycled. “We think it’s a really neat solution, because it is effective immediately,” Dominic Paul, managing director of Costa Coffee, told Reuters. “It’s not directly because of the conversations about the tax. It’s something we’ve been working on for quite a while.” Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile are working with Costa on the scheme, which will start in offices, transport hubs and other locations.  Costa said it would pay waste management companies 70 pounds  ($100) per tonne of cups collected. Combined with the 50 pounds per tonne they currently receive, it makes it economically viable for the firms to collect the cups. An additional five pounds per tonne will go to an auditor.     Costa, which is owned by Whitbread, said the costs of the programme would not be material. For the target of 100 million cups for the next 12 months, the estimated cost is just under 100,000 pounds. The goal is for 500 million cups to be recycled by 2020. The chain competes with companies like Starbucks, Pret a Manger, Caffee Nero and Greggs on the British high street, and Paul said that other firms should join the scheme. “We think our competitors should join us on this ... It’s the quickest way to get a material number of cups recycled,” he said. “If none of our competitors joined us on this, we would still do it ... ultimately that is going to be their decision.” Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-coffee/britains-costa-promises-to-recycle-half-a-billion-coffee-cups-by-2020-idUKL8N1RU5UX,18 Apr 2018,"Britain's Costa Coffee pledged
