2018-09-26,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Nexen Petroleum, a unit of China’s CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK), plans to exit the United States, divesting its stake in giant oil and gas developments in the Gulf of Mexico as trade tensions between two countries mount, three people familiar with the plan told Reuters on Wednesday. Nexen has not determined whether it will sell the assets outright or swap offshore acres with another company, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the talks are private.  One of the people said the decision to pull out of the Gulf was due to rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing; the other two did not know the reason for the planned sale. A spokeswoman for Nexen, based in Calgary, did not immediately respond to calls and an email seeking comment.  The world’s two largest economies have locked horns over trade for months, beginning with a series of levies earlier in the year, and little progress has been made in resolving the dispute.  Additional U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods kicked in on Monday, and Beijing retaliated with tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. products, including liquefied natural gas (LNG). Crude oil has not been included in the list of goods subject to tariffs. CNOOC bought Nexen in 2013 for $15.1 billion, as China mounted a campaign to acquire global natural resources. The deal gave CNOOC access to acreage in the Gulf of Mexico, the UK North Sea and off the coast of Western Africa.  Nexen holds a 25 percent interest in Hess Corp’s (HES.N) Stampede development, about 115 miles (185 kilometres) off the coast of Louisiana. The platform at Stampede began producing oil in January and has the ability to process 80,000 barrels of oil and 50 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.  Nexen also has a 21 percent interest in Royal Dutch Shell’s RDSa.SA Appomattox development, located 80 miles (128 km) off the coast of Louisiana. The Appomattox platform is forecast to have peak production of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and probable reserves of 700 million barrels of oil equivalent.  Typically, co-owners of acreage would have the first crack at taking on assets a partner is planning on selling.     Nexen has not leased any new acreage in the Gulf of Mexico since it was bought by CNOOC, according to data from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Nexen sold small acreage plots to Cox Oil this year and Total SA (TOTF.PA) last year, according to BOEM data. Nexen has not acquired any stakes in Gulf of Mexico blocks this year from other producers, according to BOEM data.  Nexen is one of the largest oil producers in the UK North Sea, according to the company’s website, and its holdings include assets in Canada, Nigeria and Trinidad and Tobago.

2018-09-26,"(Adds details on oil price moves, background) By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is not considering a release from the U.S. emergency oil stockpile to offset the impact of looming Iran sanctions, and will instead rely on big global producers to keep the market stable, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Wednesday. “If you look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and you were to introduce it into the market, it has a fairly minor and short-term impact. The numbers I’ve seen do anyway,” Perry told reporters at the Department of Energy, explaining the administration’s thinking. Oil analysts have speculated for months that the Trump administration could tap the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in an effort to tame rising prices ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections. High oil prices are a political risk for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans. The SPR currently holds about 660 million barrels of mostly sour grade crude in underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana. Under U.S. law, the government can sell up to 30 million barrels of oil, or about the amount of petroleum the United States uses in 36 hours, from the reserve over a number of weeks. Perry said that, while price spikes are possible in the short-term, “I’m comfortable that the world supply can absorb the sanctions that are coming.” Up to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil could reach markets if Iraq allows it to flow from the Kurdistan region in the north, Perry said. He also said up to an additional 300,000 bpd could soon come to market from an oilfield in the Neutral Zone that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait share, if they come to agreement. Oil traded in London fell 53 cents to settle at $81.34 a barrel on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Brent crude rose as high as $82.55, the highest since November 2014, on worries about the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Nov. 4 on Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Oil producers from OPEC and Russia met over the weekend but ruled out any immediate increase in output. The move effectively rebuffed Trump’s calls on oil producers to take action. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday he does not influence oil prices, after Trump called on OPEC to bring down the cost of fuel. The White House has said it wants Iran’s oil consumers to cut their purchases to zero. But there are expectations that the administration could offer exemptions to countries that have reduced their intake. Perry said he thought the sanctions could be carried out on a “graduated” basis, apparently meaning limits on purchases could increase over time, but he did not offer further details.

2018-09-26,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department is “pleased” with the new domestic solar panel manufacturing investments announced since President Donald Trump imposed hefty import tariffs earlier this year, but continued investment could depend on the outcome of ongoing trade talks, a trade official said on Wednesday. Solar companies including SunPower Corp (SPWR.O), China’s JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd (JKS.N), and Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS Co Ltd HQCL.O have all announced investments in U.S. manufacturing since Trump imposed the 30 percent tariff on imports in January. Trump’s move was intended to beef up domestic production but has also slowed the pace of domestic solar installations by pushing up costs. “We’re very pleased to see all these announcements,” Cora Dickson, the Commerce Department’s senior renewable energy specialist, said at the Solar Power International trade show in Anaheim, California. Dickson said “many factors” would impact any further announcements, however, including ongoing negotiations with Canada and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Those negotiations could affect the flow of components and finished products across borders and alter the economics of U.S. manufacturing of solar panels. “Obviously, free trade is wonderful, and the flow of trade and the whole supply chain and global supply chain right now is being sort of disrupted and shifting around,” Dickson said. “You have to think about alternatives. But the end goal is to get China to play fair.”  Dickson noted that all of the new domestic solar capacity was for panel assembly and not the solar cells that are put together to make panels. “We were hoping to see a resurgence in the cells. It hasn’t happened yet,” she said.  Solar cell manufacturing takes more time to set up than panel assembly, and a large share of cell imports - 2.5 gigawatts a year - are exempt from the tariffs. Trump’s levy on solar panel imports in January was aimed at reversing years of decline in U.S. solar manufacturing under competition from cheaper Asian output. But most of the solar industry lobbied against a tariff, saying it would drive up the cost of solar panels and hurt the industry’s robust job growth. Many solar companies have requested exemptions from the tariffs, and the Commerce Department last week granted seven of those requests, Dickson said. More decisions on exemptions will be made “in due course,” she added, without being specific.

Asked at an event in New York when it could be established, Mogherini said: “I believe before November.” Asked if the United States’ pulling out of the Iran deal could be a serious challenge to the U.S. dollar as reserve currency in the context of the creation of the SPV, Mogherini said “it is still an initial stage, but this could be a result of that. For sure, it has made us and other parts of the world wonder what kind of (financial) autonomy we have.” Even as she said she continues to consider the United States the EU’s strongest ally, Mogherini said “no sovereign country or organization can accept that somebody else decides with whom you are allowed to do trade with.” European diplomats have previously described the SPV proposal as a means to create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands.

2018-09-26,"Sept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. nuclear power generators urged the federal government against taking action in a dispute over imported uranium, arguing tariffs or quotas would increase costs for the struggling industry and possibly cause some reactors to shut, according to a statement emailed on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Commerce launched a “Section 232” investigation into uranium imports in July following complaints by two U.S. uranium mining companies, Ur-Energy Inc and Energy Fuels Inc, that subsidized foreign competitors have caused them to cut capacity and lay off workers. The move is a double-edged sword for President Donald Trump. While it helps domestic uranium producers by targeting importers, it undercuts the administration’s efforts to give a boost to U.S. nuclear power operators, who would see their fuel costs increase. “Imposing additional regulatory burdens on the already struggling nuclear energy industry will put 100,000 good paying domestic jobs and careers at risk and is inconsistent with President Trump’s and the Department of Energy’s policy pronouncements,” David Tamasi, spokesperson for nuclear group, called the Ad Hoc Utilities Group (AHUG), said in a statement. The White House has been trying to find a way to prevent additional coal and nuclear plants from shutting, which the administration see as vital for national energy security, as they struggle to compete with cheaper alternatives like natural gas and renewable generation. Uranium is used in the U.S. nuclear arsenal and powers the Navy’s nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines, along with 98 U.S. commercial nuclear reactors that produce 20 percent of the electricity consumed in the country. The nuclear industry said a diverse uranium supply is essential to keep that power flowing. In 2017, about 58 percent of the U.S. uranium supply came from the United States, Canada and Australia, with the rest coming from Russia (16 percent), Kazakhstan (11 percent), Uzbekistan (5 percent), Namibia (5 percent), South Africa (2 percent) and Niger (2 percent), according to the nuclear power group. Officials at Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels Inc were not immediately available for comment. The investigation, which the Commerce Department said on Wednesday is still ongoing, is one of several launched by the Trump administration under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, previously a seldom-invoked Cold War-era law. Probes on steel and aluminum imports have led to tariffs and quotas on the metals, prompting retaliation from trading partners including Canada, Mexico and the European Union.

2018-09-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Wednesday after U.S. data showed a surprise build in domestic crude inventories, but an impending drop in Iranian exports kept Brent futures above $80 a barrel and on track for a fifth straight quarterly gain. Global benchmark Brent LCOc1 fell 53 cents to settle at $81.34 a barrel. On Tuesday, Brent rose as high as $82.55, the highest since November 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures lost 71 cents to settle at $71.57 a barrel. U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose 1.9 million barrels in the week to Sept. 21, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. Analysts had expected a decrease of 1.3 million barrels. Refinery crude runs USOICR=ECI fell by 901,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed.  “We are reluctant to read much into today’s price action or the unexpected crude build per the EIA. The complex had a strong upside run and is entitled to a correction,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Investors kept a close eye on impending U.S. sanctions affecting Iran’s petroleum sector, due to come into force in November.  The oil market is bracing for a hit to global supplies from the sanctions. Brent remains on course for its fifth consecutive quarterly increase, the longest stretch since early 2007 when a six-quarter run led to a record-high price of $147.50 a barrel. Several big buyers, such as a number of Indian refiners, have signaled they will wind down purchases of Iranian crude but the impact on global markets is not yet clear. U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to reassure consumers and investors that enough supply will remain in the oil market and have pushed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to raise output. In a Tuesday speech at the United Nations, Trump reiterated calls on OPEC to pump more oil, accused Iran of sowing chaos and promised further sanctions on the country. The so-called “OPEC+” group, which includes non-OPEC members such as Russia, met over the weekend but decided not to boost output. Commerzbank said in a note that “the latest rise in oil prices is due primarily to Trump himself. ... he has focused the market’s attention on the Iran sanctions again, even though the market is adequately supplied at present thanks to the increase in OPEC and Russian production.” A Nigerian oil industry official said OPEC will act to balance the market after oil prices hit a four-year high, but its options may be limited by available spare capacity.

2018-09-26,"OSLO (Reuters) - Danske Commodities, one of Denmark’s largest commodity traders, has reduced its trading position on Nasdaq’s (NDAQ.O) Nordic power exchange after one trader’s default left a 114 million euro (101 million pounds) hole in Nasdaq’s clearing house buffers. Separately, Norway’s Eidsiva Energi and Denmark’s EWII said they were talking internally about leaving Nasdaq’s Nordic clearing house operation. Danske Commodities, which agreed in July to a takeover by Norwegian oil firm Equinor (EQNR.OL) pending regulatory approval, said Norwegian trader Einar Aas’ default on Sept. 10 had hit market liquidity. Aas, a veteran derivatives trader, made large bets on the power market. His default triggered a demand to replenish buffers and post increased cash guarantees that all market participants must have to trade on the exchange.  In addition, traded electricity volumes have fallen by two-thirds since a 2002 peak, making the market less liquid and thus less attractive and riskier for traders. (Graphic: reut.rs/2xBrdRp) “We have sized our position down by 30 to 40 percent,” Tor Mosegaard, Danske Commodities head of power markets, told Reuters without giving a value for its total position. “Depending on how liquidity on the market evolves, we may downsize it further.”  “The biggest liquidity provider (Aas) defaulted and that created a lot of illiquid products,” he added. “We can’t leave a big position in the market ... We need to close it, we need to size down our mandate on Nasdaq.” Danske Commodities trades on Nasdaq’s Nordic commodities exchange to hedge against German power prices, which it trades on Nasdaq’s rival exchange, EEX. “We use EEX in all our German products. If liquidity picks up in its Nordic products we will follow and quit Nasdaq. We will not be the first movers but we will follow,” said Mosegaard. Nasdaq declined to comment on Danske Commodities’ decision. Reuters contacted more than twenty companies, a majority of which said they expected liquidity to decrease further as a result of Aas’ default and the higher collateral they are now asked to pay. “I know that liquidity is gone... It increases the risk in swings (in the market), if you want to get out of the market, you can’t,” said the head of trading at a Nordic trading firm, who declined to be named. Eidsiva Energi, Norway’s fifth-largest power firm by number of customers, and Denmark’s EWII, which posted revenues of 200 million euros last year, said they would soon decide whether to stop clearing power trades via Nasdaq.  They will continue to use Nasdaq to trade Nordic power contracts, but could use banks instead of Nasdaq’s clearing house for that function.      The clearing house, which is run by Nasdaq to ensure that electricity contracts traded on the company’s Nordic commodities exchange are completed on time, forced members to replenish funds lost when Aas ran out of cash on Sept. 10. “We are discussing leaving Nasdaq Clearing and clearing through banks ... because of the collateral cost,” Staale Stoerdal, a corporate adviser at Eidsiva Energi [EIDEH.UL] told Reuters. Oliver Wolgast, EWII’s senior director for renewables, trading and consulting, said the company would decide within a few weeks whether to leave Nasdaq’s clearing house. “Quitting as a direct clearing member and going to clear through banks is on the table after what happened,” he said. Nasdaq said it continued to have an open dialogue with the 166 members of its Nordic clearing house.  “Nasdaq has been supporting a General Clearing Model for our Commodities Market for many years, and we support any member’s decisions to change their clearing model,” said a Nasdaq spokesman. Rival trading platform EEX is the dominant exchange in European power markets and stands to benefit. Other exchanges include CME and ICE (ICE.N). “After what happened with Aas, a number of members of Nasdaq asked for information to join, or increase their position with, EEX,” EEX’s Nordics chief, Heine Roenningen said. Six traders told Reuters they were considering joining, or trading more, on EEX. Five declined to be named as the topic is sensitive. Three of the six traders already had an account with EEX and could increase trading there, while the other three said they may join EEX and move most, if not all of their activity, there.  To reduce risk and restore trust after Aas’ default, Nasdaq raised initial margin levels and said it was considering lowering the maximum allowed positions in the Nordics. The estimated margin level on a Nordic 2019 power year contract was around 8.9 percent and is 10.1 percent now. For German power, the margin levels were 7.9 percent before and 9.9 percent after, Nasdaq said. Trading firms who already clear through banks said they expected banks to raise their fees as a result of the firms’  default-related losses and the higher collateral they are now asked to post. SEB (SEBa.ST) and ABN AMRO (ABNd.AS), which clear trades with Nasdaq told Reuters they were considering the possibility of raising their fees, among other options. “We will have a discussion with the members clearing through us and Nasdaq. One possible outcome after assessing the risk could be raising the cost of clearing fees,” said SEB (SEBa.ST) spokesman Frank Hojem.

2018-09-26,"* QP announces new increase in LNG output capacity * New project to be completed by end 2023, early 2024 * Plan will strengthen Qatar amid row with Gulf neighbours * (Adds details on foreign companies in paragraph 15) By Hadeel Al Sayegh DUBAI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Qatar announced plans on Wednesday to boost its liquefied natural gas (LNG) production capacity, which will put the tiny state on a par with top energy exporters in an apparent show of strength amid a protracted political row with Gulf neighbours. Qatar is one of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting countries’ smallest producers but is also one of the most influential players in the global LNG market due to its massive output capacity and gas reserves. Qatar Petroleum (QP), the world’s top supplier of LNG, said it was adding a fourth LNG production line to raise its output capacity from the North Field, to 110 million tonnes a year. This is an increase of around 43 percent from its current production capacity of 77 million tonnes a year. “Based on the good results obtained through recent additional appraisal and testing, we have decided to add a fourth LNG mega train,” Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the CEO of the state energy giant, said in a statement. “This will increase Qatar’s total production capacity from 4.8 to 6.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.” Russia, a major oil and gas producer, pumps around 11 million barrels of crude per day, while Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, produces about 10.5 million bpd of crude. The timeframe for completion to reach the new capacity is expected by the end of 2023 or early 2024, according to a source familiar with the project execution. Additional gas volumes available for exports will mean more revenue for the state budget and more cash for Qatar Investment Authority, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, to invest abroad, the source said. “The budget surplus will increase significantly reaching almost 160 billion Qatari riyals in 2024. This would more than cover the estimated external debt,” the source said. For Qatar, which is locked in a dispute with four Arab states, broadening its investments outside the Middle East would cement its position as the world’s largest LNG supplier and help it to weather the boycott with its neighbors. In June last year, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic, economic and transport ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies. Last year, QP said it was planning to develop additional gas from the North Field and build three new LNG mega trains, hinting at a possibility of adding a new train and further boost output potential. QP is in talks with international oil companies for the new expansion project. Oil companies operating in Qatar now include ExxonMobil, Total and Royal Dutch Shell. The company will make a decision on the foreign partners by the end of 2018, QP’s CEO had said. In April last year, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on the development of the North Field, the world’s biggest natural gas field which it shares with Iran, last year and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. The decision to boost its LNG output capacity came after Qatar was in talks to supply pipeline gas to Saudi Arabia and increase supplies to UAE, QP’s CEO told Reuters in May. The plans to supply the two Gulf nations were halted due to the dispute but QP went ahead anyway with its LNG expansion instead. The new project announced on Wednesday will produce about 32 million tonnes per year of LNG, 4,000 tonnes a day of ethane, 260,000 barrels a day of condensate, and 11,000 tonnes a day of LPG, in addition to approximately 20 tonnes per day of pure helium, QP said in the statement. “Since Qatar announced its initial plan, the market environment has improved. Forecasts of future oil prices are higher and forecasts of future LNG demand have grown stronger, particularly in Europe and China,” said Giles Farrer, research director, at Wood Mackenzie consultancy. “Another train could mean another partnership opportunity, furthering Qatar Petroleum’s international growth ambitions.” (Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; Writing by Rania El Gamal Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Elaine Hardcastle)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/qatar-energy/update-3-qatar-to-boost-gas-output-in-sign-of-strength-amid-gulf-rift-idUKL8N1WC2TS,26 Sep 2018,"Qatar announced plans on

2018-09-26,"(Adds labour minister comment) ABUJA, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main unions will begin an indefinite nationwide strike over the minimum wage on Thursday, after talks with the government broke down, the leader of an umbrella labour body representing them said on Wednesday. President Muhammadu Buhari’s government had vowed to review the minimum wage, particularly in the wake of a fuel price hike and currency devaluation in the last two years both aimed at countering the effects of a plunge in global oil prices, Nigeria’s economic mainstay. Unions want the government to almost triple the monthly minimum wage to around 50,000 naira ($164) from 18,000 naira. “We are going ahead with our planned action,” Peter Ozo-Eson, general secretary of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), told Reuters. Labour Minister Chris Ngige met union representatives on Wednesday to discuss the issues and threat of strike. “This wasn’t really a formal meeting,” Ngige told reporters in Abuja afterwards. “We are convening a meeting on Thursday Nov. 4.” If that meeting results in the government meeting union demands, the presidency’s economic team would need to approve the decision, which must then also go before parliament, the Ngige said. The NLC represents workers across most sectors of Africa’s biggest economy, including parts of the oil industry such as tanker drivers and staff at loading depots. Prolonged industrial action has the potential to cause widespread disruption. A 2016 strike organised by the umbrella body following an increase in fuel prices shut banks, schools and parts of the transport system. Analysts say the strike action, which comes months ahead of the February 2019 presidential election, is designed to ramp up pressure on the government to produce a minimum wage proposal. Buhari is seeking a second term at next year’s poll and his economic record is likely to come under scrutiny on the campaign trail. He won the 2015 election after pledging to fix the economy, tackle corruption and boost security. Last year Nigeria emerged from a recession, its first in a quarter of a century. But growth remains fragile and consumer spending is yet to recover in a country where the United Nations estimates that most people live on $2 a day or less.

2018-09-26,"VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian businesses could share with the government the financial burden of building high-speed railways and toll roads - projects high on President Vladimir Putin’s economic agenda, a senior Russian government official said. The Kremlin in August called on Russian metals and mining firms, which have profited from a weak rouble and strong commodity prices, to invest in projects that would help the stretched state budget meet Putin’s decrees. Putin’s new decrees set out ambitious economic goals for his new presidency - including transport infrastructure such as high-speed rail links - which will cost the budget at least 8 trillion rubles and should put the Russian economy among the top five world economies by 2024. Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov, in an interview with Reuters, said business could potentially invest in the development of high-speed passenger railways, which Russia does not have at the moment. This was a sector which could provide demand for different metals, advanced technologies and IT-systems, he said. “We are very much in support of investments by businesses. But it should be done where businesses see their own interests as well, not because someone has got on their backs,” Akimov said. A draft government and Russian Railways plan forsees the development of a high-speed rail link to the town of Nizhny Novgorod worth more than 620 billion rubles ($9.40 billion) and one to the town of Vladimir worth 200 billion rubles. Total Russian Railways development plan is estimated at 9.9 trillion rubles to 2025, according to document seen by Reuters.  “If the political decision to go ahead with this project (high-speed passenger railways) is taken, we will do our best to build up a model so that it would be attractive to investors,” Akimov said. The government’s plan for total infrastructure development up to 2024 is worth 6.24 trillion rubles. Around a half of that amount should come from the budget and another half - from so-called ‘non-budgetary’ resources, Akimov said. The plan, which he said may change, should be approved by Oct 1.   Akimov also said the government had added development of Northern Sea Route which now is mainly used to ship liquefied natural gas, to its infrastructure plan. The project will increase the capacity of seaports and the construction of a  Europe-Western China highway.

2018-09-26,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - An estimated 190,000 people have been killed in South Sudan’s civil war and when factors such as population displacement, disruption to health facilities and lack of food are included the death toll is at least 383,000, an independent study said. Fighting broke out in December 2013 after a political disagreement between President Salva Kiir and the former vice president he had sacked, Riek Machar. A U.N. official said in 2016 that 50,000 people had been killed and nearly a quarter of the population of 12 million uprooted by the fighting, which has often been along ethnic lines. “About 383,000 South Sudanese have died as a result of the civil war ... The true number may be considerably higher,” said the study by researchers at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, released on Tuesday. “While it is plausible that some insecurity would have persisted in South Sudan even without the civil war, we are confident that a large majority of the 190,000 violent deaths were attributable to the war itself,” it said. Researchers used to focus on those killed in fighting in estimates of the violence of a conflict, but increasingly they also look at how war has impacted overall death rates by increasing factors such as hunger and infant mortality. The study, which covered the period between December 2013 to  April this year, showed that most of the deaths occurred in Jonglei, Unity and the Equatorias states. The rate of deaths from the violence peaked in 2016-2017. Presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said he would check government data before making a comment. Kiir signed a peace agreement with Machar and other rebel factions in the Ethiopian capital this month. A previous peace deal signed in 2015 fell apart a year later after clashes broke out between government forces and rebels. In a sign of how fragile the situation is, government forces and the largest rebel group, allied to Machar, clashed in the north of the country on Monday.

2018-09-26,"(Adds details, prices, quotes) Sept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose last week as refineries sharply reduced output for seasonal maintenance, while gasoline stocks increased and distillate inventories fell, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. After five consecutive weeks of drawdowns to the lowest levels since February 2015, crude inventories rose 1.9 million barrels to 396 million barrels in the week to Sept. 21. The build was unexpected as analysts forecast a decrease of 1.3 million barrels. Refinery crude runs fell by 901,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 5 percentage points to 90.4 percent, the lowest since May, driven by seasonal declines in Midwest and East Coast refining activity. “The drop in refinery runs was pretty substantial, which shows maintenance season is kicking into high-gear. The drop in distillates is very supportive because that is the soft spot that people are focused on,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Oil prices held relatively steady following the data. U.S. crude oil futures were down 35 cents to $71.93 a barrel, while Brent dropped 27 cents to $81.60 a barrel. The two benchmarks have been on the rise of late due to swifter-than-expected declines in Iranian exports and notable declines in U.S. crude inventories. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 2.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a 752,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. In response to the data showing the drawdown in diesel and heating oil stocks, distillate cracks HOc1-CLc1, an indication of refining margins, rose 1 percent to $15 a barrel. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 495,000 bpd. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 461,000 barrels, EIA said.

2018-09-26,"BERLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany’s environment ministry backed away on Wednesday from calls for more ambitious carbon dioxide emissions limits for cars and vans, supporting a 30 percent reduction target. The ministry’s decision means Germany will put its weight behind the EU executive’s initial proposal in upcoming EU negotiations over the final targets for CO2 reductions on auto manufacturers’ fleets by 2030. In a clash between concerns over the environmental risk of emissions and industry competitiveness, the European Parliament and member states are locked in a heated debate over what limits to impose on Europe’s powerful carmakers. Explaining the decision, a ministry spokesman said holding out for more ambitious targets could result in an impasse, delaying the crucial climate legislation. “That would be the worst scenario for the environment,” the spokesman told a news conference. “That is why we have decided not to block the Commission’s proposal as the basis of further proceedings.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday European carmakers would struggle to remain competitive if EU targets were set at more than 30 percent by 2030.  EU lawmakers earlier this month backed a tougher CO2 reduction target, calling for a cut of 45 percent by 2030. Under a new credit system proposed in a bill to encourage  carmakers to roll-out electric vehicles, lawmakers also backed targets for zero and low-emission vehicles to account for 20 percent of vehicle sales by 2025 and 40 percent by 2030. In a new study on Wednesday, the EU’s executive branch said that while its proposed target of a 30 percent reduction would cut CO2 pollution from transport by 21-22 percent, a stricter target of 50 percent would only take the fall to 26-27 percent. EU data also showed that higher targets for zero and low emission vehicles would cost more jobs in the automotive sector. Lawmakers are set to vote on the bill in the European Parliament next week, while experts from the EU’s 28-nations are in talks to reach a common position. The three EU lawmaking institutions will then hold talks over a final law.

2018-09-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Climate-related disclosure is becoming mainstream as more firms support and align their financial reporting to recommendations by a global task force though few disclose the financial impact on the company, a survey shows. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was set up by the G20’s Financial Stability Board at the end of 2015 to develop a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities. This was partly in response to concerns in the financial community that assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate risk is not being factored in, threatening market stability. The framework, launched in June last year, applies to a wide range of sectors, including financial sector organisations, banks, insurance companies, asset managers and asset owners. In its first status report, the TCFD surveyed the disclosures of 1,700 companies and found that most were revealing information which was aligned with at least one of the task force’s recommendations. “Today’s announcement shows that climate disclosure is becoming mainstream. Over 500 companies are now supporters of the TCFD, including the world’s largest banks, asset managers and pension funds, responsible for assets of nearly $100 trillion,” Mark Carney, chair of the Financial Stability Board, said in a statement. This compares to the support of 100 firms when the framework was launched last year. While many companies described climate-related risks and opportunities, few disclosed the financial impact of climate change on the company, the task force said. Disclosures vary across industries, the survey found. For example, more non-financial companies reported their climate-related metrics and targets than financial companies did. But, financial firms were more likely to disclose how they had embedded climate risk into their overall risk management.   A minority of companies disclosed forward-looking climate targets or the resilience of their strategies under different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower temperature limit. Climate change can lead to droughts, floods and extreme storms. As such events become more common, people turn to insurance to cover the costs of damage which can increase premiums. There can also be a knock-on effect on house prices, for example, which can damage the overall economy. For oil, gas and power companies, as the world turns to a low-carbon economy, two thirds of the world’s fossil fuel reserves cannot be burnt. That undermines the value of assets held by such companies and also investments in them by banks and other financial institutions. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Bank of England said only 10 percent of banks in Britain are managing climate risks with long-term, comprehensive plans. The International Energy Agency estimates that the switch to a low-carbon economy will cost on average $3.5 trillion in investments a year for the foreseeable future. However, the value at risk of the global total stock of manageable assets due to climate change could be anywhere from $4.2 trillion to $43 trillion between now and the end of the century, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The TCFD will publish another status report in June next year which will analyse the disclosures made in 2018 financial reports.

2018-09-26,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he wanted a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the clearest expression yet of his administration’s support for such an outcome. The Trump administration has said in the past it would support a two-state solution if both sides agreed to it. Trump also said in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations General Assembly he wanted to unveil a peace plan in the next two to three months. “I like a two-state solution. That’s what I think works best ... That’s my feeling,” Trump said. Netanyahu has said any future Palestinian state must be demilitarized and must recognise Israel as the state of the Jewish people - conditions that Palestinians say show he is not sincere about peacemaking. The United States’ Arab allies are strong proponents of a two-state solution. Trump said at a news conference in New York later on Wednesday he would be open to a one-state solution if that was the preference of the parties themselves, a position he had previously stated. “If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that’s OK with me. If they want two states, that’s OK with me,” he said. “I’m happy if they’re happy.” Doubts have mounted over whether Trump’s administration can secure what he has called the “ultimate deal” since December, when the U.S. president recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and then moved the U.S. Embassy there. Trump said “it is a dream of mine” to secure an agreement before the end of his term in office in early 2021. “I don’t want to do it in my second term. We’ll do other things in my second term,” he said. “I think a lot of progress has been made.” Netanyahu said after meeting Trump he was “not surprised” at the U.S. president’s preference for a two-state solution for peace with the Palestinians, Israeli media reports said. Jerusalem is one of the major issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both sides claim it as their capital. Trump’s move outraged the Palestinians, who have since boycotted Washington’s peace efforts, led by Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally. It regards all of the city as its eternal and indivisible capital. Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki said Trump’s broad commitment to a two-state solution was not enough. “He has to spell it clearly... the two states (based on 67 borders), that East Jerusalem is an occupied territory. These (issues) are very important for us in order us to really move forward,” Maliki said in New York after meeting representatives of dozens of countries on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders. U.S. officials did not attend that meeting. Asked if he would engage with the United States when it released its peace plan, Maliki said: “Not at all.” “As long as he is sticking to his decisions about Jerusalem, about settlements and about moving the embassy, there is no way,” he said. Trump, asked what Israel might have to give up in return for the embassy’s move to Jerusalem, replied: “I took probably the biggest chip off the table. And so obviously we have to make a fair deal, we have to do something. Deals have to be good for both parties ... Israel got the first chip and it’s a big one.” Reporting by Steve Holland and Yara Bayoumy; Additional reporting by Michelle Nichols and Arshad Mohammed at the UNITED NATIONS, Ali Sawafta in RAMALLAH, and Ori Lewis in JERUSALEM; Writing by Yara Bayoumy; Editing by James Dalgleish, Grant McCool and Paul Tait",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-israel/update-2-trump-says-he-wants-two-state-solution-for-mideast-conflict-idUKL2N1WC0LZ,26 Sep 2018,"U.S. President Donald

2018-09-26,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ObCbGz By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Despite political support from the White House, U.S. coal consumption continues to fall, as power producers shutter coal-fired units in favour of cheaper and more flexible natural gas as well as solar and wind. Electric power producers’ coal consumption fell to 298 million short tons in the first half of 2018, down from 312 million in the same period in 2017, marginally below 2016, and the lowest since 1983 (tmsnrt.rs/2ObCbGz). U.S. power producers generated almost 6 percent less electricity from coal in the first half of the year even as total generation rose almost 5 percent and gas-fired generation was up 17 percent. Coal-fired generation declined by 32 billion kilowatt hours in the first six months, while gas-fired generation rose by 89 billion, nuclear was up by 16 billion, solar rose 7 billion and wind was up by 15 billion. Generators continued to close coal units, with coal-fired generating capacity down to 246 gigawatts at the end of June 2018, compared with 262 gigawatts in June 2017 and 273 gigawatts in June 2016. Remaining coal units are being run for fewer hours and/or at lower rates than last year, another indication they are struggling to compete with cheap natural gas. Capacity utilisation at the remaining coal-fired units was at or below prior-year levels in six of the first seven months in 2018 (“Electric Power Monthly”, Energy Information Administration, September 2018). Another 9 gigawatts of coal-fired generation capacity are scheduled to close before the end of 2020, so coal consumption is unlikely to rise and will probably continue to decline in the next few years. Most coal-fired power plants still in operation were commissioned in the 1970s and 1980s, when surging oil prices caused a shift from oil-fired to coal-fired generation. Most are now 35-50 years old and as a result of corrosion and fatigue require expensive replacements of steam generators and other large pieces of equipment. Ageing power plants also suffer from rising operation and maintenance costs, increased outages, reduced reliability and reduced thermal efficiency. Retrofitting them to comply with tougher pollution controls adds to the financial burden of keeping them in service though in many cases is not the major reason why they struggle to compete. By contrast, gas-fired units are faster and cheaper to build, cause less pollution, and can start up and ramp down quickly, so they are more flexible and better suited to following daily changes in power consumption. Technology and economics rather than government regulations are driving the shift away from coal and towards gas-fired generation. Coal-fired power plants have been losing market share for 30 years, with their share of total generation falling from a peak of 57 percent in 1988 to just 30 percent in 2017. The principal competitor has been gas, which has seen its share of generation rise from 10 percent in 1988 to 32 percent in 2017 (“Monthly Energy Review”, EIA, September 2018). Until 2007, overall growth in electricity consumption enabled coal-fired and gas-fired generation to increase in absolute terms, even as coal went into relative decline. Since then, however, power demand has flattened, while gas-fired generation has continued to grow, ensuring that coal-fired electricity generation has been steadily declining in absolute as well as relative terms. The shale revolution has entrenched the shift from coal to gas by making gas supplies plentiful and keeping prices low and relatively stable. Coal’s major advantage over gas was, traditionally, its lower price and volatility, but the fall in gas prices and increasing efficiency of gas-fired power plants has removed even this benefit. Low gas prices now hit the number of hours that coal-fired units run and ultimately the number of coal units that remain in service as they become increasingly old. As the remaining capacity of coal-fired power plants falls, coal consumption will continue to trend lower in the medium term. Unless the federal government steps in to ensure coal-fired power plants run, even when they are more expensive than natural gas, the downtrend in coal consumption will continue.

2018-09-26,"MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) is in talks to buy a stake in an oil and gas project from Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM), three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters, a rare foray into Russia’s energy sector by a Western oil major since sanctions were imposed. The sources said Shell is negotiating with state-controlled Gazprom Neft, Russia’s third-largest oil producer, about acquiring a stake in the onshore Tazovskiy project in the country’s northern Yamal region. Shell declined to comment. Gazprom Neft did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.  The project, first discovered in 1962, has initial resources of 438 million tonnes of oil (3.2 billion barrels) and 186 billion cubic meters of gas, according to Gazprom Neft’s website. It is not a major field: when production reaches its projected peak of 2 million tonnes a year, that will account for only 3 percent of Gazprom Neft’s current oil production. But the deal - if it goes ahead - would mark a return for Shell to making new investments in Russia, one of the world’s biggest oil producers which has been under Western sanctions since 2014 because of its role in the Ukraine crisis. Western oil majors, including U.S. giant ExxonMobil (XOM.N), were planning new projects in Russia before the sanctions, banking on the country’s vast and relatively cheap energy resources coupled with stable politics.  Since 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region and backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, many Western companies have suspended or quit new projects, while mainly focusing on their existing investments.  One of the three sources said Shell is interested in acquiring around 50 percent of the Tazovskiy project. The aim is to conclude the deal by the year-end, the source said. “For Gazprom Neft, it’s a chance to raise quick money, while for Shell - to get cheap reserves,” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Gazprom Neft and Shell are partners in western Siberia’s Salym Petroleum project, which produces 120,000 barrels of oil per day.  Shell suspended some shale oil and gas projects following the introduction of Western sanctions on Moscow. Gazprom Neft is subject to the U.S. government’s sectoral sanctions, which limit its ability to raise funds abroad.  It is not on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals list, which bars U.S. entities from doing business with any firm on the list.  Under a separate set of sanctions, U.S. companies are barred from helping Gazprom Neft, along with other Russian oil companies, in developing Arctic offshore, shale oil and deepwater projects.  Gazprom Neft plans to launch the Tazovskiy project in 2021, producing around 2 million tonnes of oil that year, according to the company’s website.  Tazovskiy is a conventional onshore oil project and therefore should not fall under the restrictions on shale, deepwater and Arctic projects.

2018-09-26,"LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Wednesday Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on Theresa May’s proposals, the strongest warning yet to a prime minister whose plan to leave the European Union is hanging by a thread. On the final day of his party’s annual conference, Corbyn sought to show he was ready to take up the reins of power, setting out details of what he called “a radical plan to rebuild” Britain, including the promise of a “green jobs revolution”. Corbyn also made a direct bid for the support of those outside the British capital who voted to exit the EU, often in frustration at feeling left behind by a London-based elite, saying Labour was ready to take over the tortured Brexit talks. Britain is not due another election until 2022, but Labour is preparing for a possible snap vote. May’s position, already precarious, was further weakened last week when the EU rebuffed her Brexit proposal, known as “Chequers”, which is also unpopular in her Conservative Party. Corbyn, a veteran eurosceptic, said Labour respected the outcome of a 2016 referendum when Britons voted to leave the EU, in the biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years. “As it stands, Labour will vote against the Chequers plan or whatever is left of it and oppose leaving the EU with no deal,” Corbyn told a packed hall at the conference in the northern English city of Liverpool. “And it is inconceivable that we should crash out of Europe with no deal - that would be a national disaster. That is why if parliament votes down a Tory (Conservative) deal or the government fails to reach any deal at all we would press for a general election,” he said to a standing ovation. Brexit divides Labour just as it does May’s Conservatives and much of the country, but Corbyn has tried to paper over his party’s splits by keeping open the option of holding a second referendum on staying in the EU. His words were greated with chants of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn”, a popular refrain since 2015 when he became leader of Labour, a party which seems to be growing in confidence after months of rows over anti-Semitism and other issues. Corbyn has presided over a marked move leftwards in policy, breaking with what he described as the “greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism” that led to the 2008 financial crisis. He accused politicians, including in Labour, of failing to make “essential changes to a broken economic system”. “That’s why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain,” he said. Corbyn pledged to create more than 400,000 skilled jobs by investing in technologies to cut net carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2030, and to zero by 2050 - a move the Conservatives criticised as Labour’s “37th unfunded promise”. But pro-EU Labour lawmakers said it is on Brexit where he could falter. For now, Corbyn seemed to bridge the gap between those in Labour who want a clean break with the EU and others, especially in the parliamentary party, who want the closest possible ties with the bloc, or even to stop Brexit altogether. By saying he will vote against Chequers, he has thrown down the gauntlet to May, who has promised to press on with her plan to leave the EU, named after her country residence where an agreement was hashed out with her ministers in July. With a working majority of only 13 in the 650-seat parliament and a former junior minister warning that as many as 80 of her own lawmakers could vote against it, May could have been hoping to secure some support from the opposition. But Corbyn told May that Labour would only back a “sensible deal”. If she cannot secure one, she should “make way for a party that can”, Corbyn added, before leaving the stage to strains of “Children of the revolution” by rock group T-Rex.

2018-09-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Only a small fraction of banks in Britain are planning properly to mitigate risks to their businesses from climate change, the Bank of England said on Wednesday, adding it would push lenders to take action.  The British central bank, which oversees the City of London global financial hub, said it would consult with banks to show what it expected them to be doing and said bank directors had to engage on climate change and the shift to a low-carbon economy. Governor Mark Carney, who has pushed climate change issues to the centre of the BoE's regulatory mission, said lenders had failed to grasp the scale of the challenge. (Graphics on 'BOE CHART' - reut.rs/2Oct7kY) “For banks, the financial risks from climate change have tended to be beyond their planning horizons,” Carney said The BoE said just one in 10 of banks in a survey it conducted covering 90 percent of the sector were managing climate change risks with long-term, comprehensive plans. Banks have begun to consider the most immediate physical risks to their business models such as exposure to mortgages on homes that are at risk of flooding, or to investment in countries that could be hit by extreme weather, the BoE said. But 30 percent of them still only considered climate change as a corporate social responsibility issue, the BoE said. The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee will consider whether risks from climate change to financial stability should be part of regular stress testing of lenders. “Financial policymakers will not drive the transition to a low-carbon economy, but we will expect our regulated firms to anticipate and manage the risks associated with that transition,” Carney said. In 2015, he told the insurance industry to take a more urgent approach to preparing for climate change, saying the speed at which assets such as coal, oil and gas reserves are re-priced could pose potentially huge financial risks.

2018-09-26,"* Former Gunvor employee working with Swiss prosecutor * Over $20 mln in bribes made via Semlex, others - document * Gunvor, Congo, Ivory Coast, others deny allegations By Julia Payne LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - A former Gunvor employee said he paid bribes to the president of the Republic of Congo via a presidential aide and Belgian firm Semlex to win Congolese oil contracts, according to a Swiss prosecution document. The employee said he also paid other bribes on behalf of Gunvor, the Geneva-based commodities and energy trading firm, to a state oil official and presidential aides to secure Ivory Coast oil deals. Pascal Collard, who was sentenced to an 18-month suspended prison term by a Swiss court on Aug. 28 for corruption related to these oil deals, made the accusations in a plea bargain that meant he avoided serving time in jail or paying a fine. Collard, whose plea bargain was drawn up by Swiss federal prosecutors, said managers at Gunvor knew about the payments and approved them to win the deals between 2009 and 2011. Reuters obtained a copy of the final plea bargain document from the court. It was received by the court in early July and approved by the court on Aug. 28. Swiss prosecutors have said they are investigating whether Gunvor had any role in any corrupt practices or failures in corporate responsibility related to the deals. A Gunvor spokesman said: “No member of management knew of the ex-employee’s corruption scheme or his efforts to defraud the company.” He said the firm had updated compliance controls since then and no longer did business in the two countries. The trading firm fired Collard, a trader and business developer, in 2012 and filed a criminal complaint against him, accusing him of fraud and embezzlement. Congo Communications Minister Thierry Moungalla, who acts as government spokesman, denied the allegations, saying Collard “was not able to provide any evidence. This is a baseless accusation.” An Ivory Coast government spokesman declined to comment. A lawyer for Belgian passport maker and biometrics firm Semlex declined to comment on the allegations that it facilitated payments in Congo and the Ivory Coast. The document did not address whether Semlex was being investigated or accused of wrongdoing by the Swiss authorities. The plea bargain, whose authors include federal prosecutors Gerard Sautebin and Anne-Claude Scheidegger, outlined “corrupt agreements with foreign public agents” relating to Gunvor’s business in Congo and Ivory Coast, both oil producers. The document described the payments as bribes without giving a full breakdown of amounts made to each recipient. Switzerland’s criminal code bars payments to foreign officials or third parties that have the aim of seeking “undue advantage”. Collard made payments worth more than $15 million to secure Congolese oil deals. The payments were made to Congo’s president and his family members via intermediary companies, including Petrolia E&P SA, a firm owned by Congolese presidential aide Maxime Gandzion, and Semlex, the document said. The prosecutors described Gandzion as a “public agent”, essentially a government official who was used to secure deals by gaining “undue advantage”. Gunvor disputes the prosecutors’ description and calls Gandzion a business agent who advised the trading firm. Gandzion and his lawyer did not respond to emails requesting comment. Part of the cash was transferred to President Denis Sassou Nguesso, his wife Antoinette Sassou Nguesso and his son Denis Christel Sassou Nguesso, who was in charge of oil sales for state-run Societe Nationale des Petroles du Congo (SNPC), the document said, citing Collard. Additional payments of more than $10 million were paid via another company at Gandzion’s request, the document said. Part of these monies were transferred to Congo’s then minister of finance, Gilbert Ondongo, who is now minister of state for economy, industry and public enterprise, the document said. The presidential State House declined to help with efforts by Reuters to seek comment from the Congolese president and his wife. State House said the president’s son would not comment. Minister Ondongo could not be reached. The document said that, as a result of the payments, Gunvor secured a three-year oil supply contract from SNPC in June 2010 and signed two deals to make prepayments for oil cargoes with SNPC worth $125 million and $500 million in July 2011. SNPC had no immediate comment. Collard also paid about $7.6 million to Semlex for Ivory Coast deals, with at least 70 percent of the funds going to the former head of the country’s state oil firm Petroci, Kassoum Fadika, Laurent Ottro-Zirignon who is the uncle of former President Laurent Gbagbo, and Aubert Zohore who was Gbagbo’s economic counsellor, the document said. Gunvor received Ivory Coast oil cargoes between 2009 and 2010, the document said. Fadika denied the allegations. “Petroci worked with Gunvor like all other traders and their cargoes were awarded through open tender,” he said. Zohore declined to comment. Ottro-Zirignon did not respond to requests for comment when contacted by phone. Swiss campaign group Public Eye was first to detail Gunvor’s dealings in Congo and its alleged links with the ruling family. The Swiss Attorney General has not filed charges against Gunvor. An Attorney General spokesman said “several” investigations were being conducted relating to Gunvor’s dealings in the two West African nations, including into possible failures in its “corporate responsibility”. Semlex, a private company based in Brussels, has produced ID documents in a dozen countries across Africa.

2018-09-26,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell SINGAPORE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - If there was any hope of an early resolution to the reanimated dispute between the United States and Iran, it was extinguished by the testy exchanges between the countries’ leaders at the United Nations. U.S. President Donald Trump promised more sanctions against what he called the “corrupt dictatorship” in Tehran, while his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani responded by saying his rival suffers from a “weakness of intellect.” For oil markets, this seems to lock in the loss of Iranian crude supplies when the U.S. sanctions ramp up in November, although there is still some doubt as to exactly how much the Islamic Republic’s usual exports of some 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) will be sidelined. Several traders and analysts attending the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference, hosted this week in Singapore by S&P Global Platts, expressed the view that as much as 1.5 million bpd may be lost to global markets. This is a figure well above initial estimates of around 500,000 bpd when Trump’s administration withdrew from the multilateral agreement aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear programme and re-imposed sanctions. The imminent loss of Iranian crude, even at the lower end of estimates, has helped drive prices to a four-year high, with Brent futures touching $82.55 on Tuesday, the most since November 2014. But it’s also worth noting that the Iranian situation is the latest in a series of disruptions to oil markets, which have largely re-shaped how they operate, especially in Asia, the fast-growing region that buys about two-thirds of Middle East exports and is home to three of the world’s top four importers. The first major disruptor was the November 2016 agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers, including Russia, which is largely credited for reversing the slide in prices. But the deal also affected trade flows in Asia as the bulk of the barrels that OPEC and Russia removed were medium to heavy crudes, largely favoured by Asia’s complex refineries. Initially this led to the price of heavier crudes rising relative to the global benchmark Brent light crude, but this trend actually reversed as Asia’s refiners adapted. Chinese refiners, particularly the smaller independent operators, switched to lighter grades from Russia, Brazil, West Africa and the United States, and optimised their plants to run on these grades. The loss of Venezuelan heavy crudes because of the mounting political and economic crisis in the Latin American country further encouraged Asian refiners to seek alternative supplies. The second disruptor of significance was the rise of the United States as a major supplier to Asia, with Chinese refiners especially keen on the light, sweet oil that made up most of the exports, although it’s worth noting that some heavier crude from offshore Gulf of Mexico fields also made its way east. But just as this flow was getting established, it was thrown a curve ball in the form of the escalating trade dispute between the Trump administration and China, which led Beijing to threaten to impose tariffs on U.S. crude, although this hasn’t yet happened. But even the threat was enough to prompt Chinese refiners to pull back from buying cargoes from the United States, with vessel-tracking data showing no tankers are expected in October, a dramatic fall from the record 466,000 bpd imported in June. In some ways the major surprise of the past two years is that oil markets have been able to adjust fairly quickly and successfully to disruptions that are largely the result of political decisions. The concern in the oil market in Asia is that the loss of Iranian oil may prove to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back in terms of its ability to adjust, but it’s also hard to rule out some new twists and turns in the story. How effectively will Iran be able to circumvent sanctions, will Iranian exports increasingly become “ghost” vessels with their tracking systems disabled? Will Trump realise that he’s pursuing contradictory goals in trying to choke Iran’s exports and keep oil prices below $80 a barrel, and if he does, what will he do? If oil does rise to around $100 a barrel, as some trading houses suggest is possible within months, will it result in faster demand destruction and increase the risk of a global slowdown and an emerging markets crisis? All of these factors remain in the realm of possibility, but there are some clear trends that have emerged from the recent disruption to Asian crude oil markets. The first is that Asia’s refiners have diversified their crude suppliers, and are likely to continue to take more light grades, even if heavier grades become more freely available. The second is that the consequence of these upheavals is being felt in product markets, with lighter crudes producing more gasoline relative to middle distillates, such as gasoil and diesel. The profit from making gasoil in Singapore reached a peak of $16.66 a barrel on Sept. 4, the highest since November 2015, while the margin on a barrel of gasoline GL92-SIN-CRK dropped to $3.38 on July 4, the lowest in two years.

2018-09-26,"* Chevron receives buying interest for Rosebank stake * Project is largest in UK North Sea in recent years * Sale would mark Chevron’s full exit from basin (Adds details, background) By Ron Bousso LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. oil group Chevron has a potential buyer for its stake in one of the UK North Sea’s biggest oil and gas developments, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The sale of its 40 percent stake in the Rosebank project would mark Chevron’s complete exit from the ageing basin after it launched the sale of its other fields in the region earlier this year. However, it was unclear if the San Ramon, California-based company was interested in selling out of the project, which is yet to be approved for development. “Chevron can confirm it has received an expression of interest for its share in the Rosebank project,” the spokeswoman said, without elaborating. The Rosebank project, located some 130 kilometres (80 miles) northwest of the Shetlands in seas over a kilometre deep, would be one of the biggest new fields in the UK North Sea. With reserves estimated at around 300 million barrels of oil, it could help boost the basin’s production. Other stakeholders in the Rosebank project include Suncor Energy, and privately-backed Ineos and Siccar Point, which is seeking buyers for at least half of its stake in the project. The partners are currently working on the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) plan for the field, Chevron said. The complex project is currently estimated to cost over $6 billion, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie. “If a final investment decision (FID) is taken in 2019, first oil could be in 2024, rising to around 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at peak production,” WoodMac said in a note. Chevron’s net daily production in the North Sea in 2017 averaged 50,000 barrels of oil and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas, according to its website. Chevron employs around 610 people and 220 contractors in the North Sea, the spokeswoman said.

World stocks were flat, not far off six-month highs, but sentiment remains in check with U.S. benchmark bond yields close to seven-year peaks, and as investors weigh how much more policy tightening is in store from the U.S. Federal Reserve. European shares trod water, failing to extend gains seen in Asia where Shanghai-listed shares closed almost one percent higher at eight-week highs. However, Wall Street looked set for a firmer session, with futures for all three New York indices <   up around 0.2 percent. Chinese shares rose after global index provider MSCI said it could quadruple China’s weighting in global benchmarks, lending fresh impetus to a market already buoyed by expectations of state stimulus to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. Beijing is not expected to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising interest rates this week. “The Chinese over the summer increased monetary stimulus for the system and may do more, though their ability going forward is going to be limited,” said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at wealth manager Prime Partners. Savary said markets had also been heartened by the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on China at a lower 10 percent rate that the 25 percent originally threatened. Recent data point to strong U.S. economic momentum, despite concerns about the trade wars U.S. President Donald Trump is waging. “You have economic numbers that are satisfactory... so people feel for the time being, at least, the impact on economic activity from the trade war may not be very substantial,” he added A pan-European equity index failed to build on the previous session’s gains though it remains close to one-month highs. World shares too struggled to make headway with investors keeping close watch on bond yields in the United States and Germany. In the latest hurdle for equity markets, ten-year borrowing costs in both countries have inched to multi-month highs, with the first interest rate rise by the European Central Bank now expected in September 2019, two months earlier than had been priced recently. German bonds, where many investors have taken shelter due to uncertainty in Italian markets, could see yields rise as the Italian coalition government has signalled repeatedly in recent days that its budget statement due on Thursday will not set out a spending binge. Italian yields fell as much as 10 bps on the day. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields traded around 3.08 percent, having risen as high as 3.113 percent on Tuesday, approaching a seven-year peak of 3.128 percent hit on May 18. Fed funds rates futures implied traders are fully pricing in a U.S. rate hike on Wednesday, plus an 85 percent chance of another rise in December. That expectation was cemented after data showed U.S. consumer confidence hit an 18-year high. “The focus will be on whether the Fed will indicate its tightening is coming to an end. The Fed may not do so today but I expect markets will soon start looking to that scenario,” said Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One. The Fed’s past policy statements have shown that policy makers see 2.9 percent, about 100 basis points above the current levels, as an appropriate level in the longer run. The Fed could hit that level by the end of next year if, as expected, it hikes on Wednesday, again in December and then twice more in 2019. Takei noted signs that higher rates are already starting to hurt the U.S. economy, for instance through rising consumer loan delinquencies. He added the dollar’s softness could be an early sign of growing focus on an end to the U.S. tightening cycle. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies to around 94.3, inching off 2-1/2-month lows hit last week. The euro slipped to $1.1744, not far from a three-month high of $1.18155 touched on Monday, while the yen changed hands at 112.9 to the dollar, approaching six-month lows set in mid-July. Oil prices eased off four-year highs above $82 hit on Tuesday but were still set for a fifth consecutive monthly quarter of gains, driven by a looming drop in Iranian exports in the last quarter of the year when global demand heats up.

2018-09-26,"COLOMBO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares recovered from their lowest close in nearly five years hit in the previous session and ended about 1 percent higher on Wednesday as investors picked up battered stocks. The benchmark index hit a near five-year low on Tuesday on foreign selling amid a weaker rupee and government plans to curb imports hurt investor sentiment. The Colombo stock index rose 0.92 percent to 5,887.52, pulling away from its lowest close since Dec. 18, 2013 hit on Tuesday. “Market bounced back with buying in heavyweights like John Keells which came down over the last few days,” said Hussain Gani, deputy CEO, Softlogic Stockbrokers. “We have seen some investors picking up value shares. But most of the investors are still waiting to see if the rupee is stabilising and the economic impact of rupee’s fall.” Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe said on Monday the government would take measures to impose taxes to curb imports by $500 million to $1 billion to face the currency crisis. Sri Lanka’s finance minister urged its people to buy local products and shun unnecessary imports in order to reduce the trade deficit and help stabilise a rupee currency that revisited its all-time low on Wednesday. The rupee has weakened 4.6 percent so far this month after a 1.2 percent drop last month, and has declined 10 percent so far this year. Analysts said the acceleration in the rupee’s depreciation was creating panic among investors. Turnover was 318.5 million rupees ($1.89 million), less than half of this year’s daily average of 790.8 million rupees. Foreign investors sold a net 49.6 million rupees worth of shares on Wednesday, extending the year-to-date net foreign outflow to 5.7 billion rupees worth of equities. Analysts said the recent fuel price hike also hurt investor confidence as it could hit corporate earnings. Fuel retailers raised gasoline and diesel prices earlier this month for a third time in four months due to higher global oil prices and a weaker rupee. Investors are awaiting cues from the national budget in November.

2018-09-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s interest rate hikes of 2008 and 2011 were perhaps the biggest policy errors in recent central banking history. With $100 oil coming into view again, the last thing the ECB wants is a repeat. Twice bitten, thrice shy. The price of Brent crude oil this week hit $82.55 a barrel, the highest in almost four years. It’s up 40 percent over the past year, an inflationary red flag the ECB would normally find difficult to ignore. Also this week, ECB President Mario Draghi told the European Parliament that an acceleration in underlying inflation in the euro zone was “relatively vigorous” and expressed confidence that a pick-up in wage growth would continue. Add all that together, you might think the ECB would quite readily backtrack on its pledge to keep interest rates at historically rock-bottom levels “through the summer” of next year, and deliver an inflation-cooling rate hike or two earlier. Not this time. If anything, an oil price shock of crude breaking above $100 a barrel could tempt the current incumbents in Frankfurt’s Eurotower to ease policy, or at the very least go looser for longer, rather than tighten. Firstly, the current spike in oil is more a function of supply constraints than surging demand. U.S. sanctions on OPEC members Venezuela and Iran have hit production there, while spare capacity from OPEC and its allies remains historically low, according to Nomura. The world economy, led by the United States, is growing at a robust and steady clip. But the balance of risks to growth, from trade wars to rising U.S. interest rates, is tilted to the downside. Slowing economic growth will cap oil demand. Secondly, oil prices notoriously overshoot, accelerating in the run-up to cyclical peaks and troughs. This means they rise far higher, and fall much further, than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier. Thirdly, signs of oil remaining high, say above $100 for an extended period, could squeeze corporate profits and potentially force companies to lay off workers. Rising unemployment, in what is already a fractious and dangerous political environment, would surely be viewed with alarm in Frankfurt. In short, there’s a case to be made that this would be “bad” inflation, not “good” inflation. Certainly not the time for a re-run of 2008 or 2011. (Graphic: Oil and ECB rate hikes: reut.rs/2N1TFRi)  The ECB raised rates in July 2008 as oil hit a record high $147/barrel, having doubled over the previous year. This was right in the midst of the global credit crunch: Bear Stearns had been rescued only a few months before, and Lehman Brothers would collapse a few weeks later. In 2011 oil was again above $100 and the ECB raised rates not once but twice, just as the euro zone debt crisis was bubbling up: Greece and Ireland had already received bailout packages, and bond yields in Spain and Italy were ballooning to levels that would eventually prompt Draghi’s “whatever it takes” intervention a year later. Policymakers will be more cautious this time around, not least because inflation, although at target, is lower than it was then. Headline inflation is running at 2 percent, whereas it nudged 4 percent in 2008 and 3 percent in 2011. The ECB expects its 2.6 trillion euro ($3.1 trillion) bond purchase scheme to end at the close of this year and keep rates low “through” the summer of next. The guidance on rates is vague enough to give the ECB a lot of leeway. It could raise rates in September next year, or December, or not at all, and still justifiably have kept its pledge.

2018-09-26,"* Nigeria oil output to rise by 100,000 bpd by end-2018 * Aims for 2.3 mln bpd average output in 2019 * Total launches new Nigerian grade Egina (Adds quotes, details) By Florence Tan and Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will act to balance the market after oil prices hit their highest in four years, but its options may be limited by available spare capacity, a Nigerian oil industry official said on Wednesday. “It’s obvious that if you have high prices it’ll affect demand, so you have to do some market balance,” Malam Mele Kyari, head of crude oil marketing at Nigeria’s state oil firm NNPC and also the country’s OPEC representative, told Reuters. “OPEC will do everything to stabilise, to balance the market but I’m sure you’re also aware that there’s a limit to what they can do. You must have the spare capacity,” Kyari said. Oil prices surged this week on uncertainty over the global supply outlook following U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports and also as Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate boost to output. Kyari said Nigeria planned to increase its crude oil, condensate output by 100,000 barrels per day by the end of the year, up from about 2 million bpd currently. The country’s current crude oil production is about 1.7 million bpd, he said. In 2019, the African producer is aiming for an average output of 2.3 million bpd by boosting output from existing fields as well as starting new production from an ultra deepwater field, Kyari said. Located some 130 kilometres off Nigeria’s coast at water depths of more than 1,500 metres, the Egina oilfield is expected to start production in December and its output could peak at 200,000 bpd. Kyari was in Singapore to launch the new Egina crude grade with field operator French oil major Total at APPEC. The crude has an API gravity of 27.3 degrees and has a sulphur content of 0.165 percent, a provisional crude assay from Total showed. The grade has a higher yield of gasoil and vacuum distillates compared with other products, according to the assay. Reporting by Florence Tan and Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by

2018-09-26,"REYNOSA, Mexico (Reuters) - The oil and gas fracking boom has lured scores of drillers to the Eagle Ford region of South Texas, the second largest U.S. oil patch, as new production technology opened access to billions more barrels. The play extends across the Mexican border, where its name changes to the Burgos Basin – an equally fertile shale region where the oil and gas sit mostly idle underground in a region terrorized by criminal gangs. The violence here threatens to derail the country’s first-ever auction of exploration and production rights to its shale fields in February – one that could prove pivotal to its hopes for reversing a national decline in crude and natural gas output to two-decade lows. Despite an energy-reform push that has aimed to lure investments from foreign oil firms since 2014, only Mexico’s state-run oil firm Pemex has tried fracking the country’s shale reserves, and only experimentally, even as fields that are accessible with traditional drilling methods are drying up. The nine shale oil and gas blocks up for auction are all within Burgos, in the northern state of Tamaulipas, where the Gulf and Zeta cartels have waged a war for control of drug and human-trafficking routes since 2010. As security unravelled, at least two Pemex workers were killed and 16 were kidnapped as gangs demanded protection money from oil firms and blocked work crews from accessing wells and pipelines. A manager with Weatherford International Ltd (WFT.N), the Switzerland-based oilfield services firm, was also murdered.  In April, a Pemex security worker guarding installations against fuel thieves was killed and another was shot in an ambush in the Tamaulipas city of Matamoros after gunmen fired some 60 rounds into a vehicle. The Burgos Basin contains about two thirds of the country’s technically recoverable shale reserves, estimated at 545 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas and 13.1 billion barrels of oil and condensate, compared to the 665 TCF of gas and 58 billion barrels of oil and condensate in the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Companies that are already fracking across the border in Texas would likely expand into Mexico if the government could address the violence, oil executives said. Mexican government officials often field questions about security in gatherings where they promoted the nation’s drilling opportunities to oil firms. “In every meeting I was able to attend, there were questions about security,” said Jorge Rios, vice president of operations for Latin America with Precision Drilling, a Canadian company that operates in the Eagle Ford and has drilled in Mexico in the past. “The response was not firm.”  Mexico’s energy and interior ministries did not respond to requests for comment. Pemex declined to comment. Repsol (REP.MC), a Spanish oil major, left the Burgos Basin in 2014 as the violence escalated, ending operations it began in 2004 as the first foreign firm to drill in Mexico since it nationalized the industry in 1938. The company, which has shale operations in Eagle Ford, would require “very big changes” before it considered returning to the Burgos, a Repsol executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity.   “In 2014 the situation was difficult to manage,” the executive said. “Now it’s worse.” Repsol declined to comment through its Mexican public relations agency on the executive’s version of events. Mexico’s natural gas output fell for third year in a row to 4,240 million cubic feet per day last year, increasing the need of imported gas - almost entirely from the United States - to 84 percent of the nation’s consumption. The growing dependence on foreign gas prompted the government to hold a conference for energy companies in the city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas to promote the upcoming shale auction.  The cheerfully-coloured Parque Cultural Reynosa conference centre was guarded by soldiers and police armed with automatic weapons. But inside the conference in February, panelists carefully avoided any mention of murders or kidnappings. One panelist told Reuters he had specifically been asked by Tamaulipas state officials to avoid mentioning violence. “The government was in promotional mode. They weren’t going to talk about the bad things,” said another conference participant.  Tamaulipas’ state energy commission and local officials, which helped organise the conference, did not respond to a request for comment. Security problems were nonetheless top-of-mind for attendees – who were greeted by the news of crackling shootouts in the crime-infested border city. Delegates stayed at a heavily fortified hotel and waited for rides to the conference in armoured vehicles guarded by soldiers.  In the days leading up to the conference, about a dozen bodies were left in the streets as cartel linked to the Gulf and Zeta cartels mounted roadblocks and battled security forces. Two weeks before, in the nearby city of Nuevo Laredo, a gun battle broke out within meters of where the mayor was giving a speech.  Another conference participant – a Houston-area businessman – said the Mexican government had taken a head-in-the-sand approach to the violence, one he compared unfavourably to Colombia, where senior security officials showed up at energy conferences a few years ago to reassure investors of progress in fighting armed rebels.  “If Mexico had a solution,” he said, “they would have talked about it.”  In 2003, Repsol was awarded a service contract by Pemex in the Burgos Basin to develop several conventional natural gas fields along the Reynosa-Monterrey area for 10 years. Repsol increased production at the region after an initial investment of $170 million, but returned the installation to the state-run firm in early 2014. When Repsol started, the Reynosa region was relatively calm, but within a couple of years it plunged into chaos after President Felipe Calderon went on the offensive against drug cartels. The Repsol executive said oil firms had to guard against kidnappings, extortion and having workers caught in crossfires between rival gangs, along with is now Mexico’s fastest-growing organised crime - fuel theft. The firm invested in private security, the executive said, but it wasn’t enough. “That’s what made us leave,” the executive said. A senior Pemex executive compared the current situation in Tamaulipas to Iraq and Colombia during their years of conflict, saying oil companies could operate with appropriate safety measures.  “You can work, perhaps not as efficiently as we would like, but you don’t lose money, either,” the executive said. Other companies including Newpek, a unit of Mexico’s Alfa (ALFAA.MX), and a consortium of Mexico’s Jaguar Exploración y Producción with a unit of Canada’s Sun God Resources, came to drill in Tamaulipas state after the 2014 government oil reforms.  By the time they arrived, strict protocols had been introduced by operators and service firms in the area, keeping employees inside between 4 p.m. and 8 a.m. and coordinating with the military before moving into the field. To avoid dangerous misunderstandings, cars are clearly marked with company logos and employees avoid wearing clothes that the criminals could mistake for security forces, two oil workers told Reuters. They practice defensive driving, move in convoys and are told to respond honestly if interrogated by the cartel.  Women are generally not permitted to work beyond the major urban areas. “I was not allowed to go into the field because there is a high risk I could be raped,” one female worker said.  Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT.N), whose operations include the Eagle Ford, has not considered operating in Mexico in part because of safety concerns. “The safety of our workers in Mexico would be a massive concern,” said Liberty Chief Executive Officer Chris Wright. “We’d take some of our own actions for security and guards, but maybe that’s not enough.” Reporting by Adriana Barrera in Reynosa, Mexico; Additional reporting by David Alire Garcia in Mexico City and Marianna Parraga and Liz Hampton in Houston; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-violence/insight-in-mexicos-shale-patch-cartel-violence-scares-off-drillers-idUKL2N1WC01D,26 Sep 2018,"The oil and gas

2018-09-26,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump should stop interfering in the Middle East if he wants the price of oil to stop rising, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying on Wednesday. “Mr Trump is trying to seriously reduce exports of Iran’s oil and also ensure the price of oil does not go up, but these two cannot happen together,” Zanganeh said, according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency. “If he wants the price of oil not to go up and the market not to get destabilised, he should stop unwarranted and disruptive interference in the Middle East and not be an obstacle to the production and export of Iran’s oil.” Trump, not the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is behind the recent rise in prices, Zanganeh said. “Trump blames OPEC for what he has created and caused: the rise of the price of oil and disturbance in the market.” OPEC members do not have the capacity to increase production, Zanganeh said. In a speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, Trump reiterated calls on OPEC to pump more oil and stop raising prices. He also accused Iran of sowing chaos and promised further sanctions on the country. The United States will apply sanctions to halt oil exports from Iran, the third-largest producer in OPEC, starting on Nov. 4. The pending loss of Iranian supply has been a major factor in the recent surge in crude prices.

2018-09-26,"* Shanghai shares hit 8-week high, helped by MSCI news * Fed rate hike fully expected, another one in Dec seen likely * Brent oil hits 4-year high before easing * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates throughout, changes byline, dateline,) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - A Chinese equity bounce set a modestly positive tone for world stocks on Wednesday as bets that Beijing would expand stimulus to support its economy helped offset some of the worries about global trade tensions and $80-a-barrel oil. World stocks hung not far off six-month highs, but sentiment remains in check as U.S. benchmark bond yields stand close to seven-year peaks and investors weigh how much more policy tightening is in store from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Shanghai-listed shares closed almost one percent higher at eight-week highs after global index provider MSCI said it could quadruple China’s weighting in global benchmarks. That lent fresh impetus to a market already buoyed by expectations of impending state stimulus to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. Beijing is not expected to follow U.S. Federal Reserve in raising interest rates this week. “The Chinese over the summer increased monetary stimulus for the system and may do more, though their ability going forward is going to be limited,” said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at wealth manager Prime Partners. Savary said markets had also been heartened by the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on China at a lower 10 percent rate that the 25 percent originally threatened. Recent data point to strong U.S. economic momentum, despite concerns about the trade wars U.S. President Donald Trump is waging. “You have economic numbers that are satisfactory... so people feel for the time being at least the impact on economic activity from the trade war may not be very substantial,” he added. Those factors helped MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rise 0.5 percent, while a pan-European equity index opened flat. Japan’s Nikkei touched its highest since late-January, while futures signalled a firmer opening on Wall Street. World shares stayed near flat following a weaker close in New York, as investors kept a close watch on bond yields in the United States and Germany. Ten-year borrowing costs in both countries have inched to multi-month highs, with the first interest rate rise by the European Central Bank now expected in September 2019, two months earlier than had been priced recently. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose to as high as 3.113 percent on Tuesday, near their seven-year peak of 3.128 percent hit on May 18. Fed funds rates futures implied traders are fully pricing in a rate hike on Wednesday, plus an 85 percent chance of another rise in December. That expectation was cemented after data showing U.S. consumer confidence hit an 18-year high. “The focus will be on whether the Fed will indicate its tightening is coming to an end. The Fed may not do so today but I expect markets will soon start looking to that scenario,” said Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One. The Fed’s past policy statements have shown that policy makers see 2.9 percent, about 100 basis points above the current levels, as an appropriate level in the longer run. That means the Fed could hit that level by the end of next year if, as expected, it hikes on Wednesday, again in December and then twice more in 2019. Takei noted signs that higher rates are already starting to hurt the U.S. economy, for instance through rising consumer loan delinquencies. He added the dollar’s softness could be an early sign of growing focus over an end to the U.S. tightening cycle. The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies around 94.144, just off 2-1/2-month lows hit last week. The euro traded at $1.1765, not far from three-month high of $1.18155 touched on Monday, while the yen  changed hands at 112.8 to the dollar, approaching six-month lows set in mid-July. Many emerging market currencies, such as the Turkish lira and the South African rand, also kept some distance from lows hit last month and an index of emerging market currencies was flat, having risen more than 1.5 percent in the past week. Emerging stocks rose 0.3 percent. Oil prices were supported on concerns of tight supply on U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, though they eased slightly after Trump complained the OPEC producers group was “ripping off” global oil consumers. Brent crude futures traded just off four-year highs hit on Tuesday but remained above $82 a barrel. Brent is on course for a fifth consecutive quarterly increase, the longest such stretch for the global benchmark since early 2007. “Oil is quietly driving price action in both bonds and equities, pushing up inflation breakevens and boosting energy stocks,” Deutsche Bank analysts told clients. Breakevens refer to the difference between nominal bond yields and the yield on inflation-linked bonds and reflect how investors are pricing future inflation.

2018-09-26,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) said on Wednesday an “extremely low awareness” of the seriousness of inspection standards and rules had led to improper measuring of exhaust emissions and fuel economy in vehicle models made in Japan.    Nissan said in July that sample testing for emissions and fuel economy in final vehicle inspections at most of its factories in Japan did not meet domestic standards, the second case in less than a year where misconduct was found in its inspection process. The Nissan case is the latest incident of data tampering which has tarnished Japan’s manufacturing industry and its reputation for high-quality, efficient production. Nissan, Japan’s second largest automaker, said the breach of inspection standards was similar to a case last year, when the firm admitted that for decades uncertified inspectors had signed off on final checks for cars sold in Japan. “As a company - executives, managers to plant supervisors - Nissan had extremely low awareness of the gravity of violating  (final vehicle inspection) standards and rules,” Nissan said in a statement. It blamed the misconduct on a shortage of final inspectors and a lack of oversight by plant managers, the automaker said, adding it also needed to do more training. Nissan said there were improper inspections during sample testing of 1,205 vehicles, more than the 1,171 units the company had initially reported in July. Other tests for horn volume, external vehicle noise and the aim of headlights were also conducted improperly, Nissan said. The testing was for vehicles destined for the Japanese market and did not affect units exported overseas, the automaker has said. Nissan said its sample tests would now be overseen by supervisors and managers. It also planned to boost the number of inspectors and revamp the computer software used to measure vehicle emissions. Separately, Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T) said on Wednesday it found that 6,438 vehicles had been improperly tested for emissions and fuel economy, slightly higher than what the company reported to the government in August. Last month, Suzuki Motor, Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) and Yamaha Motor Co (7272.T) apologised for improper testing, but said they did not find significant problems with the actual emissions and fuel economy of their vehicles to be sold in Japan and did not plan any recalls.

2018-09-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said on Wednesday that his plan to battle air pollution in cities by retrofitting older diesel vehicles would not require taxpayer funds or money from the car owners. The government is due to hold another summit on Friday to try to agree a way to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles without resorting to bans. Scheuer has said his priority was ensuring owners can swap old cars for cleaner ones. “My concept is currently based on needing no taxpayer money and that the car owners won’t have to pay for it. That means that German car manufacturers would have to build a framework that helps to rebuild trust,” Scheuer told broadcaster ZDF. The subject has proven controversial as pollution levels have exceeded European Union limits in a number of German cities. But the government is worried about the cost of replacing or upgrading vehicles and the impact on the country’s powerful car industry, its biggest source of export income. Scheuer said the government plan would not extend to older diesel vehicles made by foreign manufacturers, which do not fall under German jurisdiction. Carmakers and German government representatives failed to reach a compromise on Sunday over potential hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles. Friday’s meeting will take place ahead of a deadline at the end of September set by Chancellor Angela Merkel to stave off bans on older vehicle. Two government sources said on Tuesday the high-level summit would be held in the German chancellery, and both Environment Minister Svenja Schulze and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier would take part. The government currently envisages offering owners of affected diesels in 10 heavily polluted cities options including buy-backs, exchanges and hardware refits, according to a document seen by public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he would not make taxpayers money available. “I do not think that’s an issue for public money,” Scholz, who is also vice-chancellor, told dpa news agency. He also said incentives to buy a new diesel car would not be enough to tackle the problem. “When it comes to driving bans in Germany, we talk about the life situation of millions of citizens... Most of us can’t afford a new car, but buy a used vehicle,” Scholz said. “Therefore we want that there are possibilities of retrofitting,” he added.
