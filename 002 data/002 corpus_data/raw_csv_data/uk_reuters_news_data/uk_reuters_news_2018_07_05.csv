2018-07-05,"HOUSTON/CHICAGO, July 5 (Reuters) - U.S. energy, agricultural and chemicals companies are girding for a summer standoff over trade as a midnight deadline approaches for Washington to impose the next round of tariffs on a wide range of Chinese goods. Industry lobbying efforts appear to have failed to convince the Trump administration to put off Friday’s 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion worth of mostly tech and manufacturing goods from China. Earlier this year, the United States levied tariffs on steel and aluminum from China and elsewhere. Lobbying efforts are now focused on convincing President Donald Trump to not put tariffs on a second list of mainly energy, plastics and chemicals worth about $16 billion, said industry officials. China has vowed to respond to any new tariffs, threatening to further escalate the trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil and gas producers, backed a bill that would have Congress vet future tariffs proposed on national security grounds. The bill has stalled in the Senate. “We’ve had meetings with members of Congress to press the issue,” said Lee Fuller, a vice president at oil and gas trade group Independent Petroleum Association of America. It is requesting the administration “look at better alternatives than they have so far.” The IPAA favors granting more tariff exclusions to products not typically made in the United States, including certain specialty steel used in oil drilling. China’s list of goods facing retaliatory tariffs include U.S. crude oil, plastics and chemicals, all industries that have rapidly expanded using abundant U.S. shale oil and natural gas to drive exports to China. “I put millions of dollars into equipment and infrastructure on the basis of exporting a heck of a lot more to China. I’m at risk,” said Marc Levine, chief executive of Plantgistix LLC, a Texas-based plastics resin blender, packager and shipper. If China goes ahead with tariffs on U.S. plastics, it “could have a very clear negative effect on resin producers and others here to support the huge increase in production - railroads, truckers, pallet manufacturers and ocean carriers,” Levine said. Chinese retaliatory tariffs on $5.4 billion worth of U.S. chemicals goods “are direct hits” on recent production expansions, said Ed Brzytwa, director of international trade for the American Chemistry Council. “If those come into effect, we’ll have to close down plants and jobs will be at issue,” he said. The ACC opposes the Trump administration’s plan to put tariffs on $2.2 billion worth of Chinese plastics, Brzytwa said, saying: “We didn’t ask for that.” Agriculture lobbyists have resigned themselves to tariffs from China, the largest buyer of U.S. agriculture commodities, following the imposition of tariffs earlier this week by the European Union, Canada and Mexico. “We’re primarily battening down the proverbial hatches ... and hoping the administration will throw that Hail Mary for us,” American Soybean Association spokeswoman Wendy Brannen said.

2018-07-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy stands ready to ensure free navigation and the flow of commerce, the U.S. military’s Central Command said on Thursday, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guards warned they would block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz if necessary. With tensions rising over the strategic waterway, the European Union is proposing a plan for salvaging a multinational nuclear deal with Tehran after Washington withdrew, but Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told leaders in Paris and Berlin on Thursday that the package did not go far enough. Rouhani and some senior military commanders have threatened in recent days to disrupt oil shipments from the Gulf countries if Washington tries to strangle Tehran’s exports. Praising Rouhani’s “firm stance” against the United States, the head of the Revolutionary Guards said their forces were ready to block the Strait of Hormuz which links the Gulf to the open sea. In May, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs to its nuclear programme. Washington has since told countries they must stop buying Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face financial measures. Mohammad Ali Jafari, who commands the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran’s most powerful military force, responded on Thursday. If Iran cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, Jafari was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. “We are hopeful that this plan expressed by our president will be implemented if needed,” he said. “We will make the enemy understand that either all can use the Strait of Hormuz or no one.” The strait is the most important oil transit channel in the world with about one fifth of global oil consumption passing through each day. “The U.S. and its partners provide, and promote security and stability in the region,” Central Command spokesman Navy Captain Bill Urban said in an email to Reuters. Asked what would be the U.S. naval reaction if Iran blocks the strait, he said: “Together, we stand ready to ensure the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce wherever international law allows.”  The Guards’ naval arm lacks a strong conventional fleet. However, it has many speed boats and portable anti-ship missile launchers, and can lay mines. A senior U.S. military leader said in 2012 the Guards have the ability to block the strait “for a period of time” but the United States would take action to reopen it in such an event. The EU, once Iran’s biggest oil importer, has vowed to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive without the United States by trying to keep oil and investment flowing. Foreign ministers from the five remaining signatories will discuss the European proposal with Iranian officials in Vienna on Friday. However, Rouhani told French President Emmanuel Macron by telephone on Thursday that the package of economic measures failed to offset sufficiently the effects of the U.S. pullout and its re-imposition of nuclear-related sanctions. “The package proposed by Europe for continuation of cooperation in the nuclear deal does not meet all our demands,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by his official website. “We expect a clear action plan from Europe with a timetable so it can compensate for the U.S. exit from the deal.” He gave a similar message in a call to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the president’s website reported. The proposed package “only included some general promises like previous EU statements,” Rouhani said. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei set out conditions in May for European powers if they want Tehran to stay in the accord, including steps by European banks to safeguard trade with Tehran and guarantees for Iranian oil sales. Rouhani warned on Wednesday that Iran could reduce its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog if the deal collapses.

2018-07-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets in Europe and the United States advanced on Thursday, offsetting more losses in Asia as investors were encouraged by economic data from Germany and a report that its big carmakers could be spared from U.S. tariffs. Shares of Mercedes-maker Daimler, BMW, Porsche and Volkswagen surged as much as 5 percent after reports of a U.S. offer to suspend tariff threats on EU-made cars if the bloc lifts duties on U.S. vehicles. The European auto sector notched its biggest daily gains in more than two years. A further boost came from a stronger-than-expected jump in German industrial orders. “With these stories coming out, you have a sector which has been very oversold meeting some potential good news on the trade war front,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch European equity strategist James Barty.  “This is going to be the dominant issue of the summer. Are we heading for a full-blown trade war? In which case, it is very bad news for risk assets. Or do we walk away from it, in which case, as we have seen today, markets are likely to rebound quite sharply.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 181.92 points, or 0.75 percent, to 24,356.74, the S&P 500 gained 23.39 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,736.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 83.75 points, or 1.12 percent, to 7,586.43. U.S. benchmarks initially gave up some gains in mid-afternoon trading after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting on June 12-13 showed central bankers discussed whether trade tensions could dent the U.S. economy. The minutes described a meeting at which the Fed raised interest rates for the second time this year. They also suggested policymakers might signal that the rate-hike cycle was advanced enough that policy was no longer significantly affecting the economy. “Obviously that was a hawkish meeting,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “The market’s expectation always was that when we get back to neutral the Fed would stop raising rates. That’s the type of statement that will spook investors knowing the Fed may tighten beyond the neutral level.” Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.8364 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.23 percent. The euro briefly topped $1.17 and bond yields rose after the brighter German data and a report that the ECB thinks markets are now too cautious on when it will raise euro zone interest rates.[FRX/] “The euro is getting a bit of a lift on the German data though the trade concerns will continue to dominate markets with the Fed minutes being the key data point,” said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London. Nagging worry about U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade tariff plans extended a slide in Asian equity markets. Chinese shares are now deep into “bear” market territory.  On Friday, U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports will take effect. Beijing promised to retaliate but said it would “absolutely not” fire the first shot in a trade war.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.25 percent. Since mid-June, it has dropped every day except three.  Oil prices fell after U.S. government data showed an unexpected build in crude stockpiles. U.S. crude fell 1.5 percent to $73.03 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.71, down 0.68 percent.

2018-07-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell on Thursday after U.S. government data showed an unexpected build in crude oil stockpiles. U.S. crude futures fell $1.20 to settle at $72.94 a barrel, retreating from Tuesday’s 3-1/2-year high of over $75. Brent crude futures lost 85 cents to settle at $77.39 a barrel. U.S. crude stockpiles rose 1.3 million barrels last week, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Analysts had expected a 3.5 million-barrel draw. [EIA/S] “Because it’s driving season, you expect a lot of crude to go through refineries right now - so that’s why we were looking for a draw,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that public listing preparations of state-run Saudi Aramco have stalled. That may reduce the pressure on Saudi Arabia to keep oil prices high, said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. Saudi Arabia has wanted to sell shares in Aramco to bring in foreign investment to diversify its economy, but legal concerns about listing in places like London or New York have presented complications. Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, fell to their lowest level since December 2014. Flows into Cushing dropped following an outage at the 360,000 barrel per day (bpd) Syncrude facility in Alberta, which is expected to persist through July. “With those continued drawdowns at Cushing, we were approaching a situation where you could soon start to consider us nearing a shortage,” Kilduff said. The inventory report also showed an increase in imports, which “provided some relief...and showed that even with the Syncrude situation, all is not lost,” Kilduff said. Oil prices have been rocked by recent comments from President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, he accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of driving up fuel prices. OPEC, together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia, reduced output in 2017 to prop up the market. Last month, the group agreed to lift production by about 1 million bpd to offset losses from Venezuela and Iran. Prices have risen as a result of Washington’s plans to reimpose sanctions against Iran, OPEC’s No. 3 producer, analysts said. On Wednesday, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said Tehran might block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz. A blockade of the strait, through which roughly 30 percent of all seaborne oil travels, would have “dramatic consequences for global oil supply and an impact on prices that is almost impossible to put into figures,” Commerzbank said in a note.  The U.S. Navy stands ready to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce, a spokesman for the U.S. military’s Central Command said.

2018-07-05,"(Reuters) - The United States on Thursday sanctioned three Nicaraguan officials, including the country’s police chief and the head of its oil company, for human rights abuses and corruption, the U.S. Treasury Department said. The three officials sanctioned are Francisco Javier Diaz Madriz, Nicaragua’s police commissioner; Fidel Antonio Moreno Briones, the secretary of the Managua mayor’s office; and Jose Francisco Lopez Centeno, president of the state-owned oil company Petronic and vice-president of Albanisa, a private company that imports and sells Venezuelan petroleum products. The sanctions were imposed on the officials because of concerns over the “ongoing crisis in Nicaragua,” including “violence perpetrated by security forces and others that have resulted in the death of at least 220 demonstrators, and nearly 1,500 injured,” the statement said.  Under the sanctions, assets belonging to the officials in the United States are blocked and U.S. citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them or entities they own or control, the Treasury said in a statement. “The violence perpetrated by the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega against the Nicaraguan people and the efforts of those close to the Ortega regime to illicitly enrich themselves is deeply disturbing and completely unacceptable,” Sigal Mandelker, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. In 2007, Ortega’s government started receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in oil cooperation from Venezuela. Most of those funds are run by Albanisa to finance social projects and build a business conglomerate to pay back the loans. Protests began in April against Ortega’s perceived corrupt and authoritarian regime. Police and masked militias fired at the protesters, leaving more than 200 people dead. The Treasury accused Madriz of ordering the Nicaraguan police to set fire to a house in the capital, Managua, killing six people, including two children. It said police also asked gang leaders in Nicaragua to attack anti-government protesters, fired on and killed peaceful protesters. Briones ordered attacks against elderly and young people protesting peacefully, ordered violent attacks against anti-government marchers and beat protesters and stole money from Managua municipal projects, according to the Treasury. Centeno exploited government taxes and fines, siphoned funds from infrastructure projects and used his position to his benefit, the statement said.     The State Department said it would hold those responsible for the violence and intimidation campaign accountable. “These actions must end,” the department said in a statement.

2018-07-05,"(Adds background) ABU DHABI, July 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has told OPEC it pumped 10.488 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil last month, an increase of 458,000 bpd from the level it said it produced in May, OPEC sources told Reuters on Thursday. Saudi Arabia’s total supplies to the market in June were even higher than well-head production, the sources said, suggesting the Kingdom sold crude from storage. The sources said Saudi Arabia supplied 10.579 million bpd in June, a figure that includes domestic consumption and all exports, including from storage tanks. Consultants Kpler estimated the kingdom’s oil exports rose by 407,000 bpd in June to 7.62 million bpd compared with May. OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies last month to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday again accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of driving gasoline prices higher and urged the oil producer group to do more. Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud assured Trump that the kingdom can raise oil production if needed and that the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that could be deployed to help cool oil prices to compensate for falling output in Venezuela and Iran.

2018-07-05,"MALABO (Reuters) - Equatorial Guinea has granted amnesty to activists and members of the opposition ahead of a “national dialogue” this month, a decree signed by the Central African nation’s president said on Wednesday.   The move is seen as a goodwill gesture before the talks involving government, opposition, religious and other groups planned for July 16 to 21.  The decree was welcomed with caution by rights group Amnesty International, which said in a statement that a similar promise in 2014 had never materialised. The tiny oil and gas-rich nation has been ruled with an iron fist by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the longest-serving president in the continent, since he came to power in 1979 in a coup. Despite its oil riches, most of the country’s 1.2 million people live in poverty. Rights groups have labelled Obiang Nguema’s government as one of the world’s most corrupt.   According to the decree on the government’s website, a general amnesty has been granted to all those convicted of political crimes, and those currently being processed for similar crimes. It said the move was a gesture to offer greater freedom and security ahead of the national dialogue with opposition parties, civil society groups, religious groups and the diaspora. Foreign observers could also attend. Some opposition parties had demanded an amnesty as a condition of their participation in the dialogue. “While by all means this new announcement is a welcome step, much more needs to be done to make a decisive break with the country’s history of repression,” Amnesty International said. It added that a similar announcement was made in 2014 but not all political prisoners were released. “For decades, activists, opposition members and those expressing dissent have faced arbitrary arrest and detention without charge or contact with their families or lawyers, while some have been tortured,” it said.

2018-07-05,"MALABO (Reuters) - Equatorial Guinea has granted amnesty to activists and members of the opposition ahead of a “national dialogue” this month, a decree signed by the Central African nation’s president said on Wednesday.   The move is seen as a goodwill gesture before the talks involving government, opposition, religious and other groups planned for July 16 to 21.  The decree was welcomed with caution by rights group Amnesty International, which said in a statement that a similar promise in 2014 had never materialised. The tiny oil and gas-rich nation has been ruled with an iron fist by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the longest-serving president in the continent, since he came to power in 1979 in a coup. Despite its oil riches, most of the country’s 1.2 million people live in poverty. Rights groups have labelled Obiang Nguema’s government as one of the world’s most corrupt.   According to the decree on the government’s website, a general amnesty has been granted to all those convicted of political crimes, and those currently being processed for similar crimes. It said the move was a gesture to offer greater freedom and security ahead of the national dialogue with opposition parties, civil society groups, religious groups and the diaspora. Foreign observers could also attend. Some opposition parties had demanded an amnesty as a condition of their participation in the dialogue. “While by all means this new announcement is a welcome step, much more needs to be done to make a decisive break with the country’s history of repression,” Amnesty International said. It added that a similar announcement was made in 2014 but not all political prisoners were released. “For decades, activists, opposition members and those expressing dissent have faced arbitrary arrest and detention without charge or contact with their families or lawyers, while some have been tortured,” it said.

2018-07-05,"LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - Oil will soon cost $100 per barrel due to supply disruptions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump, Iran’s OPEC Governor told Reuters on Thursday, as he warned expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would help bring down prices were in vain. Trump again accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of driving fuel prices higher on Wednesday, and urged U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia to pump more if they wanted Washington to continue protecting them against their top foe Iran. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, is facing U.S. sanctions on its oil exports that are prompting some buyers to cut purchases. Iranian OPEC Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Reuters that Trump “should have expected” when blocking Iran’s access to the global markets that it would end up as “hostage (to) Saudi Arabia and Russia”, who he said had little vested interest in bringing down prices. “The responsibility of paying unnecessary prices for oil by all consumers of the whole world, especially in U.S. gas stations, is solely upon your (Trump’s) shoulders and the price of over $100 per barrel is yet to come,” Kazempour said. The Republican president has lashed out at OPEC in recent weeks. Rising gasoline prices could create a political headache for Trump before November mid-term congressional elections by offsetting Republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped boost the U.S. economy. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said Saudi Arabia had agreed to increase oil output by up to 2 million barrels, an assertion the White House rowed back on in a subsequent statement. The leader of Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest member, has assured Trump that the kingdom can raise oil production if needed, and that the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that could be deployed to help cool oil prices to compensate for falling output in Venezuela and Iran. Trump has been complaining about OPEC at the same time that Washington is piling pressure on its European allies to stop buying Iranian oil. Iran has threatened to block oil exports through a key Gulf waterway in retaliation against any hostile U.S. action. Kazempour said: “We are neighbours and will remain so, we know we can and we must live together. No one wants you (Trump) to protect anybody... You are fighting with everybody, Sir, since you came to office”.

2018-07-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and Saudi Arabia appear to have reached an understanding: Washington will reduce or eliminate Iran’s oil export revenues and in return Riyadh will guarantee oil supplies and stabilise prices. The basic deal is well understood by policymakers in both countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasising his great personal relationship with the Saudi king and crown prince. But strong personal relationships between the leaders and agreement on the overall deal obscure disagreement on some key details, not least the desirable level for oil prices. Saudi Arabia and its allies believe prices should be stabilised around $75 a barrel. Trump, meanwhile, clearly thinks they should be stabilised at a significantly lower level. Trump made the link between Iran sanctions and Saudi production policy explicit in a television interview with Fox News on July 1. The United States will counter the influence of Iran, Saudi Arabia’s major regional rival, by imposing tough sanctions. In return Saudi Arabia will protect U.S. motorists against an increase in gasoline prices. The president noted that the United States provides security for Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf countries through the presence of military forces in the region. “We are protecting those countries, many of those countries,” he said. In a follow-up Twitter message on July 4, the president said that “the United States defends many of those countries for very little $’s”. U.S. and Saudi objectives are not fully aligned, however, on oil prices. Saudi Arabia’s objective, revealed at the OPEC meeting in June, has been to stabilise production and prices around current levels. The kingdom, its Gulf allies and Russia indicated that they will lift production by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to offset losses from Venezuela and Iran, but not more. The implication is that Saudi Arabia wants to keep prices around $75 a barrel and sees that level as sustainable in the medium term. Trump, however, is not satisfied with either the current level of oil prices or the announced production increase. “They have to put out another 2 million barrels in my opinion,” he said in the July 1 Fox interview. “Gas prices are up & they are doing little to help,” he complained again on Twitter on July 4. “This must be a two-way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!” The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favoured moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country. Low prices hurt producers concentrated in Texas and other major petroleum states. From the perspective of the White House, the ideal price is not so low it causes problems for producing states but not so high it hurts consuming states. The rise in benchmark U.S. crude prices from a low of less than $30 a barrel in February 2016 to more than $70 in July 2018 has boosted the economies of Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota and other producing states. But most of those states are solidly Republican and likely to vote Trump’s party at the mid-term congressional elections in 2018. The president, therefore, is paying much closer attention to the harmful impact of higher oil and gasoline prices on consumers in swing states. The president’s repeated criticism of OPEC reflects his awareness that higher prices are already hitting a key section of his own electoral coalition. The average cost of gasoline has risen almost 60 percent from a cyclical low of $1.87 a gallon in February 2016 to $2.97 last month. U.S. motorists consume almost 143 billion gallons of gasoline each year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Most is used by private motorists, though some is bought by businesses, governments, the postal service and the armed services. Total annualised expenditure on gasoline has already risen by about $157 billion a year over the past 30 months. Every extra dollar on the price of a barrel of crude costs U.S. consumers roughly $3 billion a year, assuming refining margins and fuel taxes remain constant, and ignoring gasoline consumption by businesses and the like. Rising gasoline prices have a similar impact to a personal tax increase and have already countered much of the benefit from individual income tax cuts passed at the end of 2017. If the impact on consumer finances still seems small, a better way to understand the effect is to put the price impact on the same basis as the announced tax cuts. U.S. budget analysts generally look at the impact of tax changes over a ten-year period (“Estimated budget effects of the conference agreement for HR 1”, Joint Committee on Taxation, Dec. 18, 2017). The tax cuts approved at the end of 2017 were estimated to reduce individual income taxes by a little more than $1.1 trillion over ten years.  By comparison, the rise in oil prices since the start of 2016 is the equivalent of a tax increase of almost $1.6 trillion over the next decade. The net impact of higher oil prices on the economy as a whole is obviously smaller because much of the extra revenue will be received by domestic oil producers. But producers and consumers are not the same, and the redistribution of income has real economic and political consequences. For many households, the gains from cuts passed last year have been offset by the rise in oil prices since 2016. While tax cuts went mostly to individuals in the upper income ranges, the burden of higher gasoline prices will be felt mostly by individuals on lower incomes because they spend a higher proportion of their earnings on fuel. (“Distribution effects of the conference agreement for HR 1”, JCT, Dec. 18, 2017). With critical elections ahead, the president has to be sensitive to the financial impact of higher fuel prices on swing voters, which is why he is pressing OPEC and Saudi Arabia to boost output enough to lower them. — John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-07-05,"(Adds details, quotes, price movements) July 5 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles unexpectedly rose last week ,as imports grew and refineries cut output while gasoline inventories decreased nearly double forecasts, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Crude inventories rose 1.2 million barrels in the week to June 29, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 3.5 million barrels. Oil prices dropped on the news, in part because the figures were the inverse of the drop in inventories shown by industry group the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday. U.S. crude futures dropped 90 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $73.22 per barrel as of 11:18 a.m. EST (1518 GMT). Brent crude lost 38 cents to $77.84 a barrel. “The headline number caught people by surprise and leaning a little bit. And that’s the reason for the big downward reaction,” said Phil Flynn, trader at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for futures fell heavily by 2.1 million barrels, EIA said, dropping overall inventories at the key storage hub to their lowest level since 2014. The recent declines in Cushing are in part due to the outage at a Syncrude facility in Canada, limiting the flows into the Oklahoma hub. Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 1.4 million barrels per day. U.S. production remained steady at 10.9 million bpd for a third week in a row. Refinery crude runs fell by 163,000 bpd, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 0.4 percentage point to 97.1 percent of total capacity. Gasoline stocks fell 1.5 million barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 817,000-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 134,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 545,000-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2018-07-05,"NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - Stock markets in Europe and the U.S. advanced on Thursday as reassuring economic data from Germany and a report that its big carmakers could be spared from U.S. tariffs offset another gloomy session for Asia. Shares of Mercedes-maker Daimler, BMW, Porsche and Volkswagen surged as much as 5 percent after reports of a U.S. offer to suspend tariff threats on EU-made cars if the bloc lifts duties on U.S. vehicles. That fueled wider gains, with the European auto sector enjoying its best day in more than two years. The mood was also helped by a stronger-than-expected jump in German industrial orders after four months of declines. “With these stories coming out (about car tariffs), you have a sector which has been very oversold meeting some potential good news on the trade war front,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch European equity strategist James Barty. “This is going to be the dominant issue of the summer. Are we heading for a full-blown trade war? In which case, it is very bad news for risk assets; or do we walk away from it, in which case, as we have seen today, markets are likely to rebound quite sharply.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 74.82 points, or 0.31 percent, to 24,249.64, the S&P 500 gained 8.18 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,721.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.23 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,527.90. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.23 percent. The euro briefly topped $1.17 and bond yields rose after the brighter German data and a report that the ECB thinks markets are now too cautious on when it will raise euro zone interest rates next year. Later in the day, traders will get the minutes from last month’s U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting, when it raised U.S. rates for a second time this year. “The euro is getting a bit of a lift on the German data though the trade concerns will continue to dominate markets with the Fed minutes being the key data point,” said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London. Persisting concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade tariff plans extended a recent slide in Asian equity markets overnight, in particular Chinese shares which are now deep into “bear” market territory. On Friday, U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports will take effect. Beijing promised to retaliate in kind, though it said it would “absolutely not” fire the first shot in a trade war. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which has dropped every day except three since mid-June, ended down 0.25 percent. In commodities, Brent oil futures U.S. crude rose 0.03 percent to $74.16 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.38, up 0.18 percent, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump sent a tweet demanding that OPEC reduce prices for crude. Brent had risen on Wednesday on a threat from an Iranian commander to disrupt oil shipments from neighboring states if Washington continued to press all countries to stop buying Iranian oil, and a drop in U.S. crude inventories.

2018-07-05,"(Adds crude export data) LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - With a third of the world’s sea-borne oil passing through it every day, the Strait of Hormuz is a strategic artery linking Middle East crude producers to key markets in Asia Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond. This week, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander threatened that Tehran will block oil shipments through the waterway in response to U.S. calls to ban all Iranian oil exports. The Strait has been at the heart of regional tensions for decades and this is not first time that Tehran has made such threats. * It is a waterway separating Iran and Oman, connecting the Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. * It is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, but the shipping lane is only two miles wide in either direction. WHY IT MATTERS? * The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates a record 18.5 million barrels per day of sea-borne oil passed through it in 2016, a 9 percent increase on flows in 2015 which accounted for 30 pct of all sea-borne traded crude oil and other liquids during the year. * Sea-borne crude and condensate flows transiting the Strait are estimated at around 17.2 million bpd in 2017 and around 17.4 million bpd in the first half of 2018, according to oil analytics firm Vortexa. * Most of the crude exported from Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq passes through it. It is also the route for nearly all the liquefied natural gas (LNG) from lead exporter Qatar. * Throughout the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) the two sides sought to disrupt each other’s oil exports in what was known as the Tanker War. * The U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is tasked with protecting the commercial ships in the area. * Energy consultants Petromatrix who track U.S. aircraft carriers in the region say there are currently no carriers in the Arabian Gulf. They add the carrier that could have made the short trip to the Gulf from the eastern Mediterranean, turned around to sail back to the Atlantic. * “Under the Bush administration there was always one to two carriers in the Arab Gulf, under the Obama administration there were some short times when the Arabian Gulf was left with no carriers but that was gestures made while the U.S. was negotiating with Iran,” the said on July 5 PIPELINE ALTERNATIVES * The UAE and Saudi Arabia have sought to find alternatives to bypass the strait. The following EIA table shows those pipeline projects. INCIDENTS IN THE STRAIT * In July 1988 the U.S. warship Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner, killing all 290 on-board, in what Washington said was an accident after crew mistook the plane for a fighter. Tehran called it a deliberate attack. The U.S. said the Vincennes was in the area to protect neutral vessels against Iranian navy attacks. * In early 2008 the United States said Iranian boats had threatened its warships after they approached three U.S. naval ships in the Strait. * In June 2008, Revolutionary Guards commander-in-chief, Mohammad Ali Jafari, said Iran would impose controls on shipping in the Strait if it was attacked. * In July 2010 a Japanese oil tanker called M Star was attacked in the Strait. A militant group called Abdullah Azzam Brigades, which is linked to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility. * In January 2012, Iran threatened to block the Strait in retaliation for U.S. and European sanctions that targeted its oil revenues in an attempt to stop the nuclear program. * In May 2015, Iranian ships fired shots at a Singapore-flagged tanker which it said damaged an Iranian oil platform, causing the vessel to flee, and seized a container ship in the Strait. * On July 3, 2018, President Hassan Rouhani hinted Iran could disrupt oil flows through the Strait in response to U.S. calls to bring down Iran’s oil exports to zero. * The following day, a Revolutionary Guards commander spelled out that Iran would block all exports through the Strait if Iranian exports are stopped Sources: Reuters/Energy Information Administration Reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar; Editing by Kirsten Donovan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-oil/factbox-strait-of-hormuz-the-worlds-most-important-oil-artery-idUKL8N1U13OA,05 Jul 2018,"With a third of the world's

Energean, which listed on London’s main stock exchange this year, has committed $1.6 billion to the Karish and Tanin fields which have potential reserves of 2.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 32.8 million barrels of light oil and condensate. It estimates the five blocs it owns around Karish and Tanin contain an additional 5 trillion cubic feet of gas. It expects an external assessment over the coming weeks. “We submitted a proposal to sell gas from the FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading facility) to Cyprus. We sent it last week,” CEO Mathios Rigas told Reuters. The company has signed gas supply agreements in Israel for about 4.2 billion cubic metres of gas a year. Energean is positioning itself in the eastern Mediterranean with a newly built FPSO facility with capacity of 800 million cubic feet a day and liquids capacity of 800,000 barrels. It wants to build a 200 km (124 miles) pipeline from the FPSO to Cyprus. Cyprus’ Energy Minister was not immediately available for comment. Energean will also bid for further supply contracts in Israel, which is privatising a gas-run power plant in Alon Tavor, and additional contracts once the country switches from coal to gas plants by 2022, Rigas said.

2018-07-05,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s nuclear plants are a safety threat because of their excessive reliance on outsourcing, the risk of terror attacks and a lack of operational rigour, a parliament report said.  France is the world’s most nuclear-reliant country, with state-owned EDF generating 75 percent of its power from 58 ageing nuclear reactors spread around the country, many of which have suffered safety scares in recent years.  Following a string of nuclear plant break-ins by Greenpeace militants, aimed at highlighting the vulnerability of EDF’s reactors, the French parliament launched an investigation into nuclear security in February.  “Nuclear plants are not chocolate factories... this is a dangerous activity,” report coordinator Barbara Pompili said. She said an excessive reliance on outsourcing, with up to 80 percent of maintenance handled by contractors, was leading to a loss of internal competence at the utility.  EDF has had to close several reactors and delay the opening of a new one because of quality issues with some suppliers.  The falsification of manufacturing documentation at the Creusot foundry of EDF supplier Areva - now bought up by EDF and renamed Framatome - has led to temporary plant closures and an ongoing investigation.  EDF is also waiting for the results of an inquiry into faulty weldings executed by a subcontractor at a nuclear plant under construction in Flamanville, in northwest France.  The report blamed the fall of a 450-tonne steam generator during maintenance at EDF’s Paluel 2 reactor on problems with cooperation between EDF and its subcontractors. Paluel 2 has been offline since the May 2015 incident.  EDF denied it was over-reliant on subcontractors. “A large part of the maintenance on our reactors is done by the firms who have produced their components, they know these parts better than anyone else,” Dominique Miniere, the head of EDF’s reactor fleet, told reporters.  The report criticised the industry’s “ruling out rupture” concept - the assumption that key nuclear components are made so well that malfunctioning can be ruled out.  “There are no emergency procedures for certain types of accidents because they are assumed to be impossible,” it said.  Illustrating that risk, Areva-Framatome has produced a flawed reactor vessel cover for the Flamanville reactor, which will force EDF to replace the piece by 2024, just a few years after its expected commercial startup.  Parliament also warned against external threats.  “French nuclear installations have not been designed to withstand terrorist aggression, simply because terrorism was not an issue at the time (they were built),” the report said.  Following discussions with MPs, Pompili said Google had agreed to pixellate the contours of nuclear plants on its maps.  The report warned of the risk of “Germanwing syndrome”, referring to a 2015 crash where a pilot purposely flew his passenger jet into a French mountainside, saying nuclear plant operators needed some level of psychiatric supervision.

2018-07-05,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya charged three men with manslaughter and other offences on Thursday for their role in the collapse of a dam at a flower farm in May that killed at least 47 people. The three men - the farm’s managing director, Perry Kansagara, its general manager, Vinoj Kumar, and a local state water official, Johnson Njuguna - were charged at a magistrate’s court in the Rift Valley town of Naivasha, court documents seen by Reuters showed.   All pleaded not guilty to the charges, which as well as manslaughter included neglect of duty and failure to prepare environmental impact assessment reports for the dam, according to a tweet by the Kenyan public prosecutor’s office. On Wednesday Kenya’s top public prosecutor Noordin Haji had ordered nine businessmen and government officials be charged with manslaughter for their role in the disaster.  The three men are the first of those nine to be arraigned in court over the disaster.   “Prosecution has asked court to issue warrant of arrest to 6 others,” the public prosecutor said in the tweet.   The dam on the 3,500-acre farm in the Rift Valley burst after weeks of heavy rain, sending cascades of water down a hillside where it smashed into two villages. Haji said unqualified staff had built the dam using farm equipment, relying on flawed designs and without the necessary environmental impact assessment. It was not immediately clear whether the three men had been released on bail or would be detained.

2018-07-05,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian mergers-and-acquisitions activity edged lower in the first half of 2018, weighed by trade uncertainty, investment bankers and lawyers said, in contrast to a surge in global dealmaking. Year-to-date deal volume slipped 2.3 percent to $130.3 billion from $133.3 billion in the same period last year, according to data released by Thomson Reuters on Thursday. Global M&A activity shot up 64 percent to a record high. Factors weighing on market sentiment include fears of a trade war between the United States and other countries, as well as a lack of a resolution of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). “NAFTA is obviously first and foremost in terms of issues out there, but there’s just general political uncertainty globally,” said Grant Kernaghan, Citigroup’s managing director of Canadian investment banking, adding that Citi’s pipeline remained robust despite the uncertainty. Second-quarter volumes jumped from the first quarter, helped by a number of outbound deals. Bankers expect more such moves in the rest of the year. “The Canadian economy is strong, corporate confidence remains very high and interest rates are conducive for M&A,” said Darin Deschamps, co-head of Wells Fargo Securities Canada. “We will continue to see a high level of outbound M&A activity from Canadian pension funds and corporations.” But “we could see muted inbound M&A activity because of the trade uncertainty,” Deschamps added. Highlights in the first half include plans from a Blackstone Group-led (BX.N) consortium to acquire about 55 percent of Thomson Reuters Corp’s (TRI.N)(TRI.TO) Financial and Risk business for $17 billion, as well as Enbridge’s C$11.4 billion ($8.7 billion) deal to buy Spectra Energy Partners SEP.N and Enbridge Energy Partners EEP.N. “Regulatory risk and uncertainty has become a stronger headwind that needs to be carefully considered in the formative stages of deal-making,” said Emmanuel Pressman, chair of the corporate department at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP. “NAFTA uncertainty, alone, has not been an obvious impediment to deal-making. However, it potentially affects value expectations and is a key contributor to broader geopolitical headwinds.” Separately, Canadian equity capital market activity slumped 37 percent to C$16.9 billion in the first half of 2018, the lowest level in five years.

2018-07-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Energy trader Mercuria Group has agreed to provide a $1 billion trade finance facility to Greece’s Aegean Marine Petroleum Network, the marine fuel logistics and supplies company said on Thursday, sending Aegean’s stock up more than 150 percent.  New York-listed Aegean Marine underwent a major leadership change this year after losses prompted an activist investor revolt to sever ties with the company founder, shipping and oil tycoon Dimitris Melissanidis.  Aegean announced a $200 million write-off in early June after a new chairman, Donald Moore, was appointed in May to lead a strategic review. Shares in Aegean were up 127 percent at $1.43 as of 1359 GMT, having risen as high as $1.53.    Swiss-based Mercuria will initially inject at least $30 million in cash, Aegean Marine said. Aegean Marine also said the two companies would explore “a potential broader strategic partnership between the company and Mercuria, including operational services, trading and hedging arrangements”. Upon closing of the trade finance facility, the company will issue new shares equal to 30 percent of its common stock on a pro-forma basis to Mercuria and will invite a representative of Mercuria to join the company’s board of directors. The trading house has been building a structured trade finance division over the past two years.  It has recently done deals with North Sea producers EnQuest and Tailwind Energy as well as Indonesia’s Ramba Energy and Toronto-listed TransGlobe Energy to support their Egyptian assets. The firm also provided a lifeline to troubled Noble Group (NOBG.SI) last year with about $400 million of credit.  “We look forward to further developing our relationship with Aegean and providing the flexibility to execute a strategy that enhances the company’s operations and positions the company for long-term success,” Magid Shenouda, Mercuria’s global head of trading, said.

2018-07-05,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration wants to fire up development of the U.S. offshore wind industry by streamlining permitting and carving out vast areas off the coast for leasing - part of its ‘America First’ policy to boost domestic energy production and jobs. The Europeans have taken note. The drive to open America’s offshore wind industry has attracted Europe’s biggest renewable energy companies, who see the U.S. East Coast as a new frontier after years of success across the Atlantic. Less experienced U.S. wind power companies, meanwhile, have struggled to compete in their own backyard, according to lease data and interviews with industry executives. Many are steering clear of the opportunity altogether, concerned by development costs and attracted to cheaper options on land.  The Trump administration hopes the industry will help supply power to the heavily-populated Northeast, eventually creating American jobs in manufacturing turbines, towers and other components. Its efforts are part of a broader push to relax regulations and spur development across the energy complex. “This would be American produced energy, and American jobs,” said Vincent DeVito, energy policy advisor to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. “It fits well with the America First agenda.” For the moment, however, Europe’s renewable energy companies are the ones using the opportunity to advance their already sizable headstart in offshore wind projects.  Since 2014, European-backed companies have won all eight of the U.S. government’s competitive offshore wind lease auctions with aggressive bids that have pumped up prices into the tens of millions of dollars. (GRAPHIC: European firms dominate U.S. offshore wind leases - tmsnrt.rs/2No7GtL)  Bidding in an auction last year for nearly 80,000 acres off the coast of New York, for example, lasted 33 rounds with Norway’s Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, eventually winning the lease for a record $42.5 million. An individual lease had never before sold for more than $5 million, according to public records. Europeans claimed another victory in May when a partnership between Copenhagen Infrastructure Fund and Avangrid, the U.S. arm of Spain’s Iberdrola, won the largest ever U.S. contract for offshore wind power, in Massachusetts.  Of the federal government's 12 currently active offshore wind leases, seven are owned by European-backed companies, according to Bureau of Ocean Energy Management records. (See graphic tmsnrt.rs/2No7GtL) “The U.S. is one of the most desirable global offshore wind markets,” Jonathan Cole, Iberdrola’s managing director of offshore wind, told Reuters. Trump’s Interior Department gave the industry a boost this year when it announced major lease sales off Massachusetts, sought input on potential lease areas off New York and New Jersey, and began a study of all Atlantic coast waters for wind energy potential.  It also proposed easing permitting, including by allowing developers to get some permits before making key decisions, like what size of turbines they would use. Such aggressive leasing and flexible permitting helped Europe become the world’s largest offshore wind market, with thousands of wind turbines installed in the last two decades, and more than 9 billion euros in investment expected this year, according to trade group WindEurope.  While the U.S. East Coast has wind conditions and sea depths similar to the North Sea, it boasts just one five-turbine wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.  That wind farm was developed by privately-held U.S. firm Deepwater Wind LLC, which is backed by hedge fund D. E. Shaw Group. Deepwater Wind’s chief executive, Jeff Grybowski, called the U.S. wind industry’s hesitation to move offshore outdated.  “I’m sure that we will see more American entrants in this business as time goes on,” he said. “Until then we’re happy to fly the flag.” Other U.S. chief executives are less sanguine. Jim Robo, CEO of leading U.S. renewable energy company NextEra, told investors on a recent conference call that development time of 5 to 10 years and uncertainty around permitting raised serious questions about prospects offshore. “It is a moon shot in terms of building, in terms of finding people who actually know what they’re doing from a construction standpoint,” Robo said. NextEra, which owns 120 wind farms in the United States and Canada, did not respond to a request for additional comment.  Those concerns are echoed across much of the U.S. industry. “There are so many opportunities to do onshore, at substantially lower cost,” said Mike Garland, the CEO of Pattern Energy Group. “It makes more sense for us to be focused in that area.” Foreign companies are not just dominating the offshore leases. Most of the early projects, according to executives, will rely almost exclusively on imports of everything from subsea cables to turbines that are not currently made domestically - meaning much of the work will be overseas.  Components for Deepwater Wind’s five turbines off Rhode Island, for example, were shipped from Spain, Denmark and France, according to Grybowski. Their steel foundations were made in Louisiana. If construction demand picks up, the picture could change, according to a 2017 report by consultants BVG Associates Limited.  The report said building 8 gigawatts of offshore wind projects by 2030 would likely justify making most turbine components on U.S. soil, helping support up 16,700 full-time jobs. The Interior Department’s DeVito said he saw the possibilities first hand during a visit to an offshore wind component manufacturing site in Copenhagen. He said he was he was amazed by “the level of activity, the blades, the steel towers, the cranes swinging.”  “The opportunity is to make them here,” he said.

2018-07-05,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Reliance Industries, which has upended India’s telecoms sector with its cheap mobile data plans, launched its fiber broadband system on Thursday in a push to make deeper inroads into the country’s wireless and fixed-line internet industry. Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, said the company will begin registrations for its fiber-to-home service from Aug. 15, India’s Independence Day. “India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband ... Jio is determined to move India to among the top 5 in fixed-line broadband,” Ambani told shareholders at the oil-to-telecoms giant’s 41st annual general meeting (AGM). Jio, Reliance’s telecoms venture, is a key plank of Ambani’s long-term vision to make consumer-facing businesses as big as the company’s core oil-and-gas business that currently accounts for 90 percent of its revenues. Since its launch in 2016, Jio has roiled India’s telecoms sector by offering free calls and cut-price data plans, forcing rivals such as Bharti Airtel to respond with price cuts of their own and spurring consolidation.  Jio now has 215 million subscribers and is on track to cover 99 percent of the country, Ambani said. Reliance’s new fiber network, JioGigaFiber, will be rolled out in 1,100 cities and will potentially connect 50 million homes, enabling consumers to use smart solutions such as real-time surveillance and connected devices, Ambani said, without giving any pricing plans. Shares in rival Indian firms that offer home broadband services fell after Reliance unveiled JioGigaFiber. DEN Networks closed down about 10 percent, while Hathway Cable and Datacom ended about 15 percent lower. The plan to launch fiber broadband opens up a new revenue stream for Reliance under its Jio venture. The company has already invested around $36 billion in its telecoms initiative. While Ambani reiterated the company’s focus on high-margin petrochemicals business, local brokerage Sharekhan, which is owned by BNP Paribas, hailed the JioGigaFiber launch as “a step in (the) right direction”. Reliance has been testing its broadband service in some cities, offering what it says is faster internet connectivity than regular broadband where speed is less as the fiber reaches only up to the building and not directly into homes. The company has also been betting on acquiring content to fuel data consumption in a country of over a billion mobile subscribers. It has invested in Eros, Indian production house Balaji Telefilms and music app Saavn. Billionaire Ambani said the company was targeting 100 million users for its internet-enabled JioPhone that now also supports Facebook, WhatsApp messenger and YouTube. Reliance last year launched the JioPhone, which allowed digital payments and was effectively free: buyers could get a device for a refundable fee of 1,500 rupees. The Mumbai-headquartered company said a JioPhone 2 worth at 2,999 rupees ($43.50) will be available from Aug. 15. Reliance, which runs several grocery, electronics and fashion stores across India as well as an online fashion portal, plans to digitize its retail network using Jio’s network. Reliance shares have surged nearly 83 percent since Sept. 1, 2016, the day its telecom service was launched. Jio turned a profit within a year of its operation. “From here onwards, it will depend on the profitability of Jio,” said a fund manager, whose mutual fund owns Reliance shares. “That will either make or break the stock.” Reliance shares closed 2.6 percent lower in a broader Mumbai market that ended down 0.19 percent.

2018-07-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares headed for a third day of gains on Thursday as reassuring economic data from Germany and a report that its big carmakers could be spared from U.S. tariffs offset another gloomy session for Asia. Trade nerves had pegged Asia’s bourses back with a U.S. deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports just a day away, but it was another widely-flagged target - the German car sector - that spurred Europe’s rally and pushed up Wall Street futures.[.EU][.N] Mercedes-maker Daimler (DAIGn.DE), BMW (BMWG.DE) Porsche PSHG_P.DE and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) raced up as much as 5 percent after reports of a U.S. offer to suspend tariff threats on EU-made cars if the bloc lifts its duties on U.S. ones. It fuelled the wider European auto sector’s .SXAP best day in more than two years with the mood also been helped by a stronger-than-expected jump in German industrial orders after four months of falls. “With these stories coming out (about car tariffs), you have a sector which has been very oversold meeting some potential good news on the trade war front,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch European equity strategist James Barty.  “This is going to be the dominant issue of the summer. Are we heading for a full-blown trade war in which case it is very bad news for risk assets, or do we walk away from it, in which case, as we have seen today, markets are likely to rebound quite sharply.” The euro briefly topped $1.17 EUR=EBS and bond yields rose after the brighter German data and after a report that the ECB thinks markets are now too cautious on when it will raise euro zone interest rates next year.[FRX/] Sterling GBP=D4 gained ground too as the head of the Bank of England confirmed it was still planning to raise UK rates this year. Later in the day, traders will get the minutes from last month's Federal Reserve meeting when it raised U.S. rates for a second time this year. “The euro is getting a bit of a lift on the German data though the trade concerns will continue to dominate markets with the Fed minutes being the key data point,” said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London. The ongoing angst over U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs had extended the recent slide in Asian markets overnight, in particular Chinese shares which are now deep into “bear” market territory.  On Friday, U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports will take effect. Beijing has promised to retaliate in kind, though it said overnight that it would “absolutely not” fire the first shot in a trade war.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS, which has dropped every day except three since mid June, ended down 0.25 percent. The index has lost about 2 percent this week, plumbing a nine-month low in the process. Japan's Nikkei .N225 shed 0.8 percent, South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 slipped 0.4 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng .HSI was off 0.2 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC fell 0.9 percent to take its dive since late January to 23 percent. With Europe advancing though, Wall Street’s S&P 500 futures ESc1 and Dow and Nasdaq futures YMc1 NQc1 were all up 0.6-0.7 percent, pointing to a solid start following Wednesday’s U.S. Independence Day holiday. [.N] “The $34 billion U.S. tariffs figure has been mostly factored by the markets and focus is now on what the United States says on the remaining $16 billion (of a promised $50 billion tariff plan),” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. In currencies, the euro's gain was the dollar's loss .DXY. That also helped ease some of the pressure on volatile emerging market currencies, even Turkey's battered lira TRY= recovered from an early slip triggered by its prime minister saying cutting interest rates was a top priority. [EMRG/FRX] The Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS was slightly lower though, its recovery from an 11-month low stalling. A rebound was triggered in the past two sessions after the country's central bank sought to calm nervous markets and stem the recent tumble. The longer term direction for the yuan was still unclear. China appears broadly comfortable with a weakening yuan and would intervene only to prevent any destabilising declines or to restore market confidence, policy insiders told Reuters. “Although we do not believe China will weaponise its currency, we do believe the current trajectory of Chinese yuan depreciation is justified,” strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note. The dollar was 0.1 percent higher against the yen at 110.610 yen JPY=, though it was sticking within a narrow range ahead of the Federal Reserve minutes that could give fresh clues on central bank's rate hike plans. In commodities, Brent oil futures LCOc1 were on the rise again at $78.30 a barrel, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump sent a tweet demanding that OPEC reduce prices for crude. [O/R] Brent had risen on Wednesday on a threat from an Iranian commander to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring states if Washington continued to press all countries to stop buying Iranian oil, and a drop in U.S. crude inventories. “If Trump continues to believe that OPEC are not doing enough, we would not rule out an SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) release from the U.S., or possibly even export restrictions on petroleum products,” ING said in a note.

2018-07-05,"KIEV, July 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s parliament on Thursday passed a law requiring state-run banks to appoint a majority of independent members to their supervisory boards, a commitment made to the backers of its $17.5 billion bailout. The law aims to bring corporate governance at the banks into line with international standards and help the lenders resist political pressure, the finance ministry said in a statement after the vote. The International Monetary Fund has propped up Ukraine’s war-scarred economy with an aid programme since 2015, though the Fund has not disbursed any money since last year as the pace of reforms slowed. It has pressed the government to clean up a financial sector where non-performing loans make up more than 60 percent of portfolios in state banks as a result of risky and opaque lending practices. “We currently do not have effective control under hundreds of billions of hryvnias that we send from the state budget in order to support state-owned banks. We have to bring order here and the law will help,” Mykhailo Dovbenko, head of a parliament committee on banking, said before the vote. Ukraine has closed two-thirds of its banks since 2014 as part of a clean-up of the financial sector and in 2016 nationalised the country’s largest lender, PrivatBank. The government says 85 percent of PrivatBank’s portfolio is made up of non-performing loans, though PrivatBank’s former owners dispute this assessment and are contesting the decision to nationalise it. After PrivatBank was taken into state hands, the market-share of state-run banks doubled to 55 percent, increasing the need for better management at such banks, the central bank said. The new law says that six of nine members of a supervisory board of a state-owned bank are to be chosen via an open contest by a recruitment company with at least ten years of international experience. The president, government and parliament will appoint the other three members.

2018-07-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump again accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of driving gasoline prices higher on Wednesday and urged the oil producer group to do more. “The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up & they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $’s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!” Trump wrote on Twitter. The Republican president has lashed out at OPEC in recent weeks. Rising gasoline prices could create a political headache for Trump before November mid-term congressional elections by offsetting Republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped boost the U.S. economy. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said Saudi Arabia had agreed to increase oil output by up to 2 million barrels, an assertion that the White House rowed back on in a subsequent statement. The leader of Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest member, has assured Trump that the kingdom can raise oil production if needed and that the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that could be deployed to help cool oil prices to compensate for falling output in Venezuela and Iran. Trump has been complaining about OPEC at the same time that Washington is piling pressure on its European allies to stop buying Iranian oil. Iranian OPEC Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said on Thursday that Trump had raised oil prices through his tweets.  “Your tweets have increased the prices by at least $10. Please stop this method,” the Iranian oil ministry’s news agency, SHANA, quoted Kazempour as saying.  Kazempour said Trump was trying to intensify tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. He also called on the United States to join world powers in a meeting with Iran in Vienna on Friday. Foreign ministers from the five remaining signatories of a nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers will meet Iranian officials in the Austrian capital to discuss how to keep the accord alive after the U.S. withdrawal from the pact. Iran has threatened to block oil exports through a key Gulf waterway in retaliation against any hostile U.S. action.

2018-07-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell’s boss said it would be “foolhardy” for the oil and gas producer to set hard targets to reduce carbon emissions as it risked exposing the energy giant to legal challenges. The energy industry has struggled in recent years to find a clear path to secure its role as the world shifts from fossil fuels in order to meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement goals. Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden last year set out ambitions last year to halve its carbon emissions by 2050, far exceeding rivals. But the Dutch CEO resisted calls by activists and some investors to set binding targets. “It would be somewhat foolhardy to put ourselves in a legal bind by saying these are the targets we will adopt,” van Beurden said at a company event. “Before we put ourselves at the mercy of a legal challenge, I want to make sure we are doing the right thing first.” Van Beurden, a vocal proponent of the world’s need to meet the Paris goals, urged investors to trust him. “You have to believe us that setting an ambition, sticking my neck out, my personal reputation, the reputation of the company, is a big enough incentive to get it right,” he told reporters.     Oil companies have faced a growing number of legal challenges over climate change in recent years.  On Monday, the U.S. state of Rhode Island sued several major oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp , Shell and BP, accusing them of contributing to climate change that is damaging infrastructure and coastal communities. BP this year announced plans to keep carbon emissions from its operations flat until 2025. But BP CEO Bob Dudley echoed van Beurden’s concerns at the company’s annual general meeting in May and refused to disclose details of the plan. “You want to get us to make statements here in front of you that you can document that will lead to a class action,” Dudley said in response to a question from a shareholder. Shell spends the most among the world’s top oil and gas companies on low-carbon energies, investing up to $2 billion per year in renewables and clean fuel technology, out of a total spending budget of $25 billion to $30 billion per year. “It is more sensible to say we will go faster than society, we will catch up with society on its way to meeting Paris,” van Beurden said on Thursday.  “It is a very clear ambition, we will articulate this ambitions in steps as we go along the way. We will be totally transparent.” Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Jason Neely and Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/shell-carbon/update-1-shell-ceo-says-foolhardy-to-set-carbon-reduction-targets-idUKL8N1U121S,05 Jul 2018,"* BP has also taken cautious approach on targets

2018-07-05,"* Beijing slows approval process for new ethanol plants * Nationwide roll-out of E10 fuel by 2020 in doubt - industry * Concerns over securing sufficient corn for biofuels * U.S. trade dispute raises import hurdles for corn, ethanol (Adding charts) By Hallie Gu and Michael Hirtzer BEIJING/CHICAGO, July 5 (Reuters) - China’s ambitious push to use biofuel in cars nationwide by 2020 is in doubt amid concerns about supplies of raw material such as corn, complicated by an escalating trade dispute with Washington, producers and analysts say. In September last year, the government outlined radical plans to roll out the use of ethanol in gasoline nationally by 2020, in part to digest its huge corn stocks. State-controlled producers, like China’s State Development & Investment Corporation (SDIC), agribusiness COFCO and Jilin Fuel, rushed to draw up plans to invest billions of yuan to double output in the world’s largest car market. But since then, only one major project - SDIC’s 300,000 tonnes per year plant in Liaoning province in China’s northeast - has received the go-ahead to start construction. Three big expansion plans by major producers are stalled because the companies haven’t got approval from the government, three sources with direct knowledge of the situation say. They declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The government has not revised its timeline or commented publicly on a change in policy. But executives at two producers, three policy experts and market analysts say the drawn out approval process and project delays suggest Beijing is quietly rethinking its initial plans. The slowdown comes as a brewing trade dispute with the United States intensifies, raising the threat of further tariffs that could make imports of U.S. corn or ethanol to meet any shortfall in domestic supplies uneconomic. “The plan was too ambitious and will have a huge impact on the whole industry chain. It was too big a step forward. There might be change to the policy,” said Michael Mao, analyst with Zhuochuang, a consultancy based in Shandong province. The Commerce Ministry, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the National Development & Reform Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Building enough capacity to meet the 2020 target was always going to be tough for the country’s nascent ethanol industry. In 2017, fuel ethanol capacity was 3.45 million tonnes, according to Zhuochuang, far short of the 15 million tonnes needed for a national roll-out of gasoline known as ‘E10’, containing 10 percent ethanol. With just 18 months to go, there is little sign of the building boom the sector anticipated. In the northeastern region of Heilongjiang, the local government said it would launch a bidding process to apply for approval to build new ethanol plants, but interested companies are still waiting to hear. “I have been mainly doing some paperwork since I got here,” said a manager in charge of the building of his company’s new plants in the cornbelt province. “I meet with local government officials frequently, but there’s no news about what’s next.” An executive at another major producer said his company also wanted to expand output following the 2020 mandate, but could not get permits from the government. COFCO has not started building new ethanol plants it had planned, waiting on further announcements on government policy, according to two people familiar with the matter. The slowdown comes amid concerns that the world’s most populous country may struggle to secure enough corn to produce biofuel without disrupting food supplies and prices of the grain. Some 45 million tonnes of corn, almost a quarter of the country’s current annual demand, would be needed to make enough ethanol for a national roll-out. Domestic corn supplies have dwindled in recent years, leaving little cushion for the extra demand just as Beijing ratchets up pressure on Washington in their escalating trade dispute. Beijing will hit corn imports from the United States, one of its top suppliers, with hefty extra tariffs from Friday. China already imposes a 30 percent tariff on all ethanol imports, keeping arrivals to a trickle. In April, it slapped an extra 15 percent tariff on imports from the United States, the world’s top producer, and is set to impose another 25 percent on Friday. And after years of selling off its 200 million tonne corn stockpile, the state reserves, which were expected to help feed the new factories, will run out of corn by the end of next year, according to Reuters calculations. The Chinese government expects the 2018/19 supply deficit from domestically grown corn to balloon to 20 million tonnes from 6.4 million in 2017/18 as the crop shrinks 2.5 percent and demand grows. “Once we run out of stocks in the reserves, where can you get extra corn to make fuel ethanol?,” said Meng Jinhui, analyst with Shengda Futures.

The new taxation will likely boost oil output by 900,000 tonnes per year (18,000 barrels per day) and is initially applicable to a limited number of oilfields. Taxes on the industry are currently based on production - via a mineral extraction tax - and exports. Companies have long lobbied for profit-based taxation, saying it will spur production and better reflect exploration costs and risks. The first reading was approved in April.

2018-07-05,"HANOI (Reuters) - Police in Vietnam have arrested seven people over the “terrorist” bombing of a police station in Ho Chi Minh City last month that injured three people, police said on Thursday. The incident, in which two small explosive devices were detonated, followed protests by thousands of people in several cities against government plans to lease new economic zones to foreign investors. “This is a terrorist case against the people’s government,”  Ho Chi Minh City police said in a statement on their official website.  “The police arrested seven people and seized 10 kg of explosives.”  Four of those arrested face “terrorist” charges, and three have been charged with trading in explosives, they added. Police seized eight more bombs, they said. Pictures alongside the statement showed confiscated bomb-making materials and ammunition, they added. The nationwide protests were sparked by concerns that plans to develop economic zones by offering land leases for up to 99 years would be dominated by investors from neighbouring China, with which Vietnam has a history of fractious ties. Despite sweeping economic reforms, communist-ruled Vietnam tolerates little dissent, and has described some anti-government groups as “terrorists”, a charge punishable by death. In December 2017, Vietnam jailed 15 people it said were guilty of plotting to bomb its largest airport, in Ho Chi Minh City. They received money from the California-based Provisional Government of Vietnam, a group still loyal to the now defunct state of South Vietnam, which Hanoi listed as a “terrorist” organisation in January. A U.S. embassy spokesman said at the time the group was not designated a terrorist outfit by the U.S. State Department. Police did not identify a group behind the police station bombing on June 20, but said on Thursday it had been carried out “under the direction of overseas reactionary organisations” and the perpetrators had trained online. The group had been working for a “resistance organisation in the United States”, the VnExpress news website said, citing police.

2018-07-05,"OSLO, July 5 (Reuters) - Norway’s electricity prices, usually among the cheapest in Europe, have doubled for the third quarter as a lack of rainfall makes hydropower dam output as costly as German power, the country’s regulator said. Norway’s electricity price for the third quarter was trading at 0.43 crowns ($0.0532) per kilowatt hour (KWh), twice 2017’s level, according to Norway’s water resources and energy directorate (NVE). That continued a trend of high Norwegian power prices this year, with the spot energy price during spring and early summer also double 2017 levels. Norway counts on competitive electricity prices to attract international power-hungry investors, who seek low-price regions to build their factories and data centres. The country was also planning three interconnectors to export its cheap power. But the price is now not as cheap as it used to be. “The lack of rainfall is the main reason why the price is about twice as high as at the same time last year,” the NVE said in a report. It also corresponds to the cost of producing power from coal, it added. To add to the lack of rainfall, Norway’s wind power production fell sharply, it added, while consumption in the Nordic countries increased simultaneously. Norway, which usually exports surpluses during the warmer summer time, is seeing imports exceed exports this summer, the country’s grid said on Wednesday. Norway’s reservoirs have received rainfall in 2018 that is equivalent to 22 terrawatt hours (TWh) less than a normal year, a shortfall equivalent to the energy needs of 1.1 million households, or half of Norway’s population, it said. In a separate report produced by the country’s statistics agency SSB on Thursday, May’s power imports grew by 78.1 percent from the same month last year, while exports fell by 28 percent. Total energy production in Norway also declined by 8.7 percent. Norway’s imported power is coming from Sweden and Denmark, countries that are seeing a wind power production surplus, state-owned grid Statnett said.

2018-07-05,"* European car shares jump on report on U.S. tariff compromise * German data, ECB report lifts euro, bond yields * Oil slips after Trump’s Twitter demands for OPEC action * Markets await U.S. tariffs on China, Fed minutes * Yuan slips back * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - European shares headed for a third day of gains on Thursday, as reassuring economic data from Germany and a report that its big carmakers could be spared from U.S. tariffs offset another gloomy session for Asia. Trade war nerves had pegged all of Asia’s bourses back with a U.S. deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports just a day away, but it was another widely-flagged target - the German car sector - that drove Europe’s fast start. Mercedes-maker Daimler, and BMW Porsche and Volkswagen raced up as much as 5 percent after a newspaper report about a U.S. offer to suspend tariff threats on EU-made cars if the bloc lifts its duties on U.S. ones. The mood was also helped as German industrial orders saw a stronger-than-expected jump after four months of falls. The euro briefly topped $1.17 and bond yields also rose on a report that the ECB thinks markets are now too cautious on when it will raise euro zone interest rates next year. Later in the day, traders will also get the minutes from the recent meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve where it raised rates for a second time this year and flagged that more are likely. “The euro is getting a bit of a lift on the German data though the trade concerns will continue to dominate markets with the Fed minutes being the key data point,” said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London. The overnight slide in Asian markets, in particular Chinese shares which are now deep into ‘bear’ market territory, highlighted the ongoing angst over U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade tariff plans. On Friday, U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports will take effect, and Beijing has promised to retaliate in kind, though it did say overnight that it will “absolutely not” fire the first shot in a trade war. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which has been dropping since Monday, ended down 0.5 percent. The index has lost about 2 percent this week, plumbing a nine-month low in the process. Japan’s Nikkei shed 1 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.75 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 0.9 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 percent to take its dive since late January to 23 percent. With Europe advancing though, Wall Street’s S&P 500 futures edged up 0.4 percent and Dow futures added 0.3 percent, pointing to a solid start following Wednesday’s Independence Day holiday. “The $34 billion U.S. tariffs figure has been mostly factored by the markets and focus is now on what the United States says on the remaining $16 billion (of a promised $50 billion tariff plan),” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. In currencies, the euro’s gain was the dollar’s loss. That also helped ease some of the pressure on volatile emerging market currencies, though Turkey’s lira went lower again as its prime minister said cutting interest rates was a top priority. The Chinese yuan was also slightly lower, its recovery from an 11-month low stalling. A rebound in the yuan was triggered in the past two sessions after the country’s central bank sought to calm nervous markets and stem the recent tumble. The longer term direction for the yuan was still unclear. China appears broadly comfortable with a weakening yuan and would intervene only to prevent any destabilising declines or to restore market confidence, policy insiders told Reuters. “Although we do not believe China will weaponize its currency, we do believe the current trajectory of Chinese yuan depreciation is justified,” strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note. The dollar was 0.1 percent higher against the yen at 110.610 yen, though it was sticking in a narrow range ahead of the Federal Reserve minutes that could give fresh clues on central bank’s rate hike plans. In commodities, Brent oil futures were down 0.7 percent at $77.69 a barrel, after U.S. President Donald Trump sent a tweet demanding that OPEC reduce prices for crude. Brent had risen on Wednesday on a threat from an Iranian commander to disrupt oil shipments from neighboring states if Washington continued to press all countries to stop buying Iranian oil, and a drop in U.S. crude inventories. “If Trump continues to believe that OPEC are not doing enough, we would not rule out an SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) release from the U.S., or possibly even export restrictions on petroleum products,” ING said in a note.

2018-07-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - British government plans to transfer shale oil and gas exploration planning decisions from local authorities to the national level will be a backward step and harm local democracy, a cross-party committee of UK lawmakers warned on Thursday. In May, the government announced plans to speed up planning applications to support development of the country’s shale gas industry which it believes will reduce Britain’s dependence on imported gas in the future. Among the measures is a proposal for fracking sites to be classified as “nationally significant infrastructure”, which would mean approval for planning applications would be done at a national rather than local level. Changing the decision-making process in this way would likely exacerbate existing mistrust between communities and the fracking industry, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee said in a report. “Taking decision-making powers away from local planning authorities would be a backward step. It would remove the important link between fracking applications and local plans and be hugely harmful to local democracy and the principles and spirit of localism,” said Clive Betts, chair of the committee. Instead, local mineral planning authorities have the best knowledge of their areas to determine the impacts of fracking, the report said. The UK Onshore Oil and Gas (UKOOG) trade association said it did not share the committee’s view on a national planning role as applications for shale wells can take up to 18 months. “This leaves communities with uncertainty and local taxpayers with a huge bill to foot and is against the experience of the previous 10 years where most applications were decided in less than four months and against a statutory timescale of three months,” it said in a statement. Hydraulic fracturing involves extracting gas obtained from rocks broken up or fractured with water and chemicals at high pressure. It has become a contentious issue in Europe after it helped reverse a fall in U.S. oil output, transformed its gas sector and boosted the economy of several states. Despite that, critics argue that fracking can be associated with environmental issues such as increased industrial activity and water contamination and boost fossil fuel production when more renewable energy should be encouraged. Commercial production of shale gas in Britain has not yet started as developers complain that progress has been slowed by protests and regulatory processes. British shale gas developer Caudrilla expects to fracture its first two horizontal wells in Blackpool later this year, subject to approvals. The Scottish government has in effect banned fracking by ordering local authorities to reject planning applications from companies seeking to do shale gas exploration, after a public consultation found overwhelming opposition to it.

2018-07-05,"BEIJING, July 5 (Reuters) - Chinese companies rushed to draw up plans to build new ethanol plants in the country’s northeastern corn belt after Beijing set a target to use ethanol in gasoline nationwide by 2020. China said last year that it will roll out E10 gasoline, containing 10 percent ethanol, in 2020 to boost industrial demand for excess corn stocks. But since the announcement, only one project has been given the green light, while other companies’ plans are languishing, waiting for approval. Below are a list of ethanol plants under construction or planned: SDIC is building an ethanol plant with 300,000 tonnes of annual capacity in Liaoning province, expected to go online in August, according to executives at the company. SDIC plans to build another five factories including in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, and buy some additional facilities, in the next few years, a senior executive told Reuters last year. It was not clear if that plan is still up to date. Local state media reported late last year that the company aims to launch an ethanol plant with 600,000 tonnes per year (tpy) of production capacity in Fujin, Heilongjiang province. The company also acquired an alcohol plant in Jilin province, with annual capacity at 1.15 million tonnes, to develop its ethanol business, according to state media and a source with knowledge of the matter. SDIC will convert some of that production into fuel ethanol following the nation’s overall development strategy, the company’s spokesperson said. The timeline for doing so is not clear. The state-owned agriculture giant plans to build three factories in Heilongjiang, with 300,000 tpy of capacity each, but it is still waiting for the local government to start the bidding process, according to a person familiar with the matter. It is planning another plant with 650,000 tpy of production capacity in Changchun, Jilin province, and has relocated a 300,000 tpy unit in Anhui province, according to Zhuochuang, a consultancy in the eastern province of Shandong. COFCO did not respond to an email seeking comments.

Some 45 million tonnes of corn, almost a quarter of the country’s current annual demand, would be needed to make enough ethanol for a national roll-out. Domestic corn supplies have dwindled in recent years, leaving little cushion for the extra demand just as Beijing ratchets up pressure on Washington in their escalating trade dispute. Beijing will hit corn imports from the United States, one of its top suppliers, with hefty extra tariffs from Friday. China already imposes a 30 percent tariff on all ethanol imports, keeping arrivals to a trickle. In April, it slapped an extra 15 percent tariff on imports from the United States, the world’s top producer, and is set to impose another 25 percent on Friday. And after years of selling off its 200 million tonne corn stockpile, the state reserves, which were expected to help feed the new factories, will run out of corn by the end of next year, according to Reuters calculations. The Chinese government expects the 2018/19 supply deficit from domestically grown corn to balloon to 20 million tonnes from 6.4 million in 2017/18 as the crop shrinks 2.5 percent and demand grows. “Once we run out of stocks in the reserves, where can you get extra corn to make fuel ethanol?,” said Meng Jinhui, analyst with Shengda Futures.

2018-07-05,"* China embroiled in festering trade dispute with United States * Also wants to ensure gas supply for its ‘war on pollution’ * Chinese imports of U.S. LNG expected to surge -Morgan Stanley * Beijing faces mounting pressure to secure, diversify gas supply By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING, July 5 (Reuters) - China’s omission of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its vast list of U.S. products that face hefty import duties from Friday has preserved a potential weapon should the trade war with Washington deepen. It also underscores Beijing’s desire to ensure supplies of gas as it pushes to switch millions of households and businesses away from using coal as a key part of its ‘war on pollution’. China will on Friday impose tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods from pork to soybeans to cotton in retaliation for a similar move by Washington as trade relations sour between the world’s top two economies. “If the (trade) war escalates, (I expect) the government will not hesitate to add LNG,” a state oil and gas company executive said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Although U.S. LNG supplies to China have so far been tiny in volume and value compared with the around $12 billion per year of U.S. crude that arrives in the country, analysts say those levels could be set to shoot up as Beijing forges ahead with its battle to clear its skies. Morgan Stanley has estimated annual Chinese imports of U.S. LNG could rise to as much as $9 billion within two or three years, from $1 billion in 2017. The amount could be even larger if the United States resolves a logistics bottleneck. That would go a long way to helping balance China’s trade surplus with the United States, a major bugbear of Washington’s in the trade dispute. But the strategy also hands Beijing another weapon in its arsenal if the spat deteriorates further. China’s Commerce Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, some industry sources said the country would feel the impact of any increased tariffs on U.S. LNG, as there are a limited number of major alternative suppliers. “If we impose tariffs on U.S. LNG, we pay a much higher opportunity cost,” Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a think tank affiliated with the Commerce Ministry told Reuters. “It is easier for China to switch into other suppliers in the soybean market. Duties on soybeans hurt the U.S. more, but duties on energy products would hurt both sides.” At a meeting between the government and China’s three oil and gas majors ahead of U.S. President’s visit to the country last September, the companies underlined that China would have limited alternative sources for LNG imports, an official from one of the firms told Reuters. “The conclusion at that time was that U.S. oil is not competitive,” the official said. “In the gas market, we don’t have much choice, mainly Qatar, Australia and the U.S.” And China is eager to avoid any repeat of last winter’s gas crunch, when plunging temperatures drove people to crank up their heating amid the moves to turn away from coal. Domestic natural gas demand rose 17.6 percent in the first five months of 2018, way above government forecasts of an annual growth rate of 7 or 8 percent, data from National Development and Reform Commission showed. “With domestic gas production restrained, we need to expand imports to meet the target of having natural gas account for a 10-percent share of the energy consumption basket,” said Wang Haohao, gas analyst with Zibo Longzhong Information Group. “We need U.S. LNG out of energy security considerations,” she added.

2018-07-05,"TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Electric utilities in Japan and other Asian countries are driving blind when it comes to coal prices after the failure of Japan’s Tohoku Electric and Glencore to agree on an annual thermal coal contract that is used to set prices for the region. Tohoku Electric (9506.T), a major Japanese utility, and Glencore (GLEN.L), the world’s biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal, abandoned the talks last month on their annual Australian supply contract. “Both parties seem to have tried hard to come to a consensus but always had large difference in price expectations this year,” energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a note to clients. Coal prices spiked as Japanese and Asian utilities jumped into the spot market to cover their needs after the talks broke down.  Companies that were relying on the talks to set a price for their previously delivered cargoes and future shipments under their April to March contracts now lack a reference for netting out prior payments based on temporary prices. The collapse of this year’s talks has raised questions about the industry’s dependence on this method of setting prices.  Japan’s utilities, which buy about 40 percent of Australia’s thermal coal exports, have a relationship with Glencore and its predecessors that goes back over 30 years. The two sides typically sit down early in the year to negotiate fixed prices for annual supplies for April to March. Those prices are published by media and used by utilities in Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia for their own contracts.  However, during the talks this year, spot coal prices rose, making it difficult for the sides to settle on a contract. “Because Tohoku already signed some deals with smaller suppliers when spot prices were lower, they were not willing to pay significantly more for coal from their biggest supplier, Glencore,” said one source with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak publicly about commercial deals. “Glencore had the opposite view. They were unwilling to agree to a supply deal significantly below spot market prices,” the source added. Without this year’s deal, utilities need to find another reference price for their annual supplies or they can buy in the spot market. Finding another benchmark is difficult because the coal market is more opaque than other commodities such as crude oil, where exchanges readily publish futures prices. Rising prices have made going into the spot market expensive. Spot thermal coal prices at Australia’s Newcastle terminal GCLNWCPFBMc1 have climbed by 32 percent from their 2018 lows, to over $120 per tonne, the highest since 2012. But, buying from Newcastle supports Glencore, which exported 49.1 million tonnes of coal from Australia in 2017, a quarter of the country’s overseas sales, according to government and company data.  Market participants are divided on the industry’s next steps. Some traders expect another Japanese utility to become an alternative negotiator for this year, or Tohoku will renew negotiations for another term contract as it wants to reduce its exposure to the volatile spot market. Others expect the failed talks to mark a more significant change. “Power market liberalization in Japan now demands that utilities have more flexibility in coal prices in their ability to pass-on fuel costs,” Wood Mackenzie said. National Australia Bank said in its July commodity outlook published this week that “spot prices for thermal coal may become increasingly important, given the breakdown of the traditional Japanese financial year contract mechanism.”  Some Japanese companies are improving their ability to operate in the spot market. JERA, a joint-venture between Tokyo Electric Power (9502.T) and Chubu Electric Power (9502.T) and one of the world’s biggest fuel importers, has taken over the coal operations of Europe’s EDF Trading and plans to buy its liquefied natural gas operations. JERA President Yuji Kakimi said the company has reduced its coal requirements using long-term contracts to only a few percent from as much as 80 percent a decade ago.  Another option is to use spot price indexes. Japan’s steel sector moved to this model last year after Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal (5401.T) ended their decades-old fixed price mechanism settled through talks with Australian miners for coking coal.   However, a senior official at Glencore said “that is not what we desire to happen.” Reporting by Yuka Obayashi in TOKYO and Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE; Additional reporting by Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/japan-glencore-thermal-coal/explainer-what-the-failed-glencore-tohoku-coal-talks-mean-for-the-market-idUKL4N1TY3PQ,05 Jul 2018,"Electric utilities in

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open little changed, with Britain’s FTSE flat, Germany’s DAX 0.02 percent lower and France’s CAC down 0.1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which has been drifting lower since Monday, was down 0.5 percent. The index has lost about 2 percent this week, during which it plumbed a nine-month low. S&P 500 futures edged up 0.1 percent while Dow futures lost 0.1 percent, pointing to a mixed start for Wall Street later in the day when trading resumes following Wednesday’s Independence Day holiday. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.75 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was off 0.9 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 percent. “The markets lack strong direction without incentives from the United States, where their markets were closed yesterday. Moves by Chinese shares and the yuan remain a key factor in the meantime,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. The United States plans to implement tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports from China as both nations remained locked in a bitter trade dispute that has convulsed global financial markets in recent weeks. On July 6, tariffs on $34 billion worth of imports will take effect, and Beijing has promised to retaliate in kind. However, China’s finance ministry did say on Wednesday that it will “absolutely not” fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs. China has put pressure on the European Union to issue a strong joint statement against U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies, European officials told Reuters.. “The $34 billion U.S. tariffs figure has been mostly factored by the markets and focus is now on what the United States says on the remaining $16 billion,” Ichikawa said. In currencies, the euro was little changed at $1.1655 . The single currency fell to as low as $1.1630 overnight after weaker confidence in the euro zone overshadowed better-than-expected data on business activity. The Chinese yuan was slightly lower, its recovery from an 11-month low stalling. A rebound in the yuan was triggered in the past two sessions after the central bank sought to calm nervous markets midweek and stem the currency’s recent tumble. The yuan was a touch lower after gaining 0.2 percent against the dollar on Wednesday. The longer term direction for the yuan was still unclear. China appears broadly comfortable with a weakening yuan and would intervene only to prevent any destabilising declines or to restore market confidence, policy insiders told Reuters. “The July 6 deadline for the imposition of U.S. tariffs on China imports looms large. Although we do not believe China will weaponize its currency, we do believe the current trajectory of Chinese yuan depreciation is justified,” strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note. The dollar was 0.1 percent lower at 110.365 yen, trapped in a narrow range the previous day due to the U.S. holiday, awaiting minutes from the June Federal Reserve policy meeting due later in the day for immediate cues.

2018-07-05,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The smog-prone northern Chinese province of Hebei on Thursday said it plans to slash steel capacity by 50 percent in some of its major cities by 2020, and will also shut coal mines, coking plants and cement factories to upgrade its industrial economy. Hebei, a major source of the air pollution drifting over neighboring Beijing, produces about a quarter of the country’s total steel output, and it has been on the front line in China’s ‘war on pollution’, now in its fifth year. According to an article published by the Hebei provincial environmental bureau, the province will aim to cut a total of around 40 million tonnes of steel smelting capacity from 2018 to 2020.  It aims to have just 60 steel enterprises by the end of the decade, with 90 percent of capacity controlled by its top 15 firms, it said, citing senior government officials at a meeting on Wednesday.  The cities of Baoding, Langfang and Zhangjiakou - a host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics - will shut all their steel mills by 2020. Chengde and Qinhuangdao will close half. Chengde, Zhangjiakou and Baoding will also eliminate all their coal mines by the end of 2020.   Hebei will also shut another 5 million tonnes of annual cement capacity, 10 million tonnes of coking capacity and 1.5 gigawatts of thermal power capacity by 2020, the provincial Communist Party secretary Wang Dongfeng was quoted as saying. Hebei closed more than 60 million tonnes of steel capacity and slashed coal use by 40 million tonnes over the 2013-2017 period, though critics complained that some of the shuttered mills were already bankrupt “zombie” firms. The province had 286 million tonnes of annual steel capacity in 2013, and it is aiming to bring that figure down to 200 million tonnes by the end of the decade.

2018-07-05,"* Trump sends tweet demanding OPEC cut oil prices * OPEC supply cuts since 2017 have tightened oil markets * Oil has also risen on U.S. sanction threat against Iran By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, July 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump sent a tweet urging OPEC to reduce prices for crude. Brent crude futures were at $77.88 per barrel at 0053 GMT, down 36 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 35 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $73.79 per barrel. Trump late on Wednesday said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) producer cartel was driving up fuel prices. “The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up & they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $’s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!” Trump wrote on Twitter. OPEC together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia started to withhold output in 2017 to prop up prices. Recent price rises have also been spurred by a U.S. announcement that it plans to re-introduce sanctions against Iran from November, which will also target its oil industry. “A key driver of the rise in prices has been the OPEC-Russia deal to cut oil output, compounded by collapsing Venezuelan production and the U.S. decision to end the Iran deal,” National Australia Bank (NAB) said in its July outlook. Ship brokerage Banchero Costa said Iran’s crude oil production was currently around 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), but added “there is the risk of production decreasing going forward as exports are again affected by renewed sanctions implemented by the U.S.” OPEC and Russia announced in June they were willing to raise output to address concerns of emerging supply shortages due to unplanned disruptions from Venezuela to Libya, and likely also to replace a potential fall in Iranian supplies due to U.S. sanctions. NAB said its oil price forecasts “point to Brent spending the next few months largely in the mid-to-high $70s (per barrel) range, although meaningful OPEC-Russia output increases could push prices lower later in the year and higher U.S. shale production should impose an upside limit on WTI.” Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production has soared by 30 percent in the last two years, to 10.9 million bpd. That means just three countries, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia, meet a third of global oil demand.

2018-07-05,"LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) -    British government plans to transfer shale oil and gas exploration planning decisions from local authorities to the national level will be a backward step and harm local democracy, a cross-party committee of UK lawmakers warned on Thursday. In May, the UK government announced plans to speed up planning applications to support development of the country’s shale gas industry which it believes will reduce Britain’s dependence on imported gas in the future. Among the measures is a proposal for fracking sites to be classified as “nationally significant infrastructure”, which would mean approval for planning applications would be done at a national rather than local level. Changing the decision-making process in this way would likely exacerbate existing mistrust between communities and the fracking industry, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee said in a report. “Taking decision-making powers away from local planning authorities would be a backward step. It would remove the important link between fracking applications and Local Plans and be hugely harmful to local democracy and the principles and spirit of localism,” said Clive Betts, chair of the committee. Instead, local mineral planning authorities have the best knowledge of their areas to determine the impacts of fracking, the report said. Hydraulic fracturing involves extracting gas obtained from rocks broken up or fractured with water and chemicals at high pressure. It has become a contentious issue in Europe after it helped reverse a fall in U.S. oil output, transformed its gas sector and boosted the economy of several states. Despite that, critics argue that fracking can be associated with environmental issues such as increased industrial activity and water contamination and boost fossil fuel production when more renewable energy should be encouraged. Commercial production of shale gas in Britain has not yet started as developers complain that progress has been slowed by protests and regulatory processes. British shale gas developer Caudrilla expects to fracture its first two horizontal wells in Blackpool later this year, subject to approvals. The Scottish government has in effect banned fracking by ordering local authorities to reject planning applications from companies seeking to do shale gas exploration, after a public consultation found overwhelming opposition to it.
