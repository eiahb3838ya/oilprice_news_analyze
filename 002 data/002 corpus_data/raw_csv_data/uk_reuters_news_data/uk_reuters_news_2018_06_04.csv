2018-06-04,"SYDNEY, June 5 (Reuters) - The president of Emirates airline said the rare combination of higher fuel prices and a stronger dollar - which more usually move in opposite directions - represented a “double whammy” for the group and this would have to be managed. “We have very strong summer bookings at higher prices,” Tim Clark said during a briefing on the sidelines of an aviation industry meeting in Sydney, adding that the airline was monitoring trends for any sign that higher ticket prices were leading to a drop in demand. Global airlines body IATA on Monday downgraded its profit forecast for the industry, citing higher oil and labour costs, although said yields, a proxy for air fares, are expected to rise by 3.2 percent this year. Clark said he expected to make a decision soon on engines for the carrier’s latest order of A380 super jumbos. The planes are due for delivery from 2020. The General Electric and Pratt & Whitney Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce on the latest deliveries. Clark said the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on its A380s has shown good performance on maintenance since being introduced to the Emirates fleet 14-15 months ago. However, Emirates has delayed some A380 deliveries to allow for fix to a fan blade problem. He also said that pilot availability is back to normal after an internal planning issue.

2018-06-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a two-week low and Treasury yields climbed on Monday as political tensions in Europe eased, while Wall Street stocks gained with technology shares as investors bet on continued strong economic growth. Italy’s anti-establishment parties formed a coalition government on Friday to end three months of deadlock. Italian bond yields fell after soaring last week on fears a snap election would be called that might effectively become a referendum on euro membership. The spread on Spanish bond yields over benchmark German Bunds also narrowed after a new prime minister was sworn in in Madrid, though Socialist Pedro Sanchez’s minority administration faces a tough baptism from a revived independence drive in Catalonia. At the same time, U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield hitting one-week highs, as investors pared safe-haven holdings of lower-risk government debt amid reduced anxiety about the political turmoil in Italy and Spain. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.9442 percent compared with 2.895 percent late on Friday.  The dollar index fell 0.18 percent to 94.04, with the euro up 0.04 percent to $1.1703. U.S. stocks rose, led by gains in technology shares. Strategists said Friday’s robust jobs data gave investors heightened confidence that the U.S. economy remained strong. The Nasdaq hit a record closing high, while the S&P technology index was up 0.8 percent.  “It’s kind of a reset from last week. The European situation improved. We saw our rates in the 10-year move up a little bit, which may be indicative of growth here in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “We had some follow-through from some of the data that was out on Friday. As you drill down on that employment report ... it shows not only a strong economy but an economy that’s broadening out. There’s this idea that U.S. growth is picking up and pulling away from the pack, so that was bullish for stocks today.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 178.48 points, or 0.72 percent, to 24,813.69, the S&P 500 gained 12.25 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,746.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.13 points, or 0.69 percent, to 7,606.46. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.7 percent. European shares rose 0.2 percent. While the risk of political crisis receded in Europe, concerns over a possible global trade war rumbled on in the background.  Finance ministers of the closest U.S. allies vented their anger on Saturday over Washington’s imposition of metal import tariffs, setting the tone for a heated G7 summit in Quebec. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week plays host to a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations with six of the seven members outraged at the United States over a slew of recent moves by President Trump. Trudeau, who wants the June 8-9 meeting to focus on economic growth, insists he can handle the challenge, though insiders and analysts say he will have to fight to keep the grouping together at a time when Trump’s trade and diplomatic moves have isolated the United States and risk undermining the G7’s relevance. Washington also remained at odds with Beijing. China warned the United States on Sunday that any bilateral agreements reached on trade and business would be void if Washington implemented tariffs and other trade measures. Oil prices slid, pressured by growing U.S. production, possible global supply growth and nagging trade tensions.

2018-06-04,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Italy’s Enel SpA (ENEI.MI) acquired 73 percent of the shares of Brazilian power company Eletropaulo (ELPL3.SA) on Monday, paying about 5.55 billion reais ($1.48 billion) to become Brazil’s largest electricity distributor. The offer on Monday, accepted by Eletropaulo shareholders, was a formality after Enel won a bidding war with Spain’s Iberdrola SA last week (IBE.MC) for Eletropaulo, Brazil’s largest power distribution company by revenue. Enel paid 45.22 reais per share, according to local exchange B3, which oversaw the auction and final offer. It also pledged to make a capital injection of 1.5 billion reais in Eletropaulo. With the deal, Enel overtakes CPFL Energia, which is controlled by China’s State Grid, to lead the Brazil market. Enel’s client base in power distribution in Brazil will jump to 17 million from 7 million. The company’s final price for the Brazilian company represents a 164 percent premium over the value of its shares in March, when the Italian firm first showed interest.  Besides Iberdrola, local company Energisa SA (ENGI11.SA) also contested the auction.

2018-06-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 2 percent on Monday, with U.S. crude touching its lowest level in nearly two months, breaking below technical support levels as investors kept selling amid growing U.S. production, possible global supply growth and nagging trade tensions.   Brent crude futures LCOc1 lost $1.50 a barrel, or 2 percent, to settle at $75.29 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 ended $1.06, or 1.6 percent, lower at $64.75 a barrel, after earlier touching $64.57, its lowest since April 10.     “We are breaking key levels of support now,” said Phillip Streible, analyst at RJO Futures in Chicago. “Once we started taking out $65.50 or so, it really started to accelerate. People are not really believing that the rally will continue,” he said.      Both benchmarks were pressured by the expectation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which has led output cuts of about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017, would soon boost output.       OPEC ministers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Algeria, along with their counterpart from non-OPEC Oman, met unofficially in Kuwait on Saturday. “It appears that some sellers may have delayed action ahead of the weekend and re-entered the short side after a meeting between the Saudis and the other Arab producers failed to offer additional insight,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note. OPEC meets formally on June 22. It is expected to agree to raise output to cool the market amid worries over Iranian and Venezuelan supply and after Washington raised concerns that the oil rally was going too far, OPEC sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters last month.  U.S. crude production climbed in March to 10.47 million bpd, a monthly record, the Energy Information Administration said  last week. “There’s been lot of talk about U.S. production continuing to rise. And it feels like once we hit Memorial Day, we hit a seasonal peak” for prices, which “ran up until the start of the summer season, and then hit a summer doldrums,” said RJO Futures’ Streible.  Last week, the week after Memorial Day, the U.S. crude  contract lost about 3 percent after a decline of nearly 5 percent the previous week. Data from market intelligence firm Genscape showed that between May 29 and June 1, crude inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub and delivery point for U.S. crude futures rose 210,046 barrels, a potentially bearish signal, traders who saw the data said. “The trade tariffs between EU, Mexico, and Canada and the friction with China are also weighing on crude oil,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago. Mexico will join the European Union in seeking World Trade Organization involvement over U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, its economy ministry said.

U.S. stocks rose on Monday led by gains in technology shares and helped by Friday’s robust jobs data, which gave investors heightened confidence that the U.S. economy remained strong. The technology sector boost added to continued investor optimism after Friday’s better-than expected jobs data, according to Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “On Fridays in the summer, there’s not a lot of people behind the desk.

2018-06-04,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal fund to help U.S. coal miners disabled by black lung disease will require a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout if Congress does not extend or increase the tax on coal production that funds it, according to a government report on Monday. Coal companies are currently required to pay a $1.10 per ton tax on underground coal production to finance the federal Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which pays medical and living expenses for eligible miners, but that amount is scheduled to revert to the 1977 level of 50 cents. “With the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease, our moderate case simulation suggests that expected revenue will likely be insufficient to cover combined black lung benefit payments and administrative costs, as well as debt repayment expenditures,” according to the report from the non-partisan Government Accountability Office. Cases of black lung, an incurable illness caused by inhaling coal dust, are rising to levels not seen in decades as miners plumb the depths of played-out coal seams using heavy blasting equipment, according to government health officials.  The fund that helps them is already roughly $6 billion in debt, as revenue since it was created in the 1970s has failed to keep up with outflows. That debt could balloon to $15 billion by 2050 without congressional action, the GAO report said. The GAO offered three options to improve the solvency of the fund: extend the current excise tax rate to reduce the debt to $4.5 billion debt by 2050, increase the current tax rate by approximately 25 percent to eliminate the debt entirely by 2050, or allow the tax rate to sunset as scheduled, cancel the current debt, and appropriate $7.8 billion to the fund.  That third option would amount to a multibillion-dollar transfer of liability for black lung victims from coal companies to taxpayers. The coal industry has been lobbying hard against the tax, arguing its payments have already been too high at a difficult time for mining companies and that the fund has been abused by undeserving applicants, such as smokers. Ashley Burke, spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, rejected the idea the tax should be increased. “There is no need for a tax increase on the coal industry. The only reason borrowing has been necessary is for the government to essentially repay itself for accumulated interest payments on legacy debt from the 70s and 80s,” she said.      A bipartisan effort by lawmakers to extend the current coal tax failed earlier this year after the coal industry lobbied Republican House leadership not to take it up.  Democratic Representatives Bobby Scott of Virginia and Sander Levin of Michigan requested the GAO study in 2016 to clarify the fund’s financial condition.   Scott told Reuters the report should compel Congress to take action to extend or increase the coal excise tax. “The existing black lung excise tax rate on coal companies is imperative to the long-term solvency of the trust fund,” Scott said in a statement.  The fund currently provides medical coverage and monthly payments for living expenses to more than 25,000 people.  The Trump administration has not yet weighed in on the potential insolvency of the fund, making future policy options to address the debt uncertain, Scott said. The United Mineworkers Union of America, the coal miners’ trade union, called on Congress to ensure that the excise tax coal companies now pay remains at current levels, especially as the incidence of the disease continues to rise and affect younger miners. “This is a problem that has been created by the coal industry, there is a system to help the victims of this disease already in place that the coal industry pays for, and I see no reason why we would put the taxpayers on the hook instead,” said Cecil Roberts, president of the UMWA.

2018-06-04,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Daimler (DAIGn.DE) said planned launches of battery-powered luxury cars were on schedule on Monday following a report in Germany’s Handelsblatt that they were facing delays because of battery shortages and other technical problems. The German business daily said that Daimler’s new “EQC” electric midsize sport-utility vehicle will not hit dealerships until June 2019, several months after originally planned. But a spokesman at Daimler’s Stuttgart headquarters said it has not yet specified a launch date for the EQC model. Handelsblatt also reported that a battery-powered version of Mercedes’ redesigned S-Class flagship saloon will not be available until 2021, a year after the combustion engine model is due to come to market, citing unnamed Daimler sources. The Daimler spokesman told Reuters that development of a plug-in hybrid version of the new S-Class was going to plan. “We are on target, there are no delays,” he said. Battery production could become a major choke point for vehicle electrification as more automakers shift their model lineups to electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids.    By 2022, Mercedes plans to offer an electric version of every model it sells, with a total of at least 50 electric or hybrid models for sale. The Smart brand will stop offering cars with combustion engines altogether in 2020.

Large French companies active in Iran, including oil major Total (TOTF.PA), are struggling to obtain exemptions from the sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. “The group has begun to suspend its joint venture activities, to comply with U.S. law by Aug. 6,” PSA said in a statement on Monday.  “With the support of the French government, the Groupe PSA is engaging with the U.S. authorities to consider a waiver.” European signatories are scrambling to save the international deal, which seeks to protect trade with Iran in return for curbing the country’s nuclear programme. PSA and its French rival Renault (RENA.PA) moved swiftly to sign new production deals to upgrade their pre-sanctions partnerships with Iran Khodro and SAIPA. Production deals worth 700 million euros ($818 million) have been signed by PSA, while Renault has announced a new plant investment to increase production capacity to 350,000 vehicles a year.

2018-06-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - Golar LNG (GLNG.O) said it had started commercial operations at a pioneering floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) production platform in Cameroon, $70 million under budget. It is the first FLNG vessel of its kind and is likely to boost demand for Golar’s technology in Africa and beyond.  The Hilli Episeyo FLNG vessel, converted from an ageing tanker for $1.2 billion, produced the first LNG on March 12 but only exported its first cargo in May, to China, after technical issues delayed a ramp up in production.  After continuously producing LNG over 16 days at an average of 7,500 cubic metres/day, Golar’s project clients have contractually accepted the facility, marking its commercial start, Golar said in a statement.   Golar is in talks to develop similar projects in Senegal-Mauritania with BP (BP.L) and with Ophir Energy (OPHR.L) in Equatorial Guinea.  The successful start-up removes uncertainty about the risks associated with squeezing a liquefaction plant typically spanning hundreds of acres on land into a single, 1970s-built ship with four liquefaction units bolted onto its sides.  Trading companies and oil majors are keen on the technology for its relatively low cost and ability to unlock stranded reserves beyond the reach of pipelines.  Developer Golar provides the liquefaction facility and services under a production tolling agreement with oil firm Perenco and Cameroon’s state-run Societe Nationale Des Hydrocarbures (SNH). All of the plant’s 1.2 million tonne annual output was sold, via a competitive tender, by Perenco to Gazprom Marketing & Trading (GAZP.MM) for eight years.  In a statement, Golar LNG said commercial tolling fees will add about $164 million to its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization annually, plus an estimated $45 million in operating cash flow based on current oil prices.  All told, the Hilly Episeyo came in $70 million under budget, Golar said, a rarity in the LNG industry where project costs routinely balloon billions of dollars over budget.

While the risk of political crisis receded in Europe, concerns over a possible global trade war rumbled on in the background. Finance ministers of the closest U.S. allies vented their anger on Saturday over Washington’s imposition of metal import tariffs, setting the tone for a heated G7 summit in Quebec. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week plays host to a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations with six of the seven members outraged at the United States over a slew of recent moves by President Trump. Trudeau, who wants the June 8-9 meeting to focus on economic growth, insists he can handle the challenge, though insiders and analysts say he will have to fight to keep the grouping together at a time when Trump’s trade and diplomatic moves have isolated the United States and risk undermining the G7’s relevance. Washington also remained at odds with Beijing after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. China warned the United States on Sunday that any bilateral agreements reached on trade and business would be void if Washington implemented tariffs and other trade measures. But this did not stop Asian shares from rallying. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.39 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.37 percent. In the oil market, U.S. crude fell 1.46 percent to $64.85 per barrel and Brent was last at $75.46, down 1.73 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York;

2018-06-04,"(Adds oil deal with Bonatti) By Lamine Chikhi ALGIERS, June 4 (Reuters) - Algeria has hired U.S. law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP and other consultancies to help with a new energy law aimed at attracting much-needed investment, the CEO of state energy firm Sonatrach said on Monday. The OPEC producer, which is also a major gas supplier to Europe, has been trying to attract more foreign investors, but firms have been reluctant, complaining about bureaucracy and tough terms. The North African country has been working on a new law but it is unclear when it will be ready as many players are involved, Sonatrach CEO Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour told reporters. Debate over reforms is often slowed by competing ideas inside a government with a history of state planning and where the ruling old guard remains wary of opening up the country. “I have been told that we have in Algeria 40 million experts in football, but now I found out that we also have 40 million Algerians expert in oil and gas,” Kaddour said. “But the sooner we have an attractive law, the better,” he said, without giving a date. “Foreign firms want to know how much they will get when they will invest.” Kaddour, a U.S. trained engineer, has been trying to attract foreign firms by fixing legal disputes, as Algeria wants to boost oil and gas revenues that halved between 2014 and 2017. Algeria has struggled in the past to increase oil and gas output without major foreign investment. Kaddour also said Sonatrach had signed a deal worth 85 million euros ($100 million) with Italian firm Bonatti to lift oil production at the Menzel Lejmat Nord field to 30,000 barrels a day (bpd) from the current 17.000 bpd. The field is run with Indonesia’s state energy firm Pertamina and Talisman, part of Repsol. Algeria’s oil production stands at more than 1 million bpd day and its gas output is around 135 billion cubic metre per year. $1 = 0.8535 euros

2018-06-04,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Angola Girassol vs. WTI Houston crude: reut.rs/2Lk7Twa By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 4 (Reuters) - A tsunami of U.S. crude oil should be headed toward Asia, according to pricing on futures exchanges, but the reality in the physical market tells a somewhat different story. The discount in the futures markets of the main U.S. light crude grade, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), to the global benchmark Brent crude CL-LCO1=R stood at $11.09 a barrel on June 1, the widest in more than three years. And it’s not just a front-month aberration, with WTI’s discount to Brent for crude for delivery in six months CL-LCO6=R at $10.71 a barrel on June 1, the most since September 2014. The pricing of WTI and Brent suggest that U.S. crude is now so cheap compared to its main competitor that refiners across the world, but especially in the main consuming region of Asia, should be snapping up vast quantities. There is some evidence to suggest that this has happened in recent weeks, with vessel-tracking data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts pointing to record arrivals of U.S. crude in Asia in June. About 883,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. crude is expected to land at Asian ports in June, up from 769,000 bpd in May, which was the previous high for U.S. crude exports to Asia. While there may be scope for U.S. exports to push higher in coming months, they will probably be limited by both infrastructure constraints and a weakening of the economics. While the paper futures market makes a compelling case for U.S. crude exports, pricing in the physical markets is far less convincing. The price of WTI crude free-on-board at Houston , as assessed by Argus Media, was $73.71 a barrel on June 1, a premium of $7.90 a barrel, or 12 percent, to WTI futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That means an Asian buyer of physical WTI crude for loading in Texas is paying quite a significant premium over the price of paper oil in the futures market. The premium has risen sharply in recent weeks, given that it was closer to $3 a barrel at the end of April. Further out along the curve also shows a widening premium for physical WTI crude over the futures, with December Houston WTI being $7 a barrel more expensive than the equivalent futures contract as at the end of May. While physical WTI crude is currently at a strong premium to the futures, the opposite is the case when comparing paper Brent crude to the prices of similar physical grades. Brent futures closed at $76.79 a barrel on June 1, above the $75.24 for Nigeria’s Bonny Light BON-E and the $74.34 for Angola’s Girassol grade. Putting the numbers together shows that an Asian refiner seeking light, sweet crude, could have on June 1 bought a cargo from Angola at just 63 cents a barrel more than one from Houston. This small advantage in favour of WTI from Houston would more than likely be eaten up by the increase in shipping costs, given that Texas is a far longer voyage to Asia than is Angola. Overall, the seemingly huge advantage that WTI enjoys over crudes priced against Brent disappears once you make the jump from the paper to the physical markets. While arbitrage investors may enjoy such a situation, the current pricing of physical crude oil suggests that U.S. shipments to Asia may struggle to be competitive in the second half of the year. One side issue worth mentioning is the potential impact of geopolitical concerns. If China and the United States do manage to reach some kind of trade consensus, it may encourage Chinese buying of U.S. crude, even if it doesn’t necessarily make economic sense. On the other hand, an escalating trade dispute may see China’s state-owned refiners take less U.S. crude, and so far, it’s far from certain which is the more likely of those two outcomes.

2018-06-04,"DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has created a subsidiary to house its multibillion-dollar pension fund and could spin off its aviation division, sources said, as it restructures some assets not related to oil and gas ahead of its planned initial public offering (IPO). The move is designed to streamline Aramco’s operations and could make it easier to value since its business risk would be clearer and that may help it achieve a higher price for its shares, financial and industry sources told Reuters. “This makes Aramco a leaner company,” said one source familiar with Aramco’s plans. The state-owned oil giant declined to comment on the pension fund move or plans for its aviation division. The listing of Aramco, which is likely to happen next year,     is the centerpiece of the government’s ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify the kingdom’s economy beyond oil. Crown Prince Mohammed has said he expects the IPO to value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion, meaning a sale of 5 percent could raise $100 billion to help fund Vision 2030 projects. Analysts have valued Aramco at $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion. Saudi Arabia has often tasked Aramco with carrying out government projects that have social goals and are too big or daunting for the private sector, such as building industrial cities, stadiums and cultural centers.  The world’s largest oil exporter also has its own schools, housing, airline fleet and hospitals that are used by its roughly 55,000 employees as well as their families. But potential investors in what is expected to the biggest IPO in history may not want exposure to such a complicated array of assets that would not be as profitable as Aramco’s core oil business, financial sources said. Aramco created a new subsidiary for its in-house multibillion-dollar retirement fund management unit about six months ago, sources familiar with the matter said.  The fund, now called Wisayah, is being run by a small team of financial professionals in Dhahran, where Aramco’s headquarters is based, one of the sources said.  “This is best practice. It sets up nice clean lines so the money can’t be used for other business activities,” a second source familiar with the move told Reuters. Besides the pension fund, two sources said Aramco could spin off some non-oil units such as its aviation division, by either forming a joint venture to manage it or bringing in an outside company to operate the fleet. Aramco Aviation operates about 10 jets such as Boeing 737s and Embraer 170s, as well as helicopters that transfer employees and visitors to oil and refining plants across Saudi Arabia. Aramco formed a joint venture with U.S. construction firm Jacobs Engineering Group last year to take on the project management of government infrastructure and other projects not related to oil, as part of its IPO preparations. Another joint venture that falls outside the traditional scope of an oil company is Aramco’s Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare Company JV created in 2013 with the U.S. hospital to provide medical care for Aramco employees and their families.  One source said the joint venture may open up to the public and not just serve the company’s employees. Aramco has often defended taking on projects outside its core oil and gas business as part of its corporate social responsibility for the community.  But Aramco’s involvement in ventures such as the Al-Jawhara football stadium in Jeddah or managing floodwater drainage there has prompted criticism internally that its manpower is not being used effectively. “Aramco doesn’t only look at its oil and gas related interests but it is also a channel and mechanism for the nation. This drains Aramco’s resources both in terms of money and its core people,” said one industry source working in Saudi Arabia. “If I am an investor I need to be very clear what I am investing into, it cannot be fuzzy.” Writing by Rania El Gamal; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-ipo-restructuring/saudi-aramco-restructures-non-oil-assets-ahead-of-ipo-sources-idUKL5N1T15ZU,04 Jun 2018,"Saudi Aramco

2018-06-04,"(Adds U.S. futures, adds detail and updates prices) * Political worries ease in Italy, Spain * Strong data confirms U.S. economic momentum * Trade frictions still undermining investor confidence By Kit Rees LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Global shares rose on Monday as worries over a trade war between the United States and other major economies took a back seat, with investors focusing on an easing of political risks in Europe and strong U.S. jobs data. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, climbed 0.4 percent, while European stocks continued on their road to recovery with a 0.5 percent rise by 1107 GMT as tensions calmed in Italy and Spain. “The mood is mainly positive due to better U.S. job creation seen in (Friday’s) NFP data, which has carried stocks higher despite headwinds such as escalating trade disputes,” analysts at FX Pro Insights said. “The risk is that sentiment shifts and catches traders off balance as volatility increases.” Following a week in which Italian stocks hit their lowest since July, Italy’s anti-establishment parties formed a coalition government on Friday to end three months of political deadlock. Italian bond yields fell. They soared last week on fears a snap election would be called that might effectively become a referendum on euro membership. The spread on Spanish bond yields over benchmark German Bunds also narrowed after a new prime minister was sworn in in Madrid, though Socialist Pedro Sanchez’s minority administration faces a tough baptism from a revived independence drive in Catalonia. The euro traded at $1.1723, well clear of Tuesday’s 10-month low of $1.1506. While the risk of political crisis receded in Europe, concerns over a possible global trade war rumbled on in the background. Finance ministers of the closest U.S. allies vented their anger on Saturday over Washington’s imposition of metal import tariffs, setting the tone for a heated G7 summit next week in Quebec. In a rare open show of divisions among the club of wealthy nations, six of the G7 member countries issued a statement asking U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to convey their “unanimous concern and disappointment” to President Donald Trump. “The G7 summit this weekend could be equally terrible. There’s even talk that Trump may not go. Concerns on trade frictions are likely to continue to weigh on markets,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Washington also remained at odds with Beijing after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He either. China warned the United States on Sunday that any bilateral agreements reached on trade and business would be void if Washington implemented tariffs and other trade measures. But this did not stop Asian shares from rallying. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.3 percent to a high last seen on May 17, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.4 percent. Likewise stocks futures pointed to a positive start for Wall Street, with EMini futures for the S&P 500 up 0.3 percent. Signs of strength in the U.S. economy helped keep bears at bay. Data released on Friday showed U.S. job growth accelerated in May and the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, indicating a rapidly tightening labour market. “We had strong headline figures on employment but the rise in wages was still well-contained and did not point to a sharp acceleration in inflation,” Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. The strong report added to a string of upbeat economic data, including consumer spending, industrial production and construction spending, making the Federal Reserve all but certain to raise interest rates at its policy meeting next week. U.S. Treasury yields edged higher, with 10-year paper at 2.9076 percent, while the dollar eased 0.4 percent against its currency basket to 93.802. U.S. crude futures traded lower at $65.40, back at their lowest levels in nearly two months. Rising U.S. crude production and a glut due to a lack of pipeline capacity have pressured prices. Global benchmark Brent was down 1.3 percent at $75.76.

2018-06-04,"(Repeats for wider distribution.) By Jessica Resnick-Ault and David French NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - The planned exit of BHP Billiton Ltd  from its U.S. shale business has drawn oil companies and private equity firms into a competition that may have no clear winner until late this year or early next year, according to people familiar with the negotiations. BHP, the world’s largest miner, said in August that it would exit its U.S. shale oil and gas business after pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns a stake in the company and argued the unit was a drag on BHP’s value. The Anglo-Australian company’s Houston-based BHP Petroleum unit holds more than 838,000 acres spread across four U.S. shale plays: Texas’ Permian and Eagle Ford basins and the Haynesville and Fayetteville formations of Arkansas. A divestiture of all of that land would be among the largest shale acreage sales to date. BHP is offering to sell off acreage in seven different packages spanning three formations; it has generated interest from oil companies that paired with private equity firms to bid on all the assets, as well as from companies looking at individual packages. First bids were received last week, but no deal is expected until very late in 2018 or early 2019, according to two of the people familiar with the matter who, like all the sources, could not speak for attribution as the negotiations are not public. It was currently unclear whether BHP may hold a second bid round with certain bidders or all of them, or it may opt to continue weighing the received bids toward securing a preferred deal. The long delay can be explained by the sheer scale of the process and the number of parties involved, although bankers have also been critical of BHP’s approach which has been regarded as slow-moving throughout. Bidders include consortiums of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Blackstone Group LP, advised by Jefferies; and Chevron Corp partnered with Warburg Pincus, the people familiar with the matter said. Apollo Global Management LLC is bidding solo, while BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters last month that it could place a bid. A BHP spokeswoman declined to comment on the details of the sale. However, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said at a conference in Florida last month that there was “encouraging interest from potential bidders,” and that the higher oil prices and lower U.S. corporate tax rates than when the plan was first announced last summer were supporting the process. BP, Shell, Chevron, Blackstone and Warburg Pincus declined to comment. Apollo did not respond to a comment request. BHP values the entirety of the acreage at $14 billion, but analysts have pegged the total value of the assets lower - at a maximum of $9 billion. Bidding in consortiums would allow the integrated oil companies to focus on acreage that complemented their holdings, such as that in the Permian, while the private equity firms would take on gas-rich acreage in the Haynesville formation. The acreage includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12 billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, as appetite for shale gas assets reached fever pitch. Shale gas assets have lost value as natural gas prices fell from about $4.50 in mid 2011 to a low of $1.60 in 2016. Prices have since recovered to about $2.93 per MMBtu. Buyout houses are also dominant in the sale process for the gassy Fayetteville assets, the bid deadline for which was in late April, having been marketed separately from the rest of BHP’s shale portfolio. Barclays Plc and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch are running the sale process. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs had also helped BHP research the potential spin-off of the unit into a new company, should divestment prove unachievable, Reuters previously reported.

2018-06-04,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Motiva Enterprises has decided not to add processing capacity at its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, according to a company spokeswoman, fallout from last summer’s Hurricane Harvey that knocked nearly a quarter of all U.S. crude capacity offline. The decision, which puts Motiva on a path to buy or build another refining plant in the United States, is a significant change in the refiner’s plans from two months ago when the company’s chief executive, Brian Coffman, said Motiva was weighing adding up to 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) of processing capacity to the company’s sole U.S. refinery, the 603,000 bpd Port Arthur refinery.  The U.S. refining unit of Saudi Aramco remains committed to “investigating opportunities to return to a refining scale of 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day, (but) we do not expect to achieve this increased refining scale through the Port Arthur Refinery,” company spokeswoman Angela Goodwin told Reuters. “We are actively exploring a number of opportunities and locations as part of our growth strategy,” Goodwin said.  Motiva, like other refiners hard-hit by inundating rains from Harvey, also is adding more pumps to remove water from the Port Arthur refinery to deal with future storms, she said. Goodwin cited “commercial sensitivity” in declining to discuss why the company shifted the expansion from Port Arthur, but people familiar with Motiva’s plans said the decision stems from the Port Arthur Refinery’s shutdown after Harvey flooded the area. “They’re not going to do it in Port Arthur,” one of the sources said. “They don’t want all of their capacity shut like it was during Harvey. They still want to be making gasoline somewhere else while everyone is shut during a storm.” Hurricane Harvey last year dropped more than 60 inches (1.5 m) of rain over southeastern Texas, halting refineries that account for a quarter of U.S. production of gasoline, jet fuel and diesel and most of its fuel exports. The storm caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to energy infrastructure and pushed up fuel prices for weeks.     Other Gulf Coast refiners, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Total SA, are bolstering their storm defences, while an industry group is urging federal funding of an offshore dike that would protect the refining centre from storm surges. Total is adding generators and pumps at its 225,500 bpd refinery, also in Port Arthur, said spokeswoman Marie Maitre. It experienced a plant-wide power outage as Harvey drenched east Texas.   At Exxon’s refinery in Beaumont, Texas, 18 miles (29 km) north of Port Arthur, the company is raising an existing 10-foot flood wall by four feet, said people familiar with its operations. The company is considering expanding the Beaumont refinery and two others along the Gulf Coast to double its ability to process growing U.S. shale oil, but has not reached a final decision.  Refiners and other industries are advocating for a storm surge barrier to prevent future storms from pushing water in nearby Galveston Bay and flood refining centres in Texas City, Texas, and Houston.  “We, along with a broad coalition of our industry peers, have asked federal officials to build a ‘coastal spine,’ a protective barrier,” said Chevalier Gray, spokeswoman at LyondellBasell Industries , which operates a Houston refinery. Lyondell’s refinery, which sits on higher ground, remained in operation during Harvey.

2018-06-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should force large companies, pension funds and other big investors to report their exposure to climate risks by 2022 at the latest, a cross-party group of lawmakers said in a report published on Monday. Concerns in the investment community that assets are being mispriced because climate risk is not being factored into financial reporting have prompted demand for more transparent climate-related financial information. The report said companies should examine and disclose how climate change could impact their businesses in the future, such as increased exposure to extreme weather events for insurance companies and the impact of physical disruptions to supply chains for companies in the agriculture sector. Think-tank Climate Tracker has also warned that trillions of dollars are at risk globally due to so-called stranded assets, which include oil and gas reserves, that cannot be burnt if global climate targets are to be met. “Climate change poses financial risks to a range of investments – from food and farming, to infrastructure, construction and insurance liability,” Mary Creagh, chair of the Environment Audit Committee, said in a statement published with the group’s report. “The low-carbon transition also presents exciting opportunities in clean energy, transport and tech that could benefit UK businesses,” she said. The report said the government has encouraged publicly listed companies to report climate risk but said a voluntary approach is ineffective. “The government should make climate risk reporting mandatory on a ‘comply or explain’ basis by 2022,” the report said. A spokesman for Britain’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said Britain was a world leader in green finance and had cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40 percent since 1990. Last year the government also set up a green finance task force of financial experts, including London Stock Exchange CEO Nikhil Rathi, to look at ways to help boost jobs and investment in the low-carbon sector. “We’ll consider the findings of this report alongside our review of the Green Finance Taskforce’s proposals to encourage companies to put greater emphasis on environmental considerations when making decisions,” the spokesman said by email. There is growing international momentum behind moves to encourage financial reporting on sustainability.

2018-06-04,"THANH HOA, Vietnam (Reuters) - There’s almost more plastic than sand on this long, tree-lined beach: Plastic helmets, plastic furniture and the plastic leg of a shop mannequin all jut out of an ocean of blue plastic bags. Just south of the capital Hanoi, the once-peaceful and clean beach of Da Loc in Vietnam’s Thanh Hoa province, has been slowly suffocating under the weight of plastic waste for decades. “Plastic bags have been waste here since the first day we started using them,” said Pham Thi Lai, 60, a local seafood processor. “They put everything in a plastic bag. If they’re preserving shrimp or preserving fish, they put it in a plastic bag,” Lai said of local fishermen, many of whom shuck clam shells and dry shrimp between the mounds of plastic waste on the beach. “When they finish they just throw the bags into the ocean. The trash floats to wherever the sea level rises,” she said. Vietnam is the fourth-largest contributor to marine plastic pollution globally, a 2015 study by the University of Georgia showed. Globally, eight million tonnes of plastic is dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, according to the U.N. Environment Programme. The latest example was a pilot whale that died in Thailand with some 80 pieces of plastic rubbish found in its stomach. The theme of World Environment Day on Tuesday is beating plastic pollution, with a call for citizens, companies and civil society groups to organize the “biggest-ever worldwide cleanup”. On Monday, 41 embassies and international organizations in Vietnam signed a pledge to combat plastic pollution in the country. “As international partners, we have the privilege to work in Vietnam, and have a collective responsibility to reduce our plastic footprint in this beautiful country,” Canadian ambassador Ping Kitnikone said in a statement. The problem in Vietnam has become so bad that some people in tourist areas have started handing out reusable bags made from rattan, and use newspapers to wrap market produce. Officials in charge of the beach at Da Loc have struggled to keep up with the rising tide of waste. “Water rises and falls everyday, how can we clean it all?” said Ngo Ngoc Dinh, head of Da Loc People’s Committee. “We can’t escape it, we have to solve it ourselves”. “But we hope proper campaigns can help reduce environmental waste”.

2018-06-04,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Airlines are locking in fuel hedges, lowering capacity, raising fares and retiring older jets to cope with rising costs alongside the highest oil prices since 2014, industry executives say. The squeeze from fuel costs, which have risen much faster than ticket prices, poses a particular threat to the industry’s profitability.  The International Air Transport Association on Monday forecast airlines’ combined profits would be 12 percent lower than it had expected in December, at $33.8 billion in total, in large part because of costlier fuel. Brent crude is trading at around $76 a barrel, up nearly 50 percent from a year ago. “At this point with rising fuel, you control costs, raise prices and you may have some fall off in demand and reduce capacity,” Air New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon told Reuters on Monday.  “I think we are seeing pricing move up internationally and certainly yields come up as well,” he added. IATA forecast passenger yields, a proxy for airfares, will rise by 3.2 percent this year, in the first annual gains since 2011, as airlines look to recoup rising costs.  American Airlines CEO Doug Parker also forecast that fares could rise as capacity is reined in amid higher oil prices. China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd has said it would consider using newly launched yuan-denominated oil futures to hedge oil for the first time in a decade, but others, like Emirates and Delta Air Lines have no plans to return to hedging as a result of the recent oil price increases. “I think rushing to get hedged when the prices go up is a bit dumb and when they go down they get complacent again,” CAPA Centre for Aviation Executive Chairman Peter Harbison said. IATA chief economist Brian Pearce said hedging only delays the impact. “It stabilizes earnings; it doesn’t stop the rising costs happening,” he said.       Other carriers, such as Singapore Airlines Ltd and Air New Zealand Ltd, are well-hedged at lower prices but are being forced to hedge at higher prices as those contracts end, in keeping with their internal policies. For example, London-listed IAG, the parent of British Airways, hedges up to three years in advance on a rolling basis. That means 80 percent of its fuel is hedged for the current first three months, a number that drops to 10 percent in the final quarter of the three-year period. “Whilst most of us have hedging in place, that hedging eventually runs out or gets replaced by new positions you have got, and it is a question then of what do you do?” Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd CEO John Borghetti said. “If you look at history, typically some of that cost has to be passed on at some point because you just simply can’t absorb it.” European carriers are also hedged between 50 and 90 percent as a way to give them better control of costs. “We take a simple view that hedging is about buying time; it gives you time to address volatility,” said IAG’s chief executive, Willie Walsh.  The higher oil price is also expected to drive a new cycle of airlines’ replacing older jets with more efficient newer generation models like the A320neo and 737 MAX narrowbodies and the A350, A330neo and 787 widebodies.  Australia’s Qantas Airways Ltd is retiring gas-guzzling Boeing Co 747s more quickly than it had originally forecast and replacing them with twin-engine 787s. “It will be a bittersweet moment when those aircraft will go but it also helps us manage the increase in fuel prices,” Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said Monday. “The 787s are going to give us a big benefit this year on our international operation.” Boeing Commercial Airplanes vice president of marketing Randy Tinseth said on Sunday that replacement makes sense for airlines when oil reaches $65 a barrel. “Fuel is definitely an issue and it is eating into profitability,” said Mylene Scholnick, principal at consultancy ICF. “When fuel comes down, the airlines keep aircraft longer, so we had seen ages pushed to 28, 30 years. Now with fuel back up, it won’t bring down the retirement age drastically but will stabilize it at around 25 years.” Reporting by Jamie Freed and Victoria Bryan; Editing by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/airlines-iata-hedging/airlines-adjusting-hedges-fares-capacity-and-fleet-as-oil-price-jumps-idUKL3N1SM1DU,04 Jun 2018,"Airlines are locking in fuel

2018-06-04,"(Updates details on N.Korea-U.S. summit) By Tom Finn and Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - May was a manic month for markets but brace yourself for June. An unprecedented summit between North Korea and the United States is back on the agenda, and there are other events on the radar to potentially convulse world markets — from Turkish elections to a Swiss referendum on a new money system. Here are six events, listed chronologically, that investors will be watching in June: POSSIBLE SWISS SHOCK - JUNE 10 Switzerland holds a referendum on June 10 on whether to introduce a sovereign money system that would shake up how its banks operate. The measure, if passed, would bar commercial banks from creating money every time they make a loan. Supporters want the Swiss National Bank to be the only authority producing new money in the country. But the SNB argues the plan will damage its ability to conduct monetary policy. If the referendum passes, investors could lose faith in the Swiss franc since money-printing will not be backed by assets. It could also hurt the profits of Swiss banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse. Opinion polls show just 35 percent support for the change, but as Brexit and the 2016 U.S. election showed, electoral upsets can happen. FED UP - JUNE 12-13 On June 12-13, the U.S. Federal Reserve should deliver what will be the second of three interest rate hikes expected for this year. Rates should rise to 1.75-2.0 percent. The question now is whether the Fed might squeeze in a fourth rate rise in 2018. That likelihood lifted the dollar in May to its best month since November 2016. U.S. interest rates and Treasury yields are the main reference rate for global borrowing costs so Fed chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting statement will be closely watched to gauge the central bank’s intentions. The U.S. economy is enjoying its second-longest expansion since World War Two, with unemployment at a 17-year low. On the other hand, trade tensions pose risks to growth. A hawkish note from Powell could well fuel a fresh surge in the dollar and U.S. yields. TRUMP AND KIM - TO MEET OR NOT TO MEET Kim Jong Un is preparing for a high-stakes summit with Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, the first such meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting U.S. president. North Korea re-engagement timeline: tmsnrt.rs/2KSGocU Trump, who revived the summit on Friday after cancelling it a week earlier, wants North Korea to get rid of its nuclear arsenal, in return for relief from economic sanctions. North Korea’s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival, while Kim has said he plans to focus on economic development. Hopes the talks would avert the North Korean nuclear threat have lifted world equities. With Brent crude recently soaring to $80 per barrel, a June 22 oil producers’ meeting in Vienna will be monitored by global policymakers and market players. Since early 2017, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and some other non-OPEC producers have curbed oil output. The pact runs until the end of 2018 and the Vienna meeting will discuss whether to extend it. But oil’s 30 percent rise since end-2016 has fanned inflation fears — the U.S. 10-year bond yield recently surged to seven-year highs. Oil has slipped somewhat after Russia and de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia discussed partly restoring output halted under the 2017 accord. But some other producers oppose raising production, so consensus could be hard to achieve. Analysts reckon Brent will remain comfortably above $70 a barrel this year. Turkey, once counted among the most promising emerging markets, has suffered a massive currency and bond sell-off this year. It holds an election on June 24, with Tayyip Erdogan expected to be re-elected to a newly empowered executive presidency. Erdogan has overseen strong economic growth in his 15 years in power but his plans to take greater control of the economy and monetary policy and a deepening crackdown on opponents criticised by rights groups and Western allies have unnerved many investors. Polls show support for Erdogan’s AK Party and its nationalist partner at only around 50 percent, however, so a loss of parliamentary control may offset some of his sweeping powers. Turkey is struggling to stabilize the lira, which has plunged as much as 20 percent this year versus the dollar . A recent 3 percentage point emergency increase in interest rates was almost immediately undermined by Erdogan, a self-confessed “enemy of interest rates”. The central bank meets formally on June 7 and could take further steps to stabilise the currency With time running out for Britain to secure a deal before exiting the European Union next March, diplomats are hoping an EU summit on June 28-29 could break the deadlock. British Prime Minister Theresa May remains stuck between a rock and a hard place, with Brexit supporters pushing to sever EU ties and others advocating keeping customs cooperation with the bloc. A government white paper due before the talks will outline plans for various sectors, including financial services and agriculture. Uncertainty over Britain’s future EU ties continue to weigh on the economy and the pound, which is on course for a sixth weekly loss out of the last seven. The EU says London is yet to come up with a viable solution for the Irish border — the fear is that reinstating a physical border, including for customs, between EU-member Ireland and Britain’s Northern Ireland province could revive violence there.

2018-06-04,"* Political worries ease in Italy, Spain * Strong data confirms U.S. economic momentum * Trade frictions still undermining investor confidence By Kit Rees LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Global shares rose on Monday as worries over a trade war between the United States and other major economies took a back seat, with investors focusing on an easing of political risks in Europe and strong U.S. jobs data. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.4 percent, while European stocks enjoyed a positive start to the day’s trading as tensions calmed in Italy and Spain. “The mood is mainly positive due to better U.S. job creation seen in (Friday’s) NFP data, which has carried stocks higher despite headwinds such as escalating trade disputes,” analysts at FX Pro Insights said. “The risk is that sentiment shifts and catches traders off balance as volatility increases.” Following a week in which Italian stocks hit their lowest since July, Italy’s anti-establishment parties formed a coalition government on Friday to end three months of political deadlock. Italian bond yields fell in early trade. They soared last week on fears a snap election would be called that might effectively become a referendum on euro membership. The spread on Spanish bond yields over benchmark German Bunds also narrowed after a new prime minister was sworn in in Madrid, though Socialist Pedro Sanchez’s minority administration faces a tough baptism from a revived independence drive in Catalonia. The euro traded at $1.1687, well clear of Tuesday’s 10-month low of $1.1506. While the risk of political crisis receded in Europe, concerns over a possible global trade war rumbled on in the background. Finance ministers of the closest U.S. allies vented their anger on Saturday over Washington’s imposition of metal import tariffs, setting the tone for a heated G7 summit next week in Quebec. In a rare open show of divisions among the club of wealthy nations, six of the G7 member countries issued a statement asking U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to convey their “unanimous concern and disappointment” to President Donald Trump. “The G7 summit this weekend could be equally terrible. There’s even talk that Trump may not go. Concerns on trade frictions are likely to continue to weigh on markets,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Washington also remained at odds with Beijing after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He either. China warned the United States on Sunday that any bilateral agreements reached on trade and business would be void if Washington implemented tariffs and other trade measures. But this did not stop Asian shares from rallying. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.2 percent to a high last seen on May 17, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.4 percent. Signs of strength in the U.S. economy helped keep bears at bay. Data released on Friday showed U.S. job growth accelerated in May and the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, indicating a rapidly tightening labour market. “We had strong headline figures on employment but the rise in wages was still well-contained and did not point to a sharp acceleration in inflation,” Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. The strong report added to a string of upbeat economic data, including consumer spending, industrial production and construction spending, making the Federal Reserve all but certain to raise interest rates at its policy meeting next week. U.S. Treasury yields continued to climb, with 10-year paper at 2.9131 percent, while the dollar eased 0.2 percent against its currency basket to 93.993. U.S. crude futures traded flat at $65.79, having fallen as low as $65.51 per barrel on Friday - their lowest in almost two months. Rising U.S. crude production and a glut due to a lack of pipeline capacity have pressured prices. Global benchmark Brent was down 0.3 percent at $76.59.

2018-06-04,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam plans to more than triple the amount of electricity it produces from renewable sources and push for a 26 percent increase in household solar energy usage by 2030, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told Reuters in an interview. Speaking ahead of Vietnam’s participation in the expanded G7 summit that will be held in Canada from June 8 to 9, Phuc also said he hopes the country can utilize its roughly 20 million tonnes of rare earth reserves, which he said are the world’s third-largest, in building new energy technologies. “Vietnam is blessed with immense potential for clean renewable energy development,” Phuc said in a written response to questions from Reuters. “We wish to cooperate in research and development and transfer of advanced technologies in mining and in-depth processing of rare earth in order to create high value-added and environment-friendly products,” Phuc said. Vietnam’s largest rare earth mine is located in the northern province of Lai Chau, near the border with China. The metallic minerals are essential for technologies such as wind turbines, electric car batteries, solar panels and smartphones. Vietnam has been seeking to promote renewable energy development to reduce its increasing reliance on coal for electricity generation. According to its Strategy of Renewable Energy Development, by 2030 Vietnam plans to reduce its use of coal products by 40 million tonnes, Phuc said. Vietnam will consume 156.6 million tonnes of the fuel by 2030, according to a forecast in a 2016 report on the Ministry of Industry and Trade website. By that time, coal-fired power plants will account for 53 percent of Vietnam’s total power generation capacity, compared with the current level of 45 percent, the Ministry said. The country’s hydropower potential has almost been fully exploited and its oil and gas reserves are running low amid stalled efforts to tap new fields in the South China Sea, where Vietnam has maritime disputes with China. Vietnam will “increase the electricity output produced from renewable sources from approximately 58 billion kWh (kilowatt hours) in 2015 to 101 billion kWh by 2020, and 186 billion kWh by 2030,” Phuc said. In 2015, just 4.3 percent of households in Vietnam were equipped with solar energy equipment, Phuc said.  Solar-powered water heaters have enjoyed fairly widespread use in Vietnam over recent years, although solar panel usage is far less common. Vietnam is aiming to increase the use of household solar energy equipment to 12 percent by 2020, and 26 percent by 2030, according to Phuc. “It is important that we will not pursue economic growth at the expense of the environment,” said Phuc.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.0 percent to a high last seen on May 17, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.3 percent. Tech names such as Tencent and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing were among the biggest gainers. European stocks are seen rising, with spread-betters expecting Britain’s FTSE  and Germany’s Dax to gain 0.3 percent and France’s Cac 0.4 percent. On Wall Street on Friday, U.S. tech shares soared, pushing up the Nasdaq Composite 1.51 percent to 7,554 points, near its record closing high of 7,588 struck in March. In contrast, the S&P 500, which rose 1.08 percent on Friday, was still about 140 points off a record peak of 2,872 set in January due to concerns over trade frictions. Finance leaders of the closest U.S. allies vented anger over the Trump administration’s metal import tariffs on Saturday, setting the tone for a heated G7 summit next week in Quebec. In a rare show of division among the normally harmonious club of wealthy nations, six G7 member countries issued a statement asking U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to convey their “unanimous concern and disappointment” to President Donald Trump. “The G7 is showing more divisions than unity, to the point where one has to wonder whether it is worth holding meetings,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “The G7 summit this weekend could be equally terrible. There’s even talk that Trump may not go. Concerns on trade frictions are likely to continue to weigh on markets,” he added. There appears to have been no major break-through on trade disputes after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, either. China warned the United States on Sunday that any agreements reached on trade and business between the two countries will be void if Washington implements tariffs and other trade measures, as the two ended their latest round of talks in Beijing. Still, the U.S. economy’s current strength kept bears at bay for the moment. Data released on Friday showed U.S. job growth accelerated in May and the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, indicating a rapidly tightening labour market, which could eventually fuel inflation. “We had strong headline figures on employment but rise in wages was still well-contained and did not point to a sharp acceleration in inflation,” Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. Average hourly earnings rose eight cents, or 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in April. That pushed the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in April. The strong employment report added to a string of upbeat economic data, including consumer spending, industrial production and construction spending. They have suggested economic growth was regaining speed early in the second quarter after expanding at a moderate 2.2 percent annualised rate in the January-March period. Given the strength, the Federal Reserve is all but certain to raise interest rates at its policy meeting next week. That supported the dollar against other currencies. The U.S. currency traded at 109.50 yen, having gained 0.6 percent on Friday, extending its rebound from Tuesday’s low of 108.115, its lowest level in over five weeks. The euro traded at $1.1665, off Thursday’s high of $1.1725. Still, it kept some distance from Tuesday’s 10-month low of $1.1510 as concerns over Italy’s political crisis have eased. U.S. crude futures fell as low as $65.51 per barrel on Friday, touching their lowest level in almost two months. Rising U.S. crude production and a glut trapped inland due to a lack of pipeline capacity have pressured prices. U.S. crude futures last traded at $65.71, down 0.15 percent.

2018-06-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The planned exit of BHP Billiton Ltd from its U.S. shale business has drawn oil companies and private equity firms into a competition that may have no clear winner until late this year or early next year, according to people familiar with the negotiations.  BHP, the world’s largest miner, said in August that it would exit its U.S. shale oil and gas business after pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns a stake in the company and argued the unit was a drag on BHP’s value. The Anglo-Australian company’s Houston-based BHP Petroleum unit holds more than 838,000 acres spread across four U.S. shale plays: Texas’ Permian and Eagle Ford basins and the Haynesville and Fayetteville formations of Arkansas. A divestiture of all of that land would be among the largest shale acreage sales to date. BHP is offering to sell off acreage in seven different packages spanning three formations; it has generated interest from oil companies that paired with private equity firms to bid on all the assets, as well as from companies looking at individual packages. First bids were received last week, but no deal is expected until very late in 2018 or early 2019, according to two of the people familiar with the matter who, like all the sources, could not speak for attribution as the negotiations are not public. It was currently unclear whether BHP may hold a second bid round with certain bidders or all of them, or it may opt to continue weighing the received bids toward securing a preferred deal. The long delay can be explained by the sheer scale of the process and the number of parties involved, although bankers have also been critical of BHP’s approach which has been regarded as slow-moving throughout. Bidders include consortiums of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Blackstone Group LP, advised by Jefferies; and Chevron Corp partnered with Warburg Pincus, the people familiar with the matter said. Apollo Global Management LLC is bidding solo, while BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters last month that it could place a bid. A BHP spokeswoman declined to comment on the details of the sale. However, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said at a conference in Florida last month that there was “encouraging interest from potential bidders,” and that the higher oil prices and lower U.S. corporate tax rates than when the plan was first announced last summer were supporting the process. BP, Shell, Chevron, Blackstone and Warburg Pincus declined to comment. Apollo did not respond to a comment request. BHP values the entirety of the acreage at $14 billion, but analysts have pegged the total value of the assets lower - at a maximum of $9 billion. Bidding in consortiums would allow the integrated oil companies to focus on acreage that complemented their holdings, such as that in the Permian, while the private equity firms would take on gas-rich acreage in the Haynesville formation. The acreage includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12 billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, as appetite for shale gas assets reached fever pitch. Shale gas assets have lost value as natural gas prices fell from about $4.50 in mid 2011 to a low of $1.60 in 2016. Prices have since recovered to about $2.93 per MMBtu. Buyout houses are also dominant in the sale process for the gassy Fayetteville assets, the bid deadline for which was in late April, having been marketed separately from the rest of BHP’s shale portfolio. Barclays Plc and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch are running the sale process. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs had also helped BHP research the potential spin-off of the unit into a new company, should divestment prove unachievable, Reuters previously reported.

2018-06-04,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Motiva Enterprises has decided not to add processing capacity at its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, according to a company spokeswoman, fallout from last summer’s Hurricane Harvey that knocked nearly a quarter of all U.S. crude capacity offline. The decision, which puts Motiva on a path to buy or build another refining plant in the United States, is a significant change in the refiner’s plans from just two months ago when the company’s chief executive, Brian Coffman, said Motiva was weighing adding up to 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) of processing capacity to the company’s sole U.S. refinery, the 603,000 bpd Port Arthur refinery.  The U.S. refining unit of Saudi Aramco remains committed to “investigating opportunities to return to a refining scale of 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day, (but) we do not expect to achieve this increased refining scale through the Port Arthur Refinery,” company spokeswoman Angela Goodwin told Reuters. “We are actively exploring a number of opportunities and locations as part of our growth strategy,” Goodwin said.  Motiva, like other refiners hard-hit by inundating rains from Harvey, also is adding more pumps to remove water from the Port Arthur refinery to deal with future storms, she said. Goodwin cited “commercial sensitivity” in declining to discuss why the company shifted the expansion from Port Arthur, but people familiar with Motiva’s plans said the decision stems from the Port Arthur Refinery’s shutdown after Harvey flooded the area. “They’re not going to do it in Port Arthur,” one of the sources said. “They don’t want all of their capacity shut like it was during Harvey. They still want to be making gasoline somewhere else while everyone is shut during a storm.” Hurricane Harvey last year dropped more than 60 inches (1.5 m) of rain over southeastern Texas, halting refineries that account for a quarter of U.S. production of gasoline, jet fuel and diesel and most of its fuel exports. The storm caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to energy infrastructure and pushed up fuel prices for weeks.     Other Gulf Coast refiners, including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Total SA (TOTF.PA), are bolstering their storm defenses, while an industry group is urging federal funding of an offshore dike that would protect the refining center from storm surges. Total is adding generators and pumps at its 225,500 bpd refinery, also in Port Arthur, said spokeswoman Marie Maitre. It experienced a plant-wide power outage as Harvey drenched east Texas.   At Exxon’s refinery in Beaumont, Texas, 18 miles (29 km) north of Port Arthur, the company is raising an existing 10-foot flood wall by four feet, said people familiar with its operations. The company is considering expanding the Beaumont refinery and two others along the Gulf Coast to double its ability to process growing U.S. shale oil, but has not reached a final decision.  Refiners and other industries are advocating for a storm surge barrier to prevent future storms from pushing water in nearby Galveston Bay and flood refining centers in Texas City, Texas, and Houston.  “We, along with a broad coalition of our industry peers, have asked federal officials to build a ‘coastal spine,’ a protective barrier,” said Chevalier Gray, spokeswoman at LyondellBasell Industries (LYB.N) , which operates a Houston refinery. Lyondell’s refinery, which sits on higher ground, remained in operation during Harvey.

2018-06-04," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - A tsunami of U.S. crude oil should be headed toward Asia, according to pricing on futures exchanges, but the reality in the physical market tells a somewhat different story. The discount in the futures markets of the main U.S. light crude grade, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), to the global benchmark Brent crude stood at $11.09 a barrel on June 1, the widest in more than three years. And it’s not just a front-month aberration, with WTI’s discount to Brent for crude for delivery in six months at $10.71 a barrel on June 1, the most since September 2014. The pricing of WTI and Brent suggest that U.S. crude is now so cheap compared to its main competitor that refiners across the world, but especially in the main consuming region of Asia, should be snapping up vast quantities. There is some evidence to suggest that this has happened in recent weeks, with vessel-tracking data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts pointing to record arrivals of U.S. crude in Asia in June. About 883,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. crude is expected to land at Asian ports in June, up from 769,000 bpd in May, which was the previous high for U.S. crude exports to Asia. While there may be scope for U.S. exports to push higher in coming months, they will probably be limited by both infrastructure constraints and a weakening of the economics. While the paper futures market makes a compelling case for U.S. crude exports, pricing in the physical markets is far less convincing. (Graphic: Angola Girassol vs. WTI Houston crude: https://reut.rs/2Lk7Twa) The price of WTI crude free-on-board at Houston, as assessed by Argus Media, was $73.71 a barrel on June 1, a premium of $7.90 a barrel, or 12 percent, to WTI futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That means an Asian buyer of physical WTI crude for loading in Texas is paying quite a significant premium over the price of paper oil in the futures market. The premium has risen sharply in recent weeks, given that it was closer to $3 a barrel at the end of April. Further out along the curve also shows a widening premium for physical WTI crude over the futures, with December Houston WTI being $7 a barrel more expensive than the equivalent futures contract as at the end of May. While physical WTI crude is currently at a strong premium to the futures, the opposite is the case when comparing paper Brent crude to the prices of similar physical grades. Brent futures closed at $76.79 a barrel on June 1, above the $75.24 for Nigeria’s Bonny Light and the $74.34 for Angola’s Girassol grade. Putting the numbers together shows that an Asian refiner seeking light, sweet crude, could have on June 1 bought a cargo from Angola at just 63 cents a barrel more than one from Houston. This small advantage in favour of WTI from Houston would more than likely be eaten up by the increase in shipping costs, given that Texas is a far longer voyage to Asia than is Angola. Overall, the seemingly huge advantage that WTI enjoys over crudes priced against Brent disappears once you make the jump from the paper to the physical markets. While arbitrage investors may enjoy such a situation, the current pricing of physical crude oil suggests that U.S. shipments to Asia may struggle to be competitive in the second half of the year. One side issue worth mentioning is the potential impact of geopolitical concerns. If China and the United States do manage to reach some kind of trade consensus, it may encourage Chinese buying of U.S. crude, even if it doesn’t necessarily make economic sense. On the other hand, an escalating trade dispute may see China’s state-owned refiners take less U.S. crude, and so far, it’s far from certain which is the more likely of those two outcomes.  The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

2018-06-04,"* Ex-Japan Asia up 0.3 pct, Nikkei up 1.0 pct * Strong U.S. job data confirms current economic momentum * Trade frictions still undermine investor confidence By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, June 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose to their highest level in two-and-a-half-weeks on Monday as strong U.S. jobs data offset worries that tariff wars between the United States and the rest of the world could drag on global economic growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.0 percent to a high last seen on May 17, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.3 percent. Tech names such as Tencent and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing were among the biggest gainers. On Wall Street on Friday, U.S. tech shares soared, pushing up the Nasdaq Composite 1.51 percent to 7,554, near its record closing high of 7,588 marked in March. In contrast, the S&P 500, which rose 1.08 percent on Friday, was still about 140 points off its record peak of 2,872 set in January as concerns about trade frictions curtailed many other shares. Finance leaders of the closest U.S. allies vented anger over the Trump administration’s metal import tariffs on Saturday, setting up a heated fight at a G7 summit next week in Quebec. In a rare show of division among the normally harmonious club of wealthy nations, the six other G7 member countries issued a statement asking U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to convey their “unanimous concern and disappointment” about the tariffs to President Donald Trump. “The G7 is showing more divisions than unity, to the point where one has to wonder whether it is worth holding meetings,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “The G7 summit this weekend could be equally terrible. There’s even talk that Trump may not go. Concerns on trade frictions are likely to continue to weigh on markets,” he added. Still, the U.S. economy is undeniably in strong shape at the moment, keeping bears at bay. Friday’s government data showed U.S. job growth accelerated in May and the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-year low of 3.8 percent, pointing to rapidly tightening labour market conditions, which could stir concerns about inflation. “We had strong headline figures on employment but rise in wages was still well-contained and did not point to a sharp acceleration in inflation,” Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. Average hourly earnings rose eight cents, or 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in April. That pushed the annual increase in average hourly earnings to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in April. The strong employment report added to a string of upbeat economic data, including consumer spending, industrial production and construction spending. They have suggested economic growth was regaining speed early in the second quarter after expanding at a moderate 2.2 percent annualised rate in the January-March period. Given the strength, the Federal Reserve is all but certain to raise interest rates at its policy meeting next week. That supported the dollar against other currencies. The U.S. currency traded at 109.50 yen, having gained 0.6 percent on Friday, extending its rebound from Tuesday’s low of 108.115, which was its lowest level in over five weeks. The euro traded at $1.1665, off Thursday’s high of $1.1725. Still, it kept some distance from Tuesday’s 10-month low of $1.1510 as concerns over Italy’s political crisis have eased. U.S. crude futures fell to as low as $65.51 per barrel on Friday, touching their lowest level in almost two months as growing U.S. crude production and a glut trapped inland due to a lack of pipeline capacity have pressured their prices. They last traded at $65.80, flat from Friday close.

2018-06-04,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will crack down further on diesel consumption and support using rail for freight deliveries in its ongoing fight against pollution, the official China Daily said on Monday, citing the environment ministry. Diesel trucks accounted for just 7.8 percent of China’s total vehicles, but contributed as much as 57.3 percent of the country’s total nitrogen oxide emissions and more than three quarters of airborne particulate matter, according to data from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE). The crackdown will strengthen scrutiny on fuel and engine quality and restrict car freight, the China Daily said, quoting ministry officials. Total car ownership reached 310 million last year, up 5.1 percent compared to 2016, with diesel-fueled vehicles accounting for 9.4 percent of the total, the MEE said in a report on vehicle pollution published last Friday.      It said total pollution discharges from vehicles stood at 43.6 million tonnes in 2017, down 2.5 percent on the year, with the bulk of the emissions consisting of carbon monoxide. It also said attention needed to be paid to the 768 gigawatts of diesel-fired agricultural equipment across the country. In a separate statement, the ministry warned that vehicle emissions like nitrogen oxides had fallen much more slowly than others, and it promised to speed up the implementation of pollution prevention and control measures for diesel trucks.       As part of its war on pollution, China has taken more than 20 million outdated vehicles off the roads over the last five years, and the country routinely restricts traffic during smog build-ups. It has also taken action to limit road deliveries of coal in key regions like Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Yangtze river delta. But experts have urged the country to adopt tougher measures against vehicle pollution, including congestion charges, as they bid to cut air pollution concentrations further.

2018-06-04,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is expected on Monday to announce changes in biofuels policies, including a plan to count ethanol exports toward federal biofuels usage quotas and allowing year-round sale of fuels with a higher blend of ethanol, two sources briefed on the matter said. Reuters reported on May 11 that after hosting several meetings between representatives of the corn and refining industries, the administration was in the “last stages” of formally proposing changes to biofuels regulations intended to appease both sides. The changes, expected to be outlined in a memorandum on Monday, will be subject to the federal rule-making process, added the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment. The changes are aimed at easing tensions between the oil and corn industries, which have been clashing for months over the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard - a law that requires refiners to add increasing amounts of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline and diesel. While the RFS has helped farmers by creating a 15 billion-gallon-a-year market for corn-based ethanol, oil refiners have increasingly complained that complying with the law incurs steep costs and threatens the very blue-collar jobs President Donald Trump has promised to protect. The administration is expected to announce that it plans to allow exports of biofuels like ethanol to count toward the annual biofuels volume mandates under the RFS - which could ease the burden on domestic refiners by reducing the amounts they would have to blend domestically. The Trump administration is expected to propose lifting restrictions on selling a certain kind of higher-ethanol blend gasoline in the summer, called E15. Trump has already stated his support for such a move, which has been long sought by the corn lobby because it would theoretically expand the market for biofuels. Sales of E15 are currently banned in the summer over worries it could increase smog.     Bloomberg News reported earlier on the timing of the announcement expected for Monday. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican and biofuels advocate, said in a statement on Sunday that allowing exports of biofuels to count toward mandates “exposes the U.S. to trade cases and retaliation from countries like Canada and others.” He added that allowing the sale of E15 “isn’t anywhere near enough to offset the impact” of the ethanol export credits. “I’m not convinced this is a win-win.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-whitehouse/white-house-expected-to-announce-compromise-on-biofuels-sources-idUKL2N1T50D3,04 Jun 2018,"The Trump administration is

2018-06-04,"SINGAPORE, June 4 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures dipped for a third consecutive session on Monday, with prices coming under pressure from record U.S. output and expectations of higher OPEC supplies. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, $65.71 a barrel by 2353 GMT. Last week, WTI lost around 3 percent, adding to a near 5 percent decline a week before. The global benchmark Brent fell 26 cents, or 0.34 percent, to $76.53 a barrel. “Crude oil remained under pressure as the market remained focused on the discussion between OPEC members about whether they should increase production later this year,” ANZ said in a note. “In the U.S., the data also presented a gloomy picture. Crude oil production rose to another record, while drilling activity picked up again.” Saudi Arabia, effective leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and Russia have discussed boosting output to compensate for supply losses from Venezuela and to address concerns about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iranian output. Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft will be able to restore 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil output in just two days if global production limits are lifted, Renaissance Capital wrote in a client note. U.S. crude production rose in March to 10.47 million barrels per day (bpd), a monthly record, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. U.S. drillers added two oil rigs in the week to June 1, bringing the total to 861, the most since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. That was the eighth time drillers added rigs in the past nine weeks. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options, according to data released on Friday, as oil prices slumped on oversupply fears. The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 50,937 contracts to 370,980 during the week to May 29, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.

2018-06-04,"LONDON, June 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world’s major industrial democracies spend at least $100 billion each year to prop up oil, gas and coal consumption, despite vows to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025, a report said on Monday ahead of the G7 summit in Canada. Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - known as the Group of Seven (G7) - pledged in 2016 to phase out their support for fossil fuels by 2025. But a study led by Britain’s Overseas Development Insitute (ODI) found they spent at least $100 billion a year to support fossil fuels at home and abroad in 2015 and 2016. “Governments often say they have no public resources to support the clean energy transition,” the study’s lead author Shelagh Whitley told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “What we’re trying to do is highlight that those resources are there (but) it is being used inefficiently. “The G7 have pledged to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, but they don’t have any systems in terms of accountability to meet the pledges - they don’t have road maps or plans,” added Whitley, head of the ODI’s climate division. Researchers scrutinised and scored each country against indicators such as transparency, pledges and commitments, as well as their progress towards ending the use, support and production of fossil fuels. France was ranked the highest overall, scoring 63 out of 100 points, followed by Germany (62), Canada (54) and the UK (47), the report said. The United States scored lowest with 42 out of 100 points due to its support for fossil fuel production and its withdrawal from a 2015 global pact to fight climate change. President Donald Trump announced a year ago he was ditching the deal agreed upon by nearly 200 countries over opposition from businesses and U.S. allies. The 2015 Paris agreement committed nations to curbing greenhouse emissions and keeping the global hike in temperatures “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Britain scored the lowest on transparency for denying that its government provided fossil fuel subsidies, even though it supported tax breaks for North Sea oil and gas exploration, the report said. “We do not subsidise the production or consumption of fossil fuels,” a spokesman from Britain’s treasury said in emailed comments to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We are supporting other countries in phasing out their own fossil fuel subsidies, as part of our commitment to the G20 and G7 pledges,” he added. The study, which was co-authored by Oil Change International, the International Institute for Sustainable Development and the Natural Resources Defense Council, urged G7 governments to set concrete plans to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 as pledged. ""What should be a low-hanging fruit in terms of moving public resources away from fossil fuels is not happening, or where it is happening, it's not happening fast enough,"" said the ODI's Whitley.

2018-06-04,"KRUSCICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, June 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - F or almost a year, a clutch of Bosnian women has kept watch over a wooden bridge to disrupt the march of hydropower - part of a Balkan-wide protest against the damming of Europe’s wild rivers. From Albania to Slovenia, critics fear the proposed run of dams will destroy their majestic landscape, steal their water and extinguish species unique to the Balkans. So the village women stake out the bridge around the clock, listening out for the telltale sounds of diggers on the move. “We are always here, during the day, at night, always,” said Hata Hurem, a 31-year-old housewife, in the shadow of the towering mountains that dominate the Balkan landscape. Clustered by a creek on the edge of the village of Kruscica, about 40 miles north west of Sarajevo, the local women have taken turns to stand firm, blocking trucks and scrapers from accessing the construction sites of two small plants. Investment in renewable energy is growing worldwide as countries rush to meet goals set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. But from China to South America, dams cause controversy for flooding fragile ecosystems and displacing local communities. Plans to build almost 3,000 hydropower plants were underway across the Balkans in 2017, about 10 percent of them in Bosnia, according to a study by consultancy Fluvius. Authorities and investors say boosting hydropower is key to reducing regional dependency on coal and to falling in line with European Union energy policies as Western Balkan states move towards integration with the bloc. The energy ministry of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of Bosnia’s two autonomous regions, where Kruscica is located, did not respond to a request for comment. The government of Bosnia’s other region, Republika Srpska, said building dams was easier and cheaper than shifting towards other power sources. “The Republic of Srpska has comparative advantages in its unused hydro potential and considers it quite justified to achieve the goals set by the EU by exploiting its unused hydropower,” said energy ministry spokeswoman Zorana Kisic. Yet, critics say the “dam tsunami” - a term coined by anti-hydropower activists - endangers Europe’s last wild rivers, which flow free. If rivers stop running freely, they say dozens of species, from the Danube Salmon to the Balkan Lynx, are at risk. About a third of the planned dam projects are in protected areas, including some in national parks, according to the 2017 study, commissioned by campaign groups RiverWatch and Euronatur. Most plants are small, producing as little as up to 1 MW each - roughly enough to power about 750 homes - but their combined impact is large as activists say they would cut fish migration routes and damage their habitat. “Three thousand hydropower plants ... will destroy these rivers,” said Viktor Bjelić, of the Center for Environment (CZZS), a Bosnian environmental group. “Many of the species depending on these ecosystem will disappear or will be extremely endangered.” Some local communities fear displacement and lost access to water they’ve long used for drinking, fishing and farming. In Kruscica, protesters say water would be diverted through pipelines, leaving the creek empty and sinking hopes for a revival of nature tourism that attracted hikers, hunters and fishing enthusiasts before war intervened in the 1990s. “(The river) means everything to us, it’s the life of the community,” said Kruscica’s mayor Tahira Tibold, speaking outside the barren wooden hut used as base by demonstrators. Locals first heard about the plants when construction workers showed up last year, added the 65-year-old. Women have led protests since fronting a picket to shield men during a confrontation with police last year, said Tibold. Campaigners have taken their plight to court, alleging irregularities in the approval process, and works have stalled. But demonstrators keep patrolling around the clock, said Bjelić of CZZS, as it is not known when or how the case will end. The protest was backed by U.S. clothing company Patagonia as part of a wider campaign to preserve Balkan rivers and dissuade international banks from investing in hydropower. Banks and multilateral investors including the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC), fund hundreds of projects, according to a 2018 study by Bankwatch, a financial watchdog. “It’s a waste of money and a moral travesty that some of the world’s largest financial institutions have embraced this out-dated and exploitative technology,” Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard said in a statement in April. The World Bank, EBRD and EIB said their investments have to comply with environmental and social standards, which EBRD and EIB said they were strengthening. EBRD said it also improved its assessment process and pulled out of some projects near protected areas. “Hydropower is an important source of renewable energy for Western Balkans,” said EBRD’s spokeswoman Svitlana Pyrkalo. Bosnia gets 40 percent of its electricity from hydropower, the rest from coal-fired power plants. It plans to increase the share of renewables to 43 percent by 2020, under a target agreed with the EU. Dams are generally considered more reliable than wind and solar plants as they are less dependent on weather conditions. But that could change with global warming if droughts and floods grow more common, said Doug Vine, a senior fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a U.S.-based think tank. Last year a long drought lowered water levels across the Western Balkans, hitting hydropower output and driving up prices. Campaigners say Balkan states should focus on solar and wind power as they involve less building works and cost less. “Just because it doesn’t emit CO2 it doesn’t mean it’s good,” said Ulrich Eichelmann, head of RiverWatch. “Is like saying (that) …  smoking is healthy because it doesn’t affect the liver”.

2018-06-04,"OSLO (Reuters) - Institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management called on Group of Seven leaders on Monday to phase out the use of coal in power generation to help limit climate change, despite strong opposition from Washington. Government plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions were too weak to limit warming as agreed by world leaders at a Paris summit in 2015, they wrote. U.S. President Donald Trump announced a year ago that he was pulling out of the pact. “The global shift to clean energy is under way, but much more needs to be done by governments,” the group of 288 investors wrote in a statement before the G7 summit in Canada on June 8-9. Signatories included Allianz Global Investors, Aviva Investors, DWS, HSBC Global Asset Management, Nomura Asset Management, Australian Super, HESTA and some major U.S. pension funds including CalPERS, it said. As part of action to slow climate change, the investors called on governments to “phase out thermal coal power worldwide by set deadlines”, to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and to “put a meaningful price on carbon”. The investors also urged governments to strengthen national plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and to ensure that companies improve climate-related financial reporting. Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGC), said it was the first time that such a broad group of investors had called for a phase-out of thermal coal, used in power generation.  “There is a lot more momentum in the investor community” to put pressure on governments, she told Reuters. The IIGC was among backers of the statement, delivered to G7 governments and to the United Nations. G7 nations Canada, Britain, France and Italy are members of a “Powering Past Coal” alliance of almost 30 nations set up last year and which seeks to halt use of coal power by 2030. Japan, Germany and the United States are not members. The investors wrote that countries and companies that implement the Paris climate agreement “will see significant economic benefits and attract increased investment.” U.S. gross domestic product was $18.6 trillion in 2016, World Bank data show. Trump doubts scientific findings that heatwaves, downpours and rising sea levels are linked to man-made greenhouse gas emissions and wants to bolster the U.S. fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, coal is now used to generate almost 40 percent of electricity.

2018-06-04,"LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Britain should force large companies and assets owners such as pension funds to report their exposure to climate risks by 2022 at the latest, a cross-party group of lawmakers said in a report published on Monday. Concerns in the investment community that assets are being mispriced because climate risk is not being factored into financial reporting have prompted demand for more transparent climate-related financial information. Think-tank Climate Tracker has warned that trillions of dollars are at risk globally due to so-called stranded assets, which include oil and gas reserves, that cannot be burnt if global climate targets are to be met. “Climate change poses financial risks to a range of investments – from food and farming, to infrastructure, construction and insurance liability,” Mary Creagh, chair of the Environment Audit Committee said in a statement published with the group’s report. “The low-carbon transition also presents exciting opportunities in clean energy, transport and tech that could benefit UK businesses,” she said. The report said the government has encouraged publicly listed companies to report climate risk but said a voluntary approach is ineffective. “The government should make climate risk reporting mandatory on a ‘comply or explain’ basis by 2022,” the report said. There is growing international momentum behind moves to encourage financial reporting on sustainability. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development last week published guidance for companies reporting on the physical impact of climate change in their financial results.

2018-06-04,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Analysts says tanker scrappage to hit most in at least 7 yrs * Sector has been in crisis in wake of OPEC oil output cuts * Strict environmental rules, lower floating storage also drag * Tough conditions expected to last until second-half of 2019 By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, June 3 (Reuters) - The shipping industry will this year scrap the largest number of oil tankers in over half-a-decade, driven by weak earnings, firm prices for scrap steel and the need to prepare fleets for strict new environmental regulations. The surge in scrapping underscores how the sector is grappling with one of its worst-ever crises, hit hard after rates for transporting oil plunged to multi-year lows in the wake of excess tanker supply and tepid demand as OPEC production cuts bite. “The tanker markets are definitely in a trough at the moment, with one of the worst years in a decade in terms of freight rates and returns,” said Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at ship broker Banchero Costa in Singapore. The tough operating conditions are expected to persist until at least the second-half of 2019, analysts and industry sources said. Estimates on the number of tanker demolitions vary between the four shipping analysts that Reuters spoke to, with the most conservative standing at a seven-year high in 2018. About 10.3 million deadweight tonnes (DWT) have been sold for demolition from January to April this year, compared with 11.2 million DWT for the whole of 2017 and 2.5 million for 2016, said Erik Broekhuizen, head of tanker research and consulting at ship broker Poten & Partners Inc. “OPEC production cuts are hurting the market, and as long as they are in place, the tanker market will remain challenged,” he said, adding that scrapping had picked up for large vessels in particular. Since early 2017, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other non-OPEC crude producers have curbed exports to fight a global oil glut. The imposition of new U.S. sanctions against Iran looks set to further reduce oil flows later in 2018, although Saudi Arabia and Russia have discussed potentially raising output to fill the subsequent void. More stringent environmental regulations to be implemented by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2020 will make operating old ships uneconomical, said Leszczynski at Banchero Costa. Limited interest in using tankers to store oil, which has historically been a profitable option for shipowners during lulls in shipping volumes, is also curbing overall demand, analysts said. Scrap steel prices in Shanghai, China - the world’s top consumer and producer of the material - have meanwhile nearly doubled from a year ago due to shutdowns of inefficient steel mills amid a widespread crackdown on industrial emissions. Firms that have recently sent ships for scrapping include India’s Essar Shipping Ltd and Oslo-listed Frontline Ltd. The latter last month reported better earnings than analysts had expected, partly due to its increased scrapping. The ships being scrapped are also getting younger, with the average age falling to 19.5 years in the first quarter of this year, compared with 2017’s average of 22 years, said Rajesh Verma, an analyst with shipping consultancy Drewry. Most of the vessels are being scrapped in Bangladesh and India, although Pakistan has also returned to the demolition market after an 18-month ban, analysts said. The uptick in demolition rates has come despite increased opposition from European regulators due to environmental concerns. Despite the high scrap rate, tanker earnings will continue to be hit as fleet-growth is still too high, analysts said. Banchero Costa’s Leszczynski expects the crude tanker fleet to expand 3.3 percent this year, following growth of 4.6 percent last year and 5.8 percent in 2016. With tanker rates still a long way from being profitable, there’s little prospect of a broad industry improvement until the second half of 2019 at the earliest, said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at industry lobby group BIMCO. “Any recovery in rates in the tanker market will be hinged on the extent of scrapping in the coming years ... we expect rates to start recovering in the second half of 2019 if scrapping remains strong,” said Verma at Drewry.
