2018-07-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. oil and gas industry is lobbying against tighter sanctions on Russia that could impact U.S. investments there, congressional sources said on Friday. The U.S. Senate has revived a bill, called DETER, that would allow for swift sanctions if Moscow was found meddling in future U.S. elections. Both Democrats and Republicans are looking to redress what they consider President Donald Trump’s weak stance on accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 election when he met Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. Top U.S. energy company Exxon Mobil is among the firms that have previously opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia. Opponents claim sanctions unfairly penalize U.S. companies while allowing foreign energy rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP to operate in the world’s biggest oil producer. Western powers imposed sanctions in 2014 after Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen told Reuters on Friday there was growing bipartisan support for his DETER bill. When asked whether energy industry lobbyists were either opposing the bill or seeking revisions, Van Hollen said that “a range of issues need to be discussed including ... ones related to U.S. and European energy projects.” Van Hollen said that while he was willing to address “reasonable concerns” from industry representatives and other lawmakers, the legislation needed to be robust enough to discourage Moscow from meddling in future U.S. elections. “Don’t trip the wire because if you do, sanctions are automatic and harsh” should be the message, Van Hollen said. He said he had not been directly contacted by energy lobbyists. Lobbyists representing oil and gas firms with interests in Russia were opposing the legislation, two Senate aides said. They did not mention specific companies and spoke anonymously because private conversations were still underway. One of the Senate aides said the U.S.-Russia Chamber of Commerce was raising concerns about the legislation. The chamber describes itself as a non-profit organization headquartered in Houston that promotes trade between Russia and the United States. Its members include Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. Chamber representatives and the three energy companies did not respond to requests for comment. Exxon has already taken a hit because of sanctions. In February, the firm said it would exit some joint ventures with Russia’s Rosneft. The company still has operations in Russia, including an oil venture on an island in the North Pacific called Sakhalin.

2018-07-20,"July 20 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum Ltd, Australia’s biggest independent oil and natural gas company, has decided to pull out of Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Texas, Sempra said on Friday. “Woodside has been evaluating whether to invest equity in the project, but has recently decided not to pursue that investment further as it wishes to focus on integrated E&P, rather than U.S. Gulf Coast LNG infrastructure investments like Port Arthur LNG,” California-based Sempra said in a statement. Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said last month the project’s ability to provide it with an adequate return is “very challenged.” Sempra and Woodside had agreed to share the cost of developing Port Arthur in February 2016. The project, which Sempra said could cost $8 billion to $9 billion, includes two liquefaction trains capable of producing about 11 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, up to three storage tanks and facilities to load LNG onto ships. Sempra will continue the development of the liquefaction project, the U.S. energy company said adding, it is “in discussions with many other LNG buyers from Europe and Asia about the project, including LNG purchase and a potential equity investment.” (Reporting by Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Chang)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/woodside-lng-sempra/woodside-exits-sempra-port-arthur-lng-export-project-in-texas-idUKL4N1UG53B,20 Jul 2018,"Woodside Petroleum Ltd,

2018-07-20,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Friday rejected the Trump administration’s renewed bid to dismiss a lawsuit by young activists who say the U.S. government is ignoring the perils of climate change. By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the government fell short of the “high bar” needed to dismiss the Oregon case, originally brought in 2015 against the administration of President Barack Obama. Twenty-one children and young adults, ages 11 to 22, accused federal officials and oil industry executives of violating their due process rights by knowing for decades that carbon pollution poisons the environment, but doing nothing about it. The government contended that letting the case proceed would be too burdensome, unconstitutionally pit the courts against the executive branch, and require improper “agency decision-making” by forcing officials to answer questions about climate change. But the appeals court said the issues raised “are better addressed through the ordinary course of litigation.” A trial is scheduled for Oct. 29 in the federal court in Eugene, Oregon. President Donald Trump’s administration also has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss the lawsuit or put it on hold, and is awaiting a ruling. Its earlier bid to end the lawsuit failed in March. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. The activists are seeking various environmental remedies. Julia Olson, one of their lawyers, said in a phone interview, “The 9th Circuit sees that this case needs to go to trial with a full factual record on the young plaintiffs’ harms, their constitutional rights and climate science.” The case is U.S. et al v U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Eugene, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

2018-07-20,"(Reuters) - The city of Baltimore filed a lawsuit on Friday against 26 oil and gas companies and entities, including BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp, for knowingly contributing to what the city called the catastrophic consequences of climate change. It was the latest in a string of cases attempting to hold oil and gas companies responsible for climate change caused by carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. It came a day after a U.S. District Court judge dismissed a similar suit by New York City, saying in his ruling that climate change must be addressed through federal regulation and foreign policy because climate change is a global problem. Baltimore is vulnerable to any rise in sea level because it has 60 miles (96 km) of coastline and one of the country’s largest ports, according to the complaint, which points to research linking oil and gas production with rising sea levels. The lawsuit, filed in Baltimore Circuit Court, says Baltimore has been impacted by sea level rise and climate change leading to “property damage, economic injuries and impacts to public health.” It says the Baltimore area has suffered two 1,000-year storms within three years.  The lawsuit accuses oil and gas companies of knowing about a link between climate change and fossil fuel production for nearly 50 years, yet working to hide the dangers and protect their assets rather than minimize the damage. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, penalties and relief. “These oil and gas companies ... could have warned us. They could have taken steps to minimize or avoid the damage. In fact, they had a responsibility to do both, but they didn’t, and that’s why we are taking them to court,” city solicitor Andre Davis said in a statement. Also among those named as defendants are ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Phillips 66, Marathon Oil Corp, CNX Resources Corp, Hess Corp and Consol Energy Inc. Spokespeople for Shell and Chevron said the companies support efforts to address climate change or limit global warning, but those initiatives should be addressed outside of lawsuits. “We believe climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change ... not by the courts,” Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said in an email. A Phillips 66 spokesman declined to comment, and a CNX Resources spokesman said the company had not yet been served so was unable to comment. Spokespeople for the other oil companies were not immediately available to comment.

2018-07-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar weakened, long term Treasury yields rose and stocks closed mostly lower on Friday after President Donald Trump complained again about the greenback’s strength and about Federal Reserve interest rate rises. Wall Street and European stock markets stalled, despite good corporate earnings, after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all U.S. imports from China. Trump repeated his criticism a day earlier of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy on raising interest rates saying he is  concerned the central bank will raise interest rates twice more this year, a White House official told CNBC. The U.S. president also lamented the strength of the dollar and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. The U.S. dollar fell the most in three weeks against a basket of six major currencies, halting a rally that had driven the greenback to a year high. “The dollar is an important issue today especially because we have been on a rise for quite a long time,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.77 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.74 percent to $1.1727. Benchmark 10-year U.S. notes US10YT=RR last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.8968 percent, from 2.847 percent late on Thursday. The long end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which reflects sentiment about rising inflation and the health of the U.S. economy, saw the biggest one day jump since May while short-dated maturities held steady. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 6.38 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,058.12, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.67 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,801.82 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 5.10 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,820.20. Microsoft (MSFT.O) shares rose, supporting stock indexes after a strong earnings report late Thursday, while General Electric (GE.N) shares sank after the conglomerate cut a key financial target. In the latest trade salvo, Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from China. “The reason we are not up more is the push and pull that has been the case for the past two months,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. “That is between what is clearly a very good earnings and economic backdrop in the U.S. contrasted with the risk that trade continues to be a problem.” The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.15 percent, amid rising trade tensions.  European auto shares .SXAP, sensitive to trade tensions as U.S. officials work towards slapping tariffs on car imports, fell 2.1 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.37 percent, helped by Asian markets .MIAPJ0000PUS. Oil prices rose as a weakening dollar and lower expected August oil exports from Saudi Arabia supported the market. But  concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions and supply increases meant oil prices saw their third weekly loss.

2018-07-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday as a weakening dollar and lower expected August crude exports from Saudi Arabia supported the market, offsetting concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions and supply increases. U.S. crude strengthened late in the session as the U.S. dollar index .DXY slipped to a four-day low, on reports that U.S. President Donald Trump worries that the Federal Reserve will raise rates twice this year. “The dollar was a one-way ticket for the last couple of weeks and basically reversed directions, giving us some strong support,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group. The expiring U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 for August delivery settled up $1.00 at $70.46 a barrel, while the more liquid September contract rose 2 cents to $68.26 a barrel. U.S. crude ended the week down nearly 1 percent. Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 49 cents at $73.07 a barrel. Brent fell 3.1 percent in the week.  U.S. drillers this week cut five oil rigs, the most since March, according to a Baker Hughes report RIG-OL-USA-BHI, with the rate of growth slowing over the past month with recent declines in crude prices. [RIG/U] Prices also received a boost after OPEC’s largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, said it would temper its exports next month. Trade tensions continued to weigh on the market, providing a ceiling for any gains, traders said. Trump said in a CNBC interview he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from China. Lower oil demand in the United States and China caused by an economic slowdown due to the trade spat between the two countries would likely weigh heavily on markets, some analysts said.  “The impact on world economic growth of a levy of this magnitude will be severe and will likely have a strong negative impact on markets,” said Olaf van den Heuvel, chief investment officer at Aegon Asset Management. The People’s Bank of China reduced its midpoint for the yuan for the seventh straight trading day to the lowest in a year. The yuan then retreated to a near 13-month low CNY=CFXS, although it rebounded later. Signs of Russia and Saudi Arabia increasing oil production, as well as last week’s surprise build in U.S. crude stocks, have also weighed on prices, said Tariq Zahir, analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors. “You’re having supply come back on to the markets, so it’s not surprising to see a little bit of weakness,” Zahir said.  Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish U.S. crude futures and options positions for the first time in about a month in the week to July 17, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 34,067 contracts to 423,650 during the period.

2018-07-20,"(Reuters) - Oilfield service giants Schlumberger and General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes missed second quarter revenue forecasts on Friday as slow international growth offset record production in the United States that boosted domestic demand for their services. The Houston-based companies were the first among their peers to report earnings, putting them under scrutiny from analysts seeking clues about the health of the industry. Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services firm, is viewed a as bellwether for the global oil and gas industry due to its heavy international exposure. Schlumberger’s overall revenue rose 11 percent in the quarter to $8.30 billion, missing analysts’ estimate of $8.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from Schlumberger’s international business dragged the overall performance down: it grew 4 percent in the quarter to $5.07 billion, but remained 1.4 percent below a year ago. GE’s Baker Hughes reported total revenue of $5.55 billion, versus analysts’ forecasts of $5.57 billion, according to I/B/E/S. Baker Hughes’ revenues were hurt by its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses.    The performances reflect how a relatively slow recovery in international markets, where oil projects are often more costly, continues to drag down earnings for large integrated service firms, even as surging U.S. production helps. U.S. oil production last week hit a record 11 million barrels per day, marking a dramatic comeback in an industry that had been hard hit by the 2014 oil price crash. Wall Street analysts were not fazed by the missed estimates, and instead focused their attention on stronger-than-expected sequential growth in international markets and upbeat comments from executives.  “Both companies were much more optimistic about the global land and offshore recovery than in previous conference calls,” said James West, a senior managing director for investment banking firm Evercore ISI.  Shares of Schlumberger were trading at $66.86 in afternoon trade, off a fraction of a percent. Baker Hughes was up about 0.8 percent at $32.04. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, topped $80 a barrel in the second quarter, its strongest level in roughly three and a half years amid an effort by major oil producers to cut production and stabilize prices and supply disruptions. Schlumberger said it expected to fully utilize its international equipment in the fourth quarter of this year and forecasted double digit growth in that segment next year. “The broader-based recovery has finally started,” Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on the company’s conference call.  Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said his firm was seeing positive indications from a number of international markets and that longer-cycle activity should drive growth in its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses going forward. “This is what people have been looking for - the inflection in the international business. It is starting to materialize now,” said Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago, referencing the firm’s sequential growth.  Revenue from Schlumberger’s North America operations jumped about 43 percent to $3.14 billion. Both companies said they have yet to see the impacts of pipeline constraints in the Permian, where growing production is quickly outpacing available takeaway capacity. Schlumberger warned the constraints could slow growth in the coming months, but said it plans to continue deploying hydraulic fracturing fleets.  The bottlenecks have sent the price of local crude down to an almost $15 a barrel discount to benchmark prices at Cushing, Oklahoma. Revenues in GE’s Baker Hughes’ oilfield services unit, which accounts for more than half of its overall sales, rose 14 percent year over year to approximately $2.9 billion, driven by stronger activity in North America. Last month conglomerate General Electric said it would divest its stake in Baker Hughes in a bid to simplify its business and boost shareholder returns, less than a year after merging with the services firm.

2018-07-20,"* Pertamina assets total $51.2 bln in 2017 * Government approves plan to sell certain upstream assets * Trying to shield Pertamina from rising oil prices, weak rupiah By Cindy Silviana and Wilda Asmarini JAKARTA, July 20 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s Pertamina is seeking government approval to divest assets to help shield the state energy company from rising crude oil prices and a rupiah that is at its lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years. While higher oil prices have yielded Pertamina better returns from its oil and gas output, they have also increased the fuel bill for the net oil importer, especially amid the slumping rupiah. Indonesia has promised not to raise some consumer fuel and electricity prices ahead of elections in 2019, but the populist policy has also dented Pertamina’s finances and cut its means of spending on much-needed infrastructure. The government, which sets Pertamina’s fuel prices, wants to guard Pertamina’s finances from crude prices that are expected to climb 46 percent above the $48 per barrel assumed in this year’s budget, and a 7 percent weakening of the rupiah against the dollar this year. Pertamina wants to divest to help maintain its long-term financial condition, and to avoid risking too much in any one particular asset class, Adiatma Sarjito, vice president of corporate communication, said in a statement late on Thursday. “Like the saying ‘don’t put (all) your eggs in one basket,’ we (plan to) minimise risk based on business and legal studies.” It was not immediately clear how much Pertamina targets to sell or over what time period, but the company would maintain control over the assets, Sarjito said. Pertamina’s total assets climbed 8 percent to $51.2 billion in 2017 from a year earlier, while its profits slid 19 percent to $2.5 billion over the same period, its audited earnings report shows. Deputy State Owned Enterprise Minister Fajar Harry Sampurno this week said his office had approved Pertamina’s proposal to “take steps” to shield itself from rising oil prices. He referred to a letter from his ministry to Pertamina directors that in principle approved their plans to reduce the company’s interests in some upstream projects. It also approved Pertamina plans to spin off its Cilacap and Balikpapan refinery businesses to its subsidiaries, and review company policies that “significantly” impact its finances. Indonesia’s upstream oil and gas regulator (SKKMigas) said it supported the moves, and “hopes that through these strategic steps PT Pertamina can make more aggressive efforts in exploration for new oil and gas reserves, and be more efficient in carrying out its upstream work programs.” Pertamina, however, has cut its 2018 capital spending budget by 28 percent to around $4 billion from $5.6 billion, Investor Daily newspaper reported on Thursday, quoting Pertamina Investment Planning and Risk Management Director Gigih Prakoso. Indonesia at the same time plans to increase spending on energy subsidies by 69 trillion rupiah ($4.8 billion) to 163.5 trillion rupiah to keep some fuel prices and electricity tariffs unchanged throughout the year, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Thursday. The rupiah hit 14,500 to the U.S. dollar on Friday, its lowest level since October 2015. Brent crude cost more than 1 million rupiah a barrel in July, the highest since mid-2014 just before global oil prices slumped. In comparison, Brent priced in U.S. dollars is at its highest since 2016.

Market participants suspected state intervention to support the currency. The drop in the yuan came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was concerned that the “Chinese currency was dropping like a rock” and the strong U.S. dollar “puts us at a disadvantage”. His comments knocked the dollar, forcing it off one-year highs against a basket of currencies But the yuan, hurt by concerns over the China-U.S. trade war and a slowing Chinese economy, has shed 7.6 percent of its value against the dollar since the end of the first quarter of this year. “A weaker Chinese yuan remains a source of risk for global currency markets – and the large dollar-yuan fixing higher by the (central bank) overnight requires some cautionary monitoring,” ING Bank told clients. Investors have vivid memories of China’s sudden devaluation of the yuan in 2015 and the subsequent turmoil in global financial markets as investors worried about the stability of the world’s second-largest economy. European markets were not immune to the jitters. The pan-European STOXX index and Germany’s DAX - which is highly exposed to trade and China - fell 0.2 percent at the start of trading. MSCI’s all-country world Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.2 percent on the day but was set to end the week flat. Meanwhile, political concerns returned to dog Italian assets. The country’s bonds and stocks sold off after local media reported tensions within the coalition government and a newspaper interview with a lawmakrer raised fresh concerns about Rome’s commitment to the euro. Italian newspapers reported tension between Economy Minister Giovanni Tria and the government’s two vice prime ministers. One reason for strained relations is disagreement over appointments at some state-controlled firms, including state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), traders said. And according to a report in the newspaper Corriere della Sera, the head of the budget committee in Italy’s parliament, Claudio Borghi, said Italy would come out of the euro sooner or later. “The reports out of Italy today are a reminder of just how dysfunctional the Italian government is,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. “It’s not helpful that these parties are packed with euro sceptics.” The news had little effect on the euro, however, which was up 0.1 percent on the day. In Asia on Friday, Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.3 percent, but Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.45 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index rose 2 percent. Worries about a full-blown global trade war are likely to persist as officials from the EU Trade Commission, due to arrive in Washington next week for trade talks, are said to be preparing a list of retaliatory measures in response to proposed U.S. tariffs on European Union cars. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of peers, was down 0.1 percent on the day at 95.118. Trump on Thursday criticised Federal Reserve policy and expressed concern about the potential impact of rising interest rates and a stronger dollar on the U.S. economy and American corporate competitiveness. Brent crude futures rose 0.9 percent to $73.24 a barrel, maintaining their gains so far this week, after Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor said the kingdom’s exports are likely to fall next month and inventories may be squeezed in the third quarter. Spot gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,222.85 an ounce.

2018-07-20,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall reported a fall in underlying operating earnings for the second quarter on Friday after higher coal and gas prices put a damper on margins even as a heatwave lifted power prices in its Nordic home market. A hot and dry spring and early summer have followed a cold winter in the region, leading to far lower water flows than normal, though Vattenfall said reservoir levels at its Swedish hydropower plants remained adequate for now. The drought, which has sparked wildfires across Sweden, has pushed up Nordic electricity prices with the hydrologic balance between water supply and consumption growing increasingly strained, Vattenfall Chief Executive Magnus Hall said.  “This hydrologic balance is almost back at the situation we had in 2003, when prices became very high,” he told Reuters. “Prices have already come up as a result of this and the assessment is that if we don’t see considerable amounts of rain, this price increase will continue.” Vattenfall’s hydropower plants, primarily located along the river arteries crossing northern Sweden, account for roughly a third of its electricity production.   Quarterly operating profit excluding one-off items fell to 3.8 billion Swedish crowns ($427 million) from a year-ago 4.8 billion even as net sales increased 9 percent, the company said. Vattenfall, which produces energy from carbons, nuclear, hydropower and wind, said higher prices for coal, gas and CO2 emission allowances had squeezed margins in its power plants that use those fuels. The average spot price for gas was 35 percent higher compared to the second quarter of last year while coal prices were up 17 percent, the company said. “Electricity prices have come up, but so have costs, and that is what we are seeing a bit in our results,” Hall said. Vattenfall recorded its first annual profit in five years in 2017 as the company turned the corner on a disastrous buying spree outside its Nordic home market that saw it rack up the biggest write-downs in Swedish corporate history.

2018-07-20,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is making a fresh attempt to sell supplier PFW Aerospace, which it acquired in 2011 to avoid an insolvency of the maker of precision tubes and components, sources close to the matter said.  The German company was always seen as a temporary part of Airbus, and the sale indicates that concerns about this part of the planemaker’s supply chain have eased. After failing to sell the supplier in 2015, the sources said Airbus was poised to launch a new auction in the autumn for the company, which may be valued at 500-600 million euros ($582-$698 mln). Investment bank Lazard (LAZ.N) has been brought in to organize the deal, the sources said.  Airbus and Lazard declined to comment. The planned divestiture comes as Airbus and its rival Boeing are concerned global trade tensions could deter airlines from buying jetliners, although geopolitical uncertainty has allowed the two companies to sell more weapons. At this week’s Farnborough Airshow, the world’s largest planemakers repeated last year’s comparable haul of around 900 orders, but the tally was overshadowed by some 400 deals where the names of the buyers were withheld. PFW has its origins in a German airplane manufacturer Pfalz-Flugzeugwerke, which produced military airplanes in both world wars. It later became part of Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, before it was sold first to its staff and then in 2001 to buyout firm Safeguard, which still owns a minority stake. In Airbus’ earlier bid to sell the company in 2015, the business attracted interest from Eaton (ETN.N), Parker (PH.N), Total’s Hutchinson (TOTF.PA) as well as buyout groups such as Bridgepoint, Bregal and Liberty Hall. None were willing to meet Airbus’ asking price at the time.

2018-07-20,"OSAKA, Japan (Reuters) - Retail power and gas heavyweights Kansai Electric Power (9503.T) and Osaka Gas (9532.T) are locked in a struggle for dominance in the Kansai region, whose economy is nearly the size of South Korea’s and includes Osaka, the second-biggest city in Japan. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the country’s power monopoly system - in place for nearly 70 years - was partially dismantled in 2016, followed by the liberalisation of the retail gas market a year later. Hundreds of new power sellers soon arrived on the scene, some with just a few dozen accounts. Since then, the Kansai region has seen the most gas customers, and the second-highest number of power customers, switch providers. Nowhere is that churn more evident than with Kansai Electric and Osaka Gas. Kansai Electric pulled about 580,000 retail gas customers from Osaka Gas, but lost about 680,000 power customers to it. Overall, Kansai Electric lost nearly 1.7 million power users. But its shares have risen 27 percent since the beginning of 2017, compared with about 1 percent decline for Osaka Gas.  “It’s like the elephants battling horses. When power and gas firms battle it out against Tokyo Electric (Tepco) or Kansai Electric for an extended period, gas firms could lose,” said Reiji Ogino, senior analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. He said Kansai Electric is predicted to shed 10 to 20 percent of its customers in coming years. Osaka Gas, however, is expected to see its customer base shrink by 20 to 30 percent, he added.  That is because power companies, which tend to be larger and more diverse, can better weather deregulation, Ogino said. Kansai Electric, for instance, now sells gas to retail customers. And the company, already the third-largest power supplier in Japan, has an additional advantage: in the past 14 months, it has resumed operations at four reactors idled after the Fukushima disaster. That has allowed it to cut its electricity prices by 5.4 percent in July, making them the fourth-lowest among the former 10 power monopolies. A price war is especially beneficial for large users such as 7-Eleven Japan, which has switched its thousands of convenience stores to Kansai Electric. The savings could amount to tens of millions of dollars per year, according to local media reports.  Osaka Gas, which has 2 gigawatts of domestic power plant capacity, mostly fired by gas, reacted by undercutting Kansai Electric’s prices.  But Kansai Electric still offers cheaper combined power and gas service than Osaka Gas. This year it also began offering additional discounts, such as waiving basic monthly fees for gas, which have accelerated the pace of customer acquisitions from its chief rival. For graphic on Kansai Electric quickens pace of gas customer acquisitions click reut.rs/2L8q6Bf Ogino said that the power and gas industries in Japan are likely to enter a period of alliances of former power and gas monopolies in different regions by 2020. The 10 years after that might see mergers and acquisitions, he added. But he said a merger of the two Osaka-area rivals would be unlikely. “I don’t think the trade ministry would allow the creation of one giant power and gas company in the Kansai region because the competition principle does not work,” Ogino said. Shinichi Yamazaki, senior sector analyst at Okasan Securities, agreed. “Chances for acquisitions or mergers in Kansai region may be slim because the companies are large in size, but there may be such cases in remote areas,” Yamazaki said. Kansai Electric has tried to strengthen its position further by buying stakes in LNG projects outside Japan, getting into retail gas sales and even delving into real estate. “The history of their battle goes back two or three decades, but given Osaka Gas thinks it’s no match for Kansai Electric, it has been diversifying its businesses from way back,” he said. “History repeats itself, and the battle will continue.” Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/japan-energy-battle/japans-kansai-region-a-major-battleground-for-gas-and-electric-utilities-idUKL4N1U509N,20 Jul 2018,"* Kansai Electric, Osaka Gas square off amid liberalised

The yuan took a beating earlier in the day after the central bank set a weaker fixing for the currency for the seventh straight session, adding to the anxiety in Asian markets, which remain sensitive to any sharp moves in the yuan. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last up 0.55 percent after falling as much as 0.4 percent earlier. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open lower, with Britain’s FTSE falling 0.1 percent and Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC both shedding 0.25 percent. The yuan’s latest bout of weakness, catalysed by concerns over the brewing China-U.S. trade war and a slowing Chinese economy, has seen the it shed 7.6 percent of its value against the dollar since the end of the first quarter of this year. “There are several channels through which the yuan’s weakening is hitting Asian stocks. First, a weaker yuan challenges the competitiveness of other Asian economies,” said Shusuke Yamada, currency and equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. “The weaker currency also causes fears of capital leaving China and disrupting their capital markets, which could have knock-on effects on Asia. Lastly, a weaker yuan deepens trade war concerns.” The yuan fell to as low as 6.8128 to the dollar in the onshore market, before reversing course to last trade at 6.777 for a gain of about 0.05 percent. China’s stocks bounced back after the yuan made its about turn, its depreciation arrested after major state-owned Chinese banks were seen selling dollars in an apparent bid by authorities to prevent a rapid fall in the currency. Dominant in investors’ memories is China’s sudden devaluation of the yuan in 2015 and the subsequent turmoil in global financial markets then as investors worried about the stability of the world’s second-largest economy. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.3 percent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite Index both bounced out of negative territory to gain 0.45 percent and 2 percent, respectively. “Investors do not know how far the yuan could fall,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “(The authorities) might want to keep economic growth stable, and the direct impact of a weaker yuan could offset some negative impact from the trade war. But it will be hard to maintain confidence among foreign investors in purchasing yuan-denominated assets.” Asian stock markets were already edgy after Wall Street shares declined overnight amid the latest flare up in trade tensions, with the Dow shedding 0.53 percent and the S&P 500 declining 0.39 percent. Worries about a full-blown global trade war are likely to persist as officials from the EU Trade Commission, due to arrive in Washington next week for trade talks, are said to be preparing a list of tit-for-tat actions in response to proposed U.S. tariffs on EU cars. Against its peers, the U.S. dollar was on the defensive following U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of Federal Reserve policy. Trump on Thursday criticised Fed policy and expressed concern about the potential impact of rising rates and a stronger dollar on the U.S. economy and American corporate competitiveness. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.15 percent lower at 95.018 after being knocked down from 95.652, its highest level since July 2017. The dollar had reached that high after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed confidence in the U.S. economy and affirmed expectations that the central bank was on track to keep hiking interest rates gradually. The euro added 0.2 percent to $1.1666, lifted from a three-week trough of $1.1575 set overnight. The single currency has lost about 0.3 percent this week. The greenback lost 0.15 percent to 112.300 yen. It has been knocked away from one-year peak of 113.18 scaled on Thursday.

2018-07-20,"July 20 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices softened for another week as the focus of purchasing activity switched to September, encountering weak demand, new supply and a falling yuan potentially sapping Chinese demand. Spot prices for September LNG-AS delivery in Asia were assessed at $9.50 per million British thermal units (Btu), down 50 cents from the previous week. Traders Vitol, Trafigura and Diamond Gas International offered five cargoes in total via the Platts Market on Close process but there were no takers even as offers on some of the cargoes slipped to around $9.05 per mmBtu, traders said. In the world’s three-biggest LNG importers Japan, China and South Korea demand weakened or was set to drop later in the year. Already, Japanese LNG imports in June fell to the lowest in more than two years as utilities switched on more nuclear reactors shut following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. Japan has six reactors operating and three others have passed safety inspections and could be operating by October, allowing utilities to switch away from LNG. With temperatures in Japan set to fall back in line with average levels over the next week, demand for gas should also be tempered as cooling demand dips. Chinese demand could be reduced by the yuan’s sharp slide against the U.S. dollar to a one-year low as the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington unnerves markets, making U.S. dollar-denominated LNG more costly for Chinese buyers. The pace of spot purchasing has slackened in China although one deal was heard done this week at an estimated $9.50 per mmBtu, sources said. Two Arctic shipments from Russia’s Yamal project flowed to China as ice melt along the Northern Sea Route cleared a path, speeding up deliveries to the world’s second-biggest LNG consumer, potentially curbing China’s call on spot purchases for now. In South Korea, imports are set to ease from record levels racked up in the first half of the year, with appetite for the fuel from utilities seen fading as a raft of nuclear power stations come back online. With an average of only six reactors expected to be offline over the rest of the year, analysts say shipments of LNG into the world’s No.3 importer of the fuel are likely to decline. Restocking LNG inventory at South Korean terminals is already well under way ahead of winter, sources said. South Korea’s Korea Midland Power Co sought a cargo for November delivery via tender on Friday. Russia’s Sakhalin II LNG project added to supply this week after offering a cargo loading on Sept. 5. In the Atlantic, Trinidad’s Point Fortin LNG Exports also offered a cargo loading at the end of August. Furthermore, new supplies are expected in September. Japan’s Inpex expects its Ichthys plant in Australia to start up in September, along with the second production train at Yamal in Russia, boosting shipments to world markets. European spot prices so far remain uncompetitive with Asia in drawing away Qatari cargoes, as storage inventories recover across the continent. Indian Oil Corp was seeking a cargo for late August delivery.

2018-07-20,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co reported a smaller-than-expected drop in profit on Friday, but cut a key financial target, raising questions about its full-year outlook and sending shares sharply lower. The 126-year-old industrial conglomerate, whose power and financial-services units are struggling, said it expects to generate perhaps $1 billion less free cash flow than expected this year. The forecast cast doubt on GE’s full-year adjusted profit target of $1.00 to $1.07 a share. Though GE affirmed that target on Friday, many analysts see it as unrealistic and have cut their estimates to less than $1.00.    “We are getting questions as to how the company can maintain EPS guidance while cutting free cash flow guidance,” JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Friday. GE’s conference call with analysts also cast doubt on the outlook. “They gave you all the conditions for why the forecast could go down,” said Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. For example, GE had previously said it expects to ship 50 to 55 large power turbines this year. “On the call, they said ‘We’re targeting 50.’” GE also said power equipment sales may take longer to close. “The only thing you’re going to hear from that is there’s downside risk,” Dray said.  The stock was down 5.2 percent at $13.02 in midday trading.  The stock decline was “all about cash and (GE’s) acknowledgement of risk to the second half,” said Jeffrey Sprague, analyst at Vertical Research Partners.  GE cut the industrial free cash flow target to $6 billion from a range of $6 billion to $7 billion.   Its adjusted earnings, which exclude certain pension and restructuring costs, fell 10 percent to 19 cents a share, beating analysts’ expectations of 17 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Total revenue rose to $30.1 billion from $29.1 billion. GE said weakness in power and renewables energy offset gains in its aviation and healthcare units.  A decade and a half ago, GE was the world’s most valuable public company. But the Boston-based conglomerate foundered in several industrial markets and its move into financial services steered it into the global financial storm in 2008.  GE shares have halved in the past year. Though investors are still interested in GE, many want to see the power and capital units stabilize and even improve before buying the stock, analysts have said. GE revealed no new bad news about ongoing accounting investigations, a shareholder lawsuit and a federal inquiry into subprime mortgage activity, and appeared to be operating better, some analysts said. “They didn’t screw up,” said Nick Heymann, analyst at William Blair. “This was a quarter driven entirely by aviation and healthcare.”  GE beat earnings expectations in part because it cut overhead costs more than expected and the losses at GE Capital were less than analysts expected, said RBC’s Dray.  The results capped an unusually busy quarter in which Chief Executive John Flannery announced a long-awaited plan to spin off its healthcare unit and sell its 62.5 percent stake in oil services firm Baker Hughes.  In May, GE announced an $11.1-billion deal to merge its locomotive unit with Wabtec Corp. In June, it announced a $3.25-billion sale of its distributed power unit to U.S. buyout group Advent. GE also restated results for 2016 and 2017 to reflect new accounting standards. Last month, it was removed from the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. Finally, GE’s top executive in Latin America was jailed in Brazil after prosecutors said he was involved in a price-fixing scheme for medical equipment. Losses widened at GE Capital, the company’s financing arm, during the quarter. Power unit profit fell 58 percent in the quarter and orders there were down. GE’s power unit is relying on services revenue to offset declining sales of new equipment. But the services business also is under attack from competitors in important markets such as Saudi Arabia. Earnings from continuing operations attributable to GE shareholders fell to $736 million, or 8 cents a share, from $1.03 billion, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier.  One positive for GE: Adjusted free cash flow from industrial activities swung to a positive $258 million in the quarter from a negative $1.7 billion in the first quarter.

U.S. government bond yields rose as Trump repeated his criticism a day earlier of the Federal Reserve’s policy on raising interest rates, saying it takes away from the United States’ “big competitive edge.” He also lamented the strength of the dollar and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. The dollar was on pace for its biggest single-session drop in three weeks against a basket of major currencies, stalling a rally that had driven the greenback to a year high. “The dollar is an important issue today especially because we have been on a rise for quite a long time,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, fell 0.59 percent, with the euro up 0.57 percent to $1.1707. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 41.81 points, or 0.17 percent, to 25,106.31, the S&P 500 gained 4.14 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,808.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 31.92 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,857.21. “The dollar going down typically tends to lift equities and I think that is partly why we have seen a little bit of a turnaround today,” Frederick said. Microsoft shares rose, boosting indexes after a strong earnings report, while General Electric shares sank after the conglomerate cut a key financial target. In the latest trade salvo, Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of imported goods from China. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.45 percent, helped by Asian markets . The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.13 percent, amid rising trade tensions. European auto shares, sensitive to trade tensions as U.S. officials work towards slapping tariffs on car imports, fell 2.1 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. notes last fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.8894 percent, from 2.847 percent late on Thursday. Benchmark Brent crude stabilized as a weakening dollar and lower expected August oil exports from Saudi Arabia supported the market, overtaking concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions and supply increases. U.S. crude rose 0.81 percent to $70.02 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.15, up 0.79 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho in London; Editing by

2018-07-20,"(Reuters) - Baker Hughes, General Electric Co’s oilfield services arm, on Friday reported a slight profit miss on weaker revenues in its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses, but delivered an upbeat outlook for the second half of the year. Revenue from its oilfield equipment business, which includes deepwater drilling, fell 9.4 percent to $617 million in the second quarter, missing analysts’ estimate of $648.2 million. The Houston-based company, however, said the macro outlook for oil markets continued to be favorable. “North American production is increasing as operators grow rig and well counts, and we are seeing signs of increasing international activity in some geomarkets,” Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said. Its shares jumped 2.4 percent to $32.53 following the company’s second-quarter conference call. Overall revenue rose 2.4 percent to $5.55 billion, slightly below expectations of $5.57 billion. Adjusted earnings were 13 cents per share, missing estimates by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in oilfield services, which accounts for more than one-half of overall sales, gained 14 percent year over year to approximately $2.9 billion, driven by stronger activity in North America. Higher oil prices have prompted a surge in drilling activity. U.S. oil production hit a record 11 million barrels per day last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Analysts for investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co called the results “not particularly sexy” or a big stock mover.  Baker Hughes expects longer-cycle projects to drive growth in its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses in the second half of 2018 and 2019. The company forecast that demand in LNG markets would double to about 500 million tons per year by 2030. On June 26, GE said it will divest its 62.5 percent stake in Baker Hughes in the next two or three years in a bid to simplify its structure and boost shareholder returns. The conglomerate acquired the services firm in July 2017, creating the second largest oilfield services provider by revenue. On Friday, Baker Hughes said it will keep technology, capabilities and infrastructure obtained through the merger despite its breakup with GE. “There are agreements in place to ensure there is a seamless separation. We’ll work with GE as they evaluate the timing and structure,” Simonelli said.

2018-07-20,"(Adds Equinor comment, other possible strike action) LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - Unite the Union members working for Aker Solutions on Equinor’s Mariner oil platform were the latest to threaten strike action over pay, Britain’s largest workers union said on Friday. A series of strikes loom over the North Sea this summer. Workers on some of Total’s North Sea fields are due to start a series of 24-hour and 12-hour strikes on Monday. Another set of workers are also considering strike action. Unite said it will ballot 2,500 offshore oil services workers after rejecting a pay increase offer from the Offshore Contractors Association (OCA). This could affect 106 platforms, it said. The Aker strike would involve about 200 workers and would likely take place between early August and early October. Mariner is a heavy oilfield located some 150 km (93 miles) east of the Shetland Islands that is due to start production in the second half of 2018 with a target plateau output of 55,000 barrels per day. Its operator, Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, was not immediately available for comment. Strike action by 1,600 Norwegian rig drillers ended on Thursday after starting on July 10.

2018-07-20,"ISTANBUL/LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey’s biggest oil importer Tupras has cut back purchases of Iranian crude since May, when the United States said it would re-impose sanctions on Tehran, and analysts say Tupras is likely to stick to lower volumes in coming months. NATO member Turkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighbouring Iran has been one of its main sources of oil because of its proximity, crude quality and favourable price differentials, traders say. In the first four months of 2018, Tupras, Turkey’s largest refiner, bought an average of 187,196 barrels per day of Iranian oil, data from Turkey’s energy watchdog EPDK showed. In April alone, Tupras imported eight cargoes - equivalent to just over 240,000 bpd - from the OPEC member. But since May, when President Donald Trump announced the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran after pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal, Tupras’s purchases of Iranian oil have gone down. Tehran shipped four cargoes of crude oil per month to Tupras, equivalent to around 130,000 bpd, in May and June, tanker tracking and shipping data showed, down from six to eight earlier in the year. So far in July, Tupras has bought three more cargoes. The United States is due to re-instate sanctions on Iran’s energy sector after a wind-down period ends on Nov. 4.  An industry source said the U.S. decision was the main reason for the decline in Tupras’s purchases of Iranian oil since May, but said the company was likely to continue importing some Iranian crude, as it did when U.S. sanctions were previously in force. “During the sanctions scheme of 2011 by the U.S., Tupras was able to purchase 3 to 4 cargoes of Iranian crude a month,” the industry source said. “I believe they would want to be able to stick to that this time as well instead of completely stopping. This crude needs to be bought by someone as otherwise it will send the price shooting up, which nobody wants,” he said. Refiners in other countries are affected by the sanctions because they want to maintain their access to the U.S. financial system. Indian refiners also cut imports of Iranian oil last month to avoid looming U.S. sanctions. Trump initially planned to totally shut Iran out of global oil markets, demanding all other countries stop buying its crude by November. The United States later said it may grant sanction waivers to some allies that are particularly reliant on Iranian supplies. Most analysts still think the sanctions will significantly reduce Iran’s crude oil exports, with some forecasting as much as a two-thirds drop to 700,000 barrels per day (bpd). Turkey has criticised the U.S. decision, saying Ankara will not cut trade ties with Iran at the behest of other countries. After meeting a U.S. delegation in Ankara on Friday, the Turkish foreign ministry said authorities were working to avoid the U.S. sanctions from harming Turkey. In the past, whenever Turkey has needed to cut back on Iranian oil, Iraqi crude emerged as the alternative. Analysts say that is again likely to be the case in the coming months. “Iran and Iraq have traditionally been Turkey’s two biggest crude oil suppliers,” Cuneyt Kazokoglu, head of oil demand at consulting firm FGE, said. “It won’t be a surprise to see more Basra barrels flowing to Turkey,” he said. In the first four months of the year, Turkey imported an average of 39,768 bpd of Iraqi oil. In the whole of 2017, Iraq was Turkey’s third biggest supplier of crude after Iran and Russia, with 7 million tonnes of oil, equivalent to around 141,000 bpd.

2018-07-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - The rising value of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies is creating an additional headwind for oil prices, as it pushes up the local price of crude and fuels across much of Asia, Europe and Latin America. In trade-weighted terms, the dollar has risen to its highest since late 2016 and early 2017, and before that 2002/2003. (Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2LzLuvB) Adjusted for inflation, the dollar’s trade-weighted value is close to its highest since 2004, according to the broad exchange rate index compiled by the Federal Reserve. (Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2LC7Zjh) The U.S. dollar has appreciated by more than 8 percent against China’s yuan since the end of March, in response to the worsening trade tensions between the two countries. China overtook the United States to become the world’s largest crude importer in 2017 and net imports of crude and fuels are now running at around 9 million barrels per day. Brent crude prices have risen nearly 9 percent this year in dollar terms but are up more than 13.5 percent in yuan as a result of the exchange-rate shift. China’s currency depreciation is partly driven by bilateral tensions as the country’s authorities actively engineer or passively permit the exchange rate to act as a shock absorber (the practical effect is the same). But the U.S. dollar has also appreciated against every other major currency, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, the South Korean won and the Canadian dollar. The U.S. currency is also rising against most emerging-market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah. In general, it is the U.S. dollar appreciating rather than other currencies depreciating, mostly as a result of strong economic growth in the United States, steadily rising interest rates and safe-haven capital flows. The result is that oil prices in most oil-consuming countries are now rising much faster than the international benchmark prices quoted in dollars. There is no simple and stable relationship between exchange rates and oil prices quoted in dollars – the two have sometimes been correlated and sometimes not. Exchange rates are only one of many influences on the price of oil, and the relationship is not strong or predictable enough to be tradeable. But a strong dollar is generally associated with lower benchmark oil prices, and vice versa, all other things being equal. The last period of very high oil prices between 2011 and the first half of 2014 coincided with a period of dollar weakness, which cushioned the impact in many major oil-consuming countries. But oil’s recent rise has been accompanied by a strengthening dollar, especially in recent months, which will intensify the impact on consumers. Many emerging markets also took advantage of low oil prices in 2015 and 2016 to scale back fuel subsidies and price controls. Consumers in many of the fastest-growing fuel markets are being exposed to the impact of pricier oil much more than before. Gasoline and diesel prices in India, for example, one of the fastest-growing fuel markets, recently hit record levels because of a cocktail of higher crude prices, a stronger dollar, fiscal changes and the reduction of price controls. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, rising oil prices are likely to prompt a much larger demand-response from consumers than in 2011-2014. In the current oil-price cycle, demand restraint is likely to be felt much faster and more aggressively than in 2006-2008 or 2011-2014, so long as the dollar remains strong.

2018-07-20,"KIEV, July 20 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s Naftogaz on Friday clarified its stance on negotiations with Gazprom by saying that the Russian gas producer must pay it more than $2.56 billion. “As we told Gazprom at the tripartite meeting, an amicable agreement on the decision already taken by the arbitration court is not possible,” Yuriy Vitrenko, Naftogaz’s chief commercial officer, wrote on Facebook. “In line with the (Stockholm court) arbitration decisions, Gazprom must pay us $2.56 billion plus $75 million in interest, as well as compensate for the costs of compulsory recovery,” he said. Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev this week was quoted as saying Gazprom’s talk of reaching an amicable agreement was “just a waste of time” but that Naftogaz was prepared to consider it. Ukraine and Russia have clashed over gas supply and pricing for years and relations have deteriorated since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Kiev no longer buys gas from Gazprom but the Russian company still pipes gas across Ukraine to Europe. Naftogaz and Gazprom this week held a European Union-mediated meeting in Berlin on a new transit deal but the talks have been complicated by their lengthy legal dispute. A Stockholm court in February awarded Naftogaz $4.63 billion in damages but also ordered it to pay $2 billion to Gazprom and to resume purchases. This month Naftogaz said it had submitted a new claim to the Stockholm arbitration court for more than $11 billion from Gazprom related to a transit contract.

U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with CNBC that he was prepared to impose the full raft of tariffs. When asked about the stock market possibly falling if he took such a step, Trump said: “If it does, it does. Look, I’m not doing this for politics.” U.S. equity futures  turned lower after Trump’s comments, and the VIX volatility index - known as the “fear gauge” - rose to its highest level since July 11. The MSCI All Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up a little over 0.1 percent, and set to end the week flat after two consecutive weekly gains. “While we expect the (trade) dispute to be resolved before tipping the world into recession, there is a risk that the conflict gets worse before it gets better,” UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele wrote in a note to clients. “As a result, we reduce the size of our overweight in global equities. We will await a reduction in trade risks, as well as monitoring growth and valuations, for signs the time is right to increase exposure again.” Asian markets were dented by a slide in the Chinese yuan to its lowest for more than a year, after the Chinese central bank set a weaker fixing for the currency for the seventh straight session. The yuan last traded at 6.7955 to the dollar in the onshore market, after falling to 6.8128 in Asian trading. hours. Market participants attributed the currency’s slight rebound to suspected intervention by state authorities. The yuan has shed 7.6 percent of its value against the dollar since the end of the first quarter, hurt by concerns over the China-U.S. trade war and a slowing Chinese economy. Friday’s losses came a day after Trump had also said he was concerned that the “Chinese currency was dropping like a rock”, he did not like rising U.S. interest rates and that the strong U.S. dollar “puts us at a disadvantage”. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of peers, was down 0.1 percent on the day at 95.027. After falling 0.4 percent, MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended the day 0.6 percent higher as the yuan rebounded. European markets were not immune to the jitters. The pan-European STOXX index and Germany’s DAX, which is highly exposed to trade and China, were down 0.2 percent and half a percent respectively. Europe’s autos sector extended falls, down nearly 2 percent after Trump’s comments and set for their biggest losses day for three weeks. Global investors ploughed $5 billion into bonds and withdrew money from gold and European equities in the past week, as fears of a trade war encourage investors to seek safety in fixed income, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said. Meanwhile, political concerns in Italy returned, hitting government bonds and stocks. Reports or tensions within the coalition and an interview with a lawmarer renewed concerns about Rome’s commitment to the euro. The benchmark Italian stock index pared losses after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio denied media reports that he had demanded Economy Minister Giovanni Tria resign unless he backed government nominees to head major companies. “The reports out of Italy today are a reminder of just how dysfunctional the Italian government is,” Daiwa Capital Markets head of economic research Chris Scicluna said. “It’s not helpful that these parties are packed with euro sceptics.” The euro remained largely unchanged however, and was up 0.2 percent on the day at $1.1658. Oil prices pared early gains on the trade worries and were on course for a third straight week of falls. Brent crude pared an early 0.9 percent gain to be up 0.2 percent by 1145 GMT at $72.69 per barrel. Spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,224.35 an ounce, having hit its lowest level for a year this week.

While higher oil prices have yielded Pertamina better returns from its oil and gas output, they have also increased the fuel bill for the net oil importer, especially amid the slumping rupiah. Indonesia has promised not to raise some consumer fuel and electricity prices ahead of elections in 2019, but the populist policy has also dented Pertamina’s finances and cut its means of spending on much-needed infrastructure. The government, which sets Pertamina’s fuel prices, wants to guard Pertamina’s finances from crude prices that are expected to climb 46 percent above the $48 per barrel assumed in this year’s budget, and a 7 percent weakening of the rupiah against the dollar this year. Pertamina wants to divest to help maintain its long-term financial condition, and to avoid risking too much in any one particular asset class, Adiatma Sarjito, vice president of corporate communication, said in a statement late on Thursday. “Like the saying ‘don’t put (all) your eggs in one basket,’ we (plan to) minimise risk based on business and legal studies.” It was not immediately clear how much Pertamina targets to sell or over what time period, but the company would maintain control over the assets, Sarjito said. Pertamina’s total assets climbed 8 percent to $51.2 billion in 2017 from a year earlier, while its profits slid 19 percent to $2.5 billion over the same period, its audited earnings report shows. Deputy State Owned Enterprise Minister Fajar Harry Sampurno this week said his office had approved Pertamina’s proposal to “take steps” to shield itself from rising oil prices. He referred to a letter from his ministry to Pertamina directors that in principle approved their plans to reduce the company’s interests in some upstream projects. It also approved Pertamina plans to spin off its Cilacap and Balikpapan refinery businesses to its subsidiaries, and review company policies that “significantly” impact its finances. Indonesia’s upstream oil and gas regulator (SKKMigas) said it supported the moves, and “hopes that through these strategic steps PT Pertamina can make more aggressive efforts in exploration for new oil and gas reserves, and be more efficient in carrying out its upstream work programs.” Pertamina, however, has cut its 2018 capital spending budget by 28 percent to around $4 billion from $5.6 billion, Investor Daily newspaper reported on Thursday, quoting Pertamina Investment Planning and Risk Management Director Gigih Prakoso. Indonesia at the same time plans to increase spending on energy subsidies by 69 trillion rupiah ($4.8 billion) to 163.5 trillion rupiah to keep some fuel prices and electricity tariffs unchanged throughout the year, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Thursday. The rupiah hit 14,500 to the U.S. dollar on Friday, its lowest level since October 2015. Brent crude cost more than 1 million rupiah a barrel in July, the highest since mid-2014 just before global oil prices slumped. In comparison, Brent priced in U.S. dollars is at its highest since 2016.
