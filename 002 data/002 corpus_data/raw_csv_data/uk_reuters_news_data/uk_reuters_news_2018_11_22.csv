2018-11-22,"(Adds Castello Branco comments, background, quotes) By Mateus Maia and Marta Nogueira BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A top aide to Brazilian president-elect Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday the new government would adopt concession contracts for lucrative pre-salt oil auctions, raising concerns that talks to change the regime would drag and derail much-needed investment. Later, however, Roberto Castello Branco, who Bolsonaro has tapped to lead state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA said there was no final decision yet on what contracts the new administration would offer in the highly prized deep water oil tenders. Bolsonaro, a longtime economic nationalist and far-right legislator, modified his stance on the way to his election last month, declaring himself open to selling state assets and ceding ground over the government’s role in the crucial energy sector. Investors are eager to win a bigger slice of Brazil’s oil prize, but the shift away from an increasingly successful production sharing auction regime also raises concerns that any changes would require lengthy discussions in Congress, raising uncertainty and causing investment to dry up. A senior transition official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Bolsonaro’s administration would seek to modify the current production-sharing contract in the pre-salt fields. The source said they plan to adopt a concession model that would involve less state interference. “That’s a clear preference of ours, we will change to concessions instead of production-sharing,” the source said, without elaborating on whether the new policy would require a change in the law. The production-sharing model, which was rolled out by the leftist Workers Party (PT) and reformed by the center-right government of Michel Temer, gives the state a share of income. It has proved successful in recent auctions, luring oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp, Repsol SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and BP Plc . Asked about the potential shift during an event in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, Marcio Felix, the minister for mines and energy, said the best solution was to make a relatively simple adjustment to a law that mandates all pre-salt blocks must be tendered with production-sharing contracts. Nonetheless, Felix said he suggested to the incoming administration that any changes should take place after 2020, once key auctions have taken place. He said his main concern was that congressional talks would snarl and pause the current round of tenders, which have been successful in attracting much-needed investment. “If we get into that discussion in Congress, for example, we run the risk of paralyzing auctions and that’s what we do not want. The risks need to be well measured,” said José Mauro Coelho, a director at the Energy Research Company. Higher oil prices and the need to replace shrinking reserves have boosted oil majors’ appetites for costlier offshore ventures, pumping money into the government’s coffers. Last month, newspaper Valor reported Bolsonaro’s team was planning to tweak the production-sharing model to attack some of the political abuses perpetrated by previous administrations. Petrobras was at the center of an investigation dubbed “Car Wash” that uncovered a massive and long-running pay-to-play corruption scheme. The government found that political parties and politically appointed executives took over 6 billion reais ($1.58 billion) in bribes, mainly from construction and engineering firms, in exchange for winning contracts with Petrobras. Scores of powerful businessmen and politicians, including former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, have been jailed in connection to the case. The PT ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years and has been blamed by critics for a weak economy and endemic graft. Temer took office in 2016 after former PT President Dilma Rousseff was impeached. $1 = 3.8081 reais

2018-11-22,"(Adds IMF comments) By Mayela Armas and Corina Pons CARACAS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Preliminary data compiled by Venezuela’s central bank shows the economy shrank by 16.6 percent in 2017 compared with the year before, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, the country’s sharpest decline on record. The OPEC nation’s economy has been in free fall following the collapse of oil prices in 2014 and the unraveling of its socialist system, leading millions of people to leave the country to escape hyperinflation and rising malnutrition. But the central bank has stopped publishing economic indicators amid what President Nicolas Maduro describes as an “economic war” led by businesses and political adversaries. Preliminary data being prepared by technical experts shows that oil sector activity shrank 11.3 percent in 2017 from 2016 while the non-oil sector contracted 15.2 percent, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. The International Monetary Fund has been pressuring Venezuela for weeks to provide data on economic activity, consumer prices and balance of payments, the sources said. The central bank’s board of directors is interested in providing the data to the IMF, according to the sources, but it has not officially approved the figures. One of the sources said that a member of the board was seeking to “sweeten” the data, or alter statistics such that economic problems look less dramatic. Venezuela’s Information Ministry and the central bank did not respond to requests for comment. Jesus Faria of the all-powerful Constituent Assembly this week said that the government had made initial contact with the IMF to provide the data, adding that “we cannot allow ourselves to be hit with IMF sanctions, because such a move could lead to our expulsion from the institution.” When asked for comment, an IMF spokesman referred Reuters to comments made by IMF Communications Department Director Gerry Rice in a Nov. 15 news briefing, when he said that IMF staff had made contact with Venezuelan authorities on the issue of providing data and hoped the discussions would lead to a “productive conclusion.” The sources did not provide consumer price data for 2017. But they said that the producer price index, which tends to move in tandem with consumer prices, rose 2,800 percent in 2017 with respect to the prior year. That is in line with data from the opposition-run legislature, which began calculating economic indicators last year after the central bank stopped publishing official figures. The legislature says the producer price index rose 2,616 percent last year, and that annual inflation in October topped 833,000 percent.

2018-11-22,"PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unions CGT and FO on Thursday rejected a 1.5 percent salary increase offer by employers and called on their members to intensify a strike at French refineries and depots with a shutdown of production and distribution. The unions said in a statement, after wage talks with the French oil sector employers federation UFIP, that the wage increase offer that was made was below the French inflation rate of 2.2 percent.  They said the UFIP also rejected their bonuses demands. “The FO and CGT federations are calling on all branches in the oil sector to intensify the strike, carry out a shutdown of production units and block deliveries wherever possible,” the statement said. CGT said earlier on Thursday that the strike over wages and bonuses had hit output and deliveries at six out of France’s seven oil refineries, as well as at two major depots. CGT spokesman Thierry Defresne told Reuters that the two-day strike that started on Wednesday could be extended at the refineries and depots on Thursday evening after a vote by union members at each site.  Defresne said refineries affected by the strike included all four of Total’s (TOTF.PA) refineries in France. The 253,000 barrel-per-day Gonfreville in Normandy, the 102,000 bpd Grandpuits site, the 220,000 bpd Donges refinery and the 109,000 bpd Feyzin refinery. He said that strikes had also been declared at the Ineos refinery in Lavera and Exxon Mobil’s Fos-sur-Mer plant, which are both in the south of France. As of now, only one refinery in France, Exxon Mobil’s  240,000 bpd Port-Jerome-Gravenchon refinery, was not affected by the strike, Defresne said.  A spokeswoman for Total said output and products deliveries at three of its four refineries and a depot were slightly impacted by the strike. Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said a limited number of employees joined national protest during an afternoon shift on Thursday at the Fos-sur-Mer Refinery, and there was no impact on production and supply for both Gravenchon and Fos refineries. Ineos could not immediately be reached for comment. Workers at France’s CIM oil storage and dispatch services company, which handles supplies of crude to Total and Exxon’s refineries in the north of France, walked out in solidarity with the striking workers earlier on Thursday, CIM’s head Olivier Peyrin said. He said work was expected to resume at the terminal around 1800 GMT.

2018-11-22,"(Repeats story from Nov 22 with no change to text) By Praveen Menon and Charlotte Greenfield WELLINGTON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Low-lying Vanuatu is considering suing fossil fuel companies and industrialised countries that use them for their role in creating catastrophic climate change, the foreign minister of the Pacific island nation said on Thursday. Vanuatu, with an estimated population of 280,000 people spread across roughly 80 islands, is among more than a dozen Pacific island nations that already face rising sea levels and more regular storms that can wipe out much of their economies. Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu said it was time that some of the billions of dollars of profits fossil fuel companies generate every year goes towards the damage they cause in countries like “desperate” Vanuatu. “This is really about claiming for the damages,” he told Reuters in an interview. Speaking at the Climate Vulnerable Forum’s Virtual Summit earlier in the day, Regenvanu announced the legal options Vanuatu was considering. “My government is now exploring all avenues to utilize the judicial system in various jurisdictions - including under international law - to shift the costs of climate protection back on to fossil fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to my country,” he said. About 64 percent of Vanuatu’s GDP was wiped out in a single cyclone in 2015, causing economic losses of $449.4 million, he said. Samoa, on behalf of the 18 Pacific island forum members, including Vanuatu, on Saturday called on leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to pay more attention to climate change. Regenvanu said Vanuatu was also pursuing the idea of joining hands with other nations to pursue legal action. “We are looking for climate vulnerable countries who are willing to step up and be involved in such a case,” he told Reuters. He said Vanuatu would discuss it with other countries at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP24, next month. “Vanuatu’s brave announcement today is part of a global wave of legal action against oil, gas, and coal companies and laggard governments,” Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said in a statement. Climate change lawsuits against big corporations and governments are on the rise. The U.S. city of Baltimore filed a lawsuit in June against 26 oil and gas companies and entities, including BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp, for knowingly contributing to what the city called the catastrophic consequences of climate change.

2018-11-22,"(Adds comments by federal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Alberta is willing to buy trains itself to help clear a backlog of crude oil if Ottawa decides not to back the Canadian province’s proposal to split the costs of new rail cars, Premier Rachel Notley said on Thursday. Notley said Alberta had asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to help pay for additional rail capacity to move an additional 120,000 to 140,000 barrels per day. Notley said Alberta had not received an answer from Ottawa. Full pipelines have stranded much of Western Canada’s expanding crude output, driving down the price U.S. refineries are willing to pay. “Ottawa needs to join Alberta to help ease the economic pain,” Notley told oil well drillers in Calgary. “If Ottawa won’t come to the table, then we’ll get it done ourselves .. If it takes buying trains to (move more oil to market) then that’s what we’re going to do.” Reuters reported exclusively late on Wednesday that Alberta has asked Ottawa to share the C$350 million ($265.4 million)capital cost, and C$2.6 billion in operating costs over three years of buying rail capacity to move more crude, starting in July 2019. Sources briefed on the matter say federal officials are cool to the idea, suggesting that by the time any new cars came on line the worst of the glut should be over. Trudeau, speaking later in Calgary, did not respond directly when asked about Alberta’s proposal. He said oil executives were focused on tax breaks and adding pipeline capacity. “There are many things that are beyond our control here,” he told reporters, citing refinery shutdowns and the fact Canada exports almost all its oil to the United States. “This is very much a crisis,” he added. Trudeau’s Liberals could lose Alberta seats in a federal election set for October 2019 if voters decide he did not do enough to help. Finance Minister Bill Morneau also showed little evident enthusiasm when asked by reporters about Notley’s request, saying “that’s a discussion that might go forward in Alberta.” Low prices are costing the Canadian economy C$80 million a day, according to Alberta. Companies that service oil producers are “on life support,” said Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, which hosted Notley’s speech. Several Canadian crude producers, including Cenovus Energy , have curtailed production and asked Alberta to mandate cuts for other producers. Notley said the province is considering several options to improve prices. Mandated production is opposed by producers who own refineries to process the cheap oil, such as Suncor Energy and Imperial Oil. The premier said Alberta would have liked greater recognition of the industry’s struggles in the federal government’s fiscal update, which Morneau delivered on Wednesday without including specific new measures to help the sector. A spokesperson for Canadian National Railway Co could not be immediately reached. Canadian Pacific Railway declined to comment. Notley said Alberta has short-listed six projects to partially upgrade oil, worth a combined C$5 billion if all proceed. Upgrading reduces the thickness of bitumen so it does not require blending with lighter oil to move in pipelines, freeing up space. $1 = 1.3189 Canadian dollars

2018-11-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Thursday after U.S. inventories swelled to their highest level since December adding to concerns about a global crude glut but OPEC talk of an output cut limited losses. Benchmark Brent LCOc1 fell 96 cents last trading at $62.52 a barrel at 1840 GMT, edging back from a more than $1 drop in early European trading. U.S. WTI CLc1 fell more than a $1 before easing back to settle down 78 cents at $53.85. Trading was thin due to Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said oil was helped off its lows by a weaker U.S. dollar .DXY, making dollar-denominated crude cheaper for holders of other currencies. “Additional support has probably come from lower Iranian exports,” he said. Iran’s exports have dropped by several hundred thousand barrels per day (bpd) this month, a leading tanker-tracking company said on Thursday, suggesting U.S. sanctions that kicked in this month have scared off many buyers. But prices remain under pressure from rising U.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA, which climbed by 4.9 million barrels to 446.91 million barrels last week, their highest since December, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA also stayed at a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd), the EIA said. Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM brokerage, said the market trend remained bearish. “The question is what OPEC will do in December, will they cut, and if so, by how much?” he said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is worried about the emergence of a glut. But OPEC’s biggest exporter Saudi Arabia is under U.S. pressure not to take any action on cutting output that would push prices higher again. “Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy!... Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!” U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday.    More U.S. crude could be heading to market as U.S. pipeline bottlenecks are cleared in the second half of 2019. Rising U.S. oil output has outpaced capacity to transport the extra crude. To counter the surge in supply, OPEC is considering a deal to cut production when it meets on Dec. 6, although OPEC member Iran is expected to resist any voluntary reduction. Russia, an ally of OPEC, has also shown no sign it would join any cut.

2018-11-22,"(Adds Yamal on train 3 production, analyst, graphic) By Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - A liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker is transferring a cargo of Russia’s Yamal LNG to another vessel off the tip of northern Norway on Thursday, the first such operation that will help the facility raise production. The Vladimir Rusanov, an Arc7 ice-breaking LNG tanker, and the lower Arctic-classed Pskov LNG tanker are both anchored off Honningsvag, Norway, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. “I can confirm there is an ongoing STS (ship-to-ship) operation in the sea area of Sarnesfjord ... south-west of the city of Honningsvag,” Jan Morten Hansen, regional director at the Norwegian Coastal Administration, said. Novatek, which operates the Yamal facility, has been ramping up production after loading its first cargo last December. But traders have said output was constrained by the availability of Arctic-classed vessels able to operate in the waters there. Now it looks likely that such ship-to-ship transfers will become a regular occurrence. The transfers to other LNG carriers free up the Arc7 ice-breaker LNG vessels to return sooner to Yamal to pick up more cargoes. But this will increase demand for conventional LNG ships to pick up the cargoes from Norway. Hansen said a Norwegian shipping logistics company, Tschudi Arctic Transit AS (TAT), had permits to conduct such operations. “TAT will conduct regular STS-operations in four positions on Sarnesfjord and Kafjord in North Cape municipality. The permit allows three simultaneous operations in those positions,” Hansen told Reuters in emailed comments. Novatek said on Thursday its third train, or facility, at Yamal had begun operations. The capacity of the three trains is 16.5 million tonnes a year, making it one of the largest single LNG export plants in the world. LNG traders and ship brokers have said Yamal’s output has been constrained by the number of Arc7 LNG tankers, some of which are still being built. The seven Arc7 tankers in operation have thus far been carrying LNG cargoes to Britain, France and the Netherlands and have either unloaded there or transferred the LNG to conventional carriers for onward journeys, sometimes to Asia. Another eight are at either under construction or slated to start operations soon. The transfer in Norway shortens the Arc7 tankers’ journeys by about two thousand kilometres, freeing them up to return to Yamal sooner, enabling the facility to raise production. But the transfers will also squeeze the global LNG tanker market, Jefferies’ shipping analyst Randy Giveans said. “This will certainly tighten the (LNG tanker) market as more conventional LNG carriers are needed to finish the routes,” he said. “(And) although the transportation time is only 3-5 days from Norway to Europe, the time under employment will be much greater due to the extended loading time,” he said, adding that some cargoes will go even further to Asia and Latin America. LNG shipping rates have already soared to record highs due to the increase in LNG production from Yamal and U.S. facilities as well as the longer distances travelled.

2018-11-22,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised Saudi Arabia for helping to lower oil prices as pressure intensified for the United States to impose tougher sanctions on its Middle East ally over dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. In a tweet, Trump thanked Riyadh for the recent drop in oil prices and called for prices to go even lower to boost the U.S. and global economies. Trump has repeatedly blasted high oil prices, criticized OPEC over its production and pressured Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer, to act. Oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 rose on Wednesday but have been trending lower for weeks. Oil prices tumbled more than 6 percent on Tuesday, with U.S. crude diving to its lowest in more than a year, caught up in a Wall Street selloff fed by mounting concerns about slowing global growth. “Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!” Trump wrote. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are due to meet in two weeks and are expected to curb production to stem rising supplies. OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, are discussing a proposal to cut output by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), sources told Reuters last week.  Lower output would reverse months of increased production which saw Saudi and Russian oil production hit record highs.  Brent crude LCOc1 fell from $86.74 a barrel in October to $61.71 on Tuesday, its lowest since December 2017. U.S. WTI crude futures CLc1 slumped nearly 8 percent on Tuesday to $52.77 having hit a four-year high of $76.90 last month.     On Tuesday, Trump pledged to stand by Saudi Arabia even as he said that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have known about the plan to murder Khashoggi last month. U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis on Wednesday said the United States had a twin principle of accountability and the pursuit of human rights while also continuing to work with Saudi Arabia to end the war in Yemen. “On the Khashoggi affair, presidents don’t often get the freedom to work with unblemished partners in all things,” Mattis told reporters. The CIA believes Khashoggi’s death was ordered directly by the crown prince, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, sources familiar with the matter have said. Mattis said he did not think the CIA or the Saudi government had fully established who was responsible for the killing. With U.S. lawmakers calling for tougher sanctions, Trump said he would not cancel military deals with the kingdom. He said it would be a “foolish” move that would only benefit Russia and China, competitors of the United States in the arms market. A number of U.S. lawmakers, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, pushed back sharply on his assessment and urged further congressional action. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo again defended Trump’s stance on Wednesday, saying the United States had already  sanctioned 17 Saudis and that Riyadh was critical to the administration’s Iran strategy.   “Not every country shares our value set,” he told local radio station KQAM. “Our mission statement is to make sure that the American people are safe and secure.” Reporting by Susan Heavey and Idrees Ali in Washington and Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Editing by Tom Brown and James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-border/trump-warns-of-government-shutdown-next-month-over-border-security-idUKL2N1XW0FZ,22 Nov 2018,"U.S. President Donald

2018-11-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe’s share markets fell back into the red on Thursday, as investor worries about slowing global growth in the face of rising U.S. interest rates and trade tensions outweighed crucial Brexit progress. Chinese markets had extended their slump in Asia amid the trade war with the United States, and with Wall Street closed later for Thanksgiving and trading therefore lighter than normal, Europe followed suit. The region also had plenty to keep it busy. A disappointing batch of company earnings added to the stocks gloom but Italian bonds rallied for a second day as sparring continued over its budget and sterling jumped as London and Brussels agreed wording on a Brexit transition deal. [.EU] [GVD/EUR]  The dollar .DXY also edged lower for a second day as traders sold the greenback going into Thanksgiving and after Wall Street had seen Apple shares (AAPL.O), which have slumped $280 billion in recent weeks, fail with an attempted rebound. [.N][/FRX] “I think that the recent moves in equities have largely been about big tech catching up with the rest of the market,” said Eoin Murray, the head of investment at Hermes Investment Management. “Post the (global market) wobbles at the end of January, it has really only been big tech that has run off into the stratosphere ... So this is simply big tech coming back down to earth.” Europe’s tech sector duly lost another 0.75 percent, but it wasn’t the worst performer. Banks fell as much as 1.6 percent and mining companies and other resources firms dropped nearly 2 percent .SXPP before clawing some ground back. [.EU]  The falls also reflected the bitter Sino-U.S. trade war, encouraging investors to take money off the table before U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, meet in Argentina next week.  The focus is on whether they can make any progress on their trade feud. Countries belonging to the G20 group of the world’s biggest economies applied 40 new trade restrictive measures between mid-May and mid-October, covering around $481 billion of trade, the World Trade Organization said on Thursday. Three-quarters of the restrictions were tariff hikes, many of them retaliation to steel and aluminium tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in March.  But the WTO did not count measures announced since or not yet implemented, and one G20 country had asked for its actions to be omitted from the monitoring report, the WTO said. With no U.S. trading to look forward to later, traders contented themselves by watching Europe’s Brexit drama unfold.  Sterling jumped back up to $1.29 GBP= and 88.50 pence per euro EURGBP= after London and Brussels agreed on a text setting out their post-split ties that EU leaders are expected to endorse at a summit on Sunday. Just over four months before Britain’s departure from the EU, Brexit negotiations and political uncertainty in Britain remain the key drivers for the pound, and many analysts are cautious about its prospects. “With the UK and EU rushing to dot i’s and cross t’s on a Brexit deal, there’s some support for sterling at the moment and some upward pressure on the front end of the rates market,” said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. “Though it won’t take long before we refocus on the challenge facing the Prime Minister in getting House of Commons support for her Brexit deal,” he added. Simon Fraser, the former permanent secretary at the UK foreign office, said he expected British politicians to vote on May’s deal on Dec. 10.  “There would be a huge amount of pressure put on members of parliament and I think there is a reasonable chance she would get this through ... if not at the first vote potentially in a second vote,” he told a call held by fund manager Amundi.

2018-11-22,"MOSCOW, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Russia’s ZTZ said on Thursday it had won a contract to sell half a million tonnes of pipes to gas giant Gazprom next year for the construction of part of the Power of Siberia pipeline. Gazprom did not respond to a request for confirmation of the contract, which ZTZ said was worth over 42 billion roubles ($641.24 million). Gazprom is obliged to hold tenders for such contracts, but news that the contract had already gone to ZTZ, which only entered the market three years ago, came as a surprise to other producers, who frequently take part in such tenders. Other pipe producers were not aware that the contract had been offered, two sources in the industry said. Official documents show that Gazprom filed a notice on Russia’s official procurement website on Nov. 19 to hold a tender to buy 500,000 tonnes of pipes, and that the tender closed within 26 hours. It was the second time Gazprom had held a tender for this project. Its first attempt fell through in October after all major domestic pipemakers refused to take part, with sources in the sector saying Gazprom had set the price too low. ZTZ is a relatively new company. It began producing pipes in December 2015, and its arrival on the scene has shaken up a market traditionally controlled by four producers - steelmakers OMK and Severstal, plus specialist pipemakers ChelPipe and TMK. Sources told Reuters in February that Kremlin-controlled Gazprom was seeking discounts - put by the sources at 20 percent - in an attempt to limit its investment spending, which is due to peak in the next two years. “It is specifically our appearance on the large diameter pipe market that has permitted a total transformation of the skewed pipe price for Gazprom,” ZTZ Chief Executive Denis Safin said in a statement on Thursday. “Prices rose between 2011 and 2016, but after we launched, prices for large diameter pipes have fallen by over 30 percent for the gas company (Gazprom),” Safin said. ZTZ’s total plant capacity is 500,000 tonnes of pipes a year. $1 = 65.4980 roubles

2018-11-22,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland called on Wednesday for more forests to be planted worldwide to capture carbon emissions and so curb global warming, speaking ahead of annual U.N. climate talks to be held in Warsaw next month. Poland’s hosting of the talks has been contentious given its dependence on high-polluting coal for energy and various environmental disputes Poland’s conservative nationalist government has had with the European Union, including increased logging of the ancient Bialowieza Forest. Warsaw has repeatedly said it needs time to reduce its reliance on coal and has meanwhile launched campaigns to promote the use of forests to capture carbon, as well as electric vehicles to reduce diesel pollution. Environment Minister Henryk Kowalczyk noted on Thursday that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently determined that it was not possible to limit global warming without curbing carbon emissions. The IPPC report said that keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius means making rapid, unprecedented changes in the way people use energy to eat, travel and live. The report said that if average global temperature growth temporarily exceeded 1.5C, additional carbon removal techniques would be required.  “The Polish presidency draws attention to this through encouraging the world to undertake concrete measures in this field,” Kowalczyk told a news conference.  The IPCC report said that to limit temperature rise to 1.5C, an increase of up to 9.5 million square kilometres of forests would be needed by 2050, compared to 2010 levels, among other measures. That is equivalent to the size of China. One third of Poland’s land mass is covered by trees and the country is planting more. Ahead of the global climate talks Warsaw has promoted so called Carbon Forest Projects, which are expected to absorb about 1 million tonnes of CO2.  Greenpeace has called the idea a “cheap excuse” and a “secret weapon” for the climate conference.   “The Forest Carbon Farms have very little scientific basis and marginal meaning for the absorption of Polish greenhouse gas emissions,” Greenpeace said in a statement.  “It is not the way to reach climate neutrality, but in the best case scenario a PR stunt.”  The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) got into conflict with environmental groups and the EU by increasing logging in the primeval Bialowieza forest. In April, the EU Court of Justice ruled Poland had broken the bloc’s environmental laws with the logging. The environment minister responsible for the logging was dismissed and his successor Kowalczyk said then that the logging had already been halted and Warsaw would honour the ECJ ruling.

2018-11-22,"MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Russian companies remain committed to planned stock market listings in 2019, sources and bankers say, despite the country’s worst year for equity sales in a decade.  At least 10 Russian companies, ranging from petrochemicals giants to real estate and health businesses, had been lining up at least $4 billion worth of initial public offerings (IPOs) this year in Moscow and, in some cases, London. But none have come to pass and 2018 will be the first year in a decade without a single Russian IPO. “This year was marked by an increase in U.S. interest rates ... It triggered big outflows from emerging markets starting from May,” said Dmitry Brodsky, head of equity capital markets for Russia and CIS at Russia-focused investment bank Renaissance Capital.    “Quite a lot of companies continue to study the market or prepare to tap it ... If the markets reverse, they could be ready in four to eight months.”  But for all the plans and hopes, the outlook remains clouded as U.S. sanctions against Russia and wider economic concerns that have hammered emerging markets continue to weigh heavily on corporate Russia. Among those that had been considering an IPO this year were Sibur, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals companies, as well as insurer RESO and private healthcare provider European Medical Center.      “There will be no IPOs for the rest of the year – the window is shut,” said Alina Sychova, head of capital markets origination at Sova Capital. “I know there are a few names looking at the first-quarter: they are going to be monitoring the situation in terms of sanctions, Brexit and overall market volatility.” Last year Russian companies raised about $8 billion from public equity sales, about $3 billion of which was from IPOs, including Oleg Deripaska’s En+ (ENPLq.L) listing in London and Moscow, according to Reuters data. En+ manages Deripaska’s energy and aluminum assets. In April, however, Deripaska and his business were among those placed under U.S. sanctions in response to Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Moscow has denied any wrongdoing.  The United States has also promised a fresh sanctions package, known as the “bill from hell”, designed to punish Moscow for what Washington described as malign activity and other international actions that Russia has denied.  The Russian stock market was hit hard by the April sanctions. Haulage company Globaltruck (GTRK.MM), which raised 3.85 billion roubles ($59 million) via its Moscow IPO last November, was trading at 102.5 roubles per share on Thursday, down 22 percent from the 132 rouble offer price.  Sanctions, emerging markets turmoil and rising U.S. Treasury yields, topped off by the continuing U.S.-Sino trade war, have all hit the Russian IPO plans, bankers say. Some companies that had been private business success stories - such as food retailer Magnit - became co-owned by state bank VTB. Others, including mobile phone operator Megafon (MFON.MM), decided to delist their shares while only a handful of businesses held secondary share offerings.  “I don’t think market conditions are favorable,” said an executive at a company that had considered listing some of its operations. “There’s concern about the political situation, consumer confidence, budget, oil prices. It’s just volatile and that’s worrying for everybody,” he told Reuters.  Another to fall by the wayside was, IT services company IBS, which postponed a $100 million Moscow IPO immediately after the sanctions announcement in April, citing volatility in financial markets.  “The market, both investors and companies, needs a certain time to adjust and find a balance,” said Boris Kvasov, an executive director for equity capital markets at VTB Capital, Russia’s leading investment bank.  “A lot of (IPO) transactions are in the stage of preparation and can materialize next year ... Any positive trend in resolving this (geopolitical issues) could trigger an increase in market activity, thanks also to unfulfilled demand.”      Reporting by Olga Popova and Katya Golubkova in MOSCOW and Dasha Afanasieva and Karin Strohecker in LONDON; Editing by David Goodman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-ipo/russia-hopes-for-ipo-renaissance-after-worst-year-in-a-decade-idUKL8N1XW552,22 Nov 2018,"* Companies ready to pounce on market upturn -investment

2018-11-22,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has begun talks with shipping firms to set up a second ship-to-ship (STS) operation off the country’s eastern coast in an effort to increase sagging crude exports, according to three people familiar with the matter. PDVSA this year began sea-borne oil transfers off its western coast, mainly to move crude and fuel oil to Asia, after its ports clogged with tankers waiting to load and its Caribbean terminals faced seizure. PDVSA’s STS activity has expanded recently, but not enough to expedite operations at its main oil port of Jose, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.     The country’s crude exports fell 21 percent to an average 1.126 million barrels per day (bpd) between January and October, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. At the end of the first half, PDVSA’s contractual obligations totaled 2.19 million bpd.  PDVSA has not yet chosen a firm to handle the new STS operation. Among the companies being considered is a unit of Dubai-based Stalco Shipping Co, according to one of the people. PDVSA declined to comment, and Stalco did not respond to a request for comment. “Certified captains and mooring masters are being recruited for the project,” one person familiar with the matter said. The new STS operation would be installed near La Borracha island, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) off Puerto la Cruz, one of Venezuela’s main coastal cities, one of the sources said.      PDVSA plans to use some of its larger vessels, including Suezmaxes and very large crude carriers as mother ships, to build the operation. Up to two tankers could simultaneously load oil through this system, according to the sources. Sea-borne transfers are risky to tankers and the environment, require additional insurance, equipment and specially trained crew and masters to oversee the exchanges. PDVSA has sought approval to conduct the transfers from INEA, Venezuela’s water authority, one of the people familiar with the matter said.  But it was unclear if authorities have given PDVSA permission to conduct the operations in an ecologically sensitive area, at Mochima National Park.  Venezuela’s Ecosocialism ministry did not respond to a request for comment.   Most PDVSA-owned tankers used for exports have been anchored in Venezuelan waters since U.S. producer ConocoPhillips moved to seize Caribbean export assets last spring to enforce a $2 billion arbitration ruling. It reached a payment agreement this fall, but the seizure risk remains as other creditors could employ a similar strategy. PDVSA also was forced to close one of three docks at its Jose terminal for almost 90 days following a tanker collision in August, complicating its efforts to increase crude exports. “The idea is to change as many contracts as possible to FOB (free on board),” one of the people said, requiring product to be delivered at the seller’s port and buyers to make logistical arrangements. PDVSA’s customers would be responsible for paying STS fees to the operating company, the sources added, slightly changing a mechanism used for the STS operation off the Paraguana Refining Center, which requires clients to bring their own equipment.

2018-11-22,"(Adds details) By Davide Barbuscia ROME, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Iraq plans to launch a reconstruction agency to focus on projects such as a deep water port and a rail network, Iraq’s president said on Thursday, as the country seeks to put years of turmoil behind it. Over the past year Iraq has emerged from a devastating conflict with hardline militants who seized almost a third of the country. It declared victory in December 2017 over the Islamic State armed group, having taken back all the territory captured by the ultra hardline militants in 2014 and 2015. Barham Salih told an international conference in Rome that defeating Daesh, an acronym for the Islamic state, was “a monumental challenge and an immense success for Iraqi army forces.” Iraq plans to work with foreign entities, including sovereign wealth funds, on several infrastructure projects, Salih said, but he pointed to corruption and abuse of public funds as problems that undermine reconstruction efforts. “Iraqi and foreign private sector companies as well as international financial institutions, donor countries and sovereign wealth funds, will be invited to invest in these (infrastructure) projects”, Salih said. The Iraqi parliament elected Barham Salih, a Kurdish politician, in October. The presidency in Iraq is largely a ceremonial position, but the vote for Salih was an important step toward forming a new government. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Wednesday he would go to parliament next week to get his full cabinet approved. Reporting by Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Janet Lawrence,

2018-11-22,"TURAIF, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday that he sees weak oil demand in January and said the kingdom would respond accordingly to cool the global market’s anxiety. The world’s top oil exporter’s crude output in November is above October levels, he said, adding that it was in no one’s interest to create a supply glut. “The waivers as to the Iranian sanctions as you know ... So January demand for Saudi Arabia would be lower,” Falih said, referring to U.S. offers to Iran to keep more Iranian crude on the market. His comments come one day after U.S. President Donald Trump called on Saudi Arabia to help bring down oil prices. Falih said the kingdom’s policy has not changed and it will work towards balanced market.  “We will not sell oil that customers don’t need,” he told reporters in the northern town of Turaif, at the inauguration of a new mining project. “We will not make the market get anxious ... in the way it did in May or June, but at the same time we make it clear that it is not in anybody’s interest to create a glut similar to what we saw few years ago.” “Everybody’s interest is in our mind, and we do it with a lot of care, we do it with responsibility, with balance,” the minister said. Saudi Arabia is discussing a proposal to cut oil output by as much as 1.4 million barrels per day by OPEC and its allies, sources close to the discussions told Reuters earlier this month. The minister also said he hoped a Saudi new mining law would be applicable in the first half of 2019, which is expected to boost mining and exploration.

2018-11-22,"PARIS (Reuters) - French energy group EDF (EDF.PA) and Nawah Energy have signed a deal to operate and maintain the delayed Barakah power plant, which will be the first nuclear energy plant in the Arab world. The $24.4 billion (19 billion pounds) Barakah power plant in the United Arab Emirates is the world’s largest nuclear project under construction but has been marred by delays related to training issues. This week a senior official said that the UAE’s Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation was not yet ready to give Nawah, the company that will run the plant, a licence to operate. The plant was originally expected to begin operations in 2017. EDF said it would provide engineering studies, on-site support, and training and benchmarking sessions. “With this agreement, EDF will be strengthening its position in the UAE’s low-carbon energy sector, thereby reasserting the goal of its ‘CAP 2030’ strategy which is to triple its business volumes outside of Europe by 2030,” said EDF senior executive vice president Dominique Miniere. EDF and Nawah added that their deal, a 10-year commitment, would help Barakah prepare for operations of the first of its four 1,400 MW units.

In August, the central bank ordered MTN and its banks to bring $8.134 billion back into Nigeria, sending the company’s shares plummeting. The regulator alleged the firm had sent the funds abroad in breach of foreign exchange regulations. “We have held meetings with the MTN group and we are at the verge,” Emefiele said on Thursday. “I am optimistic that we have reached the end of the road.” MTN was not immediately available for comment. The governor said the company had submitted documents making the impending agreement possible, and that no other firm or person is being investigated for similar issues. MTN’s latest troubles come about two years after it agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle a dispute over SIM cards in Nigeria, whose finances have been hit by a weak economy and volatile global oil prices.

2018-11-22,"NEW DELHI, Nov 22 (Reuters) - India is working to establish a natural gas trading exchange, its Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, as part of a shift away from a reliance on crude oil based products which are blamed for much of the country’s pollution problem. “We want to increase the use of natural gas by 2.5 times by the end of next decade,” Modi said in New Delhi at the laying of a foundation stone for the setting up of city gas distribution (CGD) networks in 129 districts which have been auctioned. India wants to develop a transparent market for natural gas where the price is determined on an exchange and aims to increase the use of natural gas in India’s total energy mix from 6.5 percent to 15 percent between 2028 and 2030. The price of making the switch has not been disclosed but analysts have often pointed out that using natural gas to fuel vehicles and households is cheaper than LPG and cleaner than petrol or diesel, which are causing pollution in India. However, it is still hard to persuade people to switch to piped gas as LPG cylinders are well entrenched in India and the refuelling infrastructure for natural gas is minimal. As well as uncertainty about the cost, there are also concerns about the length of time needed to install the infrastructure, which is expected to take two to three years. Modi said India had begun the bidding process for a tenth round of CGD which will mean 400 districts or 70 percent of the country’s population is covered in the next two to three years. He said India is spending 130 billion rupees ($1.84 billion) to set up a pipeline that will connect eastern India where there is latent gas demand which has not been tapped because of a lack of infrastructure. The pipeline network, along with liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals being set up in the east coast and a CGD network are expected to help boost gas consumption.

2018-11-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has in effect agreed to overlook the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in return for Saudi Arabia’s help to contain oil prices and for its assistance in other areas. The United States and Britain have seized on the vulnerability of the kingdom and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to push harder for a partial ceasefire in Yemen and improve relations with Qatar. The kingdom will also come under heightened pressure to deliver on promises of increased arms purchases and overseas investment as well as reconstruction aid in Yemen. Khashoggi’s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has also given the United States leverage over the Saudi government and, by extension, the production policy pursued by the OPEC+ group of oil exporters. Oil traders have certainly made a link between the killing and oil. Khashoggi was killed on Oct. 2. Brent futures hit their highest level in the current cycle on Oct. 3 and have since fallen by more than $23 a barrel.  Several other factors, too, have weighed on oil prices since the end of September. These include rising production by OPEC and its allies, surging U.S. shale output, more generous than expected waivers for Iran’s exports, a deteriorating economic outlook and hedge fund selling. But there is little doubt the Khashoggi killing has weakened the kingdom’s international position and made it more anxious to maintain support from the White House, which has included delivering higher oil output and lower prices. The White House itself has drawn an explicit link between the killing and Saudi Arabia’s posture on oil prices (“Statement from President Donald J Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia”, White House, Nov. 20). Explaining why the president continues to give his full support to the kingdom, the White House cited its help in confronting Iran, agreeing to invest in the United States and arms sales. The official statement also highlighted Saudi Arabia’s importance as one of the world’s largest oil producers and praised the kingdom for working closely with the president to keep a lid on prices. “They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels – so important for the world,” the president said in his statement. The president subsequently commended Saudi Arabia on Twitter, writing on Nov. 21: “Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World ... Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower.” The president’s praise for Saudi Arabia marked a significant shift from his repeated criticism of OPEC this year for pushing prices higher. Trump’s comments on Twitter and television since the start of the year have made it clear he wants Brent prices well below $80 a barrel and perhaps below $70. Saudi Arabia is now much less able to resist such pressure. The United States has always been one of the world’s largest oil producers as well as its largest consumer, with the result that presidents tend to favour “moderate” oil prices. High prices penalise U.S. motorists while low prices threaten the viability of the oil industry in politically and economically important states such as Texas. High prices hurt consumers and energy-intensive manufacturers, but low prices threaten oil and gas investment as well as business activity throughout the industry’s supply chain, including steelmakers, railroads and trucking firms. The shale revolution has more than doubled U.S. oil production since 2008 but it has not altered the fundamental political and economic logic. Trump seems to have calculated, probably correctly, that lower rather than higher oil prices are important if he is to be re-elected in 2020. Motorists and energy-intensive manufacturers far outnumber voters employed in the oil and gas industry and its supply chain. Moreover, most U.S. oil production is concentrated in states that already lean heavily towards his own Republican Party and are likely to vote for him again (including Texas, North Dakota, Alaska and Oklahoma). By contrast, the swing states he needs to assemble a majority in the electoral college are dominated by oil consumers (including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida). The White House also calculates that lower oil prices will stimulate consumer spending and provide a late-cycle boost to the economy, growth and jobs. Provided prices fall moderately and do not slump, the boost to consumption will more than offset the hit to investment within the oil and gas sector and its supply chain. Domestic oil and gas producers may not be happy with the president’s advocacy for lower prices, but they are unlikely to support the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2020. In electoral politics, oil and gas producers have nowhere else to go - leaving the president free to concentrate on winning support from oil consumers in swing states. Trump’s marginal voter in 2020 will be an oil consumer rather than an oil producer. The president’s preferred oil price to maximise his chances of re-election is somewhat lower than Saudi Arabia appeared to be comfortable with a few months ago. But he has sent a clear message to OPEC+ in general, and Saudi Arabia in particular, about what he wants in terms of oil market management strategy and prices. The White House expects Saudi Arabia to ensure prices do not spike again in the months ahead in exchange for its continued support, and the president is not known for his patience. Saudi Arabia and its allies may still trim production in 2019 to avoid a renewed glut in the oil market, but the cuts are likely to be smaller than if Khashoggi had not been killed.

2018-11-22,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Low-lying Vanuatu is considering suing fossil fuel companies and industrialized countries that use them for their role in creating catastrophic climate change, the foreign minister of the Pacific island nation said on Thursday. Vanuatu, with an estimated population of 280,000 people spread across roughly 80 islands, is among more than a dozen Pacific island nations that already face rising sea levels and more regular storms that can wipe out much of their economies. Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu said it was time that some of the billions of dollars of profits fossil fuel companies generate every year goes toward the damage they cause in countries like “desperate” Vanuatu. “This is really about claiming for the damages,” he told Reuters in an interview. Speaking at the Climate Vulnerable Forum’s Virtual Summit earlier in the day, Regenvanu announced the legal options Vanuatu was considering. “My government is now exploring all avenues to utilize the judicial system in various jurisdictions - including under international law - to shift the costs of climate protection back on to fossil fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to my country,” he said. About 64 percent of Vanuatu’s GDP was wiped out in a single cyclone in 2015, causing economic losses of $449.4 million, he said. Samoa, on behalf of the 18 Pacific island forum members, including Vanuatu, on Saturday called on leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to pay more attention to climate change. Regenvanu said Vanuatu was also pursuing the idea of joining hands with other nations to pursue legal action. “We are looking for climate vulnerable countries who are willing to step up and be involved in such a case,” he told Reuters. He said Vanuatu would discuss it with other countries at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP24, next month. “Vanuatu’s brave announcement today is part of a global wave of legal action against oil, gas, and coal companies and laggard governments,” Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said in a statement. Climate change lawsuits against big corporations and governments are on the rise.  The U.S. city of Baltimore filed a lawsuit in June against 26 oil and gas companies and entities, including BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp, for knowingly contributing to what the city called the catastrophic consequences of climate change.

U.S. stock futures were slightly higher after briefly turning down, underscoring fragile investor sentiment following a rout in October and steep sell-offs in recent sessions. Spreadbetters pointed to a tentative start for Europe. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were last up 0.2 percent, recouping earlier losses. The index has managed to hold up so far in November after three straight monthly declines, but is on track for its worst annual performance since 2011. Japan’s Nikkei was off morning highs but up 0.7 percent. Chinese shares were in the red after opening higher, with the blue-chip index falling 0.4 percent. “This was a half-hearted rally to start with,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP. “Investors are still wary about whether they’ll see further lows given none of the issues that drove the recent correction have dissipated.” The bitter Sino-U.S. trade war remains the biggest concern for markets, with signs of weakening corporate profits, a steep sell-off in tech stocks and rising U.S. interest rates encouraging investors to take money off the table before year-end. “And that’s all tying in to worries about the global economy,” Oliver added. Singapore warned earlier on Thursday that trade frictions will likely hurt economic growth in the city state, widely seen as a bellwether for international trade and investment. E-Minis for the S&P 500 were up about 0.2 percent while FTSE futures were mostly flat and spreadbetters signalled a subdued start for Germany. Overnight in Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index ended higher but near session lows while the Dow gave up its gains to end flat ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in a sign of lingering bearishness. Investors are looking to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping late this month for any signs of a de-escalation in the trade war between the economic superpowers. Trump and Xi plan to meet on the sidelines of a G20 summit, which is being held in Argentina at the end of November and early December. The United States and China have slapped import duties on each others’ goods in a tit-for-tat tariff war that investors worry could put the brakes on global trade and growth. Chinese investors are not optimistic about any progress at the Trump-Xi talks, but are leaving room for surprises. “Mr. Trump is unpredictable,” said Lin Lu, a professional investor in Shanghai. “You never know when he’ll do an about-face.” Even a breakthrough on trade would only remove some of the pressure on China’s cooling economy, which is facing a slowdown in domestic consumption. Markets will also pay close attention to manufacturing activity reports from Japan, Europe and the United States due over the coming week or so. “PMIs have held up reasonably well so far but if they trend lower it could add to the nervousness,” AMP’s Oliver said. The synchronised global expansion that began roughly two years ago has now plateaued, and fresh signs are emerging of a weakening outlook. Global trade volumes are still increasing, although at a slower pace. Moreover, leading economic indicators monitored by the OECD have weakened since the start of the year and point to slower expansion ahead for the United Kingdom and the euro area. ALL-WEATHER CURRENCY The Federal Reserve has stayed on its tightening path after ending seven years of near-zero interest rates in December 2015 that took the Fed funds rate to the current 2.00 to 2.25 percent. Investors expect the Fed to go again in December. In response to the tightening, the U.S. dollar has outperformed most of its peers this year with its index against a basket of major currencies up almost 5 percent. In comparison the Japanese yen is flat so far in 2018. Marios Hadjikyriacos, analyst at broking firm XM.Com, said the greenback is currently an “all weather currency.” “It can shine both in risk-off sessions given its status as the world’s reserve asset, and on risk-on days as wide yield differentials brighten its carry appeal,” he said. The dollar index eased to 96.566 while the yen paused at 113 per dollar following two straight sessions of losses. The euro rose on hopes that the Italian budget dispute would be resolved even as the European Commission took its first step toward disciplining Italy over its deficit. It was last at $1.1406. Oil reversed early gains although prices were still well above one-year lows touched earlier this week. U.S. crude futures were last down 8 cents at $54.55 a barrel after hitting a one-year low of $52.77 on Tuesday. Brent eased 15 cents to $63.33 from the last close and well off Tuesday’s trough of $61.71. Gold was firmer, with spot prices at $1,227.98 an ounce.

2018-11-22,"MELBOURNE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Fortescue Metals Group will partner with Australia’s national science body to support the development of an industry for hydrogen, a fuel which is being touted as the next big source of low-emissions energy. Fortescue will fund Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) with A$20 million as part of a five-year agreement, Fortescue and CSIRO said in separate statements on Thursday. Hydrogen has untapped energy potential without the downside of the carbon emissions from natural gas and coal, although it is not expected to be commercialised until the 2030s. “We see potential for a significant export market in hydrogen and look forward to collaborating with third parties to ensure Australia’s leadership in the new energy economy,” said Fortescue Chairman Andrew Forrest. The first technology to be supported will focus on a metal membrane using ammonia that could allow for cheap storage and transport of the notoriously expensive and hard-to-move gas. That could pave the way for its use as a low emissions fuel. Australia, the world’s biggest coal exporter and second-biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, wants to build a hydrogen industry for export. It is looking to supply what could be a $7 billion market for hydrogen to China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore by 2030, according to a report done for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency by consultants ACIL Allen. The state of Western Australia last month launched a Renewable Hydrogen Council, including Woodside Petroleum , French power producer Engie SA and Norway’s Yara International, to form a plan to use land, wind and solar resources to produce hydrogen. $1 = 1.3795 Australian dollars

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tacked on 0.2 percent and has so far managed to hold up in November after three straight monthly declines. For the year, it is on track for its worst annual performance since 2011, in part due to anxiety over a weakening outlook for corporate profits and the heated Sino-U.S. trade war. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.7 percent while Australian shares advanced 0.6 percent. Overnight in Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index ended higher but near session lows while the Dow gave up its gains to end flat ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in a sign of lingering bearishness. “Markets experienced a better night last night, but it is fair to say that sentiment remains fragile,” ANZ analysts said in a note to clients. “There seems a greater appreciation that with the impact of U.S. fiscal stimulus waning, the U.S. economy could slow like other major economies have.” The U.S. unemployment rate is at a 49-year low and the economy is expanding at a 3.5 percent annual rate, although many economists now believe a ballooning U.S. federal budget deficit and trade protectionism could hurt growth by 2020. “That leaves the market less forgiving of poor news whether that is on the trade front or in credit markets. The bottom line, expect this higher volatility picture to persist unless global growth can stage a turnaround,” ANZ analysts said. The synchronised global expansion that began roughly two years ago has now plateued, and fresh signs are emerging of a weaker outlook. Global trade volumes are still increasing although at a slower pace. Moreover, leading economic indicators monitored by the OECD have weakened since the start of the year and point to slower expansion ahead for the United Kingdom and the euro area as a whole.

2018-11-22,"SINGAPORE, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Oil markets started Thursday timidly, with rising U.S. crude inventories pressuring prices but an expected supply cut by producer cartel OPEC offering some support. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were at $53.71 per barrel at 0051 GMT, 8 cents above their last settlement. Front-month Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA rose by 4.9 million barrels to 446.91 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a weekly report on Wednesday. That was the highest level since December 2017. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA remained at a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd), the EIA said. “U.S. inventory data ... continued to show significant supply builds, which comes on the back of sustained record U.S. crude oil production,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. Some analysts have warned that despite high global production, oil markets have little spare capacity to handle unforeseen supply disruptions. However, Innes said that once U.S. pipeline bottlenecks were alleviated, which he said he expected in 2019, “the entire notion of a tight global spare capacity argument goes down the well”. Fearing a glut, the Middle East dominated producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is considering supply cuts when it next meets on Dec. 6, although some members like Iran are expected to resist any voluntary reductions. “While there is talk that OPEC+ Russia may again agree to a production cut, the concern is that not all relevant parties will be able to come to an agreement,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. “Saudi Arabia has hinted at a unilateral cut, but it will want to be careful about annoying the U.S. given that president Trump has been vocal about his desire for lower oil prices,” he added. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised Saudi Arabia over recent oil prices and called for prices to go even lower. “Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy!... Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!” he tweeted.

2018-11-22,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Asian shares firm after Wall Street gains overnight * Overall sentiment still fragile - ANZ analyst * Oil rebounds after steep sell-off earlier this week By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Asian shares stepped ahead cautiously on Thursday while oil rebounded from a steep sell-off, though rising U.S. interest rates and escalating trade tensions kept financial markets on edge amid signs of slackening global growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tacked on 0.2 percent and has so far managed to hold up in November after three straight monthly declines. For the year, it is on track for its worst annual performance since 2011, in part due to anxiety over a weakening outlook for corporate profits. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.5 percent while Australian shares advanced 0.6 percent. Overnight in Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index ended higher but near session lows while the Dow gave up its gains to end flat ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in a sign of lingering bearishness. “Markets experienced a better night last night, but it is fair to say that sentiment remains fragile,” ANZ analysts said in a note to clients. “There seems a greater appreciation that with the impact of U.S. fiscal stimulus waning, the U.S. economy could slow like other major economies have.” The U.S. unemployment rate is at a 49-year low and the economy is expanding at a 3.5 percent annual rate, although many economists now believe a ballooning U.S. federal budget deficit and trade protectionism could hurt growth by 2020. “That leaves the market less forgiving of poor news whether that is on the trade front or in credit markets. The bottom line, expect this higher volatility picture to persist unless global growth can stage a turnaround,” ANZ analysts said. The synchronised global expansion that began roughly two years ago has now plateued, and fresh signs are emerging of a weaker outlook. Global trade volumes are still increasing although at a slower pace. Moreover, leading economic indicators monitored by the OECD have weakened since the start of the year and point to slower expansion ahead for the United Kingdom and the euro area as a whole. ALL-WEATHER CURRENCY The Federal Reserve has stayed on its tightening path after ending seven years of near-zero interest rates in December 2015 that took the Fed funds rate to the current 2.00 to 2.25 percent. Investors expect the Fed to go again in December. In response to the tightening, the U.S. dollar has outperformed most of its peers this year with its index against a basket of major currencies up almost 5 percent. In comparison the Japanese yen is flat so far in 2018. Marios Hadjikyriacos, analyst at broking firm XM.Com, said the greenback is currently an “all wealther currency.” “It can shine both in risk-off sessions given its status as the world’s reserve asset, and on risk-on days as wide yield differentials brighten its carry appeal,” he said. Hadjikyriacos expects the dollar to end the year on a high note. “The dollar seems more attractive from a risk-reward perspective as the bar to price out even more hikes – and hence weaken the currency – is probably quite high; it may require concrete evidence of a US slowdown.” The dollar index was last flat at 96.712. The yen was barely changed at 113.01 following two straight sessions of losses. Elsewhere, the euro rose on hopes that the Italian budget dispute would be resolved even as the European Commission took its first step toward disciplining Italy over its deficit. It was last at $1.1390. Oil jumped about $1 a barrel on Wednesday after U.S. government data showed strong demand for gasoline and diesel, though concerns over rising crude supply remained. U.S. crude futures edged up 4 cents to $54.65 after hitting a one-year low of $52.77 on Tuesday.
