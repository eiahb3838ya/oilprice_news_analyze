2018-03-22,"YAOUNDE, March 22 (Reuters) - Cameroon’s former water and energy minister was arrested in Nigeria and flown home on Thursday, a police source and local media said, amid a crackdown on high-level corruption. Basile Atangana Kouna was removed from his ministerial position during President Paul Biya’s March 2 cabinet reshuffle. He had already been ordered the previous month not to leave the country. “Atangana Kouna is in Cameroon. He was arrested in Nigeria and sent back to Cameroon. He arrived this evening,” one police source, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the press, told Reuters. Vision 4, a private television channel considered allied to Biya, reported that the former minister arrived at the international airport in the capital Yaounde at 6:20 pm (1720 GMT) escorted by police officers. Another channel, Canal 2 International, also reported his arrest in Nigeria and subsequent extradition back to Cameroon. Cameroon’s government spokesman was not immediately reachable for comment. Neither were officials in neighbouring Nigeria. It was not clear what charges Atangana Kouna was facing, but there was speculation on Thursday that he was arrested as part of an anti-corruption drive known as Operation Sparrowhawk. Three men - a former Ministry of Public Works official, the head of a state company, and the ex-rector of the University of Douala - were arrested as part of the operation earlier this week. Cameroon’s oil wealth has spawned a sprawling political patronage system fueled by revenues from crude exports. Transparency International ranked it 153 out of 180 countries on its annual corruption perceptions index. Biya has ruled virtually by decree since taking over from a retiring predecessor in 1982 and then winning an election with 99.98 percent of the vote a year later. Now 85, Biya is expected to again seek re-election in presidential polls later this year, but he is currently facing some of the biggest challenges to his 35-year rule. Cameroon’s oil-dependent economy has been crippled by low crude prices. And separatists are mounting a guerrilla campaign in the country’s two English-speaking provinces, demanding independence from the majority Francophone Central African nation.

2018-03-22,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has international partners it can work with if the United States walks away from a potential deal on nuclear power technology over concerns about nuclear proliferation, Khalid al-Falih, the kingdom’s energy minister, said in an interview on Thursday. “If the U.S. is not with us, they will lose the opportunity to influence the programme in a positive way,” Falih said after he and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met this week with President Donald Trump, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and other officials on a range of issues.  Perry has been quietly working with Saudi Arabia on a civilian nuclear agreement that could allow the kingdom to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium, technologies that nonproliferation advocates worry could one day be covertly altered to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.  The kingdom is also in talks with companies from Russia, China, South Korea and other countries as the race to build two reactors in Saudi Arabia heats up.  Saudi Arabia has said it needs nuclear power to move away from burning crude oil to generate electricity and to diversify its economy. Earlier this month, its cabinet approved a national policy programme that limits nuclear activities to peaceful purposes.  Perry hopes Saudi Arabia will buy nuclear power technology from U.S. companies, including Westinghouse, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy this year and abandoned plans to build two advanced AP1000 reactors in the United States.  But Salman raised concerns when he told CBS in an interview on Sunday that the kingdom will develop nuclear weapons if its archrival Iran does so.  Some members of the U.S. Congress worry the Trump administration is moving too quickly on a deal that could relax nonproliferation standards and one day help lead to a nuclear arms race across the Middle East. If Saudi Arabia signs a deal that relaxes the safeguards, the UAE could be free to break its own deal it signed with Washington years ago and enrich uranium. The UAE deal contained the “gold standard” in such 123 nuclear agreements, because it contains the safeguards.  On Wednesday, lawmakers from both parties in the U.S. House introduced a bill that would reform U.S. law to ensure that partners on nuclear energy abandon the pursuit of enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium. The bill would also harden congressional approval of civilian nuclear deals. Falih said he was hopeful for a deal with Washington. “It will be natural for the United States to be with us and to provide us not only with technology, but to help us with the fuel cycle and the monitoring, and make sure we do it to the highest standard.”  But the kingdom has generous uranium resources it wants to develop. “It’s not natural for us to bring enriched uranium from a foreign country to fuel our reactors,” Falih said. “The irony is that if the U.S. chooses not to (seal a deal) then somebody else will and we are fortunate to have many other alternative sources that have agreed to work with us and they will be competing for our programme,” Falih said. In that case,  “the U.S. will not have a seat at the table,” he said. Perry stuck a similar chord in comments during a congressional hearing on nuclear deals this week. “It appears to me, either Russia or China is going to be a partner in building civil nuclear capability in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” if the United States does not.  Some nuclear analysts believe it is unlikely that the Saudis would choose to work with Russia because it has partnerships with nuclear projects in Iran.

2018-03-22,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - OPEC members will need to continue coordinating with Russia and other non-OPEC oil-producing countries on supply curbs in 2019 to reduce global oil inventories to desired levels, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday. OPEC and non-OPEC countries struck a production supply agreement in January 2017 to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from global markets and end a supply glut. The cuts helped lift oil prices to current levels of around $65 per barrel. The oil producers will convene in June in Vienna to discuss further cooperation. U.S. crude oil futures settled on Thursday at $64.30 a barrel and Brent crude settled at $68.91. “We know for sure that we still have some time to go before we bring inventories down to the level we consider normal and we will identify that by mid-year when we meet in Vienna,” Falih told Reuters in an interview in Washington. “And then we will hopefully by year-end identify the mechanism by which we will work in 2019.” It was unclear what oil supplies would need to be in 2019, he said. Falih has previously said that OPEC would do better to leave the oil market slightly short of supplies rather than ending too early the output cut deal. Falih said on Thursday there is a general acceptance among producers that further coordination “does not necessarily mean maintaining the same level of cuts. “It just means that the mechanism has worked and they have committed to work within that mechanism for a much longer period,” he said. A new framework “requires agility” and “a willingness to do things differently in terms of what levels of production as the market dictates.”  Saudi Arabia and Russia have spearheaded efforts to reduce global oil stockpiles to their five-year average, ending years of oversupply sparked by the rapid rise in production from shale oil producers in the United States. Despite continued rapid growth in output from the United States, Falih said he did not consider the shale industry to be a threat. Without shale supplies, he said, global supplies would have been tight. Saudi Arabia needs high and stable oil prices if it is to succeed in turning the planned share listing of state oil company Saudi Aramco into the world’s biggest share sale. Saudi Arabia is planning to list up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco in the offering. A successful IPO could give the company a total valuation of up to $2 trillion (£1.5 trillion), making it the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalization. Falih said the kingdom may still move forward with the planned initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of 2018, despite previously raising doubts it could be delayed to next year. The timing of a float would depend on market conditions and the kingdom is ready to execute the IPO “at any time”. “We have prepared all documentation to be ready to do both domestic and international listings,” Falih said. “We have not closed the door on 2018.” He said the kingdom needed to be sure “that the market is ready and is this an optimum time to execute.” Falih said the company could be floated either domestically or internationally late this year. New York is still in the running for the IPO, but Saudi officials still need to weigh the potential legal risks of a listing in the United States, he said. “We have concerns obviously Aramco is too big and too valuable and too important,” he said. “We could be potentially at risk from some frivolous lawsuits and litigation that we have to consider in our final decision.” Legal challenges could arise from a U.S. law that would allow U.S. victims of militant attacks to sue foreign governments for compensation.

2018-03-22,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Thursday it had approved the possible sale to Saudi Arabia of TOW anti-tank missiles, part of a bigger $1 billion package that also includes helicopter maintenance and spare parts for military vehicles. The department said it had notified the U.S. Congress on Thursday of the possible sale, which kick-starts a formal congressional review process. Saudi Arabia requested to buy 6,600 TOW missiles and an additional 96 for training for a total of $670 million, the State Department said in a statement. The proposed sale would improve the security of an important ally in the Middle East, it added. “The proposed sale of TOW 2B missiles and technical support will advance Saudi Arabia’s efforts to develop an integrated ground defence capability,” the department said.  In addition, the State Department said it had also approved the possible sale worth $300 million of parts for Saudi Arabia’s fleet of Abrams tanks and armoured vehicles. Furthermore, it also gave the green light for the proposed sale of equipment and services worth $106.8 million for Saudi Arabia’s fleet of military helicopters  The announcements came days after U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House, crediting U.S. defence sales to the Saudis with boosting American jobs. Earlier on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told Prince Mohammed there was an urgent need to find a political solution to Riyadh’s campaign in Yemen’s war. The conflict has displaced more than 2 million people and driven the country to the verge of widespread famine.     On Tuesday the U.S. Senate killed a resolution seeking an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s involvement in Yemen.

2018-03-22,"BARINAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Protesters vandalised the most important statue of Venezuela’s former leader Hugo Chavez on Thursday in his birthplace of Sabaneta, the latest outbreak of discontent over the OPEC member’s economic and political crisis. Demonstrators took to a town square before dawn, witnesses said, burning tyres around the Russian-donated granite sculpture of a fist-clenched Chavez after several days of protests in the region over power cuts and erratic food supplies. Since the socialist leader’s death in 2013, Venezuela’s opposition has held several waves of protests against his successor, President Nicolas Maduro. There have been various attacks on symbols of ‘Chavismo’ with one statute having been taken down. Workers at the statue in Sabaneta said it was not badly damaged. Chavez was born in Sabaneta on  July 28, 1954, and raised in a mud hut by his grandmother. The statue is particularly closely-guarded by soldiers given its symbolic location in the northwestern agricultural state of Barinas, which government supporters regard as the “cradle of the revolution.”  Extra soldiers were on guard during the day to prevent any recurrence of attacks, locals said. “It’s an act of terrorism, fascism by the opposition,” Pedro Hurtado, a pro-government guide in the town, told Reuters by phone. Opposition activists in Sabaneta have long hoped to destroy the statue to show their disgust with a government they say has destroyed the oil economy and turned Venezuela into a dictatorship. Maduro calls them U.S. pawns.  “We’re fed up of power cuts, of being hungry. People are taking it out on any symbol of this disaster,” said Humberto Delgado, 63, a farmer and former Sabaneta mayor.  Denny Frias, a distant relative of Chavez who tends gardens around the statue, said he and other workers discovered the damage when they came to work. “Fortunately, the protest didn’t do much harm. We’ve washed and cleaned the smoke marks,” he said. Maduro is seeking re-election in a May 20 presidential vote, which critics say is rigged in advance to perpetuate a socialist “dictatorship.” Opposition candidate Henri Falcon has broken with an opposition boycott to stand against Maduro.

2018-03-22,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s crown prince will rub shoulders in New York next week with top figures from Wall Street and Corporate America, part of a whistle-stop first visit to the United States since becoming King Salman’s heir apparent last year. On a public relations blitz, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has lined up stops in Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle to cultivate investments. On Tuesday, he met with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. In addition to cultivating Western ties for investments in Saudi Arabia, the trip is also an opportunity for the crown prince to try to reassure some investors who were unnerved by the severity and secrecy of an anti-corruption crackdown last November.  Prince Mohammed has won Western plaudits for seeking to reduce his country’s reliance on oil, tackle chronic corruption and transform the deeply conservative, mainly Sunni Muslim kingdom. The crown prince will take part in the 2018 Saudi U.S.-CEO Forum in New York next Tuesday, the Saudi embassy said in a statement on Monday. As part of the event, he is slated to host a gala dinner, according to a copy of the forum’s agenda seen by Reuters. Others set to attend will include JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, Henry Kravis, who is CEO of private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), and Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, sources familiar with the matter said. Dimon also planned to attend a gala with the crown prince in Washington on Thursday, one of the sources said.  BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) CEO Larry Fink, who is traveling for the China Development Forum in Beijing this weekend, was not expected to attend the Saudi-U.S. event, a person familiar with the matter said. Two senior executives from BlackRock, Philipp Hildebrand and Mark Wiseman, will attend, the person said. DowDuPont Inc (DWDP.N) Executive Chairman Andrew Liveris, who is listed as co-chair of the Saudi-U.S. forum, will also be in attendance, according to the forum’s website.   Citigroup (C.N) CEO Michael Corbat was to be out of the country during the event but planned to see the crown prince elsewhere, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Next Thursday, Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) CEO Stephen Schwarzman will host an event for the crown prince, a source said. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) spokeswoman declined to comment whether CEO Lloyd Blankfein would be attending the forum, while a spokesman for Morgan Stanley (MS.N) could not be reached for comment. A Lazard spokeswoman also did not comment on any meetings.  A key focus of the crown prince’s visit has been any information on a potentially lucrative listing of up to 5 percent of state oil company Saudi Aramco. It could value it at up to $2 trillion and make it the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalization. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in an interview with Reuters in Washington on Thursday that his country may still move forward with an initial public offering on an international exchange such as London or New York in the second half of 2018, despite previously raising doubts it could be delayed to next year. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are among the possible venues for the listing.

2018-03-22,"NEW YORK, March 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A giant island of plastic floating in the Pacific Ocean holds as much as 16 times more debris than was previously thought, posing a significant threat to the food chain, scientists said on Thursday. The so-called garbage patch in waters between California and Hawaii consists of fishing nets, plastic containers, packaging and ropes, said the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, which headed up a study published in Scientific Reports, an online journal. The research using aerial images revealed the mass of trash is much denser - as much as 16 times more dense - than had previously been estimated, the study said. “It’s shocking,” said Joost Dubois, a spokesman for the Netherlands-based Ocean Cleanup Foundation, which led the team of researchers from seven countries. Nearly 200 nations late last year signed a United Nations resolution to eliminate plastic pollution in the sea, a move some hope will pave the way to a legally binding treaty. The new research estimates the accumulation is 79,000 metric tons - 1.8 trillion pieces - of plastic. Most of those pieces are tiny microplastics, it said. In another way of describing its size, Joost said it is made up of enough trash to fill 500 jumbo jets. The plastic has accumulated into a mass due to currents, scientists say. The research studied a patch of more than 600,000 square miles (1.6 million square kilometers) of the ocean. A petroleum-based product, plastic disintegrates slowly, and one item pulled from the patch was about 40 years old, they said. It harms marine life by killing creatures such as turtles and dolphins that ingest it, and it harms humans by entering the food chain in the form of microplastics, said Dubois. ""We're basically poisoning our own food, especially for those of us relying on fish for our diet,"" Dubois said.

2018-03-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The threat of a global trade war pushed benchmark equity indexes in the United States and Europe deep into the red on Thursday and cut into commodity prices, a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion (£42.5 billion) of imports from China. Under the terms of the memorandum, Trump will target the Chinese imports only after a consultation period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 724.42 points, or 2.93 percent, to 23,957.89, the S&P 500 lost 68.24 points, or 2.52 percent, to 2,643.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 178.61 points, or 2.43 percent, to 7,166.68. Equity markets were down worldwide, with the 1 percent increase in Japan’s Nikkei the only positive among major indexes for the day. Emerging market stocks lost 1.21 percent, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.65 percent. China blamed U.S. export restrictions for its record trade surplus with the United States, but expressed hope that a solution can be found to settle trade issues.  China also gingerly raised a key short-term interest rate. “Markets are saying that these tariffs are going to cut into the global growth story that looked pretty strong just a few weeks ago. The prospect of more tariffs is making markets very unsettled and you’re going to see choppy trading until we see the effect they are having on earnings,” said Jamie Cox, a managing partner for Harris Financial Group.  Those jitters, plus weaker-than-expected German business confidence data, caused European shares to fall 1.6 percent. The dollar index rose 0.03 percent, with the euro down 0.19 percent to $1.2312. The yen rose to a three-week peak against the dollar as traders piled into the Japanese currency in a safe-haven move. The Fed raised its key rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent on Wednesday and flagged at least two more increases for the year, short of the three that some economists had been predicting.  Shares in U.S. social media giant Facebook fell 2.6 percent. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologised for a “major breach of trust” over how it had handled data belonging to 50 million users. That did little to ease investor worries about the cost to fix mistakes and lawmakers’ dismay that his response did not go far enough. Bond yields fell broadly. Borrowing costs on 30-year German debt hit their lowest level of the year.  Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 22/32 in price to yield 2.8263 percent, from 2.907 percent late on Wednesday.  Concern about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies also rattled commodity markets.  U.S. crude fell 1.41 percent to $64.25 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.90, down 0.82 percent on the day. Spot gold dropped 0.2 percent to $1,328.61 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.55 percent to $1,328.80 an ounce.

2018-03-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - British prosecutors will recover 4.4 million pounds from a corruption case in which a Canadian energy company bribed Chadian diplomats in North America, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Thursday following a court ruling. Canada’s Griffiths Energy, using a front company called “Chad Oil”, bribed senior diplomats at the Chadian Embassy to the United States with discounted share deals and payments in return for oil contracts in the central African nation, the SFO said. Griffiths Energy, which changed its name to Caracal Energy Inc in 2013, pleaded guilty to corruption charges brought by Canadian authorities in the same year. The London High Court on Thursday granted the SFO’s civil order to recover 4.4 million pounds lost in that corruption case after a three-day trial, the prosecutor said in a statement. The ruling draws a line under a four-year battle to seize funds from Ikram Saleh, the wife of the former deputy chief of the mission for Chad in the United States. Saleh has 21 days to appeal against the ruling. A lawyer representing her was not immediately available for comment. Caracal was bought by diversified natural resource company Glencore Plc in 2014. Glencore declined to comment. The SFO said it began civil recovery proceedings after the corruption case came under the UK’s jurisdiction following the company’s takeover.  “This is a positive result in the ongoing fight against criminals who attempt to hide their ill-gotten gains in our jurisdiction,” said David Green, the outgoing SFO director. The recovered money will be transferred to Britain’s Department for International Development, which will invest in projects in Chad that will benefit the poor.

2018-03-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as investors took profits after this week’s rally and as U.S. stock markets fell, but losses were limited by the continuing efforts of OPEC and its allies to curb supplies. Brent crude futures fell 56 cents to settle at $68.91 a barrel, a 0.8 percent loss, having retreated from a session peak of $69.70, close to its highest level since early February.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures  fell 87 cents to settle at $64.30 a barrel, a 1.3 percent loss. WTI traded between $64.23 a barrel and $65.74 a barrel during the session. Oil prices have risen in the past two weeks, boosted by a weaker U.S. dollar and tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia that raised concern about Middle East supplies already restricted by an OPEC-led production pact. Prices recorded their biggest one-day gain since November on Wednesday after an unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventories. A drop in U.S. equities on Thursday also weighed on oil prices as U.S. President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China. “Fears of a trade tit-for-tat with China is a component to oil’s weakness today insofar as it might impact accelerating demand,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst and commodity futures broker at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. The oil derivatives market shows most activity in the past week has centred around options to buy, known as “call options,” which give the holder the possibility to purchase oil at a given price by a certain date. Call options to buy oil at $80 a barrel by the end of next month have changed hands more often in the past week than options at any other price level. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell 2.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.6 million barrels.  The decline was driven by lower crude imports and higher refinery runs.  But the confident mood in the oil market has been tempered by U.S. crude production, which climbed to a record 10.4 million barrels per day last week, putting U.S. output ahead of Saudi Arabia and closing in on Russia’s 11 million bpd. “We are still viewing rapidly rising production into record high territory as a latent bearish consideration that will only be accentuated by this renewed high pricing environment,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. U.S. production growth has partly been countered by the deal to cut output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and their allies. The agreement has run since the start of 2017 and is due to expire at the end of 2018. U.S. crude’s discount to Brent widened to as much as $4.65 a barrel on Thursday, its biggest discount since late January.

2018-03-22,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s planned steel tariffs and a potential trade battle with China could hurt U.S. liquefied natural gas companies just as a new wave of developments in the fast-growing market is gaining steam, company executives say. China is the fastest growing major buyer of LNG, making it an important customer for U.S. producers. It is also a significant exporter of the steel components used in LNG plant construction. With an LNG shortage looming as early as 2022, a rush of offtake deals with China and other buyers had been looking likely, boosting construction prospects, said company executives at the CWC LNG Americas Summit in Houston.  But the proposed steel tariffs, which will increase project costs and impact deal pricing, could make U.S. projects less attractive than international rivals.  “I think imposing steel tariffs at this juncture in the evolution of the second wave, right as we move into this very critical stage of the commercial process - locking in customer commitments - is a bad idea,” said Patrick Hughes, vice president of corporate strategy with LNG developer NextDecade Corp. Hughes said the prospect of backlash from steel-producing customer countries was “not insignificant,” adding to the risks around increased costs.  U.S. President Donald Trump amped up his trade battle with China on Thursday, announcing possible new tariffs targeting the country’s high-technology sector, following on from his decision to set general import tariffs of 25 percent on steel. China has already threatened to retaliate by hitting U.S. agricultural exports.  China is the world’s No.2 LNG importer. It also exports many of the specialized steel components needed in LNG plants, products that are not made in the United States. “I would say the overwhelming majority of steel in an LNG plant is pretty specialized,” said Anatol Feygin, Cheniere Energy Inc’s chief commercial officer, adding: “Presumably things that cannot be sourced in the U.S. will not be subject to those (tariffs).” The U.S. Department of Commerce has said there will be an exclusion process for steel products not made domestically, but many details are still unknown. Cheniere signed two major sales deals this year before the tariffs were announced, including one with China, fully commercializing the third liquefaction unit at its Corpus Christi project in Texas. The company is now finalising financing, which will take six to eight weeks, the final step before it can formally greenlight the 4.5 million tonne per annum project, said Feygin. It will be the first new LNG build to go ahead in the U.S. since 2016. That had emboldened many would-be U.S. producers, who were optimistic of their prospects of joining Cheniere in a second wave of development, with the potential to vault the United States ahead of Qatar and Australia to become the world’s top producer. The tariffs are not expected to meaningfully impact expansion projects planned by Cheniere and other first wave producers, but new entrants who need to build steel intensive infrastructure could now face harsher headwinds. Energy executives told Reuters earlier this month that the steel and aluminium tariffs could increase the cost of big-ticket shale and LNG projects by as much as 10 percent. More China-targeted tariffs would also slow deal-making between U.S. producers and Chinese buyers, just as a new buying window had opened, said Charlie Riedl, Executive Director for the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas.  “The industry is really close to laying the golden egg and this could potentially - kill it is probably too far - but it could be a real setback for the second wave of projects,” he said.

2018-03-22,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s parliament approved the adoption of European Union energy rules on Thursday, over the objections of some centre-left parties, allowing the EU outsider to remain a full member of EU markets, the leader of the parliament said on Thursday.  The centre-right minority government feared that rejecting the EU’s Third Energy Package, designed to enhance energy flows and improve regulatory oversight, would put Norway on a slippery slope to a Brexit-like ending of its close EU relations. For the past 24 years, Norwegian companies have enjoyed market access on equal terms with companies in the EU via the European Economic Area treaty, in return for the country’s adoption of EU common market regulations. Opposition to the energy bill came from politicians and trade unions fearing Norway could lose control of its abundant hydroelectric resources. To secure backing for the regulation, the government struck a compromise in advance with the main opposition Labour Party, promising that all power cables connecting Norway to other countries should be state-owned. The deal with Labour could lead to the cancellation of NorthConnect, a planned 2-billion-euro private power cable between Norway and Scotland, which its backers had hoped to put into operation by 2023. If NorthConnect does eventually go ahead, it would have to be under public ownership, Labour said. Under the EEA treaty, Norway retains the right to refuse the adoption of EU rules, but has never done so as this would allow the EU to retaliate by suspending other parts of the agreement.

2018-03-22,"(Updates with Trump setting China tariff plan, close of European trading, investor comment) By David Randall NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - The threat of a global trade war pushed benchmark equity indexes in the United States and Europe deep into the red on Thursday and cut into commodity prices, a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on Thursday that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China. Under the terms of the memorandum, Trump will target the Chinese imports only after a consultation period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 340.32 points, or 1.38 percent, to 24,341.99, the S&P 500 lost 34.8 points, or 1.28 percent, to 2,677.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.62 points, or 1.38 percent, to 7,243.67. Equity markets were down worldwide, with the 1-percent increase in Japan’s Nikkei the only positive among major indexes for the day. Emerging market stocks lost 1.06 percent, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.01 percent. China blamed U.S. export restrictions for its record trade surplus with the United States, but expressed hope that a solution can be found to settle trade issues. China also gingerly raised a key short-term interest rate. “Markets are saying that these tariffs are going to cut into the global growth story that looked pretty strong just a few weeks ago. The prospect of more tariffs are making markets very unsettled and you’re going to see choppy trading until we see the effect they are having on earnings,” said Jamie Cox, a managing partner for Harris Financial Group. Those jitters, plus weaker-than-expected German business confidence data, caused European shares to fall 1.6 percent. The dollar index rose 0.07 percent, with the euro down 0.24 percent to $1.2306. The yen rose to a three-week peak against the dollar as traders piled into the Japanese currency in a safe-haven move. The Fed raised its key rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent on Wednesday and flagged at least two more increases for the year, short of the three that some economists had been predicting. Shares in U.S. social media giant Facebook fell 2.3 percent. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for a “major breach of trust” over how it had handled data belonging to 50 million users. That did little to ease investor worries about the cost to fix mistakes and lawmakers’ dismay that his response did not go far enough. Bond yields - which move inversely to price - fell broadly. Borrowing costs on 30-year German debt hit their lowest level of the year. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 20/32 in price to yield 2.8336 percent, from 2.907 percent late on Wednesday. Concern about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies also put commodity markets on guard. U.S. crude fell 1.17 percent to $64.41 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.96, down 0.73 percent on the day. Spot gold dropped 0.4 percent to $1,326.94 an ounce.

2018-03-22,"SAO PAULO, March 22 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Eletropaulo , the country’s largest power distribution company, plans to raise $500 million for investments and debt repayment, according to documents seen by Reuters on Thursday. The company, whose two largest shareholders are Brazil’s development bank BNDES and U.S. power company AES Corp, plans to set up a subsidiary abroad as a vehicle to tap international capital markets, according to documents the firm sent to Brazil’s power sector regulator, Aneel. Eletropaulo needs Aneel’s authorization to establish the subsidiary, which would issue the bonds and send the proceeds to the parent company in Brazil. “Once capitalized, Eletropaulo would use the proceeds to fund investments in power distribution and to pay back debt,” said the company in the document requesting permission to set up the subsidiary. Eletropaulo replied to an inquiry from Reuters regarding the plan saying “there was no definition, at this time, regarding the transaction.” According to the documents, the company expects to amortize around 1 billion reais ($303.29 million) in debt by 2019 if the capitalization plan goes ahead. $1 = 3.2972 reais

2018-03-22,"AKSU, Kazakhstan (Reuters) - On the surface, the Kazakh town of Aksu looks like a Communist stereotype. Its metals factory is the biggest in the world and for generations it has provided residents with employment, healthcare, education and leisure. But there’s a crucial difference. The Eurasian Resources Group factory is controlled by three billionaires and though the Kazakh government has a stake it’s a far cry from the Communist model of ownership by the proletariat. The trio are Alexander Machkevich, Alijan Ibragimov and Patokh Chodiev and many Kazakhs see them as oligarchs close to President Nursultan Nazarbayev who has ruled since 1989. Nazarbayev, a former Soviet apparatchik, wields sweeping power and parliament is devoid of opposition. A pro-Nazarbayev political party bankrolled by ERG’s cofounders was founded in 1998 and merged with the president’s Nur Otan party in 2006. None of the three billionaires are native Kazakhs, though all are from Central Asia. They started their careers as commodities traders and took over Kazakh mining and metals assets during privatisation. These days one in five of Aksu’s 50,000 residents works at the factory and it is a model for the country’s state-sponsored capitalism under which tycoons are responsible for the welfare of “mono towns” that depend on their business. Founded in the 19th century as a river wharf for nearby coal deposits in northeastern Kazakhstan, Aksu became an industrial hub in the 1960s when Soviet planners designated it as a location for a power plant and a ferroalloys smelter. Both the plant and the smelter were privative in the 1990s after Kazakhstan gained independence from the Soviet Union and became part of ERG’s Central Asian mining and metals assets. Petr Smotrich has worked as a furnace operator at the smelter for 40 years. He met his wife Galiya there. She works as an administrator and their son Dmitry and daughter Irina also work at the same smelter. “The smelter keeps working and therefore we have confidence in our future,” he says. Ferroalloys are used in steelmaking and the Aksu Ferroalloys Plant - as the smelter is known officially - sells the bulk of its products to China, Japan and Russia. The smelter avoided the fate of many ex-Soviet industrial giants in the 1990s that went bankrupt and laid off staff, though at one point it reduced workers shifts to three per week, Smotrich says. The town has avoided the post-Soviet collapse too, Smotrich said. “There is a street gym in every yard,” Smotrich says. ERG, which is boosting exports of ferroalloys, says it has spent hundreds of millions of tenge currency, or millions of dollars, on social infrastructure such as a stadium and a swimming pool. The town also has a trade school so Aksu residents can get education and find work without ever leaving. The only thing lacking is entertainment and those looking for night clubs or cinemas travel 50 km (31 miles) to regional centre Pavlodar, Smotrich says. Others spend their free time fishing on the renovated embankment on the Irtysh river. Unemployment in Aksu is just 1.2 percent, well below the 5.0 percent national average, and crime, locals say, is almost nonexistent. Still, Smotrich says he is not sure whether his 8-year-old granddaughter will continue the metalworker dynasty. “I did nudge my children (in that direction) but she will decide for herself,” he said.

Putin, fresh from an election victory granting him his fourth term and extending his leadership of Russia by six years, called Bashir on Thursday to discuss bilateral relations, SUNA said.

It provided no date for the visit. Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague for genocide and crimes against humanity in Sudan’s Darfur region, and is mostly shunned by Western leaders.

2018-03-22,"(Reuters) - The fatal accident involving an Uber self-driving car cranks up pressure on the self-driving vehicle industry to prove its software and sensors are safe in the absence of strong government standards, experts in the field said. Automakers including General Motors Co (GM.N), technology companies such as Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and ride services providers like Uber Technologies Inc have all urged policy makers at the federal and state level not to put a heavy regulatory hand on an industry still in development. They have said their extensive testing demonstrates commitment to safety.  Uber is currently looking for a head of global safety operations who would “drive key strategic programs including Safety Experience and Building Trust,” according to a job posting on the company’s website. The search was posted before the Arizona fatality. The Uber accident in Tempe, Arizona this week was the first death attributed to a self-driving car operating in autonomous mode.  It has given ammunition to critics of the industry concerned that the lack of clear standards allows manufacturers to test faulty or partially developed technology on public streets.  Well before Sunday’s fatal accident, industry executives had begun to confront questions about whether self-driving cars can be trusted. They have opened up about their testing methods without revealing secrets of system designs.  Public disclosure of self-driving car testing data is inconsistent and varies by state. California requires manufacturers to report instances when an autonomous vehicle system disengages. Arizona does not. “There is no question whatsoever that regulations are coming,” said Doug Mehl, a partner at A.T. Kearney’s automotive practice, based in Detroit. “But right now (automakers), software developers and service providers have an opportunity to shape what those regulations are going to look like.” Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving car unit has underscored in a report that its autonomous vehicles have now logged 5 million miles in real-world testing, and billions more in computer simulations. GM’s Cruise Automation unit has highlighted its decision to teach its driving system to navigate San Francisco’s congested streets. Still, Amnon Shashua, head of Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) Mobileye vision systems unit, said the industry must do more. He has called for the self-driving vehicle industry to develop “provable safety assurances”.  “We need to prove that these vehicles are much, much safer than humans,” Shashua told Reuters. “How do you go and guarantee that you have a technology that the probability of a fatality per one hour of driving is 1,000 times better than a human? Nobody talks about that because nobody knows what to do.” Most self-driving vehicles are equipped with radar sensors and lidar sensors, which use lasers to detect obstacles around the vehicle. There are no federal standards yet specifying how such systems should work. Congress and federal regulators are still debating how tightly to regulate such systems. “There should be vision tests for the sensors they are using, both static and dynamic to see how well they work,” said Missy Cummings, a Duke University mechanical engineering professor. The short video recorded by cameras in the Uber vehicle that struck pedestrian Elaine Herzberg while crossing a street in Tempe, Arizona late Sunday raises questions about whether the Uber system responded better than a human driver, experts said on Wednesday. Uber has hired human operators to sit in driver’s seats of its autonomous vehicles to intervene if necessary. The video released by Tempe police shows a human operator behind the wheel of the Uber vehicle before the impact. The operator is seen looking down, away from the street, in the seconds before the vehicle struck Herzberg. She was pushing a bicycle across the street from left lane into the right lane where the Uber vehicle was driving. “It seems it should have detected her,” Daniel Sperling, director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at University of California Davis told Reuters in an email after viewing the video. “It seems unlikely that a human driver would have done better. We do want AVs to do better than us and the potential exists.” Americans were wary of autonomous vehicle technology even before Sunday’s fatality. According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released in late January, two-thirds of Americans are uncomfortable about the idea of riding in self-driving cars. “The greater risk for the industry is that if people feel it is unsafe, or the testing is unsafe, you’ll see a real backlash against this technology,” said Matthew Johnson-Roberson, co-director of the University of Michigan Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles.

2018-03-22,"(Adds dropped word ‘fell’ in paragraph 8.) By David Randall NEW YORK, March 22 - The threat of a global trade war pushed the U.S. dollar to its lowest in over a month on Thursday and dragged benchmark equity indexes in the U.S. and Europe into the red, a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected. It was the dollar’s third decline in four sessions and helped sterling climb to a six-week high after a Bank of England policy meeting laid the foundations for another British rate increase in the coming months. The Fed raised its key rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent on Wednesday and flagged at least two more increases for the year, short of the three that some economists had been predicting. China also nudged up its borrowing costs overnight, as Beijing braced for fresh tariffs to be announced on Thursday by U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese imports worth as much as $60 billion. Those jitters, plus weaker-than-expected German business confidence data, caused European shares to fall 1.7 percent to a two-week low. Selling pressure intensified in morning trading on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 340.32 points, or 1.38 percent, to 24,341.99, the S&P 500 lost 34.8 points, or 1.28 percent, to 2,677.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.62 points, or 1.38 percent, to 7,243.67. Shares in U.S. tech giant Facebook fell 1.6 percent in morning trading, in the wake of news Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for a “major breach of trust” over how it had handled data belonging to 50 million users. In the currency market, sterling hit a peak of $1.4216, its highest in more than a month. The Bank of England kept rates steady on Thursday but two of its policymakers unexpectedly voted for an immediate rate rise, in a statement that will boost investors’ confidence that borrowing costs will rise in May. Bond yields - which move inversely to price - fell broadly. Borrowing costs on 30-year German debt hit their lowest level of the year. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 24/32 in price to yield 2.819 percent, from 2.907 percent late on Wednesday. World shares broadly retreated, with MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shedding 0.66 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.0 percent. China said it hoped to hold talks with the United States to achieve a “win-win” solution on trade, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing. Concern about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies also put commodity markets on guard. U.S. crude fell 1.14 percent to $64.43 per barrel and Brent was last at $68.90, down 0.82 percent on the day.

2018-03-22,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe must set a minimum price for carbon, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday, something that would require a new tax on imports from non-EU countries that are not doing enough to tackle climate change. Since his election in May, Macron has championed policies to combat climate change, putting him at odds with President Donald Trump who pulled the United States out of the 2015 Paris Climate accord. Macron reiterated that France would increase the price of carbon emitted there to 84 euros per tonne in 2022 from 44 euros this year. But he said the carbon trading market was not working efficiently at the European level. “We need a European price floor for carbon. I know it won’t be easy, there will be resistance from all around,” Macron told a conference on financing sustainable growth in Brussels ahead of a summit of European Union leaders. Such a minimum price would incentivise greener investments, but would need to be accompanied by a tax on goods from countries beyond Europe’s borders who do not “make the same environmental choices”, he said. Macron also said there should be a target for EU budget spending to help a transition to a green economy and no EU spending should be “hostile” to the environment. “I think a target of 40 percent of the budget would allow for this transition to be ambitious rather than measured, as it is today.” Reporting by Richard Lough and Jean-Baptiste Vey; Editing by Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-macron-green-economy/update-1-macron-pushes-for-eu-minimum-price-for-carbon-idUKL8N1R44UI,22 Mar 2018,"Europe must set a minimum

2018-03-22,"ROME, March 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Conflicts and climate disasters, particularly drought, drove the number of people facing crisis levels of hunger up by about 15 percent last year and the situation is getting worse, a report said on Thursday. Last year 124 million people in 51 countries faced crisis levels of hunger compared to 108 million people in 48 countries in 2016 and 80 million in 2015, according to the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). The FSIN is a global project set up to strengthen food and nutrition security information systems that is sponsored by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme and the International Food Policy Research Institute. “We are clearly seeing a trend now, from 80 million to 108 million, from 108 to 124 million, people literally marching to the brink of starvation around the world,” said David Beasley, WFP’s executive director. “We will never address the issues of the day until we end some of these conflicts,” he added at the report’s launch. The FSIN report said the rising numbers in 2017 were largely due to new or intensified conflicts in Myanmar, north-east Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Yemen. In 2018, “conflict will remain a primary driver of food security”, it said, while severe dry weather is expected to affect crop and livestock production and worsen hunger in many parts of Africa. Yemen, where a proxy war between a Saudi-led military coalition and the Iran-backed Houthi movement has displaced more than 2 million people since 2015, would remain “the world’s most concerning food crisis”, the report said. It also singled out Eritrea, North Korea and Venezuela as places of concern but said a lack of data made it difficult to estimate the number of people left hungry. The analysis showed the situation could worsen in 2018 in at least three or four countries, Luca Russo, senior food crises analyst at the FAO, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The FSIN uses a five phase scale with the third level classified as crisis, fourth as emergency and fifth as famine/catastrophe. “In South Sudan, we all applaud ourselves because we avoided famine last year, but the figures today tell us we might have famine in South Sudan in the next few months and this can also apply to other countries,” Russo said.

2018-03-22,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Leading diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) has named former oil boss Helge Lund as its new chairman as the company contends with increasing price pressure and seeks acquisitions to broaden its blood products line-up. The man dubbed by some as Norway’s Mr Oil because of his extensive career in the oil and gas industry may be more of an expert in hydrocarbons than insulin, but his merger and acquisitions experience is a big draw for the Danish pharmaceuticals company. Novo is on the hunt for promising assets to boost its struggling blood products business after it lost out to French rival Sanofi (SASY.PA) in the chase for Belgian biotech company Ablynx ABLX.BR in late January. Novo said it dropped its pursuit of Ablynx, which is developing an experimental drug for a rare blood disorder, because it could not justify the high price required to beat Sanofi’s offer. “In our opinion there is only one loser and that is the one that pays too much,” said CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, referencing its stance on Ablynx when investors at Thursday’s annual general meeting asked about Novo’s growth strategy for its biopharmaceutical business. “We will stay disciplined on value but we are still looking and we hope that we will be able to manage a deal in 2018,” he added. Novo’s biopharmaceutical sales fell by 16 percent last year. “We are about to see Novo take on a role that we have not seen before and therefore it is important to have a chairman with experience of mergers and acquisitions,” said Sydbank analyst Soren Lontoft Hansen.

2018-03-22,"PARIS (Reuters) - Two rights groups have given the French government two months to halt weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates or face legal action, adding to pressure on President Emmanuel Macron to scale back support of a Riyadh-led offensive in Yemen. The action comes as some European states, notably Germany, have curtailed ties with the Saudi-led military coalition due to concerns over its role in Yemen’s civil war. France, Britain and the United States have not followed suit.    France, the world’s third-biggest arms exporter, counts Saudi Arabia and the UAE among its biggest purchasers, and France’s biggest defence firms, including Dassault and Thales, have major contracts in the Gulf. Droit Solidarite, a legal NGO, and Aser, which specialises in armament issues, argue that France is violating national and international law by selling arms that are being used in the conflict in Yemen. The United Nations and rights groups accuse the coalition of targeting civilians, which amounts to a war crime. The coalition denies this.  “France is not respecting its international commitments,” Aser’s president, Benoit Muracciole, told Reuters. Lawyers acting for the two NGOs sent a letter to the office of Prime Minister Edouard Phillipe demanding the export licenses to be suspended. If the French government does not meet their deadline, Aser and Droit Solidarite will take their case to the Conseil d’Etat, France’s highest legal authority.  “We will go to the Council of State from May 1 if there is an explicit or implicit refusal of the government to respond,” he said. The Saudi-led coalition is fighting on the side of an internationally recognised Yemeni government against the Iran-aligned Houthi group. Since the war began in 2015, more than 10,000 people have been killed, at least three million others displaced and Yemen has been plunged into a multi-fronted humanitarian disaster.   In recent years, Riyadh has bought French tanks, armoured vehicles, munitions and artillery, while the UAE purchased fighter jets.   Amnesty International and French rights group ACAT published a legal report on Monday warning France and its weapons suppliers faced potential legal risks over their dealings with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Unlike many if its allies, French export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances. They are approved through a committee headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign, defence and economy ministries. Details of licences are not public and once approved are rarely reviewed. “Arms sales in France are governed by very strict procedures of state control,” the prime minister’s office said. It confirmed receipt of the letter. In 2016, licences potentially worth 45 billion euros ($55.45 billion) to the two countries were approved with deliveries worth about 2 billion euros. “French military equipment exports are totally controlled by the state,” a Dassault spokesman said. Thales declined to comment.

2018-03-22,"* Cyprus-based firm signs first major post-Mugabe deal * Company promises 15,000 long-term jobs * First PGM production expected in 2020 (Adds details on Tharisa, unclear where funding will come from) By MacDonald Dzirutwe HARARE, March 22 (Reuters) - A Cypriot investor signed a $4.2 billion deal on Thursday to develop a platinum mine and refinery in Zimbabwe, an investment that President Emmerson Mnangagwa said showed the country was “open for business”. Signing the agreement with Cyprus-based Karo Resources, Mines Minister Winston Chitando said work would start in July, with the first output of platinum group metals expected in 2020, aiming to reach 1.4 million ounces annually within three years. It was unclear, however, where all the funding would come from and analysts said the project start date of July looked very ambitious. Located in the Mhondoro-Ngezi platinum belt, west of Harare, where Impala Platinum Holdings has operations, the project will include a coal mine and power station to produce electricity for the smelter, and should employ 15,000 people when fully implemented, Karo head Loucas Pouroulis said. Keen to revive the mining sector after years of reticence by foreign investors during Robert Mugabe’s rule, President Mnangagwa said the deal showed things had changed since his ascendancy after Mugabe’s ousting in November. “Zimbabwe is open for business and whoever stands in the way, hurting business in this country, will fall. It is not business as usual anymore, things have to change,” Mnangagwa said at the signing ceremony. The project was first mooted six years ago but had been held back by government red tape and “other unnamed vested interests, which are corrupt interests,” he said. Mines Minister Chitando added: “This is the largest investment structure in the country’s mining industry in Zimbabwe. The landscape of Zimbabwe’s mining industry will never be the same.” Zimbabwe’s government did not give details of the source of funding for such a big investment. Industry sources, who asked not to be named, said there was no obligation to provide any cash until firmer plans for the development were in place. Cyprus-born Pouroulis spent his early career with industry giant Anglo American in South Africa, branching out on his own to establish more niche operators such as Petra Diamonds, Eland Platinum and Tharisa Minerals, according to his profile on Tharisa’s website. As well as heading Karo, Pouroulis is chairman and founder of Tharisa, in which his family has a 45 percent stake. Tharisa, which has chrome and platinum operations in South Africa’s Bushveld, has made clear its interest in the potential of Zimbabwe, which holds the world’s second-largest platinum deposits after neighbouring South Africa. The company, however, has a market capitalisation of only 5.5 billion rand ($464 million), although it is well regarded by many city analysts and its share price has rallied 15 percent this year. HSBC initiated covered of the stock on Thursday, rating it a buy. It predicted it would have a net cash position of $185 million by the end of 2022 and said platinum prices should benefit from continued supply curtailment in South Africa because of regulatory and funding uncertainty. Foreign investment stalled in Zimbabwe during the later years of Mugabe’s reign. Analysts say the outlook is still uncertain, but interest is strong in a country that has rich, underexplored resources. An investment conference on Zimbabwe in London last week was heavily oversubscribed. On Monday, Mnangagwa’s government amended the Mugabe-era Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, which aimed to increase black Zimbabweans’ ownership of mines by preventing foreign entities holding majority stakes. The revised law removed that stipulation for most types of mining, but not diamond and platinum mines. Chitando said Karo Resources was expected to comply with the empowerment law by giving up majority ownership in the project. He did not elaborate.

2018-03-22,"March 22 (Reuters) - The main U.S. coal miners’ union is set to endorse two Democrats running for Congress in West Virginia, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday - a boost for Democrats trying to win over a constituency that voted heavily for Republican Donald Trump in 2016. The United Mine Workers of America on Friday will endorse Richard Ojeda for U.S. Representative in the state’s third district, as well as incumbent Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat and former West Virginia governor, the sources said. They asked not to be named as they were discussing a confidential matter. The union sees Ojeda and Manchin as supportive of major issues facing coal miners, particularly efforts to preserve their pensions, the sources said. In addition, neither candidate has fully embraced the Democratic Party’s push for climate regulation, a sticking point for miners. Trump’s White House win in 2016 was due in part to his promise to revive the ailing coal industry, which has lost more than 40 percent of its work force in less than a decade, by rolling back environmental regulation. While his administration has chipped away at regulations, the coal sector remains in the doldrums, under pressure from cheaper and cleaner natural gas, more than a year into Trump’s presidency. Republican control of Congress will be at stake in midterm elections in November, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 Senate seats will be up for grabs. The endorsements in West Virginia this week follow the union’s support for Conor Lamb in a special election for a House seat in Pennsylvania that he won earlier this month. Political observers have said that upset could be a bellwether for future races in areas that had supported Trump. The UMWA had organized a rally, door-to-door canvassing, and phone bank operations for Lamb. UMWA President Cecil Roberts told Reuters that Lamb - a former Marine who wore work boots while talking with voters - won because he focused on protecting miners’ pensions, which are at risk of insolvency due to bankruptcies and mine closures. “That’s how Conor Lamb was able to swing those voters to his side,” Roberts said. Roberts said Ojeda, a tough-talking former Army paratrooper who comes from a long line of coal miners, reminded him of Lamb. The UMWA has endorsed about three more Republicans than Democrats in House races so far in this cycle. But the tally will likely become evenly split between the two parties in the coming months as the union looks to races in Ohio, Colorado, and Arizona, said one of the sources. It is unclear how much the endorsements will help the candidates, but miners are seen as an influential political constituency, particularly in Appalachia - the epicenter of the U.S. coal industry. Ojeda, currently a state senator in West Virginia who is seen as a favorite in a Democratic primary to pick the party’s candidate on May 8, faces a tough election battle in his heavily Republican southern West Virginia district. Trump won the district by 49 percentage points against his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Ojeda himself voted for Trump. Ojeda did not comment about the coming endorsement, but said in an brief interview, “I’m going to fist fight for workers who have been neglected.” Ojeda has said he supports more coal mining, especially to fuel steel furnaces, but also backs biofuels, solar and wind power. In 2016, the UMWA endorsed a Republican in Ojeda’s district, Evan Jenkins, who is retiring to run for the U.S. Senate. Manchin, meanwhile, has long been the Democratic Party’s strongest supporter of coal interests, advocating more production and backing controversial subsidy proposals. But several Republicans are lining up against him in the midterm elections. Among them is Don Blankenship, a former coal company executive who served a year-long prison sentence for conspiring to violate safety standards at the Upper Big Branch mine - where 29 miners died in 2010. Manchin’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the coming endorsement. The Democratic National Committee is not endorsing candidates before the primary votes, but the organization likes what it sees in coal country. “Focusing on middle class families, on American workers, in these Appalachian and more rural areas is something that is successful for Democratic candidates to run on,” said Elizabeth Renda, a DNC spokeswoman.

2018-03-22,"STUTTGART, Germany (Reuters) - German utility EnBW (EBKG.DE) defended its strategy to remain an integrated energy group focused on renewables and power and gas networks on Thursday, saying its decision to resist the break-ups of larger peers E.ON and RWE was paying off. RWE (RWEG.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE) unveiled plans last week to break up and share renewables, networks and retail group Innogy (IGY.DE), the largest restructuring in the country’s energy market since Germany decided to phase out nuclear power. RWE will focus on energy generation, while E.ON will become a pure networks and retail player in Europe. At EnBW, all these businesses co-exist under one roof. “Whether it is possible to gain a foothold in tomorrow’s energy world with a different strategic approach remains to be proven in the next years,” EnBW Chief Executive Frank Mastiaux told journalists at the group’s annual press conference. “We have set out our strategy in 2013 and have not changed it one iota....and because this has worked we will continue with it in the exact same manner,” he said. Although not a clear indicator due to its limited free float, EnBW’s shares have outperformed E.ON and RWE since Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, which triggered Germany’s switch from nuclear to renewables. EnBW’s shares have still lost 37 percent since then, but RWE’s have lost 59 percent and E.ON is down 56 percent. EnBW said it would propose a dividend of 0.50 euros per share for 2017 after suspending payouts in 2016, adding core earnings had grown for the first time in seven years as the group continues its expansion into renewables. Like larger peers E.ON and RWE, Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022 caused EnBW to draw up a new strategy. Its plan has now paid off, EnBW said, adding adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) grew 9 percent to 2.11 billion euros in 2017, the first time profit had increased since 2010. The company also laid out its target post 2025, saying it expected adjusted EBITDA to rise to more than 3 billion euros by then, and flagging it could also exceed its target of 2.4 billion it has set for 2020.

2018-03-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Endeavour Energy UK has launched the sale of its North Sea oil and gas assets at an ambitious price target of $500 million, according to two industry sources and a document seen by Reuters. The sale is part of group asset sales after Endeavour’s U.S. parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2014. The UK company and its administrators have hired audit firm Deloitte as their corporate finance advisor on the sale, dubbed “Project Arrow”, the document showed. Information documents for the portfolio, which includes non-operating interests in five producing fields, a development project and some fields that have ceased production, were sent to potential buyers in February, with bids expected at the end of last month. The sources said the sale price target was ambitious given that some of the fields are no longer producing oil.  The transaction could either be a sale of the share capital of Endeavour or a sale of individual assets or a package of assets. Endeavour Energy could not be reached for comment and Deloitte declined to comment.  Endeavour’s Houston-based parent company Endeavour International Corporation, which was founded in the early 2000s and delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, was forced to file for bankruptcy following a sharp drop in oil prices that year.  It subsequently abandoned a deal with bondholders to halve its $1.2 billion debt and instead announced a sale of its U.S. assets, accounting for 18 percent of the company’s total portfolio, and the North Sea fields. That process failed to attract bidders back then, as oil prices remained low.   The UK North Sea, off the northeastern coast of Scotland, has however seen a flurry of deals in the past two years as longstanding operators make way for a new generation of smaller firms focused on squeezing more profit out of old assets. Private equity-backed buyers such as Neptune Energy, Chrysaor and Siccar Point Energy have snapped up unwanted assets from major energy producers, which have seen investment fall by around 60 percent since 2013, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Although North Sea oil output has halved from its peak of almost 3 million barrels a day at the turn of the century, it has rebounded slightly in the past couple of years as new projects have come on stream. Sources did not give any indication on the potential bidders but said that private equity firms continue to have an appetite to invest. Wood MacKenzie estimates that there are 20 private equity-backed vehicles with war chests of around $15 billion for North Sea acquisitions.

2018-03-22,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: Shape of futures price curve in Brent crude tmsnrt.rs/2Ge1dRq * Chart 2: Brent calendar spread for second half of 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2pxje2V By John Kemp LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Brent calendar spreads have risen significantly over the last week, erasing an earlier decline and indicating traders have become more bullish about the outlook for the oil market later this year. The Brent calendar spread for the second half of 2018, which measures the difference in price between futures for delivery in June and December, has climbed to more than $2.50 per barrel from $1.65 on March 13. Calendar spreads reflect expectations about the balance between supply and demand in the physical market, and are seen by many traders and investors as a more useful signal than spot prices. The relationship between spreads and inventories was identified by economist Holbrook Working in the grain market (""Price relations between July and September wheat futures at Chicago since 1885 here ”, Working, 1933). But similar relationships between spreads and inventories exist in other commodities including Brent crude. By convention, calendar spreads are normally expressed as the price of the nearer futures contract minus the price of the contract with longer until expiry. Negative spreads, known as “contango”, when the price of the nearby contract is below the longer-dated one, are correlated with high and rising inventories, when production exceeds consumption. Positive spreads, termed “backwardation”, when the price of the nearby contract is above the longer-dated one, are correlated with low and falling inventories, when production falls short of consumption. For the last quarter of a century, Brent crude futures have cycled between contango and backwardation as the global oil market has alternated between periods of over- and under-supply. Brent calendar spreads have been one of the most useful and reliable indicators of the changing balance in the global oil market tmsnrt.rs/2Ge1dRq. The Brent spreads have been gradually moving from contango to backwardation since early 2015 or early 2016 as the oil market has gradually rebalanced after the slump in 2014/15. Recently, however, the calendar spreads appeared to peak and start softening, coinciding with a downturn in spot prices. Traders and investors seemed to react to an unexpected surge in crude and condensates output from U.S. shale producers. Forecasts showed additional production from the United States as well as Brazil, Canada and Norway would be more than enough to meet the increase in oil consumption this year. Hedge funds and other financial investors have been gradually reducing their bullish positions in crude oil over the last seven weeks, intensifying the downward pressure on spreads and spot prices. But in the last week, both spreads and spot prices have rallied sharply tmsnrt.rs/2pxje2V, regaining most of the ground lost during February and March, suggesting a return to a more bullish sentiment or at least a tempering of bearishness. Oil prices and spreads do not rise and fall in straight lines or even in a simple cyclical pattern. In addition to the main cycle, there are smaller epicycles operating at various time-scales from months to weeks, days or even minutes and seconds. The weakening of the spread since early February appears to have been one of those epicycles within the framework of a larger cyclical upswing, but that epicycle seems to have reversed course over the last week. The reasons are not entirely clear, but could include rising tensions between the United States and Iran, OPEC discussions to tighten its inventory target, or another factor entirely. Some epicycles arise from within the market itself, rather than as a result of fundamental external factors, as prices move in response to the accumulation and liquidation of positions by traders. The bigger question is whether the oil market is still tightening - or whether the rise in prices since June 2017 has already done enough to ensure supply will match demand for the rest of 2018 and into 2019.

Two other people were taken to hospital with serious injuries, a fire department spokeswoman told Czech Television. The blast occurred at Unipetrol’s plant in Kralupy nad Vltavou about 30 km (19 miles) north of Prague. “There was an explosion at the storage tank but no subsequent fire in the Kralupy refinery,” Unipetrol spokesman Pavel Kaidl said. “The situation is under control and there is no other danger. There was no leakage of dangerous substances.”  The mayor of Kralupy told Czech Television the blast occurred during cleaning of the storage tank.  Unipetrol had been preparing the refinery for maintenance and an upgrade scheduled to run from March 27 to May 9. The facility has an annual capacity of 3.2 million tonnes of oil.  In August 2015, a blast and fire at Unipetrol’s Litvinov facility knocked the refinery out for more than a year. In February, Poland’s PKN Orlen said it had raised its stake in Unipetrol to more than 90 percent from 63 percent, meeting a threshold to take full control and delist the company from the Prague stock exchange.

2018-03-22,"* Dollar weakens broadly as trade worries compound Fed effect * China bumps up short-term rates slightly * Oil stalls at six-week high * European shares down 1 pct, US stocks to open lower By Marc Jones and Alasdair Pal LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - The threat of a global trade war and a steady message from the Federal Reserve on U.S. interest rates pushed the dollar to its lowest in over a month on Thursday, and took Europe’s main share markets into the red. It was the dollar’s third decline in four sessions and helped Britain’s pound to a six-week high after a Bank of England policy meeting laid the foundations for another UK rate increase in the coming months. The Fed raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 1.75 percent on Wednesday and flagged at least two more increases were likely this year. But it stopped short of pointing to the three that some economists had been predicting. China also nudged up its borrowing costs overnight, as Beijing braced for new tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese imports worth as much as $60 billion . Not all Fed bulls were discouraged, though. “Over the balance of the year we do think they will move to four hikes,” said JP Morgan Asset Management’s Seamus Mac Gorain, highlighting the impact of recent fiscal stimulus. Trade tariffs were a risk but more open economies such as Mexico or the euro zone could be more at risk than the United States, he said. Those jitters, plus weaker-than-expected German business confidence data, caused European shares to fall 1 percent to a two-week low. U.S. stocks were also set to open lower, with S&P 500 futures down 0.7 percent in pre-market trades. Shares in tech giant Facebook were set to fall for a third successive day after its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologised for a “major breach of trust” over how it had handled data belonging to 50 million users. In the currency market, the British pound hit a high of $1.4216, its highest in more than a month. The Bank of England kept rates steady on Thursday but two of its policymakers unexpectedly voted for an immediate rate rise, in a statement that will boost investors’ confidence that borrowing costs will rise in May. Bond yields - which move inversely to price - fell broadly. Borrowing costs on 30-year German debt hit their lowest level of the year. Two-year U.S. yields slipped to 2.305 percent from 9 1/2-year high of 2.366 percent. The 10-year yield fell below 2.85 percent, its biggest move in three weeks. “The threat of protectionism is dampening the mood in the German economy,” said Clemens Fuest, the chief of the Munich-based  Ifo institute, which published the business sentiment data. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended almost flat, a 1 percent drop in Chinese and Hong Kong stocks offsetting gains elsewhere. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.0 percent as investors went bargain hunting after a difficult run for the market. China hopes it can hold talks with the United States to achieve a “win-win” solution on trade, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing. But worries were swirling of a more traditional kind of war. A widely read Chinese state-run newspaper said on Thursday that the country should prepare for military action over Taiwan. Beijing was infuriated after Donald Trump signed legislation last week that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa. Concern about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies also put commodity markets on guard. Oil prices gave up earlier gains to leave Brent crude futures at $68.98 per barrel and U.S. crude at $64.76 a barrel. Copper steadied at $6,791 per tonne after reaching a three-month low on Wednesday. Reporting by Marc Jones and Alasdair Pal, editing by Jon

2018-03-22,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (BMWG.DE) will not mass produce electric cars until 2020 because its current technology is not profitable enough to scale up for volume production, the chief executive said on Thursday. Munich-based BMW unveiled its first battery electric car in 2013, and has been working on different generations of battery, software and electric motor technology since then.  The i8 Roadster model, due to hit showrooms in May, is equipped with what BMW calls its fourth-generation electric drive technology. Advances in battery raw materials and chemistry has increased its range by 40 percent over the previous version, BMW said. BMW is working to make electric car technology more modular and scaleable to make mass production commercially viable.    “We wanted to wait for the fifth generation to be much more cost competitive,” Chief Executive Harald Krueger told analysts in Munich. “We do not want to scale up with the fourth generation.” The cost advantage between BMW’s fourth and fifth generation electric vehicle technology was a “two digit number” in percent terms, Krueger said. He did not offer precise figures. “If you want to win the race, you must be the most cost competitive in the segment, otherwise you cannot scale up the volume,” he said. BMW is working on a sixth generation of its technology and is investing a three-digit-million euro amount in battery cell research to better understand mass production, the company said. BMW makes electric cars at 10 plants across the world but has focussed mainly on hybrids, which combine combustion engines with battery powered electric motors, rather than vehicles reliant solely on batteries for their power. BMW said it wanted to add 25 new electrified models by 2025, of which 12 vehicles will be fully battery electric variants. Thanks to a new production method available from 2020 onwards, BMW will be able to make all its cars with pure electric, hybrid and combustion engined variants. In 2019 BMW will start making a fully electric Mini at its plant on the outskirts of the British city of Oxford, and will start production of a battery electric version of the X3 offroader in 2020. BMW is increasing the number of factories where it makes the X3 offroader. This year it will start making the X3 in China and South Africa, in addition to Spartanburg in the United States.   BMW has chosen Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) as its partner in China for battery cell production, Krueger said.

2018-03-22,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland, March 22 (Reuters) - Jonathan Goldberg, the founder of one of the world’s largest energy-focused hedge funds BBL Commodities, is launching a new $1 billion macro fund with his former Goldman Sachs colleague Ben Jacobs that will trade currencies and equity indices based on commodities trends. The new fund was launched in March and is in the process of raising $250 million from founders with the remaining fundraising expected to close by the end of the year. BBL Commodities itself currently has some $500 million to $600 million under management. The new fund will be a rare beast in the market where commodities are often being traded by macro funds based on macro-economic trends. But Goldberg says the world will face a number of tectonic changes relating to commodities in the next few years that will be so big that they will allow the trading of entire countries based on them. One of the trends, he says, is the upcoming change in global marine regulations in 2020 that will set a new upper limit for sulphur content in fuel used for shipping to cut pollution. The rule will see a drastic reduction in demand for fuel oil, currently used in ships, and raise demand for cleaner, low-sulphur diesel. That in turn will depress the value of heavy, sulphurous crude oil from places such as Canada as they tend to yield more fuel oil than diesel. “What happens to the balance of payments of Canada when your main export product gets less value? And who – which country and currency – does better in this scenario? That is what the fund will be looking at,” said Goldberg. The Wall Street Journal was first to report about the launch of the fund. The impact from new marine fuel regulations might be as big as if not bigger than those from the U.S. shale boom on the global oil industry, said Goldberg. When U.S. shale oil production soared in 2012-2014, the world had an oversupply of 1 million barrels per day of oil, equal to around one percent of demand. But when new marine fuel regulation comes into play, demand for diesel will probably increase by about 2 million barrels per day or by over six percent of current global diesel demand, said Goldberg. He said the fund will be also look at currencies such as the Australian dollar and Russian rouble, interest rates and broad-based equity indices across commodity producers. “People are saying the world will have a petrochemical boom. So we, for example, will be looking at what this boom means for broad indices,” said Goldberg. He said the advantage of having a macro fund exploring commodity trends is primarily in having access to more liquid asset classes. “The gasoline market is simply less liquid than the Canadian dollar.” Goldberg is fairly bullish on oil prices in the short term but in the medium term he expects crude to come under pressure as global demand growth is set to slow, OPEC cuts will end, while U.S. and Canadian output will increase on the back of improved efficiency.

2018-03-22,"JUBA, March 22 (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on 15 South Sudanese oil operators will work against efforts to restore peace and stability in the nation, the government said on Thursday. The sanctions, which were announced on Wednesday, will require companies and government bodies to apply for special licences to do business in the United States, an action designed to increase pressure on President Salva Kiir to end the conflict and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan. “These measures are viewed by the Ministry of Petroleum as counterproductive to the shared mission of the Republic of South Sudan’s and the United States’ governments to bring peace and stability to South Sudan,” the ministry said in a statement. It pledged to work with the U.S. Department of Commerce “to remove these restrictions and resume normal relations with the U.S.”. South Sudan has been torn by civil war since 2013 when fighting erupted between troops loyal to Kiir and those loyal to then-Vice President Riek Machar. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of 12 million from their homes. Earlier this month, activists accused the government of funnelling cash from the state oil company to militias responsible for atrocities and attacks on civilians. Announcing the sanctions, the U.S. State Department also said the government and corrupt officials were using oil revenue to buy weapons and fund militias. Washington has already placed sanctions on South Sudanese military and political figures, and in January imposed an arms embargo to try to halt the flow of weapons into the country, signalling that it had lost patience with the warring factions for ignoring ceasefires. Last year, the government said it planned to more than double oil production to 290,000 barrels per day in fiscal 2017-2018. South Sudan is the most oil-dependent country in the world, with oil accounting for almost all its exports and around 60 percent of its gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. The government said on Thursday it will encourage more investments in the petroleum sector. Petroleum minister Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth extended an exploration and production sharing agreement with Petronas of Malaysia for six years. The deal covers blocks 3 and 7 in Unity oilfield which have been shut down due to the conflict. The government said it had secured a commitment from Petronas to resume operations soon. “Bringing back production at Unity and other fields, and increasing production overall, are the priorities of this ministry,” the minister said in a statement.

2018-03-22,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell PERTH, March 22 (Reuters) - A comfortable consensus is emerging in the iron ore market that China’s vast steel industry has undergone a structural change that has resulted in quality iron ore gaining a permanent advantage over lower grades. Certainly the common theme of presentations at this week’s Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast Conference in Perth was that the current premium of ore with a higher iron content is now a defining characteristic of China’s market. This shift matters as China buys about two-thirds of global seaborne iron ore, with the vast majority of the annual demand of more than 1 billion tonnes coming from Australia and Brazil, with South Africa a distant third. The industry benchmark is ore with an iron content of 62 percent, a quality level that is met by most Brazilian ore, as well as by top Australian miner Rio Tinto. BHP Billiton, Australia’s second-ranked producer, comes close to this level with its output, but third-ranked Fortescue Metals Group delivers a grade closer to the 58 percent level. China’s switch to using higher-grade iron ore in its blast furnaces is seemingly built around three main factors. The first is the need to reduce air pollution, which encourages steel mills to use the higher grade ores as they require less coking coal in order to be turned into pig iron and then crude steel. Using high-grade iron ore with a 65 percent iron content consumes about 12 percent less coking coal than using 58 percent iron ore. The second is the ongoing government-mandated rationalisation of the steel industry, with capacity closures of around a total 110 million tonnes being achieved in 2016 and 2017. Up to 40 million tonnes more was slated to be shut down this year. This policy is aimed at eliminating overcapacity and clearing out older, less-efficient producers, thereby boosting the profitability of the remaining steel mills. The policy has contributed to the third factor driving the switch to higher grade ore, namely that mills are enjoying strong profit margins. From being loss-making for several years up to 2016, China’s steel producers have turned strongly profitable in recent months, with the margin on benchmark steel rebar around $117 a tonne, according to S&P Global Platts data. With the steel futures in Shanghai currently trading around the equivalent of $575, it’s clear that steel makers can afford to use the higher-cost iron ore as they are still incentivised to maximise output to capture the available profit. If the current market consensus is correct that China’s shift to higher grade iron ore is structural, it becomes apparent that these three factors will also have to be structural. It’s probably fair to say that the first two - the focus on reducing pollution and the rationalisation of capacity - appear to be ongoing policies and there are no signs that they will be relaxed or changed in any shape. But the most important factor is the profitability of steel mills, and this is far from guaranteed. The return to profitability was driven by stimulus spending on infrastructure and a recovery in real estate investment, and both of these influences may be waning somewhat. This isn’t to suggest a sharp correction is looming in Chinese steel demand and prices, but at the same time constructing a case for sustaining the current levels of robust profits is quite challenging. Steel is a cyclical business and is likely to remain so, meaning that at some point China’s producers will once again face a margin squeeze. When that happens the incentive switches to use the lowest cost inputs and accept a reduction in volumes from the blast furnace. This could well put lower grade iron ore back in play, and shrink the current wide margins. The spot price in China of 62 percent iron ore .IO62-CNO=MB, as assessed by Metal Bulletin, was at $67.25 a tonne on Wednesday. The assessment for the 58 percent grade .IO58-CNO=MB was $39.06 a tonne. This makes the lower grade ore about 42 percent cheaper, and this has widened from the 29 percent gap that prevailed at the end of 2016. The current gap is clearly seen by many in the industry as the new normal, and it’s likely to persist as long as China’s steel mills enjoy the type of profits they are getting currently. But it may be a touch too soon to say that this is a sustained structural change that cannot be reversed if market circumstances change, as they inevitably will.

2018-03-22,"BENGALURU/LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) (RIO.L) is to sell its 75 percent stake in a Queensland project to Australia’s Whitehaven Coal (WHC.AX) for $200 million, in its second deal this week to shed coal assets. Rio is also in the process of selling its remaining Australian coal asset - a stake in the Kestrel underground mine.  “We believe this agreement for the sale of Winchester South represents the best option for the future development of the project while delivering attractive value for Rio Tinto,” Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement. The deal, subject to Australian regulatory approvals, is broken down into $150 million payable to Rio Tinto by Whitehaven on the date of completion and a further unconditional payment of $50 million payable a year later.  Whitehaven Coal said it would fund the purchase with cash and existing facilities and it was expected to conclude in the second quarter. Retail property manager Scentre Group (SCG.AX) has the remaining 25 percent stake in Winchester South. Once developed, Winchester South is expected to produce coking and thermal coal. Whitehaven Coal Managing Director and CEO Paul Flynn said the project was “a significant strategic acquisition,” which complemented existing assets and tallied with a longer term plan to meet Asian demand for premium quality coking coal. Glencore (GLEN.L), the world’s biggest shipper of export grade coal, has also said it expects to continue to find value in high quality coal. Rio Tinto on Tuesday announced it had agreed to sell to Glencore the Hail Creek coal mine and Valeria coal project in Australia for $1.7 billion. Sven Reinke, Senior Vice President, and Anke Richter, Associate Managing Director at Moody’s, said in an emailed statement on Thursday Glencore’s purchase was “credit positive”. “The proximity to Glencore’s existing operations and the existing infrastructure offers material potential to realise synergies and could result in a short pay back period of around 5 years,” he said. Some investors shun the fuel because of concerns about climate change and because more environmental alternatives are becoming more competitive. Coal miners’ profits have this year been boosted by a coal price rally.  Those bullish about coal say falls in investment have tightened the market, increasing the value of a commodity still favoured in parts of the world as a cheap, easy source of power.  Whitehaven Coal posted a 63 percent rise in first-half net profit, while Glencore and the other majors have rallied strongly from the deep commodity markets crash of 2015-16. Rio Tinto’s share price was trading 1.9 percent lower by 1155 GMT in London trade, slightly underperforming the broader index .FTNMX1770. Whitehaven closed down 1.5 percent in Australia. “Rio is cleaning up the portfolio and generating some pretty decent cashflow in the process,” analyst Paul Gait of Bernstein said.

2018-03-22,"MOSCOW, March 22 (Reuters) - A relative of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been nominated for a senior position in the state-owned gas giant Gazprom. In a brief financial disclosure on Thursday, Gazprom, the world’s largest natural gas producer, said its board would consider the issue “of M.E. Putin”, without giving further details. The formulation is usually used by Gazprom in reference to a discussion about nominating a new management board member, or removing an existing board member. There is currently no one called Putin on the board. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, confirmed that it did concern a relative of Putin. “As far as I know, he is a distant relative of the president. I don’t know if they have any interaction,” Peskov told a daily conference call with journalists. Mikhail Putin is a son of the president’s cousin, Interfax news agency reported. Gazprom declined to comment on his possible position in the company. Gazprom has a vacancy on its management board after Alexander Kozlov, who was in charge of the company’s logistics and procurement, died last December aged 65. Mikhail Putin has been on the management board of insurance company Sogaz, the main insurer of Gazprom, since 2008. Information about the president’s family is closely guarded from the public eye by Putin, a former head of Russia’s FSB secret service. He keeps his two daughters, Maria and Katerina, as well as his grandchildren, away from exposure to the media. Putin has said he wants them to lead normal lives. Reuters reported in 2015, citing sources who know her, that Katerina was using the surname Tikhonova, inherited from her grandmother.

2018-03-22,"OSLO (Reuters) - Greenpeace activists have boarded a rig that was due to sail to the Arctic to drill prospects on behalf of oil firm Statoil, the environmental group said on Thursday. “We have two people on board and 10 on the water to ensure the rig does not leave port. Our activity started at 8am (0700 GMT) this morning,” Truls Gulowsen, the head of Greenpeace in Norway, told Reuters.  “We are prepared to stay as long as necessary,” he added. The action took place at the Skipavik yard on Norway’s west coast, where the drilling unit was being prepared for the upcoming work. The West Hercules rig belongs to Seadrill and is contracted to Statoil via its North Atlantic Drilling affiliate.  Statoil said last month the rig would drill two exploration wells during the upcoming summer season, with options for a further five wells, adding the West Hercules would provide for a safe and efficient operation. On Thursday, the oil company said the Greenpeace action would not affect operations. “There’s a contract for upcoming work, but we haven’t begun any operations yet in that regard. It’s from this summer and onwards,” Statoil spokesman Morten Eek said. Greenpeace and other groups in January lost a lawsuit against the Norwegian government over the continued drilling in the Arctic, arguing that the award of exploration licenses violated citizens’ right to a clean environment. The environmental groups have since appealed the verdict.

2018-03-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s largest oil producer PetroChina is ramping up its spending on oil and gas exploration, despite a sharp drop in  fourth quarter profit.  PetroChina reported 4.8 billion yuan in net profit in the fourth quarter of 2017, the worst quarterly result last year and down from 6.7 billion yuan in the third quarter, a company filing showed on Thursday. Total revenue rose to 558 billion yuan in the three months from October to December, compared with 482 billion yuan in the third quarter, the filing showed.  Huang Lili, an analyst with CITIC Securities, attributed the lower earnings to losses made in the import business of liquefied natural gas (LNG).   PetroChina made deeper losses in LNG imports in the fourth quarter when China suffered a severe gas shortage, Huang said, adding PetroChina would increase spending to lift gas output.  The company said it would spend 167.6 billion yuan to develop oil and natural gas fields in regions such as the Songliang Basin, the Tarim Basin and Chongqing amid worries about dwindling crude production and surging natural gas demand.  For the full year, PetroChina raked in a total of 2.016 trillion yuan in revenue, rebounding from a four-year low in 2016 and meeting the company’s expectation.  PetroChina recommended a cash dividend of 0.06 yuan per share for 2017.

2018-03-22,"DUESSELDORF, March 22 (Reuters) - A German court on Thursday said the energy regulator would damage the profits of gas and power grid operators by cutting the returns on their network investments too severely. The Higher Regional Court in Duesseldorf upheld complaints by 1,100 network companies against the plan in a decision which can be appealed against within one month. The return on equity for operators of gas and power grids is set by Germany’s Federal Network Agency (BnetzA), which plans to cut the return to 6.91 percent from 9.05 percent for new networks and to 5.12 percent from 7.14 percent for old grids. Grid operators including Amprion, in which RWE holds a minority stake, and 50Hertz, which owned by Belgium’s Elia and asset manager IFM Investors, filed lawsuits to have the decision reversed. The new rates, set for five years, are to kick in from 2018 for gas grids and from 2019 for power networks, with a one percentage point change cutting sales by an estimated 1 billion euros. BnetzA must weigh the potential welfare of consumers, for whom the grid fees constitute around a quarter of retail bills, against the need to be fair to operators.

2018-03-22,"* Dollar weakens broadly as trade worries compound Fed effect * China bumps up short-term rates slightly * Oil stalls at six-week high * European shares seen 0.1 to 0.4 pct lower By Marc Jones LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - The threat of a global trade war and a steady message from the Federal Reserve on U.S. interest rates pushed the dollar to its lowest in over a month on Thursday and took Europe’s main share markets into the red. It was the dollar’s third decline in four sessions and helped Britain’s pound to a six-week high before a Bank of England meeting expected to lay the foundations for another UK rate increase in coming months. The Fed raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 1.75 percent on Wednesday and flagged at least two more increases were likely this year. But it stopped short of pointing to the three that some economists had been predicting. China also nudged up its borrowing costs overnight, as Beijing braced for new tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese imports worth as much as $60 billion . Not all Fed bulls were discouraged, though. “Over the balance of the year we do think they will move to four hikes,” said JP Morgan Asset Management’s Seamus Mac Gorain, highlighting the impact of recent fiscal stimulus. “Trade tariffs are a risk, of course, but more open economies,” such as Mexico or the euro zone “could be more at risk than the U.S.” Those jitters, plus weaker-than-expected German business confidence data, caused European shares to fall 0.7 percent to a two-week low. In the currency market, the British pound to $1.4171, its highest in more than a month. British wage data published on Wednesday bolstered expectations the Bank of England would signal a May rate increase after its monetary policy meeting on Thursday. Bond yields - which move inversely to price - fell broadly. Borrowing costs on 30-year German debt hit their lowest level of the year. Two-year U.S. yields slipped to 2.304 percent from 9 1/2-year high of 2.366 percent. The 10-year yield fell below 2.85 percent, its biggest move in three weeks. “The threat of protectionism is dampening the mood in the German economy,” said Clemens Fuest, the chief of the Munich-based  Ifo institute, which published the business sentiment data. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended almost flat, A 1 percent drop in Chinese and Hong Kong stocks offset gains elsewhere. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.0 percent as investors went bargain hunting after a difficult run for the market. China hopes it can hold talks with the United States to achieve a “win-win” solution on trade, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing But worries were swirling of a more traditional kind of war. A widely read Chinese state-run newspaper said on Thursday that the country should prepare for military action over Taiwan . Beijing was infuriated after Donald Trump signed legislation last week that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa. Concern about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies also put commodity markets on guard. Oil prices gave up earlier gains to leave Brent crude futures at $69.34 per barrel and U.S. crude at $65.13 a barrel. Copper steadied at $6,817 per tonne after reaching a three-month low on Wednesday.

2018-03-22,"* Expected to appoint Helge Lund as new chairman * Former Statoil chief has extensive M&A experience * Novo Nordisk seeking deals to broaden product line-up * Faces increasing price pressure in diabetes market By Stine Jacobsen COPENHAGEN, March 22 (Reuters) - Leading diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk is expected to pick former oil boss Helge Lund as its new chairman as the company contends with increasing price pressure and seeks new acquisitions to broaden its blood products line-up. The man dubbed by some as Norway’s Mr Oil because of his extensive career in the oil and gas industry may be more of an expert in hydrocarbons than insulin, but his merger and acquisitions experience is the big draw for the Danish pharmaceuticals company. Novo is on the hunt for promising assets to boost its struggling blood products business after it lost out to French rival Sanofi in the chase for Belgian biotech company Ablynx in late January. Novo said it dropped its pursuit of Ablynx, which is developing an experimental drug for a rare blood disorder, because it could not justify the high price required to beat Sanofi’s offer. Lund is expected to be appointed at Novo’s annual general meeting on Thursday. “We are about to see Novo take on a role that we have not seen before and therefore it is important to have a chairman with experience of mergers and acquisitions,” said Sydbank analyst Soren Lontoft Hansen. Lund oversaw Kvaerner’s merger with Aker Maritime. He later became head of Statoil, where he was in charge during the oil major’s $30 billion acquisition of Norsk Hydro’s petroleum business. In his next role as chief executive of BG Group, Lund went from being the guy doing the buying to being bought as Royal Dutch Shell’s takeover of the British oil and gas company was announced only two months after he started the job. The 55-year old Norwegian, also a passionate fan of English soccer club Arsenal, will replace Goran Ando, who steps down after five years in the job. Another crucial task for the new chairman will be to retain investor trust after the company cut its long-term growth revenue outlook twice within nine months in 2016. Novo now has a long-term target of 5 percent revenue growth, a far cry from the from the double-digit growth achieved in 2015 and reflecting a more challenging diabetes market amid increased competition and price erosion. “Helge is very strong strategically and very oriented towards growth,” said former Statoil chairman Svein Rennemo, who worked closely with Lund for several years. Lund will work with a relatively new management team, including Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who started last year, and Karsten Munk Knudsen, who became finance chief last month.

2018-03-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global energy-related carbon emissions rose to a historic high of 32.5 gigatons last year, after three years of being flat, due to higher energy demand and the slowing of energy efficiency improvements, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Global energy demand rose by 2.1 percent last year to 14,050 million tonnes of oil equivalent, more than twice the previous year’s rate, boosted by strong economic growth, according to preliminary estimates from the IEA. Energy demand rose by 0.9 percent in 2016 and 0.9 percent on average over the previous five years. Over 70 percent of global energy demand growth was met by oil, natural gas and coal, while renewables accounted for almost all of the rest, the IEA said in a report. Improvements in energy efficiency slowed last year. As a result of these trends, global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions increased by 1.4 percent in 2017 to 32.5 gigatons, a record high. “The significant growth in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 tells us that current efforts to combat climate change are far from sufficient,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “For example, there has been a dramatic slowdown in the rate of improvement in global energy efficiency as policy makers have put less focus in this area.”  Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary cause of global average temperature rise, which countries are seeking to curb to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change. At talks in Germany late last year among almost 200 nations about details of a global climate accord, scientists presented data showing that world carbon emissions were set to rise 2 percent in 2017 to a new record. “Global emissions need to peak soon and decline steeply to 2020; this decline will now need to be even greater given the increase in emissions in 2017,” the IEA said in its report. The IEA said Asian countries accounted for two thirds of the global increase in emissions. China’s emissions rose by 1.7 percent to 9.1 gigatons, limited by renewables deployment and more rapid switching to gas from coal. Most major economies saw an increase in carbon emissions, though Britain, the United States, Mexico and Japan experienced declines.  The biggest drop came from the United States, where they were down 0.5 percent to 4.8 gigatons due to higher renewables deployment. The IEA said oil demand grew by 1.6 percent, or 1.5 million barrels a day, more than twice the average annual rate over the past decade, driven by the transport sector and rising petrochemical demand. Natural gas consumption grew by 3 percent - the most of all fossil fuels - with China alone accounting for nearly a third of the growth. This was largely due to abundant and relatively low-cost supplies, the IEA said. Coal demand was 1 percent higher last year, reversing declines over the previous two years, due to rises in coal-fired electricity generation, mostly in Asia. However, renewables-based electricity generation rose by 6.3 percent, due to the expansion of wind, solar and hydropower. Renewables had the highest growth rate of any energy source, meeting a quarter of world energy demand growth, the IEA said.

2018-03-22,"DETROIT, March 22 (Reuters) - The fatal accident involving an Uber self-driving car cranks up pressure on the self-driving vehicle industry to prove its software and sensors are safe in the absence of strong government standards, experts in the field said. Automakers including General Motors Co, technology companies such as Alphabet Inc and ride services providers like Uber Technologies Inc have all urged policy makers at the federal and state level not to put a heavy regulatory hand on an industry still in development. They have said their extensive testing demonstrates commitment to safety. But the Uber accident in Tempe, Arizona - the first death attributed to a self-driving car operating in autonomous mode - has given ammunition to critics of the industry concerned that the lack of clear standards allows manufacturers to test faulty, or partially developed technology on public streets. Industry executives had begun well before Sunday’s accident to defuse concerns by opening up about their testing methods - without giving away the secrets of their system designs. Public disclosure of self-driving car testing data is inconsistent and varies by state. California, for example, requires manufacturers to report instances when an autonomous vehicle system disengages. Arizona does not. “There is no question whatsoever that regulations are coming,” said Doug Mehl, a partner at A.T. Kearney’s automotive practice, based in Detroit. “But right now (automakers), software developers and service providers have an opportunity to shape what those regulations are going to look like.” Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving car unit, for example, has underscored in a report that its autonomous vehicles have now logged 5 million miles in real-world testing, and billions more in computer simulations. GM’s Cruise Automation unit has highlighted its decision to teach its driving system to navigate San Francisco’s congested streets. Still, Amnon Shashua, head of Intel Corp’s Mobileye vision systems unit, said the industry must do more. He has called for the self-driving vehicle industry to develop “provable safety assurances”. “We need to prove that these vehicles are much, much safer than humans,” Shashua told Reuters. “How do you go and guarantee that you have a technology that the probability of a fatality per one hour of driving is 1,000 times better than a human? Nobody talks about that because nobody knows what to do.” Most self-driving vehicles are equipped with radar sensors and lidar sensors, which use lasers to detect obstacles around the vehicle. There are no federal standards yet specifying how such systems should work. Congress and federal regulators are still debating how tightly to regulate such systems. “There should be vision tests for the sensors they are using, both static and dynamic to see how well they work,” said Missy Cummings, a Duke University mechanical engineering professor. The short video recorded by cameras in the Uber vehicle that struck pedestrian Elaine Herzberg while crossing a street in Tempe, Arizona late Sunday raises questions about whether the Uber system responded better than a human driver, experts said on Wednesday. Uber has hired human operators to sit in the driver’s seats of its autonomous vehicles to intervene if necessary. The video released by Tempe police shows a human operator behind the wheel of the Uber vehicle before the impact. The operator is seen looking down, away from the street, in the seconds before the vehicle struck Herzberg. She was pushing a bicycle across the street from left lane into the right lane where the Uber vehicle was driving. “It seems it should have detected her,” Daniel Sperling, director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at University of California Davis told Reuters in an email after viewing the video. “It seems unlikely that a human driver would have done better. We do want AVs to do better than us and the potential exists.” Americans were wary of autonomous vehicle technology even before Sunday’s fatality. According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released in late January, two-thirds of Americans are uncomfortable about the idea of riding in self-driving cars. “The greater risk for the industry is that if people feel it is unsafe, or the testing is unsafe, you’ll see a real backlash against this technology,” Matthew Johnson-Roberson, co-director of the University of Michigan Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles.

2018-03-22,"* Eyes gas storage as future product to trade * Limited supply, lack of open access to pipeline may curb prospects * Storage shortage remains a hurdle - analyst By Chen Aizhu CHONGQING, China, March 22 (Reuters) - China’s Chongqing gas exchange is tapping state producers to allocate supplies to boost liquidity ahead of a planned launch by mid-year, while setting its sights on the country’s underground gas storage as a future trading product. The exchange, China’s latest attempt to develop a traded gas market, is aiming to launch its first contract of pipeline gas by the middle of the year, a timeline slightly behind expectations, exchange officials told Reuters this week. The request for providing liquidity to the exchange was made at a meeting in early March hosted by the National Development & Reform Commission, the main government umbrella for establishing the Chongqing exchange, executives said. “All is set ready (for the launch)...we’ve completed the contract design, the trading rules and cleared regulatory approval,” said Song Dacai, chairman of the exchange’s supervisory committee. He said over 500 participants have been approved for trading. “We’re communicating with national oil companies over supply allocations they are able to put on the exchange,” said Song. The planned launch comes after the world’s No.3 gas consumer experienced a serious supply crunch over the past winter. Suppliers struggled to keep homes warm and factories running amid a massive government-led gasification push. State-run producers, namely PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC, are expected to make nominations, including annual, monthly and weekly volumes. The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. However, the allocations could be a challenge in a tight market, as companies will need to first meet existing demand before they can allocate excess supplies to the new exchange, analysts said. “Beijing will need to allow open access to the state- controlled pipelines and storage facilities to generate active trade on the exchange,” said Chen Zhu, managing director with consultancy SIA Energy. The Shanghai Oil and Gas Exchange, a competitor launched in 2015, failed to attract much liquidity during most of its first few years of trade because of a lack of mechanism for producers to provide volumes to trade. Also, more storage is needed. China’s current gas storage working capacity is barely able to supply 4 percent of its total consumption, way below the international average of 10-12 percent.

2018-03-22,"(Adds detail, shares, analyst) MILAN, March 22 (Reuters) - Italian power grid company Terna on Thursday pledged richer shareholder returns and higher investments over the next five years, but its forecast for 2018 core earnings fell short of some investors’ expectations, sending its shares lower. Terna, one of Europe’s biggest power grid players, makes most of its money from returns set by the regulator designed to improve its domestic transmission business. The firm, controlled by state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, plans to invest 5.3 billion euros ($6.5 billion) over the period to 2022, up 30 percent on the previous plan. Most of that will go to resolve congestion on the grid and improve the quality of the service. The boom in green energy with its intermittent output and the fall in traditional, more centralised thermal production has prompted Terna - like other European transmission operators - to invest more in digital technology and storage systems. “The objective is the complete integration of renewables and the digitization of infrastructure for greater security and resilience, which will benefit the entire system,” Chief Executive Luigi Ferraris said in a statement. Rome-based Terna is investing to improve its domestic transmission business, but is also eying opportunities to boost profits outside Italy through acquisitions. Some 300 million euros of its capital expenditure is meant for international activities. The group said it would grow dividends by 6 percent on average over the next three years and hand out 75 percent of net profits in the following two years. Terna, which counts the State Grid of China as one of its largest shareholders, said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) would reach around 1.9 billion euros in 2022 from 1.61 billion euros expected this year. Non-regulated business will contribute around 350 million euros to core earnings over the period, it said. The stock was down 2.2 percent at 4.64 euros, underperforming a 0.9 percent fall in Milan’s blue-chip index . A Milan-based analyst said the business plan targets were above his estimates but 2018 guidance was disappointing. For last year, the power grid firm reported an 8.7 percent rise in net profit and proposed a dividend payout of 22 cents per share, up from 0.206 euros the previous year. $1 = 0.8093 euros

2018-03-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s HNA Group has paid a more than 3 billion yuan (335.5 million pounds) jet fuel bill, ending months of contentious discussions between the embattled conglomerate and a state-run aviation fuel firm, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Facing a cash crunch following $50 billion in acquisitions,  the aviation-to-financial services group settled the bill last week with a cash transfer to China National Aviation Fuel Group Ltd (CNAF), said one of the sources.      In an email to Reuters, an HNA Group spokesman said: “Hainan Airlines Holdings Co. Ltd has always cherished its sound cooperative relationship with China National Aviation Fuel Group Limited and all business is being carried out as usual.” A CNAF spokesman said he could not confirm the arrangements.  HNA’s outstanding balance with CNAF, China’s near-monopoly marketer and distributor of aviation fuel, had swelled significantly over the previous six months, Reuters reported last month. In recent weeks, HNA had offered various solutions to settle the jet fuel bill, including the transfer of stakes in joint venture firms and real estate assets, said two sources with knowledge of the discussions.  “The bill was sorted out after CNAF’s communications with the senior management of HNA Group,” one of the sources said. The fuel supplier normally gives customers one month credit period and the over 3 billion yuan bill was the backlog that went beyond due dates, the person added.    The best solution for CNAF was cash, the person said, since the transfer of stakes HNA offered would take much longer to materialise.    HNA has offloaded more than $6 billion in prime real estate in Australia, New York and Hong Kong, while selling shares in Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Park Hotels & Resorts (PK.N), and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc (HGV.N). In Hainan, HNA also is searching for “strategic partners” for its wide portfolio of investments, including in its 100 billion yuan Haikou central business district development. Earlier this month, HNA Infrastructure Investment Group (600515.SS) said it would sell a Hainan-based property company and logistics unit to Sunac China (1918.HK), a real estate developer, for 1.9 billion yuan.

2018-03-22,"(Reuters) - British oil rig builder Lamprell (LAM.L) forecast a bigger drop in full-year revenue on Thursday, partly due to delays in major project awards, sending its shares down 9 percent. The United Arab Emirates-based company said it expects 2018 revenue of $225-$300 million, implying a drop of about 30 percent at the midpoint of the range from the $370.4 million it reported for 2017. In September, Lamprell forecast a 10 percent drop in revenue for 2018. Lamprell, which called 2017 the “toughest year yet”, said it expects major project awards to be pushed out to late 2018 and reiterated its expectation to grow revenue only in 2019. The company, however, said its bid pipeline increased to $3.6 billion from $2.5 billion at the end of 2016, as its expansion into renewable energy starts to pay off. The company has been expanding into renewable energy to bolster its business as it struggles with oil explorers cutting spending and cancelling contracts to cope with weak oil prices. Lamprell, which runs three rig-building yards in the UAE, reported loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $70.5 million for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $30.6 million, a year earlier. The company reported total losses on its East Anglia One (EA1) offshore windfarm project of about $80 million because of mounting costs.

2018-03-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s crude oil futures, to be launched on Monday, will be a major step in Beijing’s years-long push to win greater sway over oil pricing, but for western traders it will likely bring frustration as well as opportunity. Shanghai Crude aims to rival the world’s two crude benchmarks, luring overseas traders with the promise of a deep pool of liquidity and the chance for arbitrage between Asian, U.S. and European markets. However, the contract will also come with quirks that traders used to London’s Brent or U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) may find less appealing, including shorter business hours, unique Chinese trading habits and extended holiday breaks. Yuan-denominated trading and a blend of new rules and regulatory burdens will also likely hamper initial take-up on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), executives at a dozen banks and brokers and experts involved in the launch told Reuters.  “The rules around trading methodology will be unfamiliar for western houses,” said John Browning, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based futures broker Bands Financial Ltd, which is an approved overseas intermediary for the INE. “They’ll have to get to grips with a different set of trading parameters, including initial margin calculation, rolling between months, order cancellations ratios, etc. It’s all very different.”  So far, China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts, including the country’s oil majors and about 150 brokerages. Ten foreign intermediaries have registered, including J.P.Morgan, Bands Financial, Straits Financial Services and other Hong Kong based affiliates of domestic brokerages. Last-minute changes are still being made to entice overseas users. On Tuesday, the government said it would waive income taxes for foreign investors for the first three years. Specific issues for traders include Shanghai’s shorter trading hours, split into three slots, with the afternoon session ending at 3:00 p.m. local time (0700 GMT), just before London ramps up.  Although the exchange will have an overnight trading session to match late European and early U.S. trading, it will close for more than six hours before trade resumes in Beijing. This could mean the contract risks having to play catch-up each morning to the moods and swings of Europe and America, rather than setting its own price, several senior futures traders said. Chinese trading habits may also be a shock to foreign users, they said. Chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months, but instead pick specific months in which they deal, due to a different cost structure. That could complicate efforts to trade spreads between Brent, WTI and Shanghai. These and other factors mean the contract may have a “hard time” building correlations with Brent and WTI that would make arbitrage possible, said Albert Helmig, chief executive of financial consultancy Grey House and a former vice chairman of NYMEX. “It’s a China market, with Chinese characteristics,” said Helmig. Still, China offers the potential for a deep, liquid market, buoyed by an explosion of interest from mom-and-pop investors that has supported its vast commodities derivative markets from apples to iron ore in Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Dalian. In 2017, the total traded value of ShFE’s steel derivatives contracts was $4.4 trillion from domestic investors. This compares with global turnover of more than $10 trillion in international oil futures, the world’s biggest commodity market. Previous attempts at an Asia benchmark have foundered. Contracts set up by the Dubai Mercantile Exchange a decade ago have not matched Brent or WTI, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE.N) and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group (CME.O).

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, erasing earlier gains of 0.7 pct. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.0 percent. European shares are expected to fall, with spread-betters looking to a lower opening of 0.4 percent in Germany’s Dax , 0.2 percent in Britain’s FTSE and 0.1 percent in France’s Cac. Wall Street stock indexes ended the day lower, with the S&P 500 losing 0.18 percent despite a boost from sharp gains in energy shares on rising oil prices. The Nasdaq dropped 0.26 percent with Apple falling below its 100-day average even as Facebook bounced back after two days of steep losses amid a controversy over outside exploitation of its users’ data. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast two more hikes for 2018, based on board members’ median projection. Given that some investors had expected it to project three more rate hikes, the guidance was perceived as less hawkish than anticipated, a positive factor for risk assets in general. But otherwise the Fed was upbeat on the economy, revising up rate projections for 2019 and 2020 and raising the estimated longer-term “neutral” interest rate a touch, suggesting the current tightening cycle could last for longer than previously thought. “They also forecast three hikes next year and two more in 2020 and clearly revised up the growth forecast as well,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “So the picture looks different when you look at longer-term projections. That explains the complicated reaction by markets. The prospects of continued rate hikes may cap shares,” he added. The yield on two-year U.S. notes slipped back to 2.304 percent from 9 1/2-year high of 2.366 percent hit on Wednesday while the 10-year yield dipped to 2.874 percent after an initial spike to 2.936 percent. That pushed the U.S. dollar lower in the currency market, with the dollar index  testing this month’s low after posting its biggest fall in two months on Wednesday. The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.2363, extending its recovery from a near three-week low of $1.2240 touched earlier in the week. The dollar shed up to 0.4 percent to 105.58 yen, turning down on the week to edge closer to the 16-month low of 105.24 hit on March 2. It last stood at 105.91 yen. The British pound hit a 1 1/2-month high of $1.4171, building on Wednesday’s one-percent gains. Strong British wage data published on Wednesday cemented expectations that the Bank of England was likely to signal a May rate hike after its monetary policy meeting later in the day. Following the Fed’s move, the People’s Bank of China gingerly raised the seven-day reverse repo rate, a key short-term interest rate, by 5 basis points, to prevent U.S.-China rate differential from getting too wide. The move was the PBOC’s first major policy decision under new Governor Yi Gang, who was appointed by parliament on Monday. With the Fed meeting over, investors are watching Trump, who is due to sign a memo on imposing tariffs on Chinese imports at 1630 GMT on Thursday. Concerns about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies has put many investors on guard. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the tariffs would target China’s high-technology sector and could also include restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States. Investors worry such a move could trigger countermeasures by China, possibly causing a vicious cycle of escalating retaliation. Shares on China’s exchanges were lower, the with Shanghai Composite Index slipping as much as 1.2 percent to two-week lows. “China’s equity market is relatively domestic. We estimate that on average more than 80 percent of revenues are generated in China while only a marginal share comes from the U.S. Still, there would be first-order casualties if trade tensions escalated. In the front line would be firms with significant exposure to the U.S., mostly in the tech and consumer sectors,” wrote analysts at Societe Generale. In the energy market, oil prices held firm, buoyed by a surprise decline in U.S. crude inventories as well as ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC, although a relentless rise in U.S. oil output threatens to undermine efforts to tighten the market. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose to as high as $65.74 per barrel, not far from its January peak of $66.66, having gained almost five percent so far this week. It last stood almost flat at $65.13. In contrast, copper fell to three-month low of $6,702 per tonne the previous day before bouncing back to $6,817.

2018-03-22,"(Adds quote, details on settlement) By Chen Aizhu and Matthew Miller BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - China’s HNA Group has paid a more than 3 billion yuan ($474.5 million) jet fuel bill, ending months of contentious discussions between the embattled aviation-to-financial services conglomerate and a state-run aviation fuel company, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Facing a cash crunch following $50 billion in acquisitions, HNA settled the bill last week with a cash transfer to China National Aviation Fuel Group Ltd (CNAF), said one of the sources. HNA Group was not available for comment. A CNAF spokesman said he could not confirm the arrangements. HNA’s outstanding balance with CNAF, China’s near-monopoly marketer and distributor of aviation fuel, had swelled significantly over the previous six month, Reuters reported last month. In recent weeks, HNA had offered various solutions to settle the jet fuel bill, including the transfer of stakes in joint venture firms and real estate assets. “The bill was sorted out after CNAF’s communications with the senior management of HNA Group,” the person said. The fuel supplier normally gives customers one month credit period and the over 3 billion yuan bill was the backlogs that went beyond due dates, the person added. The best solution for CNAF was cash, the person said, since the transfer of stakes HNA offered would take much longer to materialise. HNA has off-loaded more than $6 billion in prime real estate in Australia, New York and Hong Kong, while selling shares in Deutsche Bank, Park Hotels & Resorts, and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. In Hainan, HNA also is searching for “strategic partners” for its wide portfolio of investments, including in its 100 billion yuan Haikou central business district development. Earlier this month, HNA Infrastructure Investment Group (600515.SS) said it would sell a Hainan-based property company and logistics unit to Sunac China, a real estate developer, for 1.9 billion yuan.

2018-03-22,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell PERTH, March 22 (Reuters) - A comfortable consensus is emerging in the iron ore market that China’s vast steel industry has undergone a structural change that has resulted in quality iron ore gaining a permanent advantage over lower grades. Certainly the common theme of presentations at this week’s Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast Conference in Perth was that the current premium of ore with a higher iron content is now a defining characteristic of China’s market. This shift matters as China buys about two-thirds of global seaborne iron ore, with the vast majority of the annual demand of more than 1 billion tonnes coming from Australia and Brazil, with South Africa a distant third. The industry benchmark is ore with an iron content of 62 percent, a quality level that is met by most Brazilian ore, as well as by top Australian miner Rio Tinto. BHP Billiton, Australia’s second-ranked producer, comes close to this level with its output, but third-ranked Fortescue Metals Group delivers a grade closer to the 58 percent level. China’s switch to using higher-grade iron ore in its blast furnaces is seemingly built around three main factors. The first is the need to reduce air pollution, which encourages steel mills to use the higher grade ores as they require less coking coal in order to be turned into pig iron and then crude steel. Using high-grade iron ore with a 65 percent iron content consumes about 12 percent less coking coal than using 58 percent iron ore. The second is the ongoing government-mandated rationalisation of the steel industry, with capacity closures of around a total 110 million tonnes being achieved in 2016 and 2017. Up to 40 million tonnes more was slated to be shut down this year. This policy is aimed at eliminating overcapacity and clearing out older, less-efficient producers, thereby boosting the profitability of the remaining steel mills. The policy has contributed to the third factor driving the switch to higher grade ore, namely that mills are enjoying strong profit margins. From being loss-making for several years up to 2016, China’s steel producers have turned strongly profitable in recent months, with the margin on benchmark steel rebar around $117 a tonne, according to S&P Global Platts data. With the steel futures in Shanghai currently trading around the equivalent of $575, it’s clear that steel makers can afford to use the higher-cost iron ore as they are still incentivised to maximise output to capture the available profit. If the current market consensus is correct that China’s shift to higher grade iron ore is structural, it becomes apparent that these three factors will also have to be structural. It’s probably fair to say that the first two - the focus on reducing pollution and the rationalisation of capacity - appear to be ongoing policies and there are no signs that they will be relaxed or changed in any shape. But the most important factor is the profitability of steel mills, and this is far from guaranteed. The return to profitability was driven by stimulus spending on infrastructure and a recovery in real estate investment, and both of these influences may be waning somewhat. This isn’t to suggest a sharp correction is looming in Chinese steel demand and prices, but at the same time constructing a case for sustaining the current levels of robust profits is quite challenging. Steel is a cyclical business and is likely to remain so, meaning that at some point China’s producers will once again face a margin squeeze. When that happens the incentive switches to use the lowest cost inputs and accept a reduction in volumes from the blast furnace. This could well put lower grade iron ore back in play, and shrink the current wide margins. The spot price in China of 62 percent iron ore .IO62-CNO=MB, as assessed by Metal Bulletin, was at $67.25 a tonne on Wednesday. The assessment for the 58 percent grade .IO58-CNO=MB was $39.06 a tonne. This makes the lower grade ore about 42 percent cheaper, and this has widened from the 29 percent gap that prevailed at the end of 2016. The current gap is clearly seen by many in the industry as the new normal, and it’s likely to persist as long as China’s steel mills enjoy the type of profits they are getting currently. But it may be a touch too soon to say that this is a sustained structural change that cannot be reversed if market circumstances change, as they inevitably will.

2018-03-22,"(Repeats MARCH 21 story. No change to text.) By John Kemp LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Uber has suspended road tests of self-driving vehicles after the first pedestrian was killed by one of its vehicles operating under autonomous computer control. Proponents of self-driving vehicles claim they would be safer, as well as more energy efficient, but those safety claims will now come under heightened scrutiny. In theory, self-driving vehicles should eliminate several major driver-related causes of road traffic accidents, including excessive speed, intoxication and inattention. But there are concerns about how self-driving vehicles will interact with unpredictable human drivers and pedestrians as well as unmapped hazards such as temporary road obstructions. There are also fears about how self-driving vehicles would cope with hacking or widespread disruption of their communications systems (“Too much sun could wreak havoc on driverless cars”, Bloomberg, March 16). The accident investigation into Sunday’s crash will mark an important test of the technology but also of the ability of politicians, regulators and the media to think about risk in an intelligent way. All transportation is fraught with risk and road transport is particularly dangerous even with a human behind the wheel (“Self-driving Uber cars kills Arizona woman crossing street”, Reuters, March 20). Every year, there are more than 6 million reported crashes involving motor vehicles in the United States, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (“Motor vehicle safety data”, BTS, 2017). In 2016, almost 40,000 people were killed in transport-related accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (“U.S. transportation fatalities 2015-2016”, NTSB, 2017). Of those, more than 95 percent were killed in accidents involving motor vehicles (37,461), dwarfing the number killed on the railroads (733), marine transport (730), aviation (412) and pipelines (16). Road traffic fatalities included nearly 6,000 pedestrians, over 5,000 motorcyclists and 840 pedal-cyclists (“Fatal motor vehicle crashes overview”, U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017). Road traffic crashes are the number one cause of death for young people between the ages of 8 and 24, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. And they are one of the top two causes of accidental death for people in all age groups (“Motor vehicle traffic crashes as a leading cause of death in the United States”, NHTSA, 2018). In a worrying trend, U.S. roads appear to have become more dangerous in the last few years, reversing the downtrend over the previous quarter of a century. The number of crashes, injuries and fatalities has been growing faster than highway traffic volumes since around 2015. Road deaths rose to 1.18 per 100 million miles driven in 2016 up from 1.15 in 2015 and a recent low of 1.08 in 2014. The trend among pedestrians has been particularly worrying, with fatalities surging by 9 percent in 2016 to the highest level since 1990. Many road accidents have been attributed in whole or part to driver misbehaviour. Alcohol was involved in more than 10,000 fatalities in 2016. Speed in more than 10,000. And distraction in more than 3,000. Driving is already relatively dangerous in the United States, so the question is whether self-driving vehicles increase or reduce the existing risks, not whether they can eliminate risk altogether. So far, self-driving vehicles have completed fewer than 10 million miles of on-highway tests (“Self-driving cars under scrutiny after pedestrian death”, Financial Times, March 19). Supporters and critics have long acknowledged the inevitability of a self-driving vehicle being involved in a serious accident, and eventually being the cause of a fatality. Some had hoped self-driving vehicles would log 100 million miles or more before the first fatal accident to prove they are safer. But that shows a misunderstanding of how statistics work, since the first fatal accident is as likely to occur on the first mile as on the 100-millionth mile (assuming the safety level remains constant). Until self-driving vehicles are tested on actual roads for tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of miles it will not be possible to evaluate their safety relative to human-operated vehicles. The advent of self-driving vehicles poses complicated questions about safety but is no different from any other new technology. Every new technology is initially beset by accidents, and that has been particularly true in transportation, where early steam engines, automobiles and aircraft were all initially accident-prone. All federal safety regulation in the United States stems originally from the response to the problem of exploding steam boilers in the nineteenth century (“Bursting boilers and the federal power”, Burke, 1966). The advent of high-pressure steam engines on riverboats prompted a spate of explosions killing crew, passengers, and unlucky bystanders. Between 1818 and 1824, 47 lives were lost in 15 boiler explosions on steamboats. Between 1825 and 1830 there were 42 explosions killing 273 people. One particularly serious explosion aboard the steamboat “Helen McGregor” near Memphis reportedly killed 50-60 people. “The many distressing accidents which have of late occurred in that portion of our navigation carried on by the use of steam power deserve the immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authorities of the country,” President Andrew Jackson wrote in his State of the Union message to Congress in 1833. “The fact that the number of those fatal disasters is constantly increasing, notwithstanding the great improvements which are everywhere made in the machinery employed and in the rapid advances which have made in that branch of science, shows very clearly that they are in a great degree the result of criminal negligence.” “That these evils may be greatly lessened, if not substantially removed, by means of precautionary and penal legislation seems to be highly probable.” The eventual response after many years of delay was a system of safety regulation including boiler standards and inspections. The arrival of the internal combustion engine and the automobile generated a similar surge of accidents among drivers and pedestrians and a legal and regulatory response. Early aircraft, too, were far more prone to mechanical failure or pilot error than has been the case in recent years. But no one would now suggest steam boilers, automobiles or aircraft are simply too dangerous to be practical - any more than in future people will think self-driving vehicles are too dangerous. In every case of new technology, safety lessons have been learned through a painful process of trial and error that has unfortunately cost lives. Self-driving vehicles will be no different. The challenge is to introduce sensible and balanced safety regulations while encouraging continued development of a technology that has potential to save lives and bring a range of other benefits. That requires a very transparent approach from the technology companies and a calm and reasoned response from politicians, regulators and journalists.

2018-03-22,"(Reuters) - British oil rig builder Lamprell (LAM.L) forecast a bigger drop in full-year revenue on Thursday, partly due to delays in major project awards, sending its shares down 9 percent. The United Arab Emirates-based company said it expects 2018 revenue of $225-$300 million, implying a drop of about 30 percent at the midpoint of the range from the $370.4 million it reported for 2017. In September, Lamprell forecast a 10 percent drop in revenue for 2018. Lamprell, which called 2017 the “toughest year yet”, said it expects major project awards to be pushed out to late 2018 and reiterated its expectation to grow revenue only in 2019. The company, however, said its bid pipeline increased to $3.6 billion from $2.5 billion at the end of 2016, as its expansion into renewable energy starts to pay off. The company has been expanding into renewable energy to bolster its business as it struggles with oil explorers cutting spending and cancelling contracts to cope with weak oil prices. Lamprell, which runs three rig-building yards in the UAE, reported loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $70.5 million for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $30.6 million, a year earlier. The company reported total losses on its East Anglia One (EA1) offshore windfarm project of about $80 million because of mounting costs. Lamprell’s shares fell as much as 8.9 percent to 64.1 pence at 0816 GMT.

2018-03-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s crude oil futures, to be launched on Monday, will be a major step in Beijing’s years-long push to win greater sway over oil pricing, but for western traders it will likely bring frustration as well as opportunity. Shanghai Crude aims to rival the world’s two crude benchmarks, luring overseas traders with the promise of a deep pool of liquidity and the chance for arbitrage between Asian, U.S. and European markets. However, the contract will also come with quirks that traders used to London’s Brent or U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) may find less appealing, including shorter business hours, unique Chinese trading habits and extended holiday breaks. Yuan-denominated trading and a blend of new rules and regulatory burdens will also likely hamper initial take-up on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), executives at a dozen banks and brokers and experts involved in the launch told Reuters.  “The rules around trading methodology will be unfamiliar for western houses,” said John Browning, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based futures broker Bands Financial Ltd, which is an approved overseas intermediary for the INE. “They’ll have to get to grips with a different set of trading parameters, including initial margin calculation, rolling between months, order cancellations ratios, etc. It’s all very different.”  So far, China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts, including the country’s oil majors and about 150 brokerages. Ten foreign intermediaries have registered, including J.P.Morgan, Bands Financial, Straits Financial Services and other Hong Kong based affiliates of domestic brokerages. Last-minute changes are still being made to entice overseas users. On Tuesday, the government said it would waive income taxes for foreign investors for the first three years. Specific issues for traders include Shanghai’s shorter trading hours, split into three slots, with the afternoon session ending at 3:00 p.m. local time (0700 GMT), just before London ramps up.  Although the exchange will have an overnight trading session to match late European and early U.S. trading, it will close for more than six hours before trade resumes in Beijing. This could mean the contract risks having to play catch-up each morning to the moods and swings of Europe and America, rather than setting its own price, several senior futures traders said. Chinese trading habits may also be a shock to foreign users, they said. Chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months, but instead pick specific months in which they deal, due to a different cost structure. That could complicate efforts to trade spreads between Brent, WTI and Shanghai. These and other factors mean the contract may have a “hard time” building correlations with Brent and WTI that would make arbitrage possible, said Albert Helmig, chief executive of financial consultancy Grey House and a former vice chairman of NYMEX. “It’s a China market, with Chinese characteristics,” said Helmig. Still, China offers the potential for a deep, liquid market, buoyed by an explosion of interest from mom-and-pop investors that has supported its vast commodities derivative markets from apples to iron ore in Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Dalian. In 2017, the total traded value of ShFE’s steel derivatives contracts was $4.4 trillion from domestic investors. This compares with global turnover of more than $10 trillion in international oil futures, the world’s biggest commodity market. Previous attempts at an Asia benchmark have foundered. Contracts set up by the Dubai Mercantile Exchange a decade ago have not matched Brent or WTI, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE.N) and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group (CME.O).     China hopes it can do better: with state-controlled oil majors like PetroChina (601857.SS) and Sinopec (600028.SS) expected to provide liquidity, analysts said the contract has a chance of succeeding even if it faces short-term caution. “Launching a new exchange is enormously complex, so if the initial uptake for the contract isn’t that strong, it isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” said Bands’ Browning.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, erasing earlier gains of 0.7 pct. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.0 percent. European shares are expected to fall, with spread-betters looking to a lower opening of 0.4 percent in Germany’s Dax , 0.2 percent in Britain’s FTSE and 0.1 percent in France’s Cac. Wall Street stock indexes ended the day lower, with the S&P 500 losing 0.18 percent despite a boost from sharp gains in energy shares on rising oil prices. The Nasdaq dropped 0.26 percent with Apple falling below its 100-day average even as Facebook bounced back after two days of steep losses amid a controversy over outside exploitation of its users’ data. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast two more hikes for 2018, based on board members’ median projection. Given that some investors had expected it to project three more rate hikes, the guidance was perceived as less hawkish than anticipated, a positive factor for risk assets in general. But otherwise the Fed was upbeat on the economy, revising up rate projections for 2019 and 2020 and raising the estimated longer-term “neutral” interest rate a touch, suggesting the current tightening cycle could last for longer than previously thought. “They also forecast three hikes next year and two more in 2020 and clearly revised up the growth forecast as well,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “So the picture looks different when you look at longer-term projections. That explains the complicated reaction by markets. The prospects of continued rate hikes may cap shares,” he added. The yield on two-year U.S. notes slipped back to 2.304 percent from 9 1/2-year high of 2.366 percent hit on Wednesday while the 10-year yield dipped to 2.874 percent after an initial spike to 2.936 percent. That pushed the U.S. dollar lower in the currency market, with the dollar index  testing this month’s low after posting its biggest fall in two months on Wednesday. The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.2363, extending its recovery from a near three-week low of $1.2240 touched earlier in the week. The dollar shed up to 0.4 percent to 105.58 yen, turning down on the week to edge closer to the 16-month low of 105.24 hit on March 2. It last stood at 105.91 yen. The British pound hit a 1 1/2-month high of $1.4171, building on Wednesday’s one-percent gains. Strong British wage data published on Wednesday cemented expectations that the Bank of England was likely to signal a May rate hike after its monetary policy meeting later in the day. Following the Fed’s move, the People’s Bank of China gingerly raised the seven-day reverse repo rate, a key short-term interest rate, by 5 basis points, to prevent U.S.-China rate differential from getting too wide. The move was the PBOC’s first major policy decision under new Governor Yi Gang, who was appointed by parliament on Monday. With the Fed meeting over, investors are watching Trump, who is due to sign a memo on imposing tariffs on Chinese imports at 1630 GMT on Thursday. Concerns about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies has put many investors on guard. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the tariffs would target China’s high-technology sector and could also include restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States. Investors worry such a move could trigger countermeasures by China, possibly causing a vicious cycle of escalating retaliation. Shares on China’s exchanges were lower, the with Shanghai Composite Index slipping as much as 1.2 percent to two-week lows. “China’s equity market is relatively domestic. We estimate that on average more than 80 percent of revenues are generated in China while only a marginal share comes from the U.S. Still, there would be first-order casualties if trade tensions escalated. In the front line would be firms with significant exposure to the U.S., mostly in the tech and consumer sectors,” wrote analysts at Societe Generale. In the energy market, oil prices held firm, buoyed by a surprise decline in U.S. crude inventories as well as ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC, although a relentless rise in U.S. oil output threatens to undermine efforts to tighten the market. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose to as high as $65.74 per barrel, not far from its January peak of $66.66, having gained almost five percent so far this week. It last stood almost flat at $65.13. In contrast, copper fell to three-month low of $6,702 per tonne the previous day before bouncing back to $6,817.

2018-03-22,"(Adds quote, details on settlement) By Chen Aizhu and Matthew Miller BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - China’s HNA Group has paid a more than 3 billion yuan ($474.5 million) jet fuel bill, ending months of contentious discussions between the embattled aviation-to-financial services conglomerate and a state-run aviation fuel company, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Facing a cash crunch following $50 billion in acquisitions, HNA settled the bill last week with a cash transfer to China National Aviation Fuel Group Ltd (CNAF), said one of the sources. HNA Group was not available for comment. A CNAF spokesman said he could not confirm the arrangements. HNA’s outstanding balance with CNAF, China’s near-monopoly marketer and distributor of aviation fuel, had swelled significantly over the previous six month, Reuters reported last month. In recent weeks, HNA had offered various solutions to settle the jet fuel bill, including the transfer of stakes in joint venture firms and real estate assets. “The bill was sorted out after CNAF’s communications with the senior management of HNA Group,” the person said. The fuel supplier normally gives customers one month credit period and the over 3 billion yuan bill was the backlogs that went beyond due dates, the person added. The best solution for CNAF was cash, the person said, since the transfer of stakes HNA offered would take much longer to materialise. HNA has off-loaded more than $6 billion in prime real estate in Australia, New York and Hong Kong, while selling shares in Deutsche Bank, Park Hotels & Resorts, and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. In Hainan, HNA also is searching for “strategic partners” for its wide portfolio of investments, including in its 100 billion yuan Haikou central business district development.

2018-03-22,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell PERTH, March 22 (Reuters) - A comfortable consensus is emerging in the iron ore market that China’s vast steel industry has undergone a structural change that has resulted in quality iron ore gaining a permanent advantage over lower grades. Certainly the common theme of presentations at this week’s Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast Conference in Perth was that the current premium of ore with a higher iron content is now a defining characteristic of China’s market. This shift matters as China buys about two-thirds of global seaborne iron ore, with the vast majority of the annual demand of more than 1 billion tonnes coming from Australia and Brazil, with South Africa a distant third. The industry benchmark is ore with an iron content of 62 percent, a quality level that is met by most Brazilian ore, as well as by top Australian miner Rio Tinto. BHP Billiton, Australia’s second-ranked producer, comes close to this level with its output, but third-ranked Fortescue Metals Group delivers a grade closer to the 58 percent level. China’s switch to using higher-grade iron ore in its blast furnaces is seemingly built around three main factors. The first is the need to reduce air pollution, which encourages steel mills to use the higher grade ores as they require less coking coal in order to be turned into pig iron and then crude steel. Using high-grade iron ore with a 65 percent iron content consumes about 12 percent less coking coal than using 58 percent iron ore. The second is the ongoing government-mandated rationalisation of the steel industry, with capacity closures of around a total 110 million tonnes being achieved in 2016 and 2017. Up to 40 million tonnes more was slated to be shut down this year. This policy is aimed at eliminating overcapacity and clearing out older, less-efficient producers, thereby boosting the profitability of the remaining steel mills. The policy has contributed to the third factor driving the switch to higher grade ore, namely that mills are enjoying strong profit margins. From being loss-making for several years up to 2016, China’s steel producers have turned strongly profitable in recent months, with the margin on benchmark steel rebar around $117 a tonne, according to S&P Global Platts data. With the steel futures in Shanghai currently trading around the equivalent of $575, it’s clear that steel makers can afford to use the higher-cost iron ore as they are still incentivised to maximise output to capture the available profit. If the current market consensus is correct that China’s shift to higher grade iron ore is structural, it becomes apparent that these three factors will also have to be structural. It’s probably fair to say that the first two - the focus on reducing pollution and the rationalisation of capacity - appear to be ongoing policies and there are no signs that they will be relaxed or changed in any shape. But the most important factor is the profitability of steel mills, and this is far from guaranteed. The return to profitability was driven by stimulus spending on infrastructure and a recovery in real estate investment, and both of these influences may be waning somewhat. This isn’t to suggest a sharp correction is looming in Chinese steel demand and prices, but at the same time constructing a case for sustaining the current levels of robust profits is quite challenging. Steel is a cyclical business and is likely to remain so, meaning that at some point China’s producers will once again face a margin squeeze. When that happens the incentive switches to use the lowest cost inputs and accept a reduction in volumes from the blast furnace. This could well put lower grade iron ore back in play, and shrink the current wide margins. The spot price in China of 62 percent iron ore .IO62-CNO=MB, as assessed by Metal Bulletin, was at $67.25 a tonne on Wednesday. The assessment for the 58 percent grade .IO58-CNO=MB was $39.06 a tonne. This makes the lower grade ore about 42 percent cheaper, and this has widened from the 29 percent gap that prevailed at the end of 2016. The current gap is clearly seen by many in the industry as the new normal, and it’s likely to persist as long as China’s steel mills enjoy the type of profits they are getting currently. But it may be a touch too soon to say that this is a sustained structural change that cannot be reversed if market circumstances change, as they inevitably will.

Worries about a potential trade war between China and the United States kept gains in Asian shares in check. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent, with South Korea’s Kospi hitting six-week high, while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.2 percent in early trade. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast two more hikes for 2018 in its first policy meeting under new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Given some investors had expected it to project three more rate hikes, the guidance was perceived by some as less hawkish than anticipated, a positive factor for risk assets in general, though analysts noted the Fed was upbeat on the economy on the whole. “They also forecast three hikes next year and two more in 2020 and clearly revised up the growth forecast as well,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “So the picture looks different when you look at longer-term projections. That explains the complicated reaction by markets. The prospects of continued rate hikes may cap shares,” he added. The yield on two-year U.S. notes yield slipped back to 2.308 percent from 9 1/2-year high of 2.366 percent hit earlier on Wednesday while the 10-year yield dipped to 2.881 percent after an initial spike to 2.936 percent. The Fed’s decision to opt for only two more hikes this year led the U.S. dollar to its largest fall in two months against a basket of six other major currencies. The euro traded at $1.23415, recovering from near three-week low of $1.2240 touched earlier in the week. The dollar stood at 106.03 yen, erasing all its gains made so far this week. The British pound jumped 1.01 percent on Wednesday to hit six-week high of $1.4150 ahead of the Bank of England’s policy announcement later in the day. The dollar lost ground against many other currencies, including the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso , both of which gained on reports the White House had dropped a demand related to auto exports in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Hong Kong dollar traded flat at 7.8445 per U.S unit after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised rates on Thursday, following the Fed’s action. The Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, hit a 33-year low of 7.8466 on Wednesday, near the lower end of the monetary authority’s targeted trading band of 7.75-7.85. The Wall Street stock index ended the day lower, with the S&P 500 losing 0.18 percent the Nasdaq Composite 0.26 percent. Concerns about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies kept many investors on guard. The White House said President Donald Trump will announce tariffs on Chinese imports at 12:30 p.m. local time (1630 GMT) on Thursday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday his agency has prepared U.S. investment restrictions on China for President Donald Trump to consider as part of his upcoming announcement on intellectual property actions against Beijing. Investors worry such a move could trigger countermeasures by China, possibly causing a vicious cycle of escalating retaliation. In the energy market, oil prices stood near six-week highs and closed in on a 3-year peak set in late January, helped by a surprise decline in U.S. inventories, strong compliance on OPEC production cuts, and persistent concerns related to the nuclear pact with Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose to as high as $65.74 per barrel, not far from its January peak of $66.66, having gained almost five percent so far this week.

2018-03-22,"MANILA, March 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Veronica Cabe still remembers every minute of the more than 12 hours she and her family spent huddled on the roof of their two-storey home in Manila in 2009, as floodwaters swept past, carrying dead bodies, animal carcasses and coffins. Typhoon Ketsana, which killed about 500 people, was the most devastating typhoon to hit the Philippine capital in decades. As the frequency and intensity of storms increased, Cabe began to speak up about holding someone responsible. In 2015, she became a petitioner in a landmark complaint - soon to be examined by a national inquiry - which accuses global oil, mining and cement companies of human rights violations by playing a role in driving climate change. Next week, Cabe will be among more than a dozen experts and citizens to testify that the greenhouse gas emissions of some 50 firms infringe on Filipinos’ rights to life, food, water, sanitation and adequate housing, through the growing impacts of global warming. “We thought we would die on that roof - it was so scary, so traumatic,” said Cabe, a 45-year-old community organiser. “But it also made me really angry - can we only pray? Should we just accept our fate whenever disaster strikes, or can we hold someone accountable? If the carbon majors are causing damage, then they cannot just carry on,” she said. The Philippines is ranked as one of the countries most severely hit by wild weather super-charged by climate change. Now, disaster survivors and about a dozen rights groups led by Greenpeace Southeast Asia are aiming to force companies to declare their plans to prevent and mitigate the impact of emissions from extracting, burning and selling fossil fuels, which scientists say are warming the planet. The Philippine Commission on Human Rights (CHR), an independent body set up by the government, agreed in 2015 to conduct an inquiry, and will hold its first public hearings next week in Manila, followed by additional hearings in London and New York. Oil giants Chevron and BP, and miner Rio Tinto are among the so-called “carbon majors” cited in the petition. The three companies did not respond to emails seeking comment. But at least half a dozen companies submitted responses in 2016 to the commission and organisations backing the complaint, outlining the steps they are taking to curb corporate emissions. Some firms also argued they were not subject to the commission’s jurisdiction, nor required to submit to its proceedings. The inquiry is the first time a government agency has accepted, and acted on, a request for investigation of the environmental responsibility of companies that sell or are heavy users of fossil fuels, according to Zelda Soriano, an attorney with Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “It’s the first case to use the human-rights framework to take on carbon majors causing climate change. It is a big deal for a small human rights body in a small country,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The commission can only make recommendations to Philippine legislators and the business world, and has no enforcement powers. But Soriano said the inquiry would set “a precedent”, and the commission’s resolution and proposed measures would add weight “to every existing and future climate-change litigation case in any part of the world, no matter the outcome”. The Philippines complaint complements a global upsurge in legal challenges seeking redress for climate-change impacts. Legal filings in countries from Germany to Pakistan and the Netherlands aim to force faster action to tackle climate change and its impacts, or claim damages from energy firms. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court rejected the U.S. government’s bid to halt a lawsuit by young people claiming that the administration is violating their constitutional rights by ignoring the harms caused by climate change. In Norway, activists have said the country’s plans for Arctic oil exploration are unconstitutional, in an emerging branch of law where plaintiffs are trying to enlist a nation’s founding principles to limit warming. According to a 2014 study commissioned by the Climate Justice Programme and Greenpeace International, companies including Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP have contributed a large share of the carbon dioxide and methane emissions causing climate change. The Philippine human rights commission will allow companies named in the complaint to present their arguments, and aims to conclude its inquiry this year, Soriano said. It plans to pass a resolution next year. The commission, in a 2016 statement, said the case was “novel in its attempt to haul the ‘carbon majors’ in a petition involving human rights (and) promote the notion that businesses have an obligation to respect human rights”. “The inquiry, it is hoped, would result in the improvement and/or development of measures to further protect and promote human rights in this era of climate change,” it added. This, and other climate-change cases, attest that governments are not moving “fast enough or ambitiously enough on climate”, said Sarah Labowitz, co-founder of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. Even if the Philippines petition “isn’t successful on the merits, we can look at it as a demand made by people without a lot of power, for action by the biggest and most powerful actors”, she said. The climate-change hearings in the Philippines come amid rising instances of violence against activists trying to protect the country’s environment. The Philippines recorded the highest number of such attacks in Asia last year. Cabe’s former colleague, Gloria Capitan, was shot dead in 2016 for opposing a coal-mining project in Bataan province. But Cabe said the fight must go on, urging companies to do business in a way that does not harm communities or nature. “We need electricity, but not at the cost of our lives and at the cost of the environment,” she said.

2018-03-22,"(Repeats MARCH 21 story. No change to text.) By John Kemp LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Uber has suspended road tests of self-driving vehicles after the first pedestrian was killed by one of its vehicles operating under autonomous computer control. Proponents of self-driving vehicles claim they would be safer, as well as more energy efficient, but those safety claims will now come under heightened scrutiny. In theory, self-driving vehicles should eliminate several major driver-related causes of road traffic accidents, including excessive speed, intoxication and inattention. But there are concerns about how self-driving vehicles will interact with unpredictable human drivers and pedestrians as well as unmapped hazards such as temporary road obstructions. There are also fears about how self-driving vehicles would cope with hacking or widespread disruption of their communications systems (“Too much sun could wreak havoc on driverless cars”, Bloomberg, March 16). The accident investigation into Sunday’s crash will mark an important test of the technology but also of the ability of politicians, regulators and the media to think about risk in an intelligent way. All transportation is fraught with risk and road transport is particularly dangerous even with a human behind the wheel (“Self-driving Uber cars kills Arizona woman crossing street”, Reuters, March 20). Every year, there are more than 6 million reported crashes involving motor vehicles in the United States, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (“Motor vehicle safety data”, BTS, 2017). In 2016, almost 40,000 people were killed in transport-related accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (“U.S. transportation fatalities 2015-2016”, NTSB, 2017). Of those, more than 95 percent were killed in accidents involving motor vehicles (37,461), dwarfing the number killed on the railroads (733), marine transport (730), aviation (412) and pipelines (16). Road traffic fatalities included nearly 6,000 pedestrians, over 5,000 motorcyclists and 840 pedal-cyclists (“Fatal motor vehicle crashes overview”, U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017). Road traffic crashes are the number one cause of death for young people between the ages of 8 and 24, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. And they are one of the top two causes of accidental death for people in all age groups (“Motor vehicle traffic crashes as a leading cause of death in the United States”, NHTSA, 2018). In a worrying trend, U.S. roads appear to have become more dangerous in the last few years, reversing the downtrend over the previous quarter of a century. The number of crashes, injuries and fatalities has been growing faster than highway traffic volumes since around 2015. Road deaths rose to 1.18 per 100 million miles driven in 2016 up from 1.15 in 2015 and a recent low of 1.08 in 2014. The trend among pedestrians has been particularly worrying, with fatalities surging by 9 percent in 2016 to the highest level since 1990. Many road accidents have been attributed in whole or part to driver misbehaviour. Alcohol was involved in more than 10,000 fatalities in 2016. Speed in more than 10,000. And distraction in more than 3,000. Driving is already relatively dangerous in the United States, so the question is whether self-driving vehicles increase or reduce the existing risks, not whether they can eliminate risk altogether. So far, self-driving vehicles have completed fewer than 10 million miles of on-highway tests (“Self-driving cars under scrutiny after pedestrian death”, Financial Times, March 19). Supporters and critics have long acknowledged the inevitability of a self-driving vehicle being involved in a serious accident, and eventually being the cause of a fatality. Some had hoped self-driving vehicles would log 100 million miles or more before the first fatal accident to prove they are safer. But that shows a misunderstanding of how statistics work, since the first fatal accident is as likely to occur on the first mile as on the 100-millionth mile (assuming the safety level remains constant). Until self-driving vehicles are tested on actual roads for tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of miles it will not be possible to evaluate their safety relative to human-operated vehicles. The advent of self-driving vehicles poses complicated questions about safety but is no different from any other new technology. Every new technology is initially beset by accidents, and that has been particularly true in transportation, where early steam engines, automobiles and aircraft were all initially accident-prone. All federal safety regulation in the United States stems originally from the response to the problem of exploding steam boilers in the nineteenth century (“Bursting boilers and the federal power”, Burke, 1966). The advent of high-pressure steam engines on riverboats prompted a spate of explosions killing crew, passengers, and unlucky bystanders. Between 1818 and 1824, 47 lives were lost in 15 boiler explosions on steamboats. Between 1825 and 1830 there were 42 explosions killing 273 people. One particularly serious explosion aboard the steamboat “Helen McGregor” near Memphis reportedly killed 50-60 people. “The many distressing accidents which have of late occurred in that portion of our navigation carried on by the use of steam power deserve the immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authorities of the country,” President Andrew Jackson wrote in his State of the Union message to Congress in 1833. “The fact that the number of those fatal disasters is constantly increasing, notwithstanding the great improvements which are everywhere made in the machinery employed and in the rapid advances which have made in that branch of science, shows very clearly that they are in a great degree the result of criminal negligence.” “That these evils may be greatly lessened, if not substantially removed, by means of precautionary and penal legislation seems to be highly probable.” The eventual response after many years of delay was a system of safety regulation including boiler standards and inspections. The arrival of the internal combustion engine and the automobile generated a similar surge of accidents among drivers and pedestrians and a legal and regulatory response. Early aircraft, too, were far more prone to mechanical failure or pilot error than has been the case in recent years. But no one would now suggest steam boilers, automobiles or aircraft are simply too dangerous to be practical - any more than in future people will think self-driving vehicles are too dangerous. In every case of new technology, safety lessons have been learned through a painful process of trial and error that has unfortunately cost lives. Self-driving vehicles will be no different. The challenge is to introduce sensible and balanced safety regulations while encouraging continued development of a technology that has potential to save lives and bring a range of other benefits. That requires a very transparent approach from the technology companies and a calm and reasoned response from politicians, regulators and journalists.

2018-03-22,"* Brent crude oil futures near $70 per barrel * Ongoing OPEC-led supply restraint has been supporting oil * Weak dollar also supports oil prices * Soaring U.S. production tempers bullish mood somewhat By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, lifted by a surprise draw on U.S. crude inventories as well as ongoing dollar weakness which makes oil cheaper in global markets and potentially spurs demand. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $65.39 a barrel at 0021 GMT, up 22 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $69.65 per barrel, up 18 cents, or 0.3 percent. Both benchmarks are hovering just below their highest levels since early February, having risen around 10 percent from March lows. Some support for crude futures came from currency markets, where the dollar fell as Federal Reserve officials stuck to their view of three rate increases for 2018, even as they delivered an expected quarter point rate hike. In oil markets, U.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA fell 2.6 million barrels in the week to March 16, to 428.31 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said late on Wednesday. “Oil ... had a big session overnight although this wasn’t just a function of the interest rate move. Inventory data for last week showed a surprise crude draw as well as significant drawdowns in both gasoline and distillates inventories,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. Further supporting oil prices has been supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, which started in 2017 and is scheduled to go on for the rest of 2018. The overall bullish mood is being somewhat tempered by U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, which climbed to a fresh record of 10.4 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, putting the United States ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of Russia’s 11 million bpd.

2018-03-22,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States did not fully comply with a 2014 ruling against its anti-subsidy tariffs on a range of Chinese products, a World Trade Organization compliance panel said in a ruling on Wednesday that either side can appeal within 20 days. The ruling came ahead of the White House’s announcement on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump will announce tariffs on Chinese imports aimed at curbing theft of U.S. technology. The move is expected to trigger retaliation from Beijing and stoke fears of a global trade war. China went to the WTO in 2012 to challenge U.S. anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panels, wind towers, steel cylinders and aluminium extrusions.  At the time it said its complaint covered an annual $7.3 billion in exports to the United States.  The WTO panel agreed that the United States had not correctly used third country prices to assess the subsidies, but supported the U.S. assertion that exporters were getting subsidies from Chinese “public bodies”, despite Beijing’s assertions to the contrary. China’s commerce ministry said late on Wednesday that the WTO ruling showed that the United States was a “repeat abuser” of trade remedy measures, and urged it to take immediate action to correct faulty practices. If China’s complaint survives a potential appeal, it would move a step closer to retaliatory sanctions on U.S. trade, although the two sides would first have to settle on the value of sanctions, which would involve a round of legal argument.   The dispute centred on 17 investigations carried out by the U.S. Department of Commerce between 2007 and 2012. The products concerned were solar panels, wind towers, thermal and coated paper, tow-behind lawn groomers, kitchen shelving, steel sinks, citric acid, magnesia carbon bricks, pressure pipe, line pipe, seamless pipe, steel cylinders, drill pipe, oil country tubular goods, wire strand and aluminium extrusions. Many of China’s complaints about specific investigations were rejected in the panel’s 119-page report, but other points were upheld.

2018-03-22,"ROME, March 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The number of coal-fired power plants built worldwide fell steeply over the past two years, but emissions are too high to keep global warming within relatively safe levels, campaigners said on Thursday. The start of new builds dropped by 73 percent between 2015 and 2017, as China tightened restrictions on coal and a loss of private finance froze 17 construction sites in India, according to a report by Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and CoalSwarm. Newly completed coal plants also fell 41 percent, and the number of plants in planning dropped by 59 percent, it said. “From a climate and health perspective, the trend toward a declining coal power fleet is encouraging, but not happening fast enough,” said Ted Nace, the San Francisco-based director of CoalSwarm, a network of researchers on fossil fuels. To meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement target of keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, construction must end and existing plants must retire faster, the report said. But global coal capacity is still growing, rising by 2 percent in the last 12 months, according to the World Coal Association, an industry network. Ageing coal plants in Europe and the United States are being replaced by highly efficient plants in China and Asia, it said. “In the last five years as China became the largest solar and wind market in the world, it also added 229 gigawatts of coal power, thus increasing coal generation by a third,” said Benjamin Sporton, head of the World Coal Association. With continued global reliance on coal, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies must be developed to reduce fossil fuel emissions, he said. “We ... need to be resolute in our efforts to accelerate the deployment of CCS technologies which will be critical to achieving global climate objectives,” he said. CCS - which involves capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and burying it underground so that it does not enter the atmosphere - is costly, controversial and still in the early phases of testing. The campaign groups said global coal capacity is likely to start shrinking in 2022, when the number of plants retired is expected to outstrip those being built. About 100 gigawatts of coal power - equivalent to double Germany’s coal capacity - needs to be retired every year between 2020 and 2040, Nace said. ""It's a tall order... (but) it's not out of the question,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that mass production is cutting solar and wind power costs faster than expected, and markets and power planners ""are taking notice"".

2018-03-22,"OSLO (Reuters) - The past three years were the hottest on record and heat waves in Australia, freak Arctic warmth and water shortages in Cape Town are extending harmful weather extremes in 2018, the United Nations said on Thursday. Atlantic hurricanes and monsoon floods in India contributed to make 2017 the most costly year on record for severe weather and climate events, the U.N.’s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) wrote in its annual report on the global climate. “The start of 2018 has continued where 2017 left off – with extreme weather claiming lives and destroying livelihoods,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas wrote in the report.  The study confirmed a provisional finding that 2016 was the warmest year in records dating back to the 19th century, with 2017 and 2015 tied for second place in a warming trend the WMO blames on man-made emissions of greenhouse gases. Last year was the hottest year without an extra boost from an El Nino event that releases heat from the Pacific Ocean. Talaas said unusually high temperatures in the Arctic in 2018 contrasted with bitter winter storms in Europe and North America. Also so far in 2018, “Australia and Argentina suffered extreme heat waves, whilst drought continued in Kenya and Somalia, and the South African city of Cape Town struggled with acute water shortages,” he said. The report said that German reinsurer Munich Re estimated total disaster losses from weather and climate-related events in 2017 at $320 billion, a record after adjustment for inflation. In 2015, almost 200 nations agreed to shift the global economy away from fossil fuels this century as part of the Paris climate agreement.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are the prime cause of warming, has said he will withdraw from the pact, and instead promote domestic coal, gas and oil. The WMO said that levels of carbon dioxide were now above 400 parts per million of the atmosphere - far above natural variations in the past 800,000 years and backing up mainstream scientific findings that mankind is the cause. Carbon dioxide “will remain above that level for generations to come, committing our planet to a warmer future, with more weather, climate and water extremes,” Talaas said.
