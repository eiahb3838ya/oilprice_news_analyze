2019-01-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s new pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency told lawmakers on Wednesday he does not believe climate change is a major crisis, and would continue to undo Obama-era emission limits if confirmed. Trump nominated EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler last week to run the agency permanently, seeking a strong advocate for his pro-fossil fuels agenda - a choice that cheered business interests and drawn scorn from environmentalists. “I would not call it the greatest crisis,” Wheeler said at his confirmation hearing when asked if he believed the increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about the threats from global warming.  Wheeler’s confirmation is expected to sail through the Republican-controlled Senate despite Democratic opposition. A Washington insider with years of experience, he has been running the EPA since July when his predecessor Scott Pruitt resigned in a flurry of criticism over his use of resources and staff for personal matters. Democratic lawmakers focused on Wheeler’s record at EPA, his past lobbying work for energy companies, and his stance on global warming - casting him as a pro-business extremist not fit to run the nation’s top environmental regulator.  Democrat Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, asked Wheeler his view of global warming, which scientists say is driven by fossil fuels consumption and is leading to sea level rise, and more frequent flooding, wildfires and extreme weather. Wheeler said he believed global warming is an important issue that needs to be addressed, but that far-reaching federal regulation forcing deep emissions cuts was the wrong approach and more faith should be put in the hands of states and private enterprise. “You are putting up a smokescreen to ensure there is an advancement of Donald Trump’s dirty policies,” Markey said, in one of the hearing’s most heated exchanges. “That’s why it is relevant that you are a former coal industry lobbyist.”  A federal report written by 13 government agencies late last year said climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century, damaging everything from human health to infrastructure and agricultural production. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on climate change and has indicated his intention to withdraw from a global pact to fight it, dismissed the report after its release, saying “I don’t believe it”. Wheeler said he had been briefed on the assessment, but was waiting for further briefings from his staff before taking a public position on its findings. Wheeler defended his record at EPA, which has been largely defined by moves to undo or weaken Obama-era environmental regulations. He cast the agency’s rollbacks as a way to reduce the regulatory burden on business while also protecting air and water quality for Americans. Among his accomplishments, Wheeler last year finalized a proposal to replace Obama-era federal curbs on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with a new rule placing much of that power in the hands of states.  He has also overseen the EPA’s gutting of the justification for Obama-era mercury emissions limits, a proposal to reduce the number of waterways under federal protection, and efforts to lower targets for vehicle fuel efficiency.  Democrats pressed Wheeler on whether his EPA work was in any way linked to his previous lobbying on behalf of energy companies like underground coal giant Murray Energy, a vocal proponent of reduced environmental and safety regulation. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, held up photos of Wheeler attending meetings between Murray’s Chief Executive Robert Murray and Trump administration officials, and asked Wheeler for a full accounting of the number of such meetings he had arranged for the coal company. Wheeler said he would provide a written response. Industry representatives and Republican lawmakers have largely praised Wheeler for his deregulatory stance. “He understands how the regulatory process works and the type of effort that is required to develop effective and legally defensible regulatory reforms,” said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at industry-focused law firm Bracewell and a former EPA air administrator. Environmental groups have taken a different view.  Activists briefly interrupted Wheeler’s testimony on Wednesday shouting “Shut down Wheeler, not the EPA,” and several were arrested after demonstrating outside the hearing room.

2019-01-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock indexes rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 supported by sharply higher U.S. bank shares after strong earnings, while the pound was up after British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government won a confidence vote in parliament. That should allow her to attempt to create a consensus among lawmakers on an agreement on Britain’s departure from the European Union. The confidence vote followed the parliamentary defeat of May’s Brexit deal late Tuesday. Expectations of a softer Brexit - perhaps incorporating the Labour Party’s idea of membership of a permanent customs union - gave some support to the pound.  Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2873, up 0.12 percent on the day. Stocks mostly shrugged off the results of the vote. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.39 percent. On Wall Street, strong earnings from Bank of America (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) helped to keep stocks in positive territory. Bank of America shares were up more than 7 percent while Goldman’s stock was up about 8 percent. “There is hope for this earnings season, and Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have got it started off on the right foot,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 218.87 points, or 0.91 percent, to 24,284.46, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 15.34 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,625.64 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 32.57 points, or 0.46 percent, to 7,056.40. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.54 percent. The dollar rose against the euro as the euro zone single currency was pushed lower by worries about the zone's economy, with the euro EUR= down 0.12 percent to $1.14. Earlier this week, data showed Germany barely escaped a recession in the second half of 2018 and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi warned on Tuesday the euro zone economy was weaker than anticipated. In sovereign debt markets, British government bonds underperformed versus German peers in early trade. U.S. Treasury yields rose as stronger-than-forecast results from two major banks lifted Wall Street, reducing safe-haven demand for U.S. government debt. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.7326 percent, from 2.708 percent late on Tuesday.

2019-01-16,"(Adds pix available) MEXICO CITY, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Fuel continues accumulating at Mexico’s ports and storage terminals, the government and state-run Pemex said on Wednesday, as the government struggles to accelerate deliveries to gas stations via truck instead of speedier pipelines. In a bid to halt rampant theft of gasoline and diesel, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ordered key pipelines closed starting in late December, which has caused shortages and sparked concerns about the economic impact if the shortfalls are prolonged. Mexico currently has almost 7 million barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in dozens of tankers anchored around Pemex’s ports waiting to discharge. Some 5.3 million barrels more are stored at terminals, said Pemex Chief Executive Octavio Romero. In a press conference with Lopez Obrador, Romero also estimated that 3.8 million barrels of fuel purchased by oil company Pemex from different suppliers are on the way. Due to Mexico’s limited storage capacity compared with its fuel consumption, which last year surpassed 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), Pemex typically has a small fleet of tankers loaded with imported fuel at the Gulf of Mexico acting as “floating storage.” But the number of vessels waiting to discharge, mostly bringing imports from the United States, has grown to about 45 tankers this week, including a group of ships at ports on the Pacific coast, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Mexico in November also resumed importing crude from the United States after more than a decade by awarding refining firm Phillips 66 a tender to buy Bakken crude. A 300,000-barrel crude cargo arrived in the country in December, according to Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to reduce fuel imports and has been a harsh critic of the country’s 2013-14 energy reform, which opened up the sector. A drop in local oil output, which stands at 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), led the country to resort to imports of light oil in November and December to make the crude mixtures required by several local refineries, the president said. “We have to replace production. There are two options: we buy light crude for refineries or we buy gasoline,” he said during his regular press conference. “We are doing both, but at the same time we want to review with precision the reason for the fall in oil production.” Lopez Obrador’s main plan for the oil industry involves building a new mid-size refinery to boost fuel production while reducing crude exports and imports.

2019-01-16,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Executives at the major U.S. automakers are pressing the Trump administration and California to agree on standards for fuel efficiency and carbon emissions through 2025, as risks increase that a deadline for setting national standards will pass without a deal. Automakers are already entering the time frame when decisions should be made about what engines and fuel-saving technology, such as hybrids or fully electric cars, will be in use in 2021 and beyond, executives said. In August, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2025 and stripping California of the ability to impose stricter rules. The administration may also eliminate compliance credits that automakers get for making electric vehicles. A group of about 20 U.S. states, led by California, has challenged the administration proposal as unlawful and promised to sue if federal regulators move forward with the freeze. Trump’s proposed freeze would result in 500,000 barrels per day more oil consumption by the 2030s. The administration says it would reduce regulatory costs for automakers by more than $300 billion (234 billion pounds) over the next decade. At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat, said he had “heard that the Trump Administration now plans to finalise a 0.5 percent annual increase in the stringency of the standards – a rate that is 10 times weaker than the current rules.” Carper said that “will only lead to extensive litigation and uncertainty for automakers. That’s not a win-win outcome. It’s a lose-lose.” Several automakers said they have heard the administration could finalise an increase ranging from no increase to 1 percent per year, but nothing has been finalised. EPA Administrator nominee Andrew Wheeler said at the hearing he was still pushing for an agreement. “Nobody wants a 50-state deal more than I do,” Wheeler said. The administration is supposed to finalise the new rules by the end of March in order for the softer requirements to take effect by the 2021 model year, but some automakers and officials question if it will meet that deadline in the wake of the partial government shutdown. Most automakers oppose freezing the requirements, but also want relief from Obama-era standards that called for a roughly 5 percent annual reduction in carbon emissions - targets that translate to fuel efficiency requirements for various classes of vehicles. “Pick the middle. Pick 2.5 percent and get on with life,” Jim Lentz, chief executive officer of Toyota Motor Corp’s (7203.T) North America subsidiary, told Reuters at the Detroit auto show this week. Lentz told Reuters last month he was concerned that automakers are stuck between California and the White House.  “I kind of feel like this is the OK Corral and we’re the settlers walking across the middle,” Lentz said.  Ford Motor Co (F.N), which floated a compromise proposal last year to other automakers, is still pushing for a deal, Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. told Reuters.  “We’ve been very clear and very open that we want one national standard, we want California at the table,” Ford said. “We’re not asking for a rollback, but we’ve got to get everybody at the table, especially California.” Detroit automakers have the most at stake. General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) generate most of their global profits from sales of fuel-thirsty large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States. All three have discontinued or planned to drop small and medium-sized sedans from their lineups to focus on trucks and SUVs.  Trucks are front and centre at the Detroit auto show, where Fiat Chrysler’s Ram brand exhibit displays a gleaming Ram “Power Wagon” heavy duty truck on a pedestal, and GM’s GMC brand features its newly redesigned Sierra Denali luxury pickup line. But Asian automakers that have more efficient fleets are also seeking a middle ground. Henio Arcangeli, a senior vice president at the U.S. unit of Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T), said without a national deal “the consumer’s going to lose.” Mitch Bainwol, who heads the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing major automakers, said a deal makes the most sense but “time is running out. ... A successful negotiation is a win for everyone – more carbon reduction for California, a stronger and pro-job economic context for the administration and common sense certainty for our industry.” Reporting by David Shepardson in Detroit.

Trump nominated EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to run the agency permanently last week. If confirmed, Wheeler would continue to push the Trump administration’s deregulatory and pro-fossil fuels agenda but without the constant criticism over alleged mismanagement that plagued his predecessor Scott Pruitt. A Washington insider with years of experience as a top aide to Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, a climate change doubter, Wheeler has been running the EPA since July when Pruitt resigned in a flurry of controversy over his travel expenses and use of resources and staff for personal matters. His nomination has pleased business groups, but angered environmental advocates, some of whom protested the hearing. “Mr. Wheeler is certainly not the ethically-bereft embarrassment that Scott Pruitt proved to be,” Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said at the hearing. Carper, however, added: “Mr Wheeler’s environmental policies appear to be just as extreme as his predecessor’s.” Wheeler defended his record so far at EPA, largely defined by moves to undo or weaken Obama-era environmental regulations, casting it as a way to reduce the regulatory burden on business while also protecting air and water quality for Americans. Among his accomplishments at the EPA, Wheeler last year finalized a proposal to replace Obama-era federal curbs on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with a new rule placing much of that power in the hands of states.

2019-01-16,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The Canadian province of Alberta’s OPEC-style decision to force production cuts is benefiting oil companies with higher prices, but it is also pushing capital elsewhere and threatens to undermine booming crude-by-rail shipments. After Alberta cut 325,000 barrels per day (bpd) starting this month, the discount on Canadian heavy oil compared to benchmark U.S. crude oil shrank to less than $7 per barrel from more than $40 in October, providing relief for producers. But drilling activity has dropped sharply in the last year, hurting service providers, and the shrinking discount reduces incentive for shippers to move crude by rail, which is costlier than pipelines. Some producers have already decided to spend more in other provinces. “As soon as we heard this curtailment was taking place, we shifted our capital to Saskatchewan from Alberta,” said Grant Fagerheim, chief executive of light-oil producer Whitecap Resources Inc (WCP.TO).     Whitecap intends to spend about 80 percent of its C$450 million ($340 million) capex in Saskatchewan, up from its usual spending there of around 60 percent, Fagerheim said.    Canada is the world’s fourth-largest crude producer, but larger producers like the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia do not face Canada’s obstacles in getting oil to market. Full pipelines and aggressive opposition to expanding the industry meant that even as Canada’s production hit record levels last year, benefits of that boom were elusive. Alberta, which produces most of Canada’s oil, last month ordered curtailments to drain bloated storage tanks and boost prices. Government intervention has provided a lifeline to producers that were selling barrels at a loss late last year and avoided an economic catastrophe for Canada. Bonterra Energy Corp (BNE.TO) produces less than 9,000 bpd, making it exempt from requirements to curb output, but it still benefits from higher prices, Chief Executive George Fink said. Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO), which announced plans last year to increase shipments by rail, is seeing a “very positive impact” on cash flow due to small price discounts, senior vice president of downstream Keith Chiasson told Reuters.     But with growth capital leaving Alberta and transportation problems unresolved, producers are feeling their way along in the early days of reckoning with almost unprecedented challenges. Across Canada, 184 rigs were working as of Jan. 11, down 92 rigs from a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes data.     Companies that provide contract services for producers, such as drilling, are looking to the United States and Mexico, said Gary Mar, chief executive of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada. Government-ordered production cuts worsened an already grim situation for service companies, Mar said. Asked about the curtailment program’s unintended consequences, an Alberta government spokesman noted that its strategy was focused on getting top dollar for its oil.     “There’s too much at stake and we shouldn’t be selling our products on the cheap,” said Mike McKinnon, spokesman for Alberta’s energy minister.  But prices have improved so dramatically that shipping by rail - the backup plan for moving crude until new pipelines are built - makes less economic sense. The cost of shipping crude by rail to U.S. buyers is estimated around $15 to $20 per barrel, well above the current differential.  Cenovus would not comment on whether the company is losing money on near-term rail shipments, but said they are scheduled to ramp up in the second quarter once new cars arrive.     Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) was planning to move 20 percent of its Canadian heavy oil this year by rail, but the narrow differentials now make that an unlikely target, said Rob Dutton, Devon’s senior vice president of Canadian operations. Devon currently moves less than 10 percent by train.     “It’s more difficult now” to reach that level, Dutton said in an interview. “Forty-five days ago, I would have said, ‘absolutely, for sure.’”  ($1 = 1.3240 Canadian dollars) Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by Denny Thomas and Tom Brown",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-crude-curtailment/canadas-oil-cuts-offer-lifeline-to-producers-but-create-new-problems-idUKL1N1Z70RB,16 Jan 2019,"The Canadian province

The Dow ended Wednesday with gains of 0.59 percent, while the S&P 500 added 0.22 percent and the Nasdaq 0.15 percent. Investors in Asia might be less encouraged by a Wall Street Journal report that U.S. federal prosecutors were investigating Huawei Technologies, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. businesses and could soon issue an indictment. Such a move could inflame tensions between Beijing and Washington and make a trade deal yet harder. China’s central bank on Wednesday moved to avert a cash crunch in the economy by injecting a record $83 billion into the country’s financial system. Also looming in the background were concerns the U.S. government shutdown was starting to take a toll on its economy. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the shutdown shaved 0.13 percent off quarterly economic growth for each week it goes on. As expected, British Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly won her confidence vote and invited other party leaders for talks to try to break the impasse on a Brexit divorce deal. An outline for Plan ‘B’ is due by Monday and the market assumes there will have to be an extension of the Article 50 exit date past March 29. “Nothing has happened in the last 24 hours to dissuade us from the view that we are headed in the direction of an Article 50 delay, a softer Brexit or no Brexit,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. “But it remains too soon to be buying sterling with your ears pinned back,” he added, noting many uncertainties remained. All of which left the pound firm at $1.2881, though still short of Monday’s peak at $1.2929. It fared well on the euro, which hit a seven-week low before steadying at 88.45 pence . The lessening of Brexit risk pressured the safe-haven yen and helped the U.S. dollar up to 109.10. The euro eased back to $1.1394 while the dollar index nudged up to 96.077. In commodity markets, palladium hit record highs thanks to increasing demand and lower supply of the metal used in auto catalysts. Spot gold held steady at $1,293.68 per ounce. Brent crude futures rose 66 cents to $61.30 a barrel overnight, while U.S. crude was last off 7 cents at $52.24.

2019-01-16,"PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - From her red-roofed home near Papua New Guinea’s capital of Port Moresby, Isabelle Dikana Iveiri overlooks a giant plant used by Exxon Mobil Corp to liquefy billions of dollars’ worth of natural gas before it is shipped to Asian buyers. Dikana Iveiri can also see swaths of muddy shoreline, where mangroves have been felled for firewood by locals who don’t have electricity, gas, or money to buy either. The $19 billion Exxon-led PNG LNG project was supposed to be a game-changer for PNG, a vast South Pacific archipelago beset by poverty despite its wealth of natural resources. But much of the promised riches, through taxes to the government, royalties to landowners and development levies to communities, have arrived well below Exxon’s own commissioned forecasts, if at all, according to landowners, the World Bank and the PNG government. “My family has been here a long time,” said Dikana Iveiri, one of several landowners interviewed by Reuters near the PNG LNG plant. “Our royalties are not going well; they are using our land but not paying us properly,” she said referring to both Exxon, which pays the royalties and the government, which distributes them.  Since gas exports began more than four years ago, Dikana Iveiri said she had received just one royalty payment in 2017. She was expecting about 10,000 kina ($2,885) based on information given to her by the government and community leaders. She said she received 600 kina.  Exxon, community leaders and the government did not comment on Dikana Iveiri’s specific situation but in a statement to Reuters, Exxon said distribution of royalties and benefits to the LNG plant site landowners started in 2017. Cash payments to individual landowners would depend on how many landowners were in a precinct and were just one of the benefits communities received, Exxon said.  The project employs nearly 2,600 workers, 82 percent of whom are Papua New Guinean and Exxon said it has invested $360 million to build infrastructure and pay for training and social programs. “We could not be more pleased to see how the benefits are flowing to the communities at the LNG plant site, to see how investments are being made in important infrastructure such as schools and health that demonstrates the process is a good one and it works,” ExxonMobil PNG Managing Director Andrew Barry told a mining and energy conference in Sydney in December. Barry said Exxon was hoping royalties would begin flowing in the pipeline and upstream areas “in the not too distant future”. The government admits it has made mistakes. PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill, who was part of the government but not the leader in 2009, said many of the disputes around PNG LNG stemmed from the way the government and Exxon proceeded with the project without first resolving landowner claims. “It should have been done before, it wasn’t only for Exxon and the partners but even the government at the time did not do the proper clan vetting, proper identification of the land owners - they allowed this project to go on without that,” O’Neill told Reuters.  Treasury, the treasurer, and the Prime Minister’s spokesman declined to provide responses to Reuters’ questions about the project. (GRAPHIC: ExxonMobil's LNG facilitie - tmsnrt.rs/2QhGSAz)  GAS-POWERED MONEY SPINNER PNG LNG was completed ahead of schedule and exported 8.3 million metric tonnes in 2017, compared to its anticipated design capacity of 6.9 million tonnes, according to the project’s website. Exxon does not disclose the project’s revenue or profits but research house Morningstar estimates it has generated $18.8 billion in revenue for Exxon and its partners since production started in 2014. The project’s break-even price of around $7.40 per million British Thermal Units (mBTU) compares favorably to an average over $10/mBTU for eight recent gas projects in the region, according to analysis by consultancy Wood Mackenzie and Credit Suisse. “The plant capacity has performed phenomenally,” Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic told Reuters. “On cost, it’s much lower than peers ... it’s got an ample resource base and it’s got a well-disciplined operator in the form of Exxon.” The project’s contribution to Papua New Guinea’s economy and government finances is less clear. PNG’s Treasury does not report project income figures, but government budget papers show tax revenue flowing from PNG LNG has been well below expectations.  In its 2012 budget, the PNG government estimated it would receive $22 billion in revenue over the project’s life to 2040. In November, the government slashed its revenue forecast in half to $11 billion over the life of the project.  It identified 11 tax concessions, which along with a drop in gas prices, amounted to hundreds of millions in kina in annual revenue forgone. A 2017 World Bank analysis found the project partners had negotiated favorable methods of calculating royalties to the government that allowed them to take various deductions.  Combined with tax concessions, the project created “a complex web of exemptions and allowances that effectively mean that little revenue is received by government and landowners,” the World Bank said.   Exxon did not respond to questions regarding the World Bank findings and the World Bank declined to provide further comment.  Exxon’s partners, which include Australian-listed Oil Search Ltd and Santos Ltd, and a subsidiary of Japan’s JXTG Holdings Inc, referred Reuters’ questions to Exxon. Exxon said in a statement to Reuters the project has generated 5 billion kina in revenue for the government and landowners via taxes, royalty and benefit payments. The figure includes revenue to the PNG state-owned stakeholders.  A second LNG project, Papua LNG, led by France’s Total with Exxon and Oil Search as minority partners, is scheduled to finalize an agreement with the PNG government in early 2019. Papua LNG, a new gasfield using the same but expanded processing plant, could commence production as soon as 2024, according to Total. Analysts estimate it will cost around $13 billion. “The experience of the first project developed by Exxon and Oil Search, there was some criticism, some mistakes,” Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told Reuters in an interview in Port Moresby, referring to relations with landowners. “Some lessons (are) being taken out … around the management of landowners and trying to engage at an early stage with them.” Total has agreed to an undisclosed annual minimum payment to the government and to reserve some gas for local industry, he said. Exxon did not respond to requests for comment on Pouyanne’s statements. In its statement, Exxon acknowledged that “distribution of royalties and benefits in some project areas were delayed since the start of production due to court action by a small number of landowners which prevented the relevant government departments from completing their administrative processes.” Exxon said it was committed to assisting the government ensure landowners receive royalty and equity dividends as soon as practicable. Disputes have broken out within communities near PNG LNG facilities as landowners fight to have their claims recognized.  Some clashes have been fatal, said Highlands clan leader Johnson Tape, one of 16 clan leaders with a claim over the Komo Air Field, used by the Exxon project. “Our clans fought each other, but now there is peace; we are one team fighting Exxon,” said Tape.  Christopher Havieta, the governor of Gulf Province, where  gas fields for the new project are located, said locals wanted to avoid the experiences of Exxon’s PNG LNG. “It was a foundation project and so a lot of exemptions were made and the end result is we have a lot of social problems that have risen up.”  Reporting by Jonathan Barrett and Tom Westbrook in PORT MORESBY; Editing by Lincoln Feast.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/papua-lng-exxon-mobil/insight-in-papua-new-guinea-exxons-giant-lng-project-fuels-frustration-idUKL4N1Y129G,16 Jan 2019,"* Exxon-led PNG LNG plant among the industry's most

2019-01-16,"(Reuters) - Australia’s largest independent coal producer Whitehaven Coal said on Thursday its second quarter saleable coal production rose 11 percent as a timely pickup in production from its Narrabri mine bolstered output. Managed saleable coal production for the three months to Dec. 31 2018 came in at 5.6 million tonnes, compared with production of 5 million tonnes a year ago, the company said in a statement.  The miner’s sales fell 7 percent for the quarter to 5.4 million tonnes. Whitehaven, which produces both thermal and metallurgical coal, reaffirmed its full year 2019 saleable production guidance at 22 million tonnes to 23 million tonnes on a managed basis.  The miner posted record quarterly run of mine coal production of 7.4 million tonnes, boosted by strong performance at both its Narrabri and Maules Creek mines. Technical issues at the Narrabri mine had undercut Whitehaven’s coal production in the previous quarter. The mine accounted for about 40 percent of Whitehaven’s production in the second quarter. Whitehaven sells its high grade coal across Asia, with the company citing the governments of Japan and Korea as its main  customers. The miner has been able to avoid the slowdown in demand faced by its peers, who sell to China.  Whitehaven’s stock price lost slightly in 2018. However, it fared far better than its peers on Australia’s benchmark energy index, which declined nearly 11 percent in 2018.

2019-01-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets rose on Wednesday, with Wall Street’s major indexes hitting one-month highs after strong earnings from Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs, while the pound rose after British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government won a confidence vote in parliament. May can now try to build consensus on an agreement on Britain’s departure from the European Union. The confidence vote followed the parliamentary defeat of May’s Brexit deal late Tuesday. Hopes for a softer Brexit, perhaps incorporating the Labour Party’s idea of a customs union, gave some support to the pound.  “Sterling has jumped on the back of this because now we are looking at the possibilities of other parties coming to Theresa May and work with her on the issue of Brexit. The future path will be very much dependent on the promises she makes with cross parties,” Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd in London, wrote in a note following the vote. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2877, up 0.15 percent on the day. Stocks held their gains following the vote. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.18 percent. On Wall Street, results from Bank of America (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) eased worries about the earnings outlook and helped to support stocks. Bank of America shares were up 7.2 percent while Goldman’s stock was up 9.5 percent. “It’s still way early, but so far the tone has been good,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  “The fact that the banks are a little more sensitive certainly to interest rates and the yield curve and business activity, it gives a decent read on the economy.”       The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 141.57 points, or 0.59 percent, to 24,207.16, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 5.8 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,616.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 10.86 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,034.69. Investors also digested a Wall Street Journal report that federal prosecutors are investigating Huawei Technologies, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. businesses and could soon issue an indictment. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.54 percent. The dollar rose against the euro as the euro zone single currency was pushed lower by worries about the zone's economy, with the euro EUR= down 0.18 percent to $1.1393. Data this week showed Germany barely escaped a recession in the second half of 2018. On Tuesday, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi warned the euro zone economy was weaker than anticipated. U.S. Treasury yields climbed as the confidence vote and stock market gains reduced safety bids on the bond market. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.7272 percent, from 2.708 percent late on Tuesday. Oil prices also gained, boosted by the U.S. equity market rally and a supply cut agreement by OPEC+. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 68 cents to settle at $61.32 a barrel.

2019-01-16,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen on Wednesday rejected  critiques by the country’s farm minister that questioned her knowledge about Brazil’s conservation efforts. Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias on Monday said that Bundchen should not be saying bad things about Brazil, for example by calling the country a deforester, without knowing the facts.     Bundchen, who is married to U.S. football star Tom Brady, in November blasted a proposal by President Jair Bolsonaro to merge the environment ministry with the agriculture ministry. That did not happen, but the Bolsonaro government has stripped Brazil’s environment ministry of oversight of areas such as water resources and eliminated its secretariat on climate change.  Bolsonaro, who counts on powerful farmers as part of his core supporters, has said he wants to end an “industry” of environmental fines, which activists say is a major tool for ensuring rules are followed. He has also suggested Brazil could exit the Paris Agreement on climate change.     “It surprised me to see my name mentioned in a negative way for defending and speaking in favor of the environment, because I’ve been supporting projects and involved in socio-environmental causes since 2006,” Bundchen wrote on Twitter. “I’m always looking for knowledge through reading and contact with scientists, researchers, farmers, cooperative and environmental organizations.” The post did not mention Dias or the agriculture ministry by name. Dias responded by thanking Bundchen on Twitter for her message and saying they should work together to combat illegal deforestation. In Monday’s radio broadcast, Dias said that Bundchen should be promoting Brazil’s sustainability efforts, arguing that the country’s preservation of two-thirds of its native vegetation is a major environmental accomplishment, rather than criticizing Brazil. The minister later tweeted that she would soon invite Bundchen to be an ambassador for Brazil’s efforts to feed the world while preserving nature. Bundchen did not indicate whether she had received an invitation or whether she would accept. “I believe that agricultural production and environmental conservation need to go together, side by side,” she said in her posting.

2019-01-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Wednesday, buoyed by a U.S. equity market rally and a supply cut agreement by OPEC+, but gains were limited by data showing growing U.S. refined product inventories and record crude production. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 68 cents to settle at $61.32 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 20 cents to settle at $52.31 a barrel. Boosting oil prices, Wall Street’s main indexes hit a one-month high. [.N] Crude futures sometimes track equity markets.  Futures drew support from a supply cut agreement from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and major non-OPEC producer Russia. The group agreed in December to cut combined oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day from January. Russia’s deputy energy minister said the country will reach its oil output target reduction in April. “The market is consolidating. To see what our next driver is, we’re going to watch to see if the cuts are working, if the members that agreed to them are adhering to them,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Despite the output cuts, rising crude oil production in the United States could pressure prices. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude production rose last week to a record 11.9 million barrels per day, as crude exports jumped close to record highs near 3 million bpd. U.S. fuel stockpiles rose more than forecast and were up for the fourth straight week, EIA data showed. [EIA/S] U.S. crude output is expected to grow this year to a record beyond 12 million bpd, with the country turning into a net crude exporter in late 2020, the EIA said on Tuesday. Gasoline stockpiles USOILG=ECI rose 7.5 million barrels,  far exceeding analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.8 million-barrel gain. At 255.6 million barrels, gasoline stocks were at the highest weekly level since February of 2017. Distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI, which include diesel and heating oil, increased 3 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.6 million-barrel rise, the data showed. Crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell 2.7 million barrels, more than double forecasts. “Any bullish sentiment from the crude draw has been vanquished by emphatic builds to the products,” said Matthew Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. Mounting signs of an economic slowdown across the world may also keep oil prices in check. White House estimates showed on Tuesday that the U.S. economy is taking a larger-than-expected hit from a partial government shutdown. The outlook for the global economy darkened further after Britain’s parliament on Tuesday shot down Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal to leave the European Union. China this week reported poor December trade data. China’s central bank on Wednesday made its biggest daily net cash injection via reverse repo operations on record, in efforts oil markets will watch closely.

2019-01-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s new pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency told lawmakers on Wednesday he does not believe climate change is a major crisis, and would continue to undo Obama-era emission limits if confirmed. Trump nominated EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler last week to run the agency permanently, seeking a strong advocate for his pro-fossil fuels agenda - a choice that cheered business interests and drawn scorn from environmentalists. “I would not call it the greatest crisis,” Wheeler said at his confirmation hearing when asked if he believed the increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about the threats from global warming.  Wheeler’s confirmation is expected to sail through the Republican-controlled Senate despite Democratic opposition. A Washington insider with years of experience, he has been running the EPA since July when his predecessor Scott Pruitt resigned in a flurry of criticism over his use of resources and staff for personal matters. Democratic lawmakers focused on Wheeler’s record at EPA, his past lobbying work for energy companies, and his stance on global warming - casting him as a pro-business extremist not fit to run the nation’s top environmental regulator.  Democrat Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, asked Wheeler his view of global warming, which scientists say is driven by fossil fuels consumption and is leading to sea level rise, and more frequent flooding, wildfires and extreme weather. Wheeler said he believed global warming is an important issue that needs to be addressed, but that far-reaching federal regulation forcing deep emissions cuts was the wrong approach and more faith should be put in the hands of states and private enterprise. “You are putting up a smokescreen to ensure there is an advancement of Donald Trump’s dirty policies,” Markey said, in one of the hearing’s most heated exchanges. “That’s why it is relevant that you are a former coal industry lobbyist.”  A federal report written by 13 government agencies late last year said climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century, damaging everything from human health to infrastructure and agricultural production. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on climate change and has indicated his intention to withdraw from a global pact to fight it, dismissed the report after its release, saying “I don’t believe it”. Wheeler said he had been briefed on the assessment, but was waiting for further briefings from his staff before taking a public position on its findings. Wheeler defended his record at EPA, which has been largely defined by moves to undo or weaken Obama-era environmental regulations. He cast the agency’s rollbacks as a way to reduce the regulatory burden on business while also protecting air and water quality for Americans. Among his accomplishments, Wheeler last year finalized a proposal to replace Obama-era federal curbs on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with a new rule placing much of that power in the hands of states.  He has also overseen the EPA’s gutting of the justification for Obama-era mercury emissions limits, a proposal to reduce the number of waterways under federal protection, and efforts to lower targets for vehicle fuel efficiency.  Democrats pressed Wheeler on whether his EPA work was in any way linked to his previous lobbying on behalf of energy companies like underground coal giant Murray Energy, a vocal proponent of reduced environmental and safety regulation. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, held up photos of Wheeler attending meetings between Murray’s Chief Executive Robert Murray and Trump administration officials, and asked Wheeler for a full accounting of the number of such meetings he had arranged for the coal company. Wheeler said he would provide a written response. Industry representatives and Republican lawmakers have largely praised Wheeler for his deregulatory stance. “He understands how the regulatory process works and the type of effort that is required to develop effective and legally defensible regulatory reforms,” said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at industry-focused law firm Bracewell and a former EPA air administrator. Environmental groups have taken a different view.  Activists briefly interrupted Wheeler’s testimony on Wednesday shouting “Shut down Wheeler, not the EPA,” and several were arrested after demonstrating outside the hearing room.

2019-01-16,"(Reuters) - A big Pacific storm is set to dump up to seven feet of snow in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains and several inches of rain elsewhere in the state on Wednesday and Thursday, compounding the flood risk after earlier rain storms blew through the state. “The big one is rolling in late morning today, that’s for darn sure,” said meteorologist David Roth with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Police in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties ordered evacuations Tuesday from areas damaged by last year’s wildfires because of the risk heavy rain would trigger mud and debris flows on charred hillsides. Significant road closures and travel delays were possible in the Los Angeles area given risks of flash flooding and rockslides, the NWS reported. An earlier storm moved over Southern California on Tuesday, with about 2 inches of rain in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and up to 4.5 inches in the Santa Monica Mountains, the NWS reported. The new storm brewing out at sea will probably bring areas north of Santa Barbara up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of rain. As much as seven feet of snow was possible over 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The weather is a boon for California’s farmers and ski areas, given most of the state is recovering from years of drought, according to the United States Drought Monitor.  The wild weather is the result of moisture-laden winds from the Pacific known as “atmospheric rivers.”  The first storm will reach the U.S. Midwest and Northeast on Thursday and Friday, gathering more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The second storm will hit the central and eastern United States through the weekend, forecasters said.

2019-01-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The risk that global efforts to tackle climate change will fail has risen despite concerns about powerful storms, floods, and droughts, a survey released by the World Economic Forum said on Wednesday, days before its annual gathering in Davos.  The annual Global Risks Report, which incorporates the survey, highlighted several top risks for 2019 including massive incidents of data fraud and theft and large scale cyberattacks.  But the top risk by likelihood in the survey was extreme weather, in a survey of 1,000 experts from government, business, academia and non-governmental organizations. And the risk that failure by governments to limit the magnitude of climate change and adapt to it has risen to second place in terms of both likelihood and impact, compared to only fifth place and fourth place in those categories last year in the survey.  “Of all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe,” said the report.  After 200 countries, including the United States, agreed to tackle climate change in 2015 at U.N. talks in Paris, worries in the survey about governmental failure to tackle global warming fell.  But that has changed after U.S. President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his intention to pull out of the Paris agreement, a move he emphasized in 2018. In addition, deadly wildfires in Greece and California and hurricanes in Florida and North Carolina were frequently in the news. “People ... are beginning to understand increasingly the gravity of the situation and that the Paris Agreement, even if fully implemented, cannot be seen as a panacea,” Aengus Collins, the report’s author and project leader told Reuters.  The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October said global temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures. And U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide spiked 3.4 percent last year after falling for the previous three, the Rhodium Group, an independent research group, said last week. Trump, who attended last year’s talks in Davos, plans to send Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the talks that begin Jan. 22 as he grapples with Democrats over a partial government shutdown. The report said rapidly growing coastal cities, particularly in Asia, are making people more vulnerable to climate change. A “vicious circle” of urbanization concentrates people and buildings in areas of potential damage, while also increasing risks, by destroying natural sources of resilience, such as mangrove forests, or increasing strain on groundwater reserves, it said.

2019-01-16,"* European bourses rise, British stocks slip * Investors see Brexit delay growing more likely * Sterling firms against the dollar * MSCI’s Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index little changed By Tom Wilson LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - World equity markets on Wednesday rode out the heavy parliamentary defeat for British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, as investors saw potential for legislative deadlock to force London to delay its departure from the EU. May’s government faces a no confidence vote on Wednesday after the shattering rejection left Britain’s exit from the European Union in disarray. May is expected to survive the vote but investors see little sign of breakthrough on the Brexit impasse. As a result, they are increasing betting on Britain being forced to postpone its planned March 29 exit, though few have any clarity on what that would mean for the country in the longer run. Markets had largely priced in the overnight defeat, and in early trade major European bourses mirrored overall resilience in Asian markets. There, stocks were also lifted by signs that China will take more steps to bolster its slowing economy and the U.S. Federal Reserve may pause its run of interest rate rises. “The evidence yesterday is that there is a quorum of (British) MPs who will do what’s required to avoid a no-deal Brexit,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. “So there’s a strong probability of an extension of Article 50 and that means there’s an increased probability of a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all.” With some expecting a delay to raise chances of a softer Brexit, for example based on the opposition Labour party’s idea of membership of a permanent customs union, sterling was flat against the dollar at $1.2860. “We do think it is unlikely that sterling will fall to fresh lows unless the current government falls, and that unlikely although the risk is not zero,” said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London. “Volatility is expected to remain high, but we do think that there is upside for sterling. Sterling is very cheap on the long-term basis, partly because of the probability of the no-deal Brexit.” The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat, while MSCI’s main European Index gained 0.3 percent. Britain’s leading equity index fell 0.1 percent in early trade, lagging European stocks which climbed 0.2 percent. The broader Euro STOXX 600 was up 0.3 percent, while indexes in Germany, France and Spain all rose. Earlier in the day MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.2 percent, with South Korea’s Kospi and Hong Long’s Hang Seng both scaling six-week highs. Asian shares had responded well to China’s central bank injecting a record amount of money into the country’s financial system. That underscored Chinese officials’ commitment to signal more measures to stabilise a slowing economy. Global markets have drawn succour from the resumption of Sino-U.S. trade talks, though scepticism over the absence of detailed progress was underlined overnight as the U.S. trade representative that he did not see any progress made on structural issues during U.S. talks with China last week. Investors are also betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will slow its interest rate hikes. On Tuesday U.S. policymakers agreed the Federal Reserve should pause further rate hikes until it is clear how much the U.S. economy will be held back by larger risks like slowing growth in China. Investors “are mainly focused on the outcome of the U.S.-China trade negotiations, but it may take more than a month before it will become clear,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo. The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 95.921, and lost 0.1 percent against the yen at 108.58 yen. The euro was steady against the dollar at 1.1418. The single currency has lost nearly 1.5 percent from a 12-week high hit on Jan. 10. In sovereign debt markets, British government bonds underperformed versus their German peers in early trade, with March gilt futures opening 30 ticks lower at 122.90, underperforming German Bund futures by around 10 ticks. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields dropped to an 11-month low of 2.543 percent at the start of January but have bounced back above 2.70 percent. Oil prices firmed after climbing about 3 percent in the previous session as expectations that OPEC-led supply cuts will tighten markets despite signs of a global economic slowdown. Brent crude oil futures were at $61.17 per barrel at 0904 GMT, 0.1 percent above their last close.

The cause of the halt is being investigated, he said. “There is no interruption to trains 1 and 2 and we continue to produce LNG and load cargoes,” he said. The outage is expected to boost Asian LNG prices LNG-AS that are currently at an eight-month low and their weakest for this time of year in at least two years due to a mild winter in East Asia, industry sources said. “It should lend some support to prices,” a Singapore-based LNG trader said. The mechanical issue is likely due to a heat wave sweeping across Australia, industry sources said, though this could not be confirmed with Chevron. Higher than usual temperatures have the potential to affect the cooling processes of an LNG plant. The past four days are all among Australia’s top 10 warmest days on record, according to the country’s Bureau of Meteorology in a tweet on Wednesday. Only one cargo loaded this week, with another currently loading from the Gorgon project at Barrow Island off Western Australia, compared with three last week and five the week before, shipping data from Refinitiv Eikon showed. The three-train Gorgon project, one of the world’s largest natural gas projects, can produce 15.6 million tonnes of LNG annually from its three trains, according to Chevron’s website. Chevron is the Gorgon project operator, with its Australian subsidiary holding a controlling 47.3 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell each have a 25 percent share, and the rest is held by Japan’s Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA .

Iran has agreed to sell crude oil to India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer, in exchange for rupees after sanctions imposed by the United States blocked its access to the global financial system. The oil-rich country must spend those rupees on Indian goods and Iran does not produce enough of the protein-rich soymeal domestically. Higher meal exports will support Indian soybean prices and limit the complaints from farmers that had demanded relief from low prices from the government, which faces elections by May. India’s soymeal exports to Iran could jump to 450,000 tonnes during the 2018/19 fiscal year ending in March, up from just 22,910 tonnes during the previous fiscal year, B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors’ Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based industry body for oilseed processors, said this week. Exports could rise to 500,000 tonnes during the next fiscal year if the sanctions remain, he added. “Iran has started buying aggressively due to the sanctions and it seems demand will remain there in coming months,” said Mehta. India started paying Iran for oil imports in rupees after receiving a six-month waiver from the sanctions that started in November. India wants to continue buying oil from Iran since it offers free shipping and an extended credit period, while Iran will use the rupee funds to mostly pay for Indian exports. Iran is paying a premium of as much as 10 percent compared to other buyers since the country was struggling to secure soymeal from other sellers and keen to use oil payments, said an exporter based at Indore in central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. “We have to charge a premium as many times payments get delayed,” he said. During the previous U.S. sanctions, India settled 45 percent of its Iranian oil payments in rupees and the remainder in euros. But this time New Delhi wanted to make all payments in rupees to reduce its trade deficit with Iran. Local soybean prices have jumped 10 percent in just three weeks as oil mills started procuring the oilseed to fulfill the export orders for Iran. However, soymeal prices have also jumped and made Indian exports less lucrative for traditional buyers such as South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Bangladesh. Indian soymeal was available at about $400 per tonne on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, compared to $330 for South American supplies, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. “In coming months Thailand and Vietnam are likely to switch to Brazil and Argentina. Their supplies are cheaper even after factoring in higher freight cost,” the dealer said. Still, India’s soymeal exports could jump 35 percent in the 2018/19 fiscal year to 1.6 million tonnes, estimates the SEA’s Mehta.

Crude output from the world’s top oil importer will stabilise at 190 million tonnes in 2019, the same level as last year, analysts from the research unit of China National Petroleum Corp said on Wednesday. That forecast indicates that China’s oil majors could struggle to ramp up domestic production and boost reserves despite a call from President Xi Jiping for them to step up their contributions to national energy security. China’s state oil and gas producers PetroChina, Sinopec Corp and CNOOC have vowed to increase their domestic oil and gas drilling in the wake of such calls. The nation’s fuel markets will remain oversupplied, the CNPC forecast showed, with China expected to add 32 million tonnes of new refining capacity in 2019. A worsening glut in local markets could force refiners to ask for larger export quotas, the analysts said, with total refined products exports likely to climb 19 percent from last year to 48.6 million tonnes. Diesel consumption is expected to fall to 158 million tonnes from 159.8 million last year, while gasoline demand is seen growing 3.6 percent to 131.9 million tonnes. The country’s natural gas demand will reach 308 billion cubic metres (bcm), CNPC said. That marks an 11.4-percent climb from 2018, although the pace of growth would be down from 16.6 percent recorded previously. Domestic gas production is expected to reach 170.8 bcm by 2019, according to the forecast.

2019-01-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - The value of traded global markets for carbon dioxide (CO2) allowances soared 250 percent last year to a record high of 144 billion euros ($164 billion), analysts at Refinitiv said on Wednesday. The overall figure was pushed higher by the soaring cost of carbon permits in Europe’s Emissions Trading System, (ETS) which more than trebled last year from 8 euros a tonne to around 25 euros. “In Europe we attribute the price rise mainly to anticipation of the Market Stability Reserve that came into effect in January 2019: it will significantly tighten the supply,” the analysts said in an annual global market report. The European Emission Trading System (ETS) charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit. The ETS has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis, but this will be addressed by new measures including the Market Stability Reserve, which from this year will remove some surplus allowances from the market. “We see 2018 as an outlier when it comes to price increase in one single year, and do not expect a repetition of such steep path in 2019,” said Anders Nordeng, senior carbon analyst at Refinitiv and a contributor to the report. A total of 9 billion carbon permits were traded globally in 2018, up 45 percent on the previous year, the analysts said. The European market accounted for 90 percent of the total value of globally traded carbon permits, with North American trading schemes making up 9 percent, the report said. Volumes and traded value grew in North America in both the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), “largely in anticipation of new rules in both trading systems for when they enter new trading periods starting in 2021.” the analysts said. The emerging markets in China and South Korea still see very limited trading, despite the fact that their emission trading systems cover vast emissions volumes, the analysts said.

2019-01-16,"PARIS, France, Jan 16 (Reuters) - French electricity grid operator RTE on Wednesday called for the restart of EDF’s Cordemais coal power plants, which have been halted by a strike, as a bout of particularly cold weather looms. Workers at French state-controlled utility EDF’s Cordemais 1,200 MW 4 and 5 units went on strike on Jan. 11, to protest against government plans to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2022. The RTE said the shutdown of those Cordemais units, and planned and extended outages at EDF’s two 1,300 MW Flamanville nuclear reactors, had led to an unprecedented tight supply in the west of the country in the heart of winter. “The weather conditions forecast in western France has led RTE to anticipate an increase in electricity consumption for the days of Jan. 17 and 18 in the region,” RTE said in a statement. The grid operator said the situation requires the mobilization of other power generation units in the area, including the Cordemais power plant, to ensure the security of electricity supply. It said it had requested that the plant should be available on Thursday and Friday. “At any time, RTE may ask certain production plants to start or increase their production, including during the case of a strike, if this is necessary to secure electricity supply,” it added. French and European electricity contracts for delivery next week rose sharply on Wednesday as forecasts showed consumption was expected rise due to the expected cold weather. France, unlike neighbour Germany, depends mostly on electricity for heating during prolonged cold spells. A 1 degree drop in average temperature below seasonal level, increases power demand by around 2.5 gigawatts, according to RTE.

2019-01-16,"* PetroChina sells spot Yamal cargoes in Europe * Volumes to stay in Europe due to low Asian demand By Ekaterina Kravtsova LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - China’s top oil and gas company PetroChina is selling spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes on the European market from Russia’s Yamal plant, adding to a flood of volumes to the continent amid subdued Asian demand, trade sources said. PetroChina’s increased presence in Europe is an example of how Asian energy companies are expanding their role as LNG traders, engaging in LNG transactions globally. The early start-up of Yamal LNG’s second and third trains, or production lines, in 2018 raised spot volumes from Russia and helped PetroChina boost its European market presence, selling LNG from its 20 percent share of the project’s spot volumes. PetroChina has offered cargoes mainly to northwest Europe this winter, with buyers that include trading houses Vitol and Trafigura, as well as UK oil major BP, two sources said. Regular volumes from Yamal ensure a more stable presence in Europe for PetroChina, the publicly traded arm of China National Petroleum Corp. Last winter, PetroChina also traded some spot volumes from Yamal LNG Train 1. However, a spike in Yamal LNG production at the end of 2018 to 16.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) has allowed PetroChina to compete for high-profile buyers with another Yamal LNG shareholder, Novatek, and U.S. producers. This winter has seen Europe become a prime destination for spot LNG cargoes, amid weak Asian demand and increased shipping costs to transport LNG between the Atlantic and Pacific basins. Russia’s Novatek has a 60 percent share of Yamal LNG spot cargoes and has been offering up to two cargoes a week to European buyers, a source close to the matter said. PetroChina’s sales are organised via tenders open to a limited number of participants, an LNG trader said, adding that the tenders are being held almost every week this winter. France’s Total, which also has a 20 percent share of Yamal spot LNG, has not been marketing the volumes, sources said. With a low spread between European gas and Asian LNG prices, some traders and brokers expect PetroChina’s spot volumes to stay in Europe for most of this year. “There is still a very high interest (for spot LNG volumes in Europe), unlike last winter,” an LNG buyer in Europe said. PetroChina has a 20-year offtake deal from Yamal for 3 mpta, aimed at delivery in China only and expected to start this year. That deal is part of a total 14.8 mtpa from Yamal LNG that is committed to Total, PetroChina, Russia’s Gazprom, Spain’s Naturgy and Novatek, Total’s website says.

2019-01-16,"BERLIN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Germany’s coal-mining states might get more compensation than initially expected for the country’s planned exit from coal, according to participants in a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel. The meeting, which took place on Tuesday, was positive and could result in an agreement in the next 10 days on a roadmap for Germany’s exit from coal, Saxony-Anhalt state premier Reiner Haseloff said. “I think that’s possible,” Haseloff said. A government-appointed committee, dubbed the coal commission, is working on a plan on how to phase out brown coal mining and coal-fired power plants without leaving affected regions structurally weak and with thousands of job losses. Operators of such plants include RWE and Uniper , which have asked for fair compensation should their plants be mothballed or closed ahead of time. Manufacturers may also ask for compensation should electricity prices rise as a result of lower supply from comparably inexpensive coal-fired plants. The commission pledged 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in support in a draft agreement published last year, while affected German states have called for several tens of billions of euros. Michael Kretschmer, Saxony’s state premier, said that the message that more support was needed had sunk in during Tuesday’s meeting, which was also attended by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz. “Everyone knows it is not enough,” Kretschmer said referring to the proposed 1.5 billion euros in support. The commission plans to publish its findings on Jan. 25 and no later than Feb. 1, including a timeline for when Germany’s last coal-fired power station will go offline.

But the Left Party said it would try to pull the plug on Lofven if his government swung too far to the right, raising that prospect that Lofven will struggle to deliver on an agenda that includes tax cuts and labour market reform.   “We have an agreement with four parties and I plan to deliver on that,” Stefan Lofven told reporters. “What the Left Party decides to do...that is up to them.” September’s election delivered a hung parliament with neither major bloc able to rule without the support of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the white-supremacist fringe and who hold the balance of power.   After months of wrangling, Lofven agreed a historic deal bringing together the Social Democrats and the Greens - who were part of Lofven’s previous minority coalition - with the Centre and Liberal parties from the centre-right Alliance. Lofven, who intends to govern again with the Greens, has promised to drive a sharp swing to the right in Swedish politics, the steep price to be paid for enlisting Centrist and Liberal support. However, he risks being held hostage by the Left Party, which supported his previous government but pledged to seek to bring down Lofven if he proposes bills to loosen up the tightly regulated labour market or ease rent control rules, taboos for the centre-left until now. “The Left Party has the power of veto over this government,” Ulf Kristersson, the head of the Moderate Party told reporters, saying his right-wing party would try to topple Lofven’s government at the first opportunity.  “We will not save a government that we think should never have taken power.” But if Lofven fails to deliver on the package of market-friendly measures, he risks losing the support of the Centre and Liberals, leaving him facing a difficult task of finding the middle ground in the coming months.     “You cannot exclude the chance that we will have another crisis,” said Henrik Ekengren Oscarsson, a political scientist at University of Gothenburg.

2019-01-16,"SANDEFJORD, Norway, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Austria’s OMV and partners plan to invest up to $6 billion initially to develop the Arctic Wisting oil find, Norway’s northernmost oil discovery, which could start production within a decade, a senior executive said on Wednesday. OMV owns a 25 percent stake in the Wisting license and the other stakeholders are Norway’s Equinor, Norwegian state-owned firm Petoro and Japan’s Idemitsu. OMV said on Monday that the recoverable resource estimate of the find had increased to 440 million barrels of oil, from 350 million barrels previously, after drilling of an appraisal well at the site in 2017. Knut Mauseth, head of OMV’s Norwegian subsidiary, told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy conference on Wednesday that the group plans an initial investment of 40 billion-50 billion Norwegian crowns ($4.7 bln-$5.9 bln) to develop the find. Trade publication Petro.no was first to report the preliminary cost estimate. Wisting is Norway’s northernmost oilfield, located 300 kilometres (186 miles) north of the Nordic country’s mainland. Mauseth said a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel would be used as a production facility and oil from the field would be exported from the field by tankers. A decision on the type of FPSO would be taken in 2020, with production expected to start in 2026, he said. The Norwegian government is keen for oil firms to develop new oil and gas in the Barents Sea and is considering building an oil terminal on mainland Norway to handle oil exports from offshore fields. Mauseth, however, said OMV did not believe a terminal would be economically viable. “If it makes sense, we are prepared to consider that, but so far the numbers haven’t been favourable, it’s not economic to do it that way,” he told Reuters. On other projects, OMV plans this year to drill one appraisal well at its Hades/Iris gas and condensate discovery in the Norwegian Sea, one of the largest finds off Norway in 2017, Mauseth said. The discovery, near the Equinor-operated Morvin field, so far is estimated to hold 6.2-34.1 billion cubic metres of gas and 1.2-8.2 million cubic metres (7.5-51.6 million barrels) of condensate. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the state agency managing the Nordic country’s oil and gas resources, said the discovery was expected to have a significant upside. “If it (the appraisal well) provides good news, then we have another development project,” Mauseth said. $1 = 8.5386 Norwegian crowns

2019-01-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global growth is slowing and the world economy is headed for a recession in 2019 unless something happens to give it renewed momentum. The OECD’s composite leading indicator fell to just 99.3 points in November, its lowest since October 2012, and down from a peak of 100.5 at the end of 2017. Growth momentum has been easing for some time in Britain, Canada, France and Italy and there were tentative signs of slackening momentum in the United States and Germany in November. The composite indicator is likely to fall even further when data for December are published next month, given the weakness already revealed in equity markets and business surveys. The OECD composite leading indicator has been weakening consistently for the last year and now points unambiguously to a contraction ahead. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HfQKH5) In the last 50 years, whenever the index has fallen below 99.3, there has almost always been a recession in the United States (1970, 1974, 1980, 1981, 1990, 2001 and 2008). The one exception was the weakening of the index in 1998, when the United States continued to grow, despite the weakening global economy in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. Even in this case, however, the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee noted “the economy has been holding up but is now showing clear signs of deterioration.” “When we feed this information into our various models, they inevitably, as we might expect, engender a quite considerable softening.” The observations are contained in the transcript of an unusual, out-of-cycle conference call held by the Federal Open Market Committee in September 1998. One week later, the Federal Reserve responded to signs of a weakening economy by cutting U.S. interest rates. Most of the world’s major economies outside the United States showed clear signs of slackening growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. Even in the United States, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index for December showed the sharpest deceleration in growth since the recessions of 2008 and 2001. Global trade volumes showed signs of slowing towards the end of 2018 after strong growth in 2017. Air freight through Hong Kong International Airport, the world’s busiest air cargo hub and a proxy for global trade, was down 1.6 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Air freight volumes in Hong Kong were down by a massive 5 percent in December compared with the same month a year earlier, according to the Civil Aviation Department. Most economists now forecast a period of slower growth in 2019 but policymakers have expressed hope for a soft landing rather than an outright recession. Policymakers almost always aim for a soft landing, in an effort to maintain business and consumer confidence, but there are good reasons to be sceptical about the scenario. Experience shows the economy is characterised by a significant number of positive feedback mechanisms which amplify booms and slumps. Expansions tend to accelerate as business investment, employment, incomes, consumer spending and equity prices reinforce each other. Once the economy starts to lose momentum, however, all these factors tend to interact with each other in the opposite direction to intensify the slowdown. A soft landing is still possible but a hard landing is more likely unless something happens to kickstart global growth. If policymakers want to avoid a recession, they have two principal options: (a) cut U.S. interest rates to ease global financial conditions; or (b) conclude a trade agreement between China and the United States to ease trade tensions and boost business confidence. But unless policymakers intervene with one of these alternatives, the global economy’s momentum will continue to slacken and push it towards recession. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2019-01-16,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Jet Airways (JET.NS) said on Wednesday it is in talks with its lenders to resolve its debt problems, amid increasing prospects of a bailout by major shareholder Etihad Airways. Shares in Jet, which has been hit by intense competition, a depreciating rupee and high oil prices and said it was now looking at a cash injection by stakeholders and board changes, closed more than 8 percent lower. Representatives of the two airlines were due to meet with creditors, led by Jet’s biggest lender State Bank of India (SBI.NS), in Mumbai to discuss a proposal that involves Etihad increasing its stake, a source familiar with the situation said. However, India’s civil aviation secretary, R N Choubey, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Mumbai that control of Jet would need to remain in domestic hands. “Under no circumstances will we allow the substantial ownership and effective control to be busted,” he said, adding that even if Etihad’s stake is raised to 49 percent, the regulator will need to be satisfied that control was local. CNBC-TV 18 reported that Etihad had offered to buy Jet shares at a 49 percent discount and immediately release $35 million to bail out the troubled carrier, citing a letter to SBI from the Abu Dhabi airline’s CEO Tony Douglas. Jet will not be able to fund its operations beyond the next week, the CNBC-TV 18 report cited Douglas as saying. Etihad wants Jet’s founder and Chairman, 69-year-old Naresh Goyal, to step down from the board and his stake to be slashed to 22 percent from 51 percent, CNBC-TV 18 reported. Under Indian capital markets rules, Etihad would be required to make an open offer to shareholders for a majority of the shares once its stake goes past 25 percent, something the Abu Dhabi airline is seeking an exemption from, CNBC-TV 18 said. Choubey said that the ministry had not received a request from Jet and Etihad for such an exemption.  Jet’s chief executive, Vinay Dube, declined to take comment at the aviation conference in Mumbai, while an Etihad spokesman also declined to comment. A source close to Jet said it will not take delivery of any more Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX planes until a resolution plan is agreed.

May’s government faces a no confidence vote at 1900 GMT after the shattering rejection of her Brexit blueprint on Tuesday evening left Britain’s exit from the European Union in disarray. May is expected to survive the vote, sponsored by the main opposition Labour Party, but investors could see scant sign of a breakthrough in the Brexit impasse. As a result, they are increasingly betting on Britain being forced to postpone its planned March 29 exit, though few have any clarity on what that would mean for the country in the longer run. Stock markets had largely priced in the overnight defeat, and for the most part held on to early gains that mirrored earlier resilience in Asian markets. There, stocks had shrugged off May’s defeat and were lifted by signs that China will take more steps to bolster its slowing economy and the U.S. Federal Reserve might pause its run of interest rate rises. “Markets seem to be pricing in a greater probability of a ‘soft Brexit’,” said Azad Zangana, a European economist and strategist at Schroders. “However, we believe that investors are getting ahead of themselves.” The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, ceded early gains to slip 0.1 percent, while European stocks gained 0.2 percent. French and Spanish bourses edged up, while Germany’s main index lost 0.1 percent. Britain’s main equity index dropped as much as 0.6 percent with investors shifting focus from Brexit to results and news of mergers and acquisitions. Expectations of a softer Brexit - perhaps incorporating the Labour Party’s idea of membership of a permanent customs union - gave support to the pound. Sterling held at a two-month high against the euro and was largely flat against the dollar after seesawing in a broad 1.5 percent trading range overnight. By shortly after midday, the pound was trading at 88.62 pence per euro, its strongest level since late November, and was down 0.1 percent at $1.2851. “We do think it is unlikely that sterling will fall to fresh lows unless the current government falls, and that is unlikely although the risk is not zero,” said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London. Tan said sterling is valued relatively cheaply, in part because of the lingering possibility that Britain could crash disruptively out of the EU without a deal. Asian shares had responded well to China’s central bank injecting a record amount of money into its financial system. That underscored Chinese officials’ commitment to signalling more measures to stabilise a slowing economy. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi and Hong Long’s Hang Seng both scaled six-week highs. Global markets have drawn succour from the resumption of Sino-U.S. trade talks, though scepticism over the absence of detailed progress was underlined overnight as the U.S. trade representative said that he saw no headway made on structural issues during U.S. talks with China last week. Investors are also betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will slow its planned interest rate hikes. On Tuesday U.S. policymakers agreed the Federal Reserve should pause further hikes until it is clear how much the U.S. economy will be held back by larger risks such as slowing growth in China. Investors “are mainly focused on the outcome of the U.S.-China trade negotiations, but it may take more than a month before it will become clear”, said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo. The dollar was buoyant, gaining 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 95.921, and climbing 0.2 percent against the yen at 108.58 yen. The euro slipped 0.4 percent against the dollar to 1.1280. The single currency has lost nearly 1.5 percent from a 12-week high hit on Jan. 10. In sovereign debt markets, British government bonds underperformed versus German peers in early trade, with March gilt futures opening 30 ticks lower at 122.90, lagging German Bund futures by around 10 ticks. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields dropped to an 11-month low of 2.543 percent at the start of January but have since bounced back above 2.70 percent. Oil prices slid into the red after climbing about 3 percent in the previous session on expectations that OPEC-led supply cuts will tighten markets despite signs of a global economic slowdown. Brent crude oil futures were at $60.34 per barrel by late morning, down 0.5 percent from their last close.

2019-01-16,"(Adds U.S. secretary of state comment, background) MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday Moscow was alarmed by U.S. talk of some kind of possible U.S. military option for Venezuela and accused Washington of leaning on the opposition there to block talks with the government. Lavrov, addressing his annual news conference, said the U.S. approach to Venezuela showed U.S. efforts to try to undermine governments around the world it didn’t like were continuing. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has indicated its support for an opposition leader, ratcheting up pressure on Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro as he embarks on a disputed second term. In 2017, Trump said he didn’t rule out a “military option” to put an end to what he regards as economic chaos in Venezuela, a close Russian ally, in comments that brought widespread condemnation. The U.S. has also criticized Moscow for launching military flights to Venezuela, rebukes that the Kremlin has rejected. Venezuela’s opposition-run Congress this week declared Maduro a “usurper” as Washington weighed recognizing the leader of the Congress, Juan Guaido, as the country’s legitimate president, two people familiar with the matter said. Pompeo on Wednesday said the United States, which has already imposed sanctions on Maduro and a number of his top allies, backed the opposition’s action. “We congratulate, recognize & support the courage of #Venezuela’s National Assembly to formally declare #Maduro a ‘usurper’ of democracy & to transfer executive responsibilities to the National Assembly,” Pompeo wrote on Twitter. Over the weekend, Pompeo called Maduro’s government illegitimate and said the United States would work with like-minded countries in Latin America to restore democracy in Venezuela.

2019-01-16,"WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers will grill U.S. President Donald Trump’s new pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday over his past coal lobbying, but have little hope of blocking his confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump nominated EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to run the agency permanently last week, a pick that could provide him another avid supporter of his deregulatory and pro-fossil fuels agenda without the constant criticism over alleged mismanagement that plagued Wheeler’s predecessor Scott Pruitt. A Washington insider with years experience as a top aide to Republican Senator and climate skeptic Jim Inhofe, Wheeler has been running the EPA since July, when Pruitt resigned in a flurry of criticism over his expensive travel and use of resources and staff for personal matters. Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee running Wednesday’s confirmation hearing said they would press Wheeler on his past lobbying, which includes work for underground coal giant Murray Energy - a vocal proponent for reduced environmental and safety regulation. They are also likely to needle Wheeler about his record so far at EPA, which has largely been a follow through on Pruitt’s moves to undo or weaken Obama-era environmental regulations - including on power plant pollutant emissions. “I urged him to restore public trust in the agency by heeding lessons of the past and by remedying some of Scott Pruitt’s most egregious actions and proposals. He has not done so,” said Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the committee. Industry representatives and Republican lawmakers, however, have largely praised Wheeler for his deregulatory stance, arguing the EPA has for years imposed overly-burdensome requirements on businesses that have hurt growth. “He understands how the regulatory process works and the type of effort that is required to develop effective and legally defensible regulatory reforms,” said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at industry law firm Bracewell and former EPA Air Administrator. Environmental groups, including Moms Clean Air Force - an organization that advocates for children’s environmental health - plan to attend Wednesday’s hearing in protest. Dominique Browning, a member of the group, wrote in a New York Times op-ed on Monday that Wheeler “should not be entrusted with protecting us from harm” and that his recent move to weaken mercury limits by downplaying their benefits was harmful.

2019-01-16,"DETROIT, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Executives at the major U.S. automakers are pressing the Trump administration and California to agree on standards for fuel efficiency and carbon emissions through 2025, as risks increase that a deadline for setting national standards will pass without a deal. Automakers are already entering the time frame when decisions should be made about what engines and fuel-saving technology, such as hybrids or fully electric cars, will be in use in 2021 and beyond, executives said. In August, the Trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2025 and stripping California of the ability to impose stricter rules. The administration may also eliminate compliance credits that automakers get for making electric vehicles. Trump’s proposed freeze would result in 500,000 barrels per day more oil consumption by the 2030s. The administration says it would reduce regulatory costs for automakers by more than $300 billion over the next decade. A group of about 20 U.S. states, led by California, has challenged the administration proposal as unlawful and promised to sue if federal regulators move forward with the freeze. The administration is supposed to finalize the new rules by the end of March in order for the softer requirements to take effect by the 2021 model year, but some automakers and officials question if it will meet that deadline in the wake of the partial government shutdown. Most automakers oppose freezing the requirements, but also want relief from Obama-era standards that called for a roughly 5 percent annual reduction in carbon emissions - targets that translate to fuel efficiency requirements for various classes of vehicles. “Pick the middle. Pick 2.5 percent and get on with life,” Jim Lentz, chief executive officer of Toyota Motor Corp’s North America subsidiary, told Reuters at the Detroit auto show this week. Lentz told Reuters last month he was concerned that automakers are stuck between California and the White House. “I kind of feel like this is the OK Corral and we’re the settlers walking across the middle,” Lentz said. Ford Motor Co, which floated a compromise proposal last year to other automakers, is still pushing for a deal, Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. told Reuters. “We’ve been very clear and very open that we want one national standard, we want California at the table,” Ford said. “We’re not asking for a rollback, but we’ve got to get everybody at the table, especially California.” Detroit automakers have the most at stake. General Motors Co , Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV generate the bulk of their global profits from sales of fuel-thirsty large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States. Big trucks are front and center at the Detroit auto show, where Fiat Chrysler’s Ram brand is displaying a gleaming Ram “Power Wagon” heavy duty truck on a pedestal at its show exhibit, and GM’s GMC brand is featuring its newly redesigned Sierra Denali luxury pickup line. Fiat Chrysler, Ford and GM have all discontinued or planned to drop small and medium-sized sedans from their lineups to focus on trucks and SUVs. But Asian automakers that have more efficient fleets are also seeking a middle ground. Henio Arcangeli, a senior vice president at the U.S. unit of Honda Motor Co Ltd, said without a national deal “the consumer’s going to lose.” Mitch Bainwol, who heads the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing major automakers, said a deal makes the most sense but “time is running out. It has always been true that the biggest impediment to a deal is politics ... A successful negotiation is a win for everyone – more carbon reduction for California, a stronger and pro-job economic context for the administration and common sense certainty for our industry.” (Reporting by David Shepardson in Detroit.

2019-01-16,"ZAGREB, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Croatia will press on with a planned floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal project in the northern Adriatic despite a low number of binding bids from gas buyers, Energy Minister Tomislav Coric said on Wednesday. Croatia is trying to diversify its energy sources but late last year received few bids for the use of the LNG terminal on the northern Adriatic island of Krk, which cast some doubt over its viability. “It is a strategic project and is being implemented within that context. It is planned to be used by several countries, not just Croatia, and is part of the European Union plans to diversify energy sources,” Coric told the parliament while answering a deputy’s question. He did not elaborate on how the government planned to financially support the LNG terminal which is tentatively seen as starting operations from the beginning of 2021. The floating terminal has a planned capacity of 2.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year, while Croatia received binding bids amounting to 0.52 bcm. Coric also said Croatia had also received the letters of intent for use of the terminal from some Hungarian companies. The terminal is being partially financed by the European Union as part of EU efforts to diversify away from Russian energy imports. The targeted markets are countries in central and southeastern Europe. The value of the terminal is seen at 250 million euros ($285 million), with the EU providing just over 120 million euros. The rest was originally planned to be financed on commercial terms. Croatia annually consumes gas volumes slightly higher than the terminal’s planned capacity. Domestic production, which has fallen in recent years, accounts for slightly more than 40 percent of the country’s requirements. $1 = 0.8775 euros

2019-01-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Analysts have increased their forecasts for prices in Europe’s carbon market to 2021 as supply cuts begin to bite, but warned that short-term prices will be volatile due to uncertainty about Britain’s departure from the European Union. EU Allowances (EUAs) are expected to average 27.00 euros/tonne in 2019 and 32.83 euros/tonne in 2020, according to a survey of seven analysts polled by Reuters. COMMODITYPOLL54 The forecasts were up 17.3 percent and 21.8 percent, respectively, from prices given in October, when the projections were for 23.01 euros in 2019 and 26.96 euros in 2020. Analysts increased their forecasts for 2021 to an average of 27.26 euros/tonne, up 4.4 percent. The European Emission Trading System (ETS) charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit. Prices trebled last year, with utilities increasing hedging ahead of supply cuts coming into effect from 2019 and as more speculative traders entered the market. The ETS has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis, but this will be addressed by new measures including the Market Stability Reserve, which from this year will remove some surplus allowances from the market.  “As 2019 is the first year of the operation of the market stability reserve (MSR), this will be still the most important factor impacting the carbon market,” said Sandrine Ferrand, analyst at Engie Global Markets. Analysts at Berenberg, who had the most bullish forecasts, said the MSR will lead to a deficit of 400 million tonnes of carbon permits in 2019. “And this is not a one-off year – the EU ETS system has just begun a decade of deficits,” said Berenberg analyst Lawson Steele. In the shorter term however, several analysts warned that prices, now around 23.00 euros/tonne CFI2Zc1, will be volatile due to uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union.  British lawmakers voted on Tuesday against Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, leaving the country no clearer on its exit plan, and with the government facing a no confidence vote later on Wednesday. “If the UK ends up leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March, it will discontinue its participation in the EU ETS,” analysts at Refinitiv said. “Such outcome would be overall bearish for EUA prices in the short term as UK installations could be expected to offload their surplus allowances and unwind hedges,” the analysts said.

2019-01-16,"(Repeats with no changes) By Erwin Seba HOUSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Buoyed by concluding a big pay raise for steel workers last month, a United Steelworkers union top negotiator squares off on Wednesday against oil companies seeking to win a 24 percent wage hike for 30,000 refinery and chemical employees. The stakes are high for the union and oil industry, which scored big profits last year from refining and chemicals. The talks are the first since 2015 when a stalemate led to rolling strikes that sent more than 7,000 workers off their jobs at 12 U.S. refineries and three chemical plants. The union’s co-negotiator, USW International Vice President Tom Conway, is a 6-foot-tall former Bethlehem Steel millwright with a reputation as a bulldog, according to associates. He faces negotiators from Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s U.S. arm, which has represented the oil industry in talks since 1997. Conway led USW negotiations last year with U.S. Steel Corp that got hourly employees a 14 percent raise over four years. The USW is seeking a three-year agreement with the oil industry that would replace the pact that expires on Feb. 1. The union’s proposals include an 8 percent annual wage increase for each year of the contract. Union members with four years’ experience earn about $40 an hour. The contract covers 30,000 workers at plants operated by Shell, Marathon Petroleum Corp, BP Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp, Valero Energy Corp, and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp and Delek US Holdings Inc. Refiners enter talks enjoying high profits from near-full plant utilization rates and record product exports that have lifted margins. “We look forward to a productive set of talks with the USW and will bargain in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable agreement,” said Shell spokesman Ray Fisher. Fisher declined to discuss the terms that the company would offer. In addition to higher pay, the union is seeking improved job security, health and safety conditions including the number of consecutive days that employees must work, officials have said. Conway, son of a union member and a U.S. Air Force veteran, declined to be interviewed. But in remarks at a union convention in 2017, he described his negotiating philosophy as a battle with corporations to get the benefits workers deserve. “Collective bargaining makes them sit and share with us what we rightfully have a right to demand,” he said at the Las Vegas meeting. “Be ready for it, because the fights will come whether we want them or not. But when the fights do come, we can win those fights.” Conway helped lead workers through the 2015 strike, triggered when oil-company negotiators failed to ask for an extension of talks after the prior contract expired, said former USW International Vice President Gary Beevers. “He is an excellent negotiator and an asset to the team,” Beevers said of Conway. Conway is part of a two-man team with USW National Oil Bargaining Chairman Kim Nibarger. Failure to reach a deal could have widely felt impact. During the 2015 strike, the 12 refineries cut production by as much as 50 percent, reducing gasoline supply during the spring build-up during the summer driving season.

2019-01-16,"(Reuters) - A big Pacific storm is set to dump up to seven feet of snow in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains and several inches of rain elsewhere in the state on Wednesday and Thursday, compounding the flood risk after earlier rain storms blew through the state. “The big one is rolling in late morning today, that’s for darn sure,” said meteorologist David Roth with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Police in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties ordered evacuations Tuesday from areas damaged by last year’s wildfires because of the risk heavy rain would trigger mud and debris flows on charred hillsides. Significant road closures and travel delays were possible in the Los Angeles area given risks of flash flooding and rockslides, the NWS reported. An earlier storm moved over Southern California on Tuesday, with about 2 inches of rain in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and up to 4.5 inches in the Santa Monica Mountains, the NWS reported. The new storm brewing out at sea will probably bring areas north of Santa Barbara up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of rain. As much as seven feet of snow was possible over 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The weather is a boon for California’s farmers and ski areas, given most of the state is recovering from years of drought, according to the United States Drought Monitor.  The wild weather is the result of moisture-laden winds from the Pacific known as “atmospheric rivers.”  The first storm will reach the U.S. Midwest and Northeast on Thursday and Friday, gathering more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The second storm will hit the central and eastern United States through the weekend, forecasters said.

2019-01-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The risk that global efforts to tackle climate change will fail has risen despite concerns about powerful storms, floods, and droughts, a survey released by the World Economic Forum said on Wednesday, days before its annual gathering in Davos.  The annual Global Risks Report, which incorporates the survey, highlighted several top risks for 2019 including massive incidents of data fraud and theft and large scale cyberattacks.  But the top risk by likelihood in the survey was extreme weather, in a survey of 1,000 experts from government, business, academia and non-governmental organizations. And the risk that failure by governments to limit the magnitude of climate change and adapt to it has risen to second place in terms of both likelihood and impact, compared to only fifth place and fourth place in those categories last year in the survey.  “Of all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe,” said the report.  After 200 countries, including the United States, agreed to tackle climate change in 2015 at U.N. talks in Paris, worries in the survey about governmental failure to tackle global warming fell.  But that has changed after U.S. President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his intention to pull out of the Paris agreement, a move he emphasized in 2018. In addition, deadly wildfires in Greece and California and hurricanes in Florida and North Carolina were frequently in the news. “People ... are beginning to understand increasingly the gravity of the situation and that the Paris Agreement, even if fully implemented, cannot be seen as a panacea,” Aengus Collins, the report’s author and project leader told Reuters.  The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October said global temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures. And U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide spiked 3.4 percent last year after falling for the previous three, the Rhodium Group, an independent research group, said last week. Trump, who attended last year’s talks in Davos, plans to send Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the talks that begin Jan. 22 as he grapples with Democrats over a partial government shutdown. The report said rapidly growing coastal cities, particularly in Asia, are making people more vulnerable to climate change. A “vicious circle” of urbanization concentrates people and buildings in areas of potential damage, while also increasing risks, by destroying natural sources of resilience, such as mangrove forests, or increasing strain on groundwater reserves, it said.

2019-01-16,"* European bourses rise, British stocks slip * Investors see Brexit delay growing more likely * Sterling firms against the dollar * MSCI’s Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index little changed By Tom Wilson LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - World equity markets on Wednesday rode out the heavy parliamentary defeat for British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, as investors saw potential for legislative deadlock to force London to delay its departure from the EU. May’s government faces a no confidence vote on Wednesday after the shattering rejection left Britain’s exit from the European Union in disarray. May is expected to survive the vote but investors see little sign of breakthrough on the Brexit impasse. As a result, they are increasing betting on Britain being forced to postpone its planned March 29 exit, though few have any clarity on what that would mean for the country in the longer run. Markets had largely priced in the overnight defeat, and in early trade major European bourses mirrored overall resilience in Asian markets. There, stocks were also lifted by signs that China will take more steps to bolster its slowing economy and the U.S. Federal Reserve may pause its run of interest rate rises. “The evidence yesterday is that there is a quorum of (British) MPs who will do what’s required to avoid a no-deal Brexit,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. “So there’s a strong probability of an extension of Article 50 and that means there’s an increased probability of a softer Brexit or no Brexit at all.” With some expecting a delay to raise chances of a softer Brexit, for example based on the opposition Labour party’s idea of membership of a permanent customs union, sterling was flat against the dollar at $1.2860. “We do think it is unlikely that sterling will fall to fresh lows unless the current government falls, and that unlikely although the risk is not zero,” said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London. “Volatility is expected to remain high, but we do think that there is upside for sterling. Sterling is very cheap on the long-term basis, partly because of the probability of the no-deal Brexit.” The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat, while MSCI’s main European Index gained 0.3 percent. Britain’s leading equity index fell 0.1 percent in early trade, lagging European stocks which climbed 0.2 percent. The broader Euro STOXX 600 was up 0.3 percent, while indexes in Germany, France and Spain all rose. Earlier in the day MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.2 percent, with South Korea’s Kospi and Hong Long’s Hang Seng both scaling six-week highs. Asian shares had responded well to China’s central bank injecting a record amount of money into the country’s financial system. That underscored Chinese officials’ commitment to signal more measures to stabilise a slowing economy. Global markets have drawn succour from the resumption of Sino-U.S. trade talks, though scepticism over the absence of detailed progress was underlined overnight as the U.S. trade representative that he did not see any progress made on structural issues during U.S. talks with China last week. Investors are also betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will slow its interest rate hikes. On Tuesday U.S. policymakers agreed the Federal Reserve should pause further rate hikes until it is clear how much the U.S. economy will be held back by larger risks like slowing growth in China. Investors “are mainly focused on the outcome of the U.S.-China trade negotiations, but it may take more than a month before it will become clear,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo. The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 95.921, and lost 0.1 percent against the yen at 108.58 yen. The euro was steady against the dollar at 1.1418. The single currency has lost nearly 1.5 percent from a 12-week high hit on Jan. 10. In sovereign debt markets, British government bonds underperformed versus their German peers in early trade, with March gilt futures opening 30 ticks lower at 122.90, underperforming German Bund futures by around 10 ticks. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields dropped to an 11-month low of 2.543 percent at the start of January but have bounced back above 2.70 percent. Oil prices firmed after climbing about 3 percent in the previous session as expectations that OPEC-led supply cuts will tighten markets despite signs of a global economic slowdown. Brent crude oil futures were at $61.17 per barrel at 0904 GMT, 0.1 percent above their last close.

The cause of the halt is being investigated, he said. “There is no interruption to trains 1 and 2 and we continue to produce LNG and load cargoes,” he said. The outage is expected to boost Asian LNG prices LNG-AS that are currently at an eight-month low and their weakest for this time of year in at least two years due to a mild winter in East Asia, industry sources said. “It should lend some support to prices,” a Singapore-based LNG trader said. The mechanical issue is likely due to a heat wave sweeping across Australia, industry sources said, though this could not be confirmed with Chevron. Higher than usual temperatures have the potential to affect the cooling processes of an LNG plant. The past four days are all among Australia’s top 10 warmest days on record, according to the country’s Bureau of Meteorology in a tweet on Wednesday. Only one cargo loaded this week, with another currently loading from the Gorgon project at Barrow Island off Western Australia, compared with three last week and five the week before, shipping data from Refinitiv Eikon showed. The three-train Gorgon project, one of the world’s largest natural gas projects, can produce 15.6 million tonnes of LNG annually from its three trains, according to Chevron’s website. Chevron is the Gorgon project operator, with its Australian subsidiary holding a controlling 47.3 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell each have a 25 percent share, and the rest is held by Japan’s Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA .

2019-01-16,"* Iran buys soymeal with rupees received from oil sales * India’s exports seen at 450,000 T vs 22,910 T yr ago * Soybean prices jump on demand, makes soymeal expensive By Rajendra Jadhav MUMBAI, Jan 16 (Reuters) - India’s soymeal sales to Iran are set to spike as the oil producer uses the rupees it receives for its crude exports to cover its animal feed demand amid U.S. sanctions that have crimped the country’s ability to import necessities. Iran has agreed to sell crude oil to India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer, in exchange for rupees after sanctions imposed by the United States blocked its access to the global financial system. The oil-rich country must spend those rupees on Indian goods and Iran does not produce enough of the protein-rich soymeal domestically. Higher meal exports will support Indian soybean prices and limit the complaints from farmers that had demanded relief from low prices from the government, which faces elections by May. India’s soymeal exports to Iran could jump to 450,000 tonnes during the 2018/19 fiscal year ending in March, up from just 22,910 tonnes during the previous fiscal year, B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors’ Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based industry body for oilseed processors, said this week. Exports could rise to 500,000 tonnes during the next fiscal year if the sanctions remain, he added. “Iran has started buying aggressively due to the sanctions and it seems demand will remain there in coming months,” said Mehta. India started paying Iran for oil imports in rupees after receiving a six-month waiver from the sanctions that started in November. India wants to continue buying oil from Iran since it offers free shipping and an extended credit period, while Iran will use the rupee funds to mostly pay for Indian exports. Iran is paying a premium of as much as 10 percent compared to other buyers since the country was struggling to secure soymeal from other sellers and keen to use oil payments, said an exporter based at Indore in central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. “We have to charge a premium as many times payments get delayed,” he said. During the previous U.S. sanctions, India settled 45 percent of its Iranian oil payments in rupees and the remainder in euros. But this time New Delhi wanted to make all payments in rupees to reduce its trade deficit with Iran. Local soybean prices have jumped 10 percent in just three weeks as oil mills started procuring the oilseed to fulfill the export orders for Iran. However, soymeal prices have also jumped and made Indian exports less lucrative for traditional buyers such as South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Bangladesh. Indian soymeal was available at about $400 per tonne on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, compared to $330 for South American supplies, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. “In coming months Thailand and Vietnam are likely to switch to Brazil and Argentina. Their supplies are cheaper even after factoring in higher freight cost,” the dealer said. Still, India’s soymeal exports could jump 35 percent in the 2018/19 fiscal year to 1.6 million tonnes, estimates the SEA’s Mehta.

Crude output from the world’s top oil importer will stabilise at 190 million tonnes in 2019, the same level as last year, analysts from the research unit of China National Petroleum Corp said on Wednesday. That forecast indicates that China’s oil majors could struggle to ramp up domestic production and boost reserves despite a call from President Xi Jiping for them to step up their contributions to national energy security. China’s state oil and gas producers PetroChina, Sinopec Corp and CNOOC have vowed to increase their domestic oil and gas drilling in the wake of such calls. The nation’s fuel markets will remain oversupplied, the CNPC forecast showed, with China expected to add 32 million tonnes of new refining capacity in 2019. A worsening glut in local markets could force refiners to ask for larger export quotas, the analysts said, with total refined products exports likely to climb 19 percent from last year to 48.6 million tonnes. Diesel consumption is expected to fall to 158 million tonnes from 159.8 million last year, while gasoline demand is seen growing 3.6 percent to 131.9 million tonnes. The country’s natural gas demand will reach 308 billion cubic metres (bcm), CNPC said. That marks an 11.4-percent climb from 2018, although the pace of growth would be down from 16.6 percent recorded previously. Domestic gas production is expected to reach 170.8 bcm by 2019, according to the forecast.

Trading in Asian equities on Wednesday broadly mirrored overnight resilience in the face of the latest setback for British Prime Minister Theresa May. European shares are also seen steady to firmer, with spread-betters looking to a rise of 0.3 percent in Germany’s DAX and a flat opening in Britain’s FTSE and France’s CAC. British opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called a vote of no confidence in May’s government, to be held at 1900 GMT, after her Brexit plan was soundly defeated in parliament on Tuesday. But many investors expect May to survive, and to subsequently pursue delaying the planned March 29 departure date, even as few investors have any clarity on what that would mean in the longer run. Sterling was last trading at $1.2862 on the dollar, having quickly recovered from its brief losses to $1.2670 late on Tuesday right after May’s plan was voted down by a bigger-than-expected margin. “I would say the rough market consensus now is an extension of the deadline. Beyond that, things are still opaque, including on how many months it will be postponed or whether they will have a second referendum,” said Shuntaro Ikeshima, chief manager of currency trading at Mitsubishi Trust Bank. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.14 percent in late trade, with Australian shares hitting two-month highs and South Korea’s Kospi and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng reaching six-week tops. Equity markets had rallied on Tuesday after Chinese officials came out in force to signal more measures to stabilise a slowing economy. Underscoring that commitment, China’s central bank earlier on Wednesday injected a record amount of money into the country’s financial system.. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.55 percent while China’s blue-chip CSI300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares was flat, holding on to most of the previous session’s gains, when it rose nearly 2 percent. In Tuesday’s session on Wall Street, the S&P 500 rallied 1.1 percent as technology and internet stocks gained on Netflix Inc’s plans to raise fees for U.S. subscribers. The S&P 500 communication services index, which includes Netflix and Alphabet Inc, jumped 1.7 percent, while the technology sector tacked on 1.5 percent. The China stimulus hints and dovish remarks by one of the U.S. central bank’s most hawkish policymakers also helped lift the U.S. market. Ester George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and a voting member of the Fed’s policy-setting committee this year, made the case for patience and caution on interest rate hikes to avoid choking off growth. SINO-U.S. TRADE TALKS Sentiment was partly undermined by reported comments from United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that he did not see any progress made on structural issues during U.S. talks with China last week. Investors “are mainly focused on the outcome of the U.S.-China trade negotiations, but it may take more than a month before it will become clear,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “It’s hard for market sentiment to turn one way or the other, whether a recovery or decline, as long as it remains unclear what outcome there will be.” Lighthizer’s caution helped force the dollar to remain on the defensive against the Japanese yen, a safe-haven currency that’s often preferred by traders during times of market and economic stress. The greenback lost 0.2 percent at 108.50 yen. Elsewhere in the currency market, the euro was almost flat at $1.1413. The single currency has lost nearly 1.5 percent from a 12-week high hit on Jan. 10. Against the British pound, it stood near seven-week low against the pound at 88.69 pence. U.S. Treasuries steadied after a choppy overnight session. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes last stood at 2.711, a tad lower from 2.718 percent at the U.S. close on Tuesday. In commodities, oil prices held firm after 3-percent gains on Tuesday on China’s promise of more stimulus. Worries over slowing China demand have been one of the key factors in the recent slide in oil. International Brent crude oil futures were last up 6 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $60.70 a barrel. U.S. crude futures were almost flat at $52.13 a barrel. Spot gold was 0.2 percent up at $1,291.5, holding not far off a seven-month peak of $1,298.60 scaled on Jan. 4.

May’s crushing loss overnight triggered political upheaval that could lead to a disorderly exit from the European Union on March 29 or even to a reversal of the 2016 decision to leave. Investors’ short-term focus is now on a confidence vote on May’s government by lawmakers later in the day.. Sterling was last trading at $1.2841 on the dollar, off about 0.1 percent. It had rallied more than a cent from the day’s lows against the dollar with the sizable defeat for May seen forcing Britain to pursue different options. “Elections tend to cause sell offs in markets because they’re inherently uncertain events but the UK situation is more complex than a normal vote,” said Stephanie Kelly, senior political economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. “The margin of Theresa May’s defeat and the call of no confidence do matter for markets in the short term,” she said adding she expected sterling to be volatile until the result of the no-confidence vote is known. May’s defeat put pressure on UK-focused exchange-traded funds. A Tokyo-traded FTSE 100 ETF was down about one percent on Wednesday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a touch lower, having swung up on Tuesday after Chinese officials came out in force to signal more measures to stabilise a slowing economy. Australian shares rose 0.2 percent while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.7 percent by midday. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares fell 0.1 percent on Wednesday. Despite the small loss, it managed to hold on most of the previous session’s gains, when it rose nearly 2 percent. China’s central bank on Wednesday made its biggest daily net cash injection via reverse repo operations on record — totalling $82.73 billion — in another sign of growing concern over risks facing the slowing economy. In Tuesday’s session on Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent as technology and internet stocks gained on Netflix Inc’s plans to raise fees for U.S. subscribers. The S&P 500 communication services index, which includes Netflix and Alphabet Inc, jumped 1.7 percent, while the technology sector tacked on 1.5 percent. The China stimulus hints and dovish remarks by one of the U.S. central bank’s most hawkish policymakers also helped lift the U.S. market. Ester George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and a voting member of the Fed’s policy-setting committee this year, made the case for patience and caution on interest rate hikes to avoid choking off growth. SINO-U.S. TRADE TALKS Sentiment was not helped by reported comments from United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that he did not see any progress made on structural issues during U.S. talks with China last week. Investors “are mainly focused on the outcome of the U.S.-China trade negotiations, but it may take more than a month before it will become clear,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “It’s hard for market sentiment to turn one way or the other, whether a recovery or decline, as long as it remains unclear what outcome there will be.” Lighthizer’s caution helped force the dollar to remain on the defensive against the Japanese yen, a safe-haven currency that’s often preferred by traders during times of market and economic stress. The greenback lost 0.2 percent at 108.50 yen. Elsewhere in the currency market, the euro lost 0.1 percent to $1.1405, extending its decline against the dollar for a fifth session. The single currency has lost nearly 1.5 percent from a 12-week high hit on Jan. 10. U.S. Treasuries steadied after a choppy overnight session. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes last stood at 2.711, a tad lower from 2.718 percent at the U.S. close on Tuesday. In commodities, oil prices rose about 3 percent overnight supported by China’s promise of more stimulus. Worries over slowing China demand have been one of the key factors in the recent slide in oil. International Brent crude oil futures were last off 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $60.57 a barrel. U.S. crude futures were down 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $51.99 a barrel. Spot gold was 0.1 percent lower at $1,288.40, holding not far off a seven-month peak of $1,298.60 scaled on Jan. 4.
