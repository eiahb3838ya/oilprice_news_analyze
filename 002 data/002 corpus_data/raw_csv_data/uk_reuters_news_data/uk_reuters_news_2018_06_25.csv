2018-06-25,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s leftist presidential front-runner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, may allow more oil and gas fields to be auctioned off if elected on July 1, a top adviser said on Monday, striking a moderate tone days before the election. Lopez Obrador, who has a commanding poll lead ahead of Sunday’s vote, has been a longstanding critic of the 2013-14 energy reform that opened up oil and gas production and exploration to private and foreign investors.  However, Alfonso Romo, his top business adviser and nominee for chief of staff, said Lopez Obrador was open to permitting more auctions if the process had not been tainted by wrongdoing. Lopez Obrador has vowed to review outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto’s energy overhaul, and threatened to cancel the reform if he found corruption in the awarding of contracts. “The auctions are going to continue if everything we find is alright,” Romo said, noting that Lopez Obrador himself had taken the same message to investors. “He said it in New York. Andres Manuel, not Alfonso Romo.” Romo, a business tycoon, reiterated his vote of confidence in the energy sector liberalisation, saying he felt “very at ease” with the oil contracts he had reviewed so far. Members of Lopez Obrador’s campaign team have sent out mixed signals on the reform, with some arguing Mexico should not be giving up its oil to private or foreign interests. Romo said that Mexico needed to lower energy dependence on the United States, and if the private sector could help it do so, it should. He also said a Lopez Obrador government should consider allowing private investment in oil refining. A Lopez Obrador government would also like to strengthen a “very undervalued” peso currency by boosting investor confidence and the rule of law, Romo said. He took pains to stress that a Lopez Obrador government did not plan to resort to intervention for that purpose. “This government’s straitjacket will be that we don’t want to raise the debt,” Romo said. “And we will achieve it.” The peso sank to a 1-1/2-year low this month, hit by a broad dollar rally, a deadlock in talks between the United States, Canada and Mexico to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement and some nerves ahead of the election. Lopez Obrador, 64, was runner-up in the last two campaigns and has long been the foremost anti-establishment voice in Mexico. Some of his proposals, such as suspending the oil and gas auctions, have unnerved investors. Romo said the process of revising the energy reform and its contracts should ideally be completed by about October. The next president will take office at the start of December. Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, holds a double-digit lead in all major opinion polls, although one survey on Monday showed his lead narrowing slightly.

2018-06-25,"NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. buyout group Advent agreed to buy General Electric Co’s distributed power unit for $3.25 billion (£2.5 billion), the companies said on Monday, marking GE’s exit from a growing segment of the power business. GE had put the unit, which makes Jenbacher and Waukesha brand reciprocating gas engines, up for sale as part of a three-year plan to exit about $20 billion in industrial assets. GE hopes to book as much as $10 billion in such proceeds this year. The sale, expected to close in the fourth quarter, highlights the growing demand for reciprocating engines by utilities, which pair them with wind and solar generators. Because the engines start quickly, they can fill in when wind and sun falter and then be shut off when not needed, conserving fuel. Large power turbines cannot start as quickly and so must be kept spinning at partial power even when wind or solar electricity supplies are ample. “Distributed Power is a terrific asset,” said Ranjan Sen, managing partner at Advent International. “The business has significant growth potential on a global scale and talented employees all over the world.” Advent plans to “invest substantially” in critical areas such as the product portfolio, service network and digitization, he said, to build up the company’s market position.  Advent prevailed against engine maker Cummins in the final stages of the auction. Engine makers Kohler and Wartsila and investor KKR, had dropped out earlier, people close to the matter said. GE stock slid 2.3 percent to close at $12.75 in New York. While the sale was not likely to have much effect on GE’s stock, it “checks the box on another divestiture-simplification action by (GE) CEO John Flannery,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray. Advent’s purchase values the unit at about 11.2 times 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of just below $290 million, said a person close to the matter. Last year it posted revenue of $1.3 billion.  Faced with weak profits and calls to be broken up, GE is aggressively cutting costs, selling units and strengthening its balance sheet under a new board and managers. Selling the industrial gas engine business is expected tohelp streamline GE’s $35 billion-a-year power division, whose profit plunged last year as sales of power plants and services fell sharply. Jenbacher and Waukesha engines range from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts. One of GE’s key customers is the German port city of Kiel, which is using 20 Jenbacher engines to create a 190 megawatt plant, replacing a coal-fired plant opened in 1970, GE said.  The engines will supply heat and electricity to homes and buildings, with power supplemented by nearby wind turbines, GE said. The last of the Jenbachers was delivered in March and the old coal plant is due to shut down next year, GE said.  Finland’s Wartsila, which makes similar engines, dropped out of talks for the unit several weeks ago, as it did not see enough synergies to allow it to pay the mooted price of as much as $3.5 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions.

2018-06-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets sank on Monday as the trade fight between the United States and other top economies escalated, and benchmark Wall Street indexes suffered their worst losses in more than two months while safe-haven investments gained. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday said forthcoming investment restrictions would apply “to all countries that are trying to steal our technology,” not just to China. Hours later, White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro walked back Mnuchin’s remarks, telling CNBC that the restrictions on investing in tech companies would just target China.  “People are scared,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. “The market does not like uncertainty, and a trade war is something that is difficult, if not impossible, to handicap.”  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 328.09 points, or 1.33 percent, to 24,252.8, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 37.81 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,717.07, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 160.81 points, or 2.09 percent, to 7,532.01. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 2.19 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 1.41 percent. Technology stocks bore the brunt of the damage.

Policymakers in China moved quickly to temper any potential economic drag from Beijing’s dispute with the United States. Its central bank said on Sunday it would cut the amount of cash some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points to spur lending to smaller firms. The European autos sector .SXAP was hit by trade tensions between Washington and Europe, falling 2.4 percent in a seventh straight day of losses after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he aimed to hike tariffs on European Union car imports by 20 percent. The index of global auto manufacturers .MIWO0AC00PUS fell 1.5 percent.  A senior European Commission official said on Saturday    the European Union would respond to any U.S. move to raise tariffs on cars made in the bloc.  Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) said on Monday it would move production of motorcycles shipped to the European Union from the United States to its international facilities and forecast the trading bloc’s retaliatory tariffs would cost the company $90 million to $100 million a year. The growing disputes have led investors to take refuge on safer ground.

2018-06-25,"(Adds details on train cargo and destination) June 25 (Reuters) - BNSF Railway Co on Monday said it could resume service Tuesday on a stretch of northwestern Iowa track damaged when a train left the track and crude oil spilled from derailed cars. The crude oil train derailed near Doon, Iowa, on Friday sending 32 rail cars off the track and spilling an estimated 230,000 gallons of oil into flood waters and toward a nearby river. Crews are nearly finished removing oil from damaged cars and repairing tracks, BNSF said in a statement. Its crews are using booms to contain the oil and skimmers to remove it from the waters, said BNSF, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The railroad said booms also have been placed “approximately five miles downstream to capture any oil that may have traveled with floodwaters through nearby fields.” The derailment occurred near where the tracks cross the Rock River. The train included 98 tank cars moving in total some 58,000 barrels of crude oil from Western Canada to Stroud, Oklahoma for oil producer ConocoPhillips, a Conoco spokesman said. The oil company said it expected minimal disruption to its shipments as a result of the accident. “The accident is a manifestation of increased crude-by-rail from Western Canada due to pipeline constraints,” said Kevin Birn, an energy analyst at IHSMarkit in Calgary. As of March, crude by rail out of Western Canada reached 170,000 barrels per day (bpd), compared with 155,000 bpd at the same time a year ago, he said. More Canadian oil is moving south on trains and trucks to the U.S. because of a lift in global oil prices encouraging more production and a lack of available pipeline space. Canada’s oil overall exports by rail averaged 4 million barrels a month in 2017. BNSF has not said what caused the train to leave the tracks, but the area has suffered flooding in recent days. There were no injuries and no fire resulting from the accident.

2018-06-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday as investors prepared for an extra 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil to hit markets after OPEC  agreed to raise production and as U.S. equity markets slipped on trade war fears. Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell 82 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $74.73 a barrel. U.S. light crude CLc1 settled at $68.08 a barrel, down 50 cents. “The trade tensions and overall global market concerns are what’s holding crude back today,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago.  U.S. stocks sank in a broad sell-off on escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. “The expectation that we’ll see more crude out of OPEC and that supplies in the U.S. will be tight because of the Syncrude outage ... is going to keep the market on edge,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group.  Losses in U.S. crude prices were limited by the likelihood that an outage at Syncrude Canada’s 360,000 bpd oil sands facility would last through July. The outage is expected to limit crude arriving at Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point of the U.S. futures contract.  This helped further shrink U.S. crude’s discount to global benchmark Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 to as small as $4.78. The spread was as wide as $11.57 on June 1, but had started contracting ahead of OPEC’s expected supply increase, analysts said. To view a graphic on US crude grades vs Brent and WTI, click: reut.rs/2MXa0Yp On Friday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed to modestly boost global oil supplies.  The group, which has been curbing output since 2017, said it would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction, largely due to unplanned disruptions in places including Venezuela and Angola. The head of Saudi oil giant Aramco said it has spare capacity of 2 million bpd and can meet additional demand in case of supply interruptions. Still, U.S. bank Goldman Sachs anticipates an oil market deficit. “Saturday’s OPEC+ press conference provided more clarity on the decision to increase production, with guidance for a full 1 million bpd ramp-up in 2H18,” Goldman said in a note on Sunday.   “This is a larger increase than presented Friday although the goal remains to stabilize inventories, not generate a surplus.”   U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the deal may not be enough.  “Obviously we’ve got a market that is stressed from a standpoint of supply,” Perry said, and the agreement “may be a little short” of what is needed.

2018-06-25,"NAIROBI, June 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The violent conflicts between farmers and semi-nomadic herders in Nigeria that left dozens of people dead over the weekend illustrate the intensifying pressure and competition for arable land in Africa, experts said on Monday. Fertile land that is dwindling due to climate change combined with a population boom are fueling conflicts across the continent, they said. The weekend deaths of at least 86 people in Nigeria’s central Plateau state are seen as part of an escalation of conflicts that have raged for years, often over land. Nigeria has one of the world’s fastest growing populations, rapidly approaching 200 million and expected to be bigger than the United States by 2050, according to United Nations estimates. With the Boko Haram jihadists’ insurgency in the last decade in Nigeria’s central and northern states, herders have been pushed south to populated farming areas, said Rinaldo Depagne, West Africa project director for the International Crisis Group (ICG). At least 2,000 people died annually in Nigeria’s Middle Belt due to communal land conflicts between cattle herders and farmers between 2011 and 2016, the ICG estimates. The weekend clashes are “the extension of the violence,” Depagne told Thomson Reuters Foundation. Africa’s arable land is being taken up by infrastructure, farmers and multinational agricultural firms seeking to produce food for a growing population, depriving herders of grazing reserves, Depagne said. “More people to feed means more agricultural settlement and less available land and water for herders. All of this tend to trigger more and more disputes,” he said. Relations between the nomadic Fulani herders and farming communities in Mali and Niger as well have been chaotic, with fights over cropland, grazing, water and migration routes, experts say. Climate change, bringing extreme weather, droughts and desertification, has increased conflict over land, said Tim Christophersen, coordinator of freshwater, land and climate at United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Both climate change and conflict can mean limited access to clean water, and that affects agricultural productivity, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We should stop the degradation of land and invest in restoring landscape,” he said, suggesting more strategies for resilience, crop diversification and more “climate-smart” agriculture. “We need to make societies more resilient by ensuring that people have alternative livelihoods that makes them use their land in a sustainable way,” he said. The drought and desertification have degraded pastures and dried up many natural water sources across Nigeria’s northern state, forcing herders south in search of grassland, Depagne said. The spread of conflict into the southern states is aggravating already fragile relations among the country’s major regional, ethnic and religious groups, he said. The south’s majority Christian communities resent the influx of predominantly Muslim herders, he said. Authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in central Plateau state after the weekend fighting. The violence in Nigeria’s diverse Middle Belt states has killed more people than the Islamist insurgency in Nigeria’s northeast, according to Reuters calculations.

2018-06-25,"HOUSTON, June 25 (Reuters) - A tanker that for more than a month was unable to deliver Russian crude to Venezuela’s PDVSA amid a dispute between the state-run firm and ConocoPhillips has discharged its cargo in the Caribbean, and a second vessel is soon to follow, according to Reuters data and a source with knowledge of the sales. Conoco in May got court orders to seize PDVSA’s assets, inventories and oil cargoes in the Caribbean to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration award. The measures were later partially revoked, but PDVSA has been unable to fully use its refining and storage facilities in the region, diverting cargoes that have contributed to export delays. Aframax tanker Advante Atom originally was to discharge Russian Urals crude in mid-May at PDVSA’s Bullenbay terminal in Curacao, where it would be re-exported to Cuba, one of several such cargoes since January. But the cargo was affected by the Conoco-PDVSA dispute and temporarily remained in Venezuelan waters to avoid being seized. On June 21, it discharged via a ship-to-ship transfer off the Cayman Islands, according to Reuters vessel tracking data. It was not immediately clear what company ultimately received the cargo. PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment. A second Russian crude cargo that was supposed to be delivered to PDVSA in May, on Aframax tanker British Cygnet, was moved to Aruba’s STS area in early June to transfer its load. It has waited for six weeks to deliver, according to the data. PDVSA exported 765,000 barrels per day of crude and refined products to customers in the first two weeks of June, a 32 percent decline compared with May, excluding shipments by two of the company’s joint ventures, which export separately. Manuel Quevedo, Venezuela’s oil minister and the state-run firm’s president, last week said the country expects to recover a portion of its lost crude output this year. But there are no early signs of a reversal in the declining trend. The number of active rigs fell to 28 in May versus 54 in the same month of 2017. Secondary sources quoted in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ monthly report estimated Venezuela’s oil production fell to 1.392 million bpd last month, the lowest since the 1950s. The lack of Venezuelan crude supply has forced the 335,000-bpd Isla refinery, owned by the Curacao government, to seek a temporary operator to replace PDVSA, which has not sent oil to the facility since late April.

2018-06-25,"MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said on Monday that those responsible for deadly attacks in the north of country where gangs wielding machetes have attacked police and religious leaders will be “neutralised”. Violence first broke out in Mozambique’s northern province of Cabo Delgado last October, with local residents reporting gangs attacking police stations, torching villages and executing religious leaders. “We will not rest until these perpetrators are neutralised and held accountable, so our Defence and Security Forces are on the ground, firm and relentless,” said Nyusi in a statement. Human Rights Watch (HRW) last week estimated that at least 39 people had been killed and more than 1,000 displaced since May. The United States and Britain have advised their citizens to steer clear of the area.

2018-06-25,"PARIS (Reuters) - French water and waste group Veolia has opened what it says is Europe’s first recycling plant for solar panels and aims to build more as thousands of tonnes of ageing solar panels are set to reach the end of their life in coming years.  The new plant in Rousset, southern France, has a contract with solar industry recycling organisation PV Cycle France to recycle 1,300 tonnes of solar panels in 2018 - virtually all solar panels that will reach their end of life in France this year - and is set to ramp up to 4,000 tonnes by 2022.  “This is the first dedicated solar panel recycling plant in Europe, possibly in the world,” Gilles Carsuzaa, head of electronics recycling at Veolia, told reporters.  The first ageing photovoltaic (PV) panels - which have lifespans of around 25 years - are just now beginning to come off rooftops and solar plants in volumes sufficiently steady and significant to warrant building a dedicated plant, Veolia said. Up until now, ageing or broken solar panels have typically been recycled in general-purpose glass recycling facilities, where only their glass and aluminium frames are recovered and their specialty glass is mixed in with other glass. The remainder is often burned in cement ovens.      In a 2016 study on solar panel recycling, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said that in the long term, building dedicated PV panel recycling plants makes sense. It estimates that recovered materials could be worth $450 million by 2030 and exceed $15 billion by 2050. The robots in Veolia’s new plant dissemble the panels to recuperate glass, silicon, plastics, copper and silver, which are crushed into granulates that can used to make new panels.  A typical crystalline silicon solar panel is made up of 65-75 percent glass, 10-15 percent aluminium for the frame, 10 percent plastic and just 3-5 percent silicon. The new plant does not recycle thin-film solar panels, which make up just a small percentage of the French market. Veolia said it aims to recycle all decommissioned PV panels in France and wants to use this experience to build similar plants abroad.  Installed solar capacity is growing 30 to 40 percent per year in France, with 53,000 tonnes installed in 2016 and 84,000 tonnes in 2017, Veolia said.  Worldwide, Veolia expects tonnage of decommissioned PV panels will grow to several ten of millions of tonnes by 2050. IRENA estimated that global PV waste streams will grow from 250,000 tonnes end 2016 - less than one percent of installed capacity - to more than five million tonnes by 2050. By then, the amount of PV waste will almost match the mass contained in new installations, it said.

2018-06-25,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Monday a deal between global oil producers to boost crude output reached last week may not be enough to relieve global oil markets that are stressed by supply constraints.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC countries reached an agreement on Saturday to moderately boost production after consuming countries including the United States had urged them to produce more. Saudi Arabia said the agreement would likely result in about 1 million barrels more oil output per day, or about 1 percent of global oil supplies.  The price of oil LCOc1 traded in London fell on Monday after the wider agreement, by $1.15 to $74.40 a barrel. On Friday they had risen $2.50 to $75.55 a barrel after OPEC only countries came to their own deal to boost output.  “Obviously we’ve got a market that is stressed from a standpoint of supply,” Perry told reporters. The rise in prices on Friday showed the agreement “may be a little short” of what is needed.  There are difficulties in getting crude oil to market in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, in Venezuela, which is struck with political turmoil, and in Angola, Perry said. In addition, the United States is asking oil consuming countries to reduce their purchases of oil from Iran, an OPEC member, as Washington re-imposes sanctions on the Islamic Republic.  Perry said the United States would do everything it can to keep gasoline prices in check.  But he said the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should only be used for supply emergencies and not as a tool to manipulate markets. Several sales of crude oil from the reserve have been mandated by laws passed by Congress to help balance the federal budget.

2018-06-25,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. coal mining companies are worried President Donald Trump’s intensifying trade dispute with China could hurt their booming export business, one of the ailing sector’s most important lifelines, according to industry players. Beijing this month added coal and other energy products to a list of U.S. goods facing import tariffs in retaliation for Trump administration levies. The measure has already dampened Chinese demand for U.S.-mined coal, multiple U.S. and Chinese industry sources said. For instance, trade sources said China National Building Material International, one of the biggest metallurgical coal importers in China, pulled back from supply talks with U.S. coal broker XCoal and miner Consol Energy (CEIX.N) shortly after Beijing’s announcement. A source familiar with the matter said Consol had been in talks with China to supply up to 1 million tons per year of metallurgical coal but would not confirm whether the deal would be delayed.  Officials at XCoal declined to comment.  “We’re obviously watching it closely, particularly given what a bright spot exports have been for our industry of late,” said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, which represents U.S. mining companies. “Anything that would chip away at the appetite for U.S. coal abroad would be of concern.” The U.S. Energy Information Administration said U.S. coal exports to Asia doubled from 15.7 million tons in 2016 to 32.8 million tons in 2017. Exports to China totaled 3.2 million tons in 2017, up from zero in 2015 and 2016, according to the EIA. The coal industry’s concerns mirror the unease spreading in U.S. farm country over unintended consequences of the Trump administration’s protectionist stance, which has roiled foreign market for American crops. The farm and coal industries are critical Trump supporters that the president and his Republican party are relying on to help them retain control of Congress in the mid-term elections in November. Steve Roberts, president of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, said Trump’s protectionism was a “dilemma” for his organization, which represents a number of companies benefiting from the export trade. “Because of our small population, we export far more than we consume,” he said.  “We are concerned about the momentum slowing down... We are literally holding our breath to make sure this dispute is part of a bigger picture... and the parties see the advantage of trade with each other.” Jason Bostic, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said he hoped the dispute would blow over, or at least that the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs would boost domestic demand for metallurgical coal. U.S. demand for met coal is currently about 23 million tons a year, and could rise if U.S. steel manufacturing increases. “We are walking a tight rope,” he said. The addition of coal to the list of more than 650 items facing higher tariffs from China also came as a shock to Chinese steel mills and trading firms. Just last month, Beijing had been encouraging them to buy more U.S. coal to narrow the trade gap, four sources with knowledge of the plan said. Coal operators like Pennsylvania’s Consol had been in talks with Chinese buyers, and hope those talks revive. “Long-term we think that coal will be part of the solution, with China buying U.S. coal to offset the trade deficit,” said Zach Smith, a spokesman for Consol.  A number of Appalachian operators are banking on it. In a May investor presentation, Corsa Coal (CSO.V) said it was aiming for 4 million tons per year of metallurgical coal sales by 2020 with 70 percent for export and 30 percent domestic. In its presentation, Corsa said Chinese and Indian infrastructure as well as a rising population were positive drivers for coking coal to serve growing demand for steel. Corsa Coal did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, Bluestone Coal (BSR.V), owned by the family of West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, announced it planned to hire 250 workers for two reopened mines and two new metallurgical mines in West Virginia. Some 70 percent of its coal is marketed for overseas export. A representative for Bluestone could not be reached for comment.

A U.S. government official on Sunday said the Treasury Department was drafting curbs that would block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. companies with “industrially significant technology.” Separately, a report by the Wall Street Journal said the U.S. Commerce Department and National Security Council were proposing “enhanced” export controls to keep such technologies from being shipped to China. The news sent equities sharply lower. “Trade wars typically have a negative impact on the markets. Markets don’t like uncertainty,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. In mid-morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 279.69 points, or 1.14 percent, to 24,301.2, the S&P 500 lost 31.82 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,723.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 136.59 points, or 1.78 percent, to 7,556.22. Technology stocks bore the brunt of the news, with the S&P technology index falling 1.5 percent, the most among the major S&P 11 sectors. The report hit Asian stocks overnight and in London the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.88 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.26 percent. Policymakers in China moved quickly to temper any potential economic drag from its dispute with the United States. Its central bank said on Sunday it would cut the amount of cash some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points. The European autos sector, was hit by trade tensions between Washington and Europe, falling 2.7 percent and set for its seventh straight day of losses after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he aimed to hike tariffs on EU car imports by 20 percent. The index of global auto manufacturers fell 1.34 percent. A senior European Commission official said on Saturday that the European Union would respond to any U.S. move to raise tariffs on cars made in the bloc. Harley-Davidson Inc said on Monday it would move production of motorcycles shipped to the European Union from the United States to its international facilities and forecast the trading bloc’s retaliatory tariffs would cost the company $90 million to $100 million a year. The growing disputes have led investors to take refuge on safer ground. The U.S. Treasury yield curve between 2-year and 10-year notes flattened to 33 basis points, the lowest level since 2007. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil fell as investors prepared for an extra 1 million barrels per day in output to hit the markets after OPEC and its partners agreed to raise production. Brent was last at $74.36, down 1.58 percent on the day. In the currency market, the dollar index fell 0.12 percent, with the euro up 0.26 percent to $1.1685. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.25 percent versus the greenback at 109.69 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3266, down 0.02 percent on the day. The Turkish lira rose on expectations of a stable government after Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party claimed victory in presidential and parliamentary polls. Bitcoin steadied after hitting seven-month lows over the weekend as the security of cryptocurrency exchange operators came under more scrutiny.

2018-06-25,"* New agreement signed as spring deadline expires * France, China still cannot agree on price * Most other nuclear nations gave up on reprocessing PARIS, June 25 (Reuters) - French state-owned nuclear fuel group Orano has agreed with China’s CNNC to do preparatory work for the sale of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant to the Chinese company, in the latest attempt to seal a deal that has been 10 years in the making. Orano said on Monday the agreement - which runs until the end of 2018 and covers work to be carried out by Orano to prepare the sale of the recycling plant - was confirmed during a visit by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to China. An Orano spokeswoman said the work would cost the French company about 20 million euros ($23.4 million) and cover in particular project management and quality control paperwork. She added talks about the plant were continuing, with the price being one of the remaining issues to be agreed. Negotiations about the 800 tonne capacity plant have been going on for a decade, with new agreements signed regularly, usually during Franco-Chinese diplomatic meetings. But so far the two parties have not been able to agree on a price for transferring the technology. Following a visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron in January, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal would be worth 10 billion euros ($12 billion) and that France had been given assurances a contract would be signed this spring. That deadline passed last week without a contract. Ten years ago, Orano - formerly called Areva - had hoped for 15 billion euros. Leading civil nuclear nations such as the United States, Britain and Japan have ended or are phasing out spent-fuel processing. France and Russia are the only two nations recycling spent fuel from nuclear reactors, but France no longer operates the breeder reactors which are suitable to use this fuel. Critics say that recycling increases the risk of nuclear proliferation, as it separates out plutonium, and is not cost effective because uranium is trading near decade lows. $1 = 0.8560 euros

2018-06-25,"OSLO (Reuters) - A fall in equities and oil markets knocked shares in Shelf Drilling (SHLF.OL) on their Oslo market debut on Monday, although the world’s largest owner of shallow water rigs was optimistic rig rates are set to rise. The Dubai-based company’s shares were trading at 63.64 Norwegian crowns at 1400 GMT, below their initial public offering (IPO) price of 65.35 crowns.  “I think it (the share price move) is more of a response to a broader market movement than anything specific to the company,” Chief Executive David Mullen said. Stocks in Asia and Europe fell on concerns about a trade dispute between the United States and other major economies, while Brent crude LCOc1 eased after a deal between OPEC and  other oil producers to increase production.  Shelf Drilling’s debut came four years after it abandoned plans to list in London in the wake of an oil price downturn. The company raised about $225 million in the offering, it said on Friday, the latest drilling firm to list in Oslo to raise capital. Mullen told Reuters on Monday the company expected to see higher rig rates in 2019 and more consolidation of the fragmented market. He forecast utilisation of marketed rigs would rise to near 80 percent by the end of this year from 74 percent currently, giving rig owners more leverage to ask for higher prices. “So going into 2019 we should see some pricing power, and some real price movements,” he said in an interview, adding the Middle East, North Sea and West Africa were the most promising regions for jack-up rigs. About 80 percent of Shelf Drilling’s current business relates to drilling extra wells at existing oilfields to help to  drain the reservoirs or to repair existing wells. As a recovery in crude oil prices increases oil companies’ interest in offshore exploration and field developments, Mullen plans to acquire more so-called premium rigs, better suited to search for new resources than standard specification rigs.  “Today we have eight premium jack-ups and we want to see that grow ... I would like to ultimately grow to a fleet of 15, maybe 20, premium jack-up rigs,” Mullen said. Mullen also said he expected more consolidation in the drilling rig market between small players, and big deals too. “I think you are going to see some big mergers ... but we are more interested in acquiring assets, not so much interested in doing broad M&A deals,” he said. Copenhagen-listed conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) is expected to try to sell its drilling arm, Maersk Drilling, but has not found a buyer so far. Mullen said Shelf Drilling itself was not seeking a broad deal with Maersk, but could be interested in buying some of the Danish company’s benign environment jack-up rigs.

2018-06-25,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil processor, said it has ceased sourcing from suppliers that are allegedly associated with a company that was accused by Greenpeace of causing deforestation.   Greenpeace had accused Gama, a palm oil business set up by Wilmar’s co-founder Martua Sitorus and his brother, of causing deforestation in Indonesia.  The environmental group said analysis of trade data showed that Wilmar traded palm oil from Gama, despite being aware that Gama was violating Wilmar’s No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policy by clearing rainforest.  “Wilmar must immediately cut off all palm oil suppliers that can’t prove they aren’t destroying rainforests,” said Kiki Taufik, global head of Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s Indonesian forests campaign.  Wilmar has as of June 20 ceased sourcing from all suppliers that are allegedly associated with Gama as identified by Greenpeace, it said in a statement on Monday.  It said it would not buy from any company that cannot prove to its satisfaction that they do not belong to Gama because of the alleged identified non-compliance with Wilmar’s NDPE policy.  It added that it has no control or management over Gama Corp. Wilmar executives with familial ties with Gama do not hold any decision-making power or influence on Wilmar’s sustainability policy. Wilmar promised in 2013 to seek to end purchases of palm oil grown on deforested land. In 2015, it opened its supply chains to outside scrutiny in a move that was lauded by environmentalists. Calls to the Gama offices in Jakarta went unanswered after business hours.  Concerns about the amount of forests and peat lands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years. Palm oil is used in products including margarine, soap and biodiesel.

2018-06-25,"(Repeats item issued earlier) * Private equity attracted by undervalued opportunities * Who’s next? Interest in Quadrant Energy - bankers * China shale group Sino Gas & Energy in play * Firms with LNG stakes eyed for consolidation By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, June 25 (Reuters) - Private equity firms are expected to drive a wave of merger activity in Australia’s gas sector, hunting for bargains amid soaring demand in China, rising domestic prices and a broader oil market recovery. The energy sector has dominated Australian M&A activity over the past 12 months, led by a spurned $10.8 billion bid for oil and gas producer Santos and a $9.8 billion bid for pipeline operator APA Group by Hong Kong’s CK Infrastructure. Still, the share prices of smaller companies in the sector have yet to fully reflect the sharp recovery in oil markets over the past year and gains from lower drilling costs, say bankers and consultants. “Private equity firms clearly see strong turnaround opportunities in the oil and gas sector. Stocks are trading below their earnings potential with serious upside,” said Perth-based Deloitte Consulting partner Bernadette Cullinane. U.S. firm Harbour Energy pursued Santos for a year before its bid ended in acrimony, while private equity fund Lone Star bid A$530 million ($392 million) in March for Australia’s Sino Gas & Energy Holdings, which has stakes in two shale gas projects in China. More deals are seen as small oil and gas companies look to fund new gas developments to feed the east coast market and bigger companies, like Santos, look to replenish their reserves, following years of cuts in exploration. “Most of the sub-billion market cap companies with reasonable 2P resources and cash flow or near term cashflow would be attractive to private equity funds,” said Eddie Rigg, head of corporate finance at Argonaut, who advised a private Chinese firm that lost out in a three-way bidding war for gas producer AWE Ltd in February. Such companies include Senex Energy, Central Petroleum, Cooper Energy and Strike Energy . Rigg predicted Sino Gas will attract a rival bid from a U.S., European or Asian group as most of the geological and well engineering risks on its project have been dealt with. “It’s a reasonably safe entry into a growing gas market,” he said. Australian domestic gas prices have more than doubled in the past three years as east coast supply has been sucked into exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to feed Asia-Pacific demand. China’s LNG imports, driven by a clean air push, are expected to jump 50 percent over three years to 57 million tonnes by 2020, according to Australian government forecasts. For investors, Australia is handy way to play into that growth. “Australia’s attractiveness as an oil and gas M&A and investment proposition is driven primarily by its low geopolitical and sovereign risk ... and of course its proximity to Asia’s energy demand centres,” said Deloitte’s Cullinane. The next likely target is in Australia’s west. Gas supplier Quadrant Energy, potentially worth A$3 billion, is attracting interest as one of its two owners, Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management, is looking to sell its stake, bankers say. Quadrant, co-owned by Macquarie Group, produces more than a fifth of the gas going into the domestic market in the state of Western Australia, has oil production and untapped gas reserves. Potential suitors include Santos. The appeal for Santos is that it knows the Quadrant business well as the companies share stakes in a number of gas fields, bankers and analysts say, although Santos may not want to risk alienating shareholders by splashing out on a deal so soon after having rejected a takeover. “Quadrant’s domestic business in Western Australia is a prized cash cow in Santos’ portfolio. Doubling down there makes sense,” said Wood Mackenzie analyst Saul Kavonic. Santos, Brookfield and Macquarie declined to comment. Within the next two years, there could be other deals on the west coast, where Woodside Petroleum and Chevron Corp are looking to develop new gas fields to feed their LNG plants. The biggest hurdle to their plans is the myriad of co-owners in their gas fields and LNG plants - all with competing priorities - making it difficult to agree on development plans. The best way to overcome that hurdle, analysts and bankers say, would be for Woodside or Chevron to buy out some of their partners, as Woodside did in February with the $744 million purchase of ExxonMobil’s stake in the Scarborough gas field. “Obviously if an interest owner in a particular part of the value chain no longer desires to participate, Chevron or other companies are always looking for opportunities to improve their portfolio,” Chevron’s Asia-Pacific exploration and production president Stephen Green said in a recent group interview.

2018-06-25,"(Repeats with no changes in text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Who can and who can't raise crude output within OPEC: reut.rs/2M8auJY By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 25 (Reuters) - If it were possible to boil the crude oil market down to just one determining factor for the coming months, it would be this: What will Saudi Arabia actually do? The Saudis appear to have emerged as the winners from last week’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and the subsequent talks between OPEC and its allies in the deal to restrict output. The outcome of the meetings would seem to indicate that crude oil supply should rise by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd). That’s based on the assumption that OPEC and allies will return to 100 percent compliance with the November 2016 cut of 1.8 million bpd from a current situation of over-compliance. However, the reality on the ground is that many OPEC countries lack the ability to pump their full quotas. Saudi Arabia is the only producer that can ramp out output significantly within a short period of time. The market consensus after the OPEC meeting in Vienna on June 22, and the talks with non-OPEC allies the following day, was that the agreements reached wouldn’t actually result in an extra 1 million bpd reaching global markets. While there is some debate on the likely increase in supply, the upper end of the range is around 600,000 bpd. The question is whether this would be enough to prevent prices from rallying again. Given that the Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, is going to have to provide the lion’s share of any increase in output, watching its export numbers and price signals in the coming months will be key. In fact, the Saudis already are supplying more crude, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. Saudi seaborne crude exports were 7.06 million bpd in May, the most in a year, the data shows. Prior to the November 2016 agreement, Saudi Arabia was regularly exporting more than 7 million bpd. But it’s also worth noting that only in two months, January and February in 2016, did the kingdom ship more than 7.6 million bpd. What this shows is that the Saudis definitely have the scope to export more crude, but boosting output above 7.6 million bpd on a sustained basis isn’t something they have done in recent years. The Saudis are on track to export more than 7 million bpd in June, with Thomson Reuters data estimating seaborne shipments of 7.1 million bpd. But it’s interesting to note that the Saudis have been somewhat vague when it comes to saying exactly how much more they will produce. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said after last week’s meetings that the kingdom’s state-controlled oil company will increase output by hundreds of thousands of barrels, with precise figures to be decided later. There is also some confusion over whether Saudi Arabia will be permitted, in terms of the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement, to over-produce its quota to make up for shortfalls from other members, such as Venezuela and Libya, currently unable to pump more. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said Saudi Arabia wouldn’t be allowed to pump more on behalf of Venezuela, meaning the kingdom “can increase its production by less than 100,000 bpd”. With no certainty on exactly who can produce what, it becomes more important than ever to monitor crude oil flows in coming months, and perhaps less important to hang on every word uttered by the various parties to the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement. Another factor often bypassed in the discussion is exports of refined fuels. Saudi Arabia’s exports of gasoline were around 350,000 bpd in the first four months of this year, according to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI). That’s up by around 100,000 bpd from last year’s average. Saudi shipments of gasoil averaged just under 800,000 bpd in the January to April period, about 200,000 bpd more than for 2017. For all oil products, the JODI data show that Saudi Arabia’s exports averaged 1.83 million bpd in the first four months of 2018, up 32 percent from the 1.39 million bpd recorded in the same period last year. What this shows is that Saudi Arabia is already boosting exports to global markets, but in the form of refined products rather than crude. That brings us back to the burning question for oil markets: How much more can, or will, the Saudis add to the global supply of both crude and refined products? There is certainly a risk in relying on the kingdom to virtually single-handedly balance supply and demand, thereby keeping prices in the sweet spot of around $70-$80 a barrel, which seems to be high enough to prevent fiscal problems in most producers, but low enough to prevent demand destruction.

2018-06-25,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Asian shares ease, U.S. stock futures down over half a percent * China, auto shares take brunt of trade tensions * European shares fall 1 pct * Oil prices drop by 2 pct as traders factor in OPEC output rise * Turkish lira rises more than 1 pct after Erdogan victory By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - World stocks sank on Monday, hit by worries over a worsening trade dispute between the United States and other leading economies, while crude oil prices fell by over two percent as traders factored in an output rise agreed by major exporters. The Wall Street Journal said U.S. President Donald Trump planned to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to China. The report hit Asian stocks overnight and in London the pan-European STOXX 600 index was down by one percent by afternoon trade in London. S&P500 mini futures fell as much as 0.6 percent while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell by one percent to 6-1/2-month lows. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.8 percent. Taking a particular hit on the trade tensions was the European autos sector, falling 1.9 percent and set for its seventh straight day of losses after Trump said on Friday he aimed to hike tariffs on EU car imports by 20 percent. MSCI’s All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent. As the threat of a full-blown trade war has grown, the gauge has fallen in five of the last six weeks. Last week it fell one percent - its biggest weekly drop in three months. “We suspect the Trump team will push ahead with these policies (which will elicit reciprocal tariffs from China and the EU) until U.S. equities start to crumble and polls move against Trump,” ING strategists wrote in a research note. A spread between approval and disapproval ratings of the U.S. President had reached its narrowest since March 2017, they noted. Chinese shares were among the biggest losers, falling 1.27 percent and tumbling 3.7 percent last week, as Trump threatened to hit $200 billion of Chinese imports with 10 percent tariffs. Policymakers in China moved fast to temper any potential economic drag from the dispute, as its central bank said on Sunday it would cut the amount of cash some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points. That reduction in reserve requirements, the third this year, had been widely anticipated by investors and is aimed at accelerating the pace of debt-for-equity swaps and spurring lending for smaller firms. Despite the move, the CSI300 Index of mainland Chinese shares lost 0.8 percent, edging near the one-year low it touched on Friday. Beijing has begun downplaying Made in China 2025, the state-backed industrial policy that has provoked alarm in the West and is core to Washington’s complaints about the country’s technological ambitions, diplomatic and Chinese state media sources said. The index of global auto manufacturers fell 0.7 percent. It lost 4.7 percent last week. Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on Friday on all imports of EU-assembled cars, a month after his administration launched an investigation into whether auto imports posed a national security threat. A senior European Commission official said on Saturday that the European Union would respond to any U.S. move to raise tariffs on cars made in the bloc. Oil shed some of the gains posted on Friday after OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed a modest increase in production from next month. They did not however announce a clear target for the output hike, leaving traders guessing how much more will actually be pumped. OPEC and non-OPEC said in a statement they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. “Saturday’s OPEC+ press conference provided more clarity on the decision to increase production, with guidance for a full 1 million bpd ramp-up in 2H18,” Goldman Sachs said in a note on Sunday. “This is a larger increase than presented Friday although the goal remains to stabilize inventories, not generate a surplus.” U.S. crude futures traded at $68.79 per barrel, down 0.3 percent for the day after Friday’s 4.6 percent rally. International benchmark Brent fell 1.5 percent, however, to $74.41 per barrel, giving up nearly half of its gains made on Friday. In the currency market the euro rose, up 0.2 percent at $1.1678. German business confidence deteriorated in June, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting the mood among company executives in Europe’s biggest economy was darkening in light of the threat of a global trade war. The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 109.60 yen, earlier hitting its lowest levels in two weeks as the Japanese currency firmed on concerns about the global trade frictions. The Turkish lira gained up to 1.6 percent on expectations of a stable government after Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party claimed victory in presidential and parliamentary polls. But his victory kept alive worries about inflation and the central bank’s independence given recent comments suggesting he wanted to take greater control of monetary policy. The lira traded at 4.68 to the dollar, up 1.7 percent from 4.6625 at the end of last week. Bitcoin steadied after hitting seven-month lows during the weekend as the security of cryptocurrency exchange operators came under more scrutiny. The digital currency fell as low as $5,780 overnight and last stood at $6,209.63 . Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Henning

2018-06-25,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Oil giant Saudi Aramco has spare capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd) and can meet additional oil demand in case of any interruption in supplies, the company head said on Monday, days after OPEC agreed a modest increase in oil output from July.  Aramco, the world’s third-largest crude oil producer, is producing about 10 million bpd and has the capacity to produce 12 million bpd, Amin Nasser, the company’s chief executive, said on the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), de facto led by Saudi Arabia, and non-OPEC producers including Russia agreed over the last few days on a modest increase in oil production from July, following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs.  “We have a healthy spare capacity ... that will be availed to meet additional demand and any interruptions in supply if it happens,” Nasser said.  Nasser expects OPEC’s decision to be implemented “very soon”, although he did not comment on Aramco’s likely output for the July-August period.  “Whatever is concluded as part of this agreement, we will fulfil,” he said.  OPEC and it’s non-OPEC allies met last week to review a pact to cut their combined output by 1.8 million bpd that was put into place at the beginning of 2017.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at the weekend OPEC and non-OPEC combined would pump roughly an extra 1 million bpd in coming months, equal to 1 percent of global supply.  Global consumers have grown increasingly worried over the past few months about oil supplies, with the United States vowing to renew sanctions against Iran, and Venezuela seeing a big drop in its output due to U.S. sanctions and an economic crisis.  Nasser was in Delhi to sign a deal allowing the United Arab Emirates’ Abu Dhabi National Oil Company [ADNOC.UL] to acquire a stake in a planned $44 billion refinery and petrochemical project on India’s west coast.      Nasser said the company’s is “almost there” in finalising the stake to be given to ADNOC.    Saudi Aramco is looking at “all options” to enter fuel retailing in India through partnerships with Indian oil companies and ADNOC, Nasser said.  Aramco wants to be present in the entire value chain of India’s energy sector, he said.  India has seen mass local protests against the proposal to set up the refinery in the Ratnagiri region of the western state of Maharashtra, but Nasser said he expects India to resolve the land acquisition issues.      “We are assured by our Indian partners ... that this is being worked out,” he said.     India is emerging as a key demand centre for refined fuels. To meet its growing demand, the South Asian nation aims to raise its refining capacity by 77 percent to 8.8 million bpd by 2030.     Nasser also said the oil markets are healthy and demand forecasts look healthy for 2019.  Reacting to media reports that China’s Sinopec  has reduced oil purchases from the kingdom, Nasser said: “Sinopec  is our major customer, sometimes they buy less, sometimes they request for more. We have some Chinese refiners approaching us directly for oil purchases, and that’s kept our sales to China at a healthy level.”  Reporting by Nidhi Verma and Sai Sachin Ravikumar; Writing by Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Malini Menon and Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-saudi-arabia/update-1-saudi-aramco-ceo-says-has-2-mln-bbls-per-day-of-spare-capacity-idUKL4N1TR37B,25 Jun 2018,"* Can meet additional demand if any supply disruptions

2018-06-25,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Energy companies Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) will not submit a claim for missed revenue due to the Dutch government’s decision to halt gas production at the Groningen field by 2030, the Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs said on Monday. “A lot of gas will be left in the ground,” Economy minister Eric Wiebes said at the presentation of his deal with the oil majors responsible for extracting Groningen gas. “That gas is the property of the oil companies, but they will not submit a claim and the government is not required to compensate them.” The Dutch government in March said it would end gas production at the Groningen field by the end of the next decade, in an effort to stop a string of relatively small, but damaging earthquakes caused by gas extraction. This will leave around 450 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas in the ground, Wiebes said, with an estimated value of approximately 70 billion euros (61.48 billion pounds). The decision to halt Groningen production forced the government to broker a new deal with Shell and Exxon Mobil, whose 50-50 joint venture NAM is responsible for the field. NAM will be required to pump as much gas as the government says is needed in the coming years. In return, it will see its share of the revenue from Groningen rise from 10 to 27 percent, Wiebes said, starting this year.   As part of the deal, NAM will also contribute a total of 500 million euros to strengthen the economy in the Groningen region.

2018-06-25,"(Reuters) - The world’s biggest oil and gas players are gathering for a summit in Washington D.C. this week that will be overshadowed by the specter of shifting trade patterns due to a trade dispute between the United States and China. The uncertainty comes at a historic moment for the United States, which has become the world’s biggest natural gas producer, one of the top crude oil producers, and a growing exporter of both. It will host the triennial World Gas Conference for the first time in 30 years. “The timing is unfortunate,” said Charlie Riedl, executive director of the Center for LNG, noting the U.S.-China trade scuffle has ramped up uncertainty just as the next wave of U.S. liquefied natural gas producers are trying to finalize offtake deals needed to start construction. Beijing this month proposed 25 percent tariffs on U.S. petroleum imports, a retaliation against President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods that is expected to dent sales to the U.S. shale industry’s largest customer - adding new pressure for firms that produce natural gas as a byproduct of crude production. While LNG imports have so far been spared, the industry is concerned that the supercooled gas could be next if China’s talks with Washington sour – something that would disadvantage U.S. developers but help rivals also courting China. “I don’t know that it prevents deals from happening, but I think it gives buyers pause,” Riedl said. The conference will draw executives from global energy giants like Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP Plc (BP.L), and Total SA (TOTF.PA), along with senior officials from the U.S. State Department’s energy bureau, and ministers from energy producers and consumers like Argentina and Indonesia.  It follows last week’s OPEC meetings in Vienna, where the partner countries agreed on a modest increase in oil production from next month, following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs.  The Trump administration is eager to expand its “energy dominance” agenda by offering more U.S. oil, coal and LNG to Europe and other takers, as an alternative to supplies from geopolitical rivals like Russia, while also forging bonds with big players like China. The United States has made some inroads with sales of LNG to Poland and Lithuania, but faces a tough task selling large amounts of LNG to wider parts of Europe, especially as Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and a consortium of partners advance a new pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany. “We want to see a global gas market that is market-driven, prevents countries from using gas for political purposes, and drives economic growth across the world,” Frank Fannon, the top U.S. energy diplomat, told Reuters. Rising crude prices have U.S. producers drilling for more oil than ever, with natural gas produced as a byproduct. While some of that gas is going into power generation - offsetting coal power even as Trump has promised to bail out struggling nuclear and coal plants - there is still more than is needed domestically. That has producers hoping for new export capacity. Globally, there has been a dearth of major go-ahead decisions on LNG projects since 2015, as sagging energy prices and worries over a looming glut left buyers hesitant.  But the glut has not materialized and global demand has taken off, fanning fears of an LNG shortage instead. Gas trade rose 6.2 percent in 2017, according to a report by BP, with LNG demand up more than 10 percent in its best year since 2010. “The needle is moving significantly, both on the supply and demand side,” said Eric Fell, an analyst with Genscape. That should smooth the path for deal-making at the four-day Washington conference, said industry players and analysts, despite the trade dispute with Beijing. The Asian superpower is not the only buyer in town, said Gregory Vesey, chief executive of LNG Ltd (LNG.AX), which is developing the Magnolia LNG project in Louisiana.  “All across Europe there are opportunities that are starting to feel very real,” he said, noting European gas prices are up, while U.S. LNG prices have stayed flat.

2018-06-25,"SINGAPORE, June 25 (Reuters) - Environmental campaigner Greenpeace accused Singapore’s Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil processor, of having links to palm oil-related deforestation despite its previous commitments to safeguard tropical forests. Greenpeace accused Gama, a palm oil business set up by Wilmar’s co-founder Martua Sitorus, of causing deforestation in Indonesia. The environmental group said analysis of trade data showed that Wilmar continued to trade palm oil from Gama, despite being aware that Gama was violating Wilmar’s No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation policy by clearing rainforest. ""Wilmar must immediately cut off all palm oil suppliers that can't prove they aren't destroying rainforests,"" said Kiki Taufik, global head of Greenpeace Southeast Asia's Indonesian forests campaign. (bit.ly/2lu2oAm) Wilmar promised in 2013 to seek to end purchases of palm oil grown on deforested land. In 2015, it opened its supply chains to outside scrutiny in a move that was lauded by environmentalists. Wilmar did not have an immediate response to a Reuters request for a comment on the Greenpeace report. Calls to the Gama offices in Jakarta went unanswered after business hours. Concerns about the amount of forests and peat lands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years.

2018-06-25,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2tt9dX9 By John Kemp LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Hedge funds left their positions largely unchanged in the run up to last week’s meetings among oil ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. Hedge funds and other money managers trimmed their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum for the ninth week in a row. But the combined net long position was cut by just 14 million barrels in the week to June 19, the smallest weekly amount since the middle of April, taking the total reduction so far to 330 million barrels since April 17. There were only very minor changes to positions in all crude and fuels contracts. Portfolio managers cut net positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-9 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-1 million) and European gasoil (-8 million) but added positions in Brent (+3 million) and U.S. gasoline (+2 million). In most cases, position changes were driven mainly by small reductions in existing bullish long positions rather than the creation of new bearish short ones (tmsnrt.rs/2tt9dX9). Even after the long liquidation over the last nine weeks, fund managers remain overwhelmingly bullish about the outlook for oil prices later in 2018. Bullish long positions outnumber bearish short positions by a ratio of more than 7:1, down from a peak of almost 14:1 in mid-April, but still exceptionally high. Hedge fund managers have become slightly less bullish about the outlook for oil prices rather than outright bearish. Short positions remain at unusually low levels in all petroleum contracts and there has been no sign of significant new short selling.

2018-06-25,"BAQUBA, Iraq (Reuters) - Attackers have slit the throats of a mother and three sisters of an Iraqi election commission employee in their home, security and medical sources said on Monday. The employee himself, from the Turkmen minority in the town of Hamrin in ethnically mixed Diyala Province, was not at home at the time and was unharmed, the sources said. No group has claimed responsibility for the killings late on Sunday. Islamic State threatened to attack Iraq’s May parliamentary election and anyone who assisted in it. At least one candidate was killed before the vote but the group did not claim responsibility for his killing. The Sunni Islamist militants have lost the one-third of Iraq’s territory they once controlled, but still operate from pockets along the border with Syria and other areas including the Hamrin mountains. Their ambushes, assassinations and bombings have increased in recent weeks, especially in Diyala. A Diyala security source said Iraqi security forces had launched an operation in the north of the province against Islamic State militants.

2018-06-25,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The joint deal by OPEC and other oil-producing allies to raise output demonstrates the strength of the Russia-Saudi energy alliance, which will help stabilize the market for many years to come, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund said on Monday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other top crude producers agreed to raise output from July by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd), after Saudi Arabia persuaded arch-rival Iran to cooperate.  Ahead of OPEC’s Vienna meeting, Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world’s top oil producers, said they had a general consensus that the OPEC+ format should be “institutionalized” and extended until 2019 and beyond to monitor the market and change output if needed.  “A long-term partnership between Russia and Saudi Arabia related to the coordination of efforts between oil producers and the future creation of a new organization based on OPEC+ will help to overcome disagreements between the producers and work out a united action strategy on the global markets,” Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) told Reuters.  Dmitriev, one of the architects of the initial deal between Moscow and OPEC in December 2016, said that long-term Russia-Saudi cooperation “will ensure pricing stability on global markets and increase investments in the energy sector.”  At a meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, Dmitriev said that Saudi Arabia, whose Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Moscow in June, agreed to invest  $10 billion in Russia, of which $2 billion had already been spent.  Dmitriev told Reuters he expected investments between the two countries to double in the next three years.

The Wall Street Journal said U.S. President Donald Trump planned to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to China. The report hit Asian stocks overnight and in London the pan-European STOXX 600 index was down over half a percent in morning trade. S&P500 mini futures fell as much as 0.6 percent while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.95 percent to 6-1/2-month lows. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.8 percent. Taking a particular hit on the trade tensions was the European autos sector, falling 1.4 percent and set for its seventh straight day of losses after Trump said on Friday he aimed to hike tariffs on EU car imports by 20 percent. MSCI’s All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 in morning trade in Europe. As the threat of a full-blown trade war has grown, the gauge has fallen in five of the last six weeks. Last week it fell one percent - its biggest weekly drop in three months. “We suspect the Trump team will push ahead with these policies (which will elicit reciprocal tariffs from China and the EU) until U.S. equities start to crumble and polls move against Trump,” wrote ING strategists in a research note. A spread between approval and disapproval ratings of the U.S. President had reached its narrowest since March 2017, they noted. Chinese shares were among the biggest losers, falling 1.27 percent and tumbling 3.7 percent last week, as Trump threatened to hit $200 billion of Chinese imports with 10 percent tariffs. Policymakers in China moved fast to temper any potential economic drag from the dispute, as its central bank said on Sunday it would cut the amount of cash some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points. That reduction in reserve requirements, the third this year, had been widely anticipated by investors and is aimed at accelerating the pace of debt-for-equity swaps and spurring lending for smaller firms. Despite the move, the CSI300 Index of mainland Chinese shares lost 0.8 percent, edging near the one-year low it touched on Friday. The index of global auto manufacturers fell 0.7 percent. It lost 4.7 percent last week. Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on Friday on all imports of EU-assembled cars, a month after his administration launched an investigation into whether auto imports posed a national security threat. A senior European Commission official said on Saturday that the European Union would respond to any U.S. move to raise tariffs on cars made in the bloc. Investors and traders are worried that threats of higher U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures could derail a rare period of synchronised global growth. Oil shed some of the gains posted on Friday after OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed a modest increase in production from next month. They did not however announce a clear target for the output hike, leaving traders guessing how much more will actually be pumped. OPEC and non-OPEC said in a statement they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. “Saturday’s OPEC+ press conference provided more clarity on the decision to increase production, with guidance for a full 1 million bpd ramp-up in 2H18,” Goldman Sachs said in a note on Sunday. “This is a larger increase than presented Friday although the goal remains to stabilize inventories, not generate a surplus.” U.S. crude futures traded at $68.64 per barrel, up 0.1 percent for the day after Friday’s 4.6 percent rally. International benchmark Brent fell 1.2 percent, however, to $74.61 per barrel, giving up nearly half of its gains made on Friday. In the currency market the euro trade flat, having retreated in early trade. German business confidence deteriorated in June, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting the mood among company executives in Europe’s biggest economy was darkening in light of the threat of a global trade war. The dollar fell nearly half a percent to 109.48 yen, hitting its lowest levels in two weeks as the Japanese currency firmed on concerns about the global trade frictions. The Turkish lira gained up to 1.6 percent on expectations of a stable government after Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party claimed victory in presidential and parliamentary polls. But his victory kept alive worries about inflation and the central bank’s independence given recent comments suggesting he wanted to take greater control of monetary policy. The lira traded at 4.59 to the dollar, up 1.7 percent from 4.6625 at the end of last week. Bitcoin steadied after hitting seven-month lows during the weekend as the security of cryptocurrency exchange operators came under more scrutiny.

2018-06-25," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - If it were possible to boil the crude oil market down to just one determining factor for the coming months, it would be this: What will Saudi Arabia actually do? The Saudis appear to have emerged as the winners from last week’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and the subsequent talks between OPEC and its allies in the deal to restrict output. The outcome of the meetings would seem to indicate that crude oil supply should rise by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd). That’s based on the assumption that OPEC and allies will return to 100 percent compliance with the November 2016 cut of 1.8 million bpd from a current situation of over-compliance. However, the reality on the ground is that many OPEC countries lack the ability to pump their full quotas. Saudi Arabia is the only producer that can ramp out output significantly within a short period of time. The market consensus after the OPEC meeting in Vienna on June 22, and the talks with non-OPEC allies the following day, was that the agreements reached wouldn’t actually result in an extra 1 million bpd reaching global markets. While there is some debate on the likely increase in supply, the upper end of the range is around 600,000 bpd. The question is whether this would be enough to prevent prices from rallying again. Given that the Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, is going to have to provide the lion’s share of any increase in output, watching its export numbers and price signals in the coming months will be key. In fact, the Saudis already are supplying more crude, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. Saudi seaborne crude exports were 7.06 million bpd in May, the most in a year, the data shows. Prior to the November 2016 agreement, Saudi Arabia was regularly exporting more than 7 million bpd. But it’s also worth noting that only in two months, January and February in 2016, did the kingdom ship more than 7.6 million bpd. What this shows is that the Saudis definitely have the scope to export more crude, but boosting output above 7.6 million bpd on a sustained basis isn’t something they have done in recent years. The Saudis are on track to export more than 7 million bpd in June, with Thomson Reuters data estimating seaborne shipments of 7.1 million bpd. But it’s interesting to note that the Saudis have been somewhat vague when it comes to saying exactly how much more they will produce. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said after last week’s meetings that the kingdom’s state-controlled oil company will increase output by hundreds of thousands of barrels, with precise figures to be decided later. Who can and who can't raise crude output within OPEC: reut.rs/2M8auJY There is also some confusion over whether Saudi Arabia will be permitted, in terms of the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement, to over-produce its quota to make up for shortfalls from other members, such as Venezuela and Libya, currently unable to pump more. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said Saudi Arabia wouldn’t be allowed to pump more on behalf of Venezuela, meaning the kingdom “can increase its production by less than 100,000 bpd”. With no certainty on exactly who can produce what, it becomes more important than ever to monitor crude oil flows in coming months, and perhaps less important to hang on every word uttered by the various parties to the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement. Another factor often bypassed in the discussion is exports of refined fuels. Saudi Arabia’s exports of gasoline were around 350,000 bpd in the first four months of this year, according to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI). That’s up by around 100,000 bpd from last year’s average. Saudi shipments of gasoil averaged just under 800,000 bpd in the January to April period, about 200,000 bpd more than for 2017. For all oil products, the JODI data show that Saudi Arabia’s exports averaged 1.83 million bpd in the first four months of 2018, up 32 percent from the 1.39 million bpd recorded in the same period last year. What this shows is that Saudi Arabia is already boosting exports to global markets, but in the form of refined products rather than crude. That brings us back to the burning question for oil markets: How much more can, or will, the Saudis add to the global supply of both crude and refined products? There is certainly a risk in relying on the kingdom to virtually single-handedly balance supply and demand, thereby keeping prices in the sweet spot of around $70-$80 a barrel, which seems to be high enough to prevent fiscal problems in most producers, but low enough to prevent demand destruction. — The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters — Editing by Kenneth Maxwell",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-crude-saudi/column-what-saudi-arabia-does-now-is-key-for-global-crude-oil-markets-russell-idUKL4N1TR1I0,25 Jun 2018,* Who can and who can't raise crude output within OPEC: https://reut.rs/2M8auJY,COLUMN-What Saudi Arabia does now is key for global crude oil markets: Russell
2018-06-25,"(Repeats June 22 story with no changes in text) By Neha Dasgupta PEDAVEEDU, India, June 22 (Reuters) - India is fast-tracking environmental clearances for projects like power plants and coal mines in a bid to propel growth, setting off alarm bells among environmentalists and affected residents who say the decisions are being made too quickly. In a country where state machinery typically moves slowly, the environment ministry under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has slashed the average time taken to grant clearances to 170 days from 600 days, said two government sources with direct knowledge of the matter. “We’re standardising processes and taking decisions swiftly,” said one of the officials, who did not want to be named, citing government policy. “We know the basic issues, and merely taking more time for approvals does not mean much.” The environment ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The push appears to be similar to U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to speed up infrastructure approvals - his administration has said it wants environmental reviews for major projects to take no longer than 21 months, instead of years. India’s industrial sector grew at 4.3 percent last year but growth slowed from 4.6 percent a year ago. The speedier approvals come as some big-ticket infrastructure projects face delays, including the proposed $100 billion Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor and the Japan-backed $17 billion bullet train. Any loss of jobs from slowing growth could hurt Modi as he seeks a second term in 2019. Environmental group Greenpeace says India’s construction sector and coal-fired power plants are major contributors to rising levels of particulate matter in the air. The World Health Organisation says India is home to the world’s 14 most polluted cities. The PM10 index, which measures the concentration of particulate matter of 10 microns diameter or less in the air, hit 999 in the capital New Delhi last week, the highest measure on monitoring devices. This coarse particulate matter is mostly dust, which attaches to toxic material from other emissions. A level of 500 is considered “hazardous” and people are advised to remain indoors. The government halted construction activities in the capital and nearby cities to ease the pollution and by Friday afternoon it was at 124, although that is still considered unhealthy. “The way in which in the last ten years government has allowed power plants to come up in the periphery of Delhi and its surrounding region is a major contributor to pollution,” said Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner with Greenpeace. Projects across the country cleared by the environment ministry this year include three new thermal power plants, a carbon black manufacturing facility, two cement plants and the expansion of four coal mines, according to government data. “Faster clearances can certainly compromise the quality of evaluation,” said Srestha Banerjee, programme manager at the private Centre for Science and Environment. “By standardising terms of references for various sectors the government has tried to reduce time in the environment clearance process. This is not a bad step. But in order to reduce time, it has exempted public hearing for some important sectors. This is extremely problematic.” In India’s villages and smaller towns, protests are mounting against rapid industrialisation because of the environmental damage. The Lambada, a tribe in the southern state of Telangana, is opposing a 200 megawatt coal-fired power plant near the village of Pedaveedu that the environment ministry cleared in 78 days this year. Environmentalists say it usually takes at least six months to clear such projects. The environment ministry did not respond to questions on the time taken for the approval. “I won’t let this power plant be constructed,” said Mudavath Vui, a 60-year old Lambada woman dressed in a bright blue embroidered top with clinking bells and coins and colourful beads around her neck. “I have seen my husband die from cancer and I don’t want this plant to increase our suffering.” Her community, which forms a major chunk of the population in three villages around the proposed site of the power plant to be built by privately held MG Power Projects, has also been opposing two large cement plants in the area that they accuse of triggering respiratory and other problems. Groups of Lambada villagers frequently gather around Pedaveedu to shout slogans against the power plant. They and activists said they plan to intensify protests against MG Power’s plant when construction starts. An MG official said the company is yet to firm up plans on starting construction. Protests by villagers and local tribesmen have also erupted at Vedanta’s copper smelter in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where 13 activists were killed in a protest last month, and at its bauxite mine in the state of Odisha. “FIXED TIME-FRAME” Securing faster environment clearances has become crucial for businesses that have struggled to overcome the chaotic implementation of a nationwide sales tax last year. This year the environment ministry has cleared 38 percent of total projects within 100 days, compared with 16 percent in the same period a year ago, government data showed. The number of projects cleared has jumped 37 percent in the first five months of the year compared with the same period a year ago. Gujarat Agrochem Pvt Ltd, an insecticides, chemical and herbicide manufacturer in the western state of Gujarat, secured approval in April to expand a plant after submitting its proposal at January-end. The speed surprised the company itself, its regional head Sunish Nair told Reuters. Earlier this decade, the company had to wait two years to get the go-ahead to build a herbicide plant in Gujarat. By the time the approval came, in 2013, the project’s estimated cost had jumped 28 percent and demand for the particular product waned, Nair said. “It seems they are now adhering to a fixed time-frame,” Nair said, welcoming the faster clearance process under the current government. In Pedaveedu, however, the fast clearances have led to even more entrenched opposition. “We will pour kerosene onto ourselves and die, but not let the power plant be set up,” said V. Koteshwar Rao, a resident and vice-president of the Jana Chaitanya Society, a local activist group.

2018-06-25,"* Asian shares flat in early trade, U.S. stock futures down a tad * China, auto shares take the brunt of Trump’s trade war * Oil prices maintain gains after OPEC agrees on output hike * Turkish lira rises more than 1 pct after Erdogan’s victory By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, June 25 (Reuters) - Asian shares got the week off to a cautious start on Monday amid lingering concerns about escalating trade frictions while U.S. oil prices maintained hefty gains made after major oil producers had agreed on a modest increase in production. S&P500 mini futures fell as much as 0.5 percent in early trade while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.4 percent. The falls were triggered by a report from Wall Street Journal that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to China. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe has fallen five of the last six weeks, including last week, when it declined one percent - its biggest weekly drop in three months as the threats of trade wars have become all the more real. Chinese shares were among the biggest losers, tumbling 3.7 percent last week, as Trump put the heat on Beijing, threatening to hit $200 billion of Chinese imports with 10 percent tariffs. Policy makers in China moved fast to temper any potential economic drag from a trade dispute with the United States, with China’s central bank on Sunday saying it would cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points (bps). The reserve reduction, the third by the central bank this year, had been widely anticipated by investors and is aimed to accelerate the pace of debt-for-equity swaps and spur lending to smaller firms. Another major victim were automaker shares, which shed 4.7 percent last week. Trump threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on Friday on all imports of EU-assembled cars, a month after his administration launched an investigation into whether auto imports posed a national security threat. A senior European Commission official said on Saturday that the European Union will respond to any U.S. move to raise tariffs on cars made in the bloc. Investors and traders are worried that threats of higher U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures by others could derail a rare period of synchronized global growth. Oil prices were supported after OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed on a modest increase in oil production from next month, without announcing a clear target for the output increase, leaving traders guessing how much more will actually be pumped. OPEC and non-OPEC said in their statement that they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. “In reality, there aren’t many countries that can raise outputs, with only Saudi Arabia having the capacity to flexibly increase the output. But if Saudis alone increase outputs sharply, they could face backlash from some other countries,” said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities. “So markets seem to be sceptical how much Saudi can increase. We could see some profit-taking after last week’s gains but the market will be supported. The next focus will be on the size of output increase by Saudis in July,” he added. U.S. crude futures traded at $68.57 per barrel, little changed for the day after Friday’s 4.6 percent rally. International benchmark Brent fell 2.0 percent, however, to $74.08 per barrel, giving up more than a half of their gains made on Friday. In the currency market, the euro held firm at $1.1668 , bouncing back after hitting an 11-month low of $1.1508 on Thursday. The euro climbed on Friday as traders were encouraged by improved regional economic growth data and new assurances by Italian politicians that their nation would not leave the single currency. Business activity in Germany and France, the euro zone’s top two economies, picked up in June despite trade tensions between Europe and the United States, IHS Markit data showed. The dollar was little moved at 109.93 yen, holding above last week’s low of 109.55 yen. The Turkish lira gained more than one percent on expectations of a stable government after Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party claimed victory in Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary polls on Sunday. But his victory kept alive worries about inflation and the central bank’s independence given Erdogan’s recent comments suggesting he wants to take greater control of monetary policy. The lira traded at 4.6050 to the dollar, compared to 4.6625 at the end of last week. Bitcoin steadied after hitting seven-month lows during the weekend as the security of cryptocurrency exchange operators came under more scrutiny. The digital money fell to as low as $5,780 and last stood at $6,155. Reporting by Hideyki Sano

2018-06-25,"SINGAPORE, June 25 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil prices fell by more than 2 percent early on Monday as traders factored in an expected output increase that was agreed at the headquarters of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna on Friday. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $73.90 per barrel at 0035 GMT, down 2.2 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $68.36 a barrel, down 0.3 percent, supported by a slight drop in U.S. drilling activity. Prices initially jumped after the deal was announced as it was not seen boosting supply by as much as some had expected. OPEC and non-OPEC partners including Russia have since 2017 cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to tighten the market and prop up prices. Largely because of unplanned disruptions in places like Venezuela and Angola, the group’s output has been below the targeted cuts, which it now says will be reversed by supply rises especially from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia. Britain’s Barclays bank said OPEC’s and Russia’s commitments would take “the market from a -0.2 million bpd deficit in H2 2018 to a 0.2 million bpd surplus”. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the agreement “represents a compromise between responding to consumer pressure and the need for oil-producing countries to maintain oil prices and prevent harming their economies”. In the United States, U.S. energy companies last week cut one oil rig, the first reduction in 12 weeks, taking the total rig count to 862, Baker Hughes said on Friday. That put the rig count on track for its smallest monthly gain since declining by two rigs in March with just three rigs added so far in June, although the overall level remains just one rig short of the March 2015 high from the previous week.

2018-06-25,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Private equity firms are expected to drive a wave of merger activity in Australia’s gas sector, hunting for bargains amid soaring demand in China, rising domestic prices and a broader oil market recovery. The energy sector has dominated Australian M&A activity over the past 12 months, led by a spurned $10.8 billion bid for oil and gas producer Santos (STO.AX) and a $9.8 billion bid for pipeline operator APA Group (APA.AX) by Hong Kong’s CK Infrastructure. Still, the share prices of smaller companies in the sector have yet to fully reflect the sharp recovery in oil markets over the past year and gains from lower drilling costs, say bankers and consultants. “Private equity firms clearly see strong turnaround opportunities in the oil and gas sector. Stocks are trading below their earnings potential with serious upside,” said Perth-based Deloitte Consulting partner Bernadette Cullinane. U.S. firm Harbour Energy pursued Santos for a year before its bid ended in acrimony, while private equity fund Lone Star bid A$530 million ($392 million) in March for Australia’s Sino Gas & Energy Holdings SEH.AX, which has stakes in two shale gas projects in China. More deals are seen as small oil and gas companies look to fund new gas developments to feed the east coast market and bigger companies, like Santos, look to replenish their reserves, following years of cuts in exploration. “Most of the sub-billion market cap companies with reasonable 2P resources and cash flow or near term cashflow would be attractive to private equity funds,” said Eddie Rigg, head of corporate finance at Argonaut, who advised a private Chinese firm that lost out in a three-way bidding war for gas producer AWE Ltd in February. Such companies include Senex Energy (SXY.AX), Central Petroleum (CTP.AX), Cooper Energy (COE.AX) and Strike Energy (STX.AX). Rigg predicted Sino Gas will attract a rival bid from a U.S., European or Asian group as most of the geological and well engineering risks on its project have been dealt with. “It’s a reasonably safe entry into a growing gas market,” he said. Australian domestic gas prices have more than doubled in the past three years as east coast supply has been sucked into exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to feed Asia-Pacific demand. China’s LNG imports, driven by a clean air push, are expected to jump 50 percent over three years to 57 million tonnes by 2020, according to Australian government forecasts. For investors, Australia is handy way to play into that growth. “Australia’s attractiveness as an oil and gas M&A and investment proposition is driven primarily by its low geopolitical and sovereign risk ... and of course its proximity to Asia’s energy demand centres,” said Deloitte’s Cullinane. The next likely target is in Australia’s west. Gas supplier Quadrant Energy, potentially worth A$3 billion, is attracting interest as one of its two owners, Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), is looking to sell its stake, bankers say. Quadrant, co-owned by Macquarie Group (MQG.AX), produces more than a fifth of the gas going into the domestic market in the state of Western Australia, has oil production and untapped gas reserves. Potential suitors include Santos.  The appeal for Santos is that it knows the Quadrant business well as the companies share stakes in a number of gas fields, bankers and analysts say, although Santos may not want to risk alienating shareholders by splashing out on a deal so soon after having rejected a takeover. “Quadrant’s domestic business in Western Australia is a prized cash cow in Santos’ portfolio. Doubling down there makes sense,” said Wood Mackenzie analyst Saul Kavonic. Santos, Brookfield and Macquarie declined to comment. (GRAPHIC: Australia's LNG projects and gas basins - reut.rs/2MgvBKz) Within the next two years, there could be other deals on the west coast, where Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) are looking to develop new gas fields to feed their LNG plants. The biggest hurdle to their plans is the myriad of co-owners in their gas fields and LNG plants - all with competing priorities - making it difficult to agree on development plans.  The best way to overcome that hurdle, analysts and bankers say, would be for Woodside or Chevron to buy out some of their partners, as Woodside did in February with the $744 million purchase of ExxonMobil’s stake in the Scarborough gas field. “Obviously if an interest owner in a particular part of the value chain no longer desires to participate, Chevron or other companies are always looking for opportunities to improve their portfolio,” Chevron’s Asia-Pacific exploration and production president Stephen Green said in a recent group interview.
