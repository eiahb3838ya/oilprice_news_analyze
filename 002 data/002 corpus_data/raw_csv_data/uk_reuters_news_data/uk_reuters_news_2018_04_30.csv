2018-04-30,"(Adds comment from Department of Energy, paragraphs 8 and 9) By Scott DiSavino April 30 (Reuters) - The operator of the biggest U.S. power grid said on Monday it would study fuel security vulnerabilities in its Mid-Atlantic and Midwest system and, if needed, compensate generators for the resiliency their units provide. “We do not feel we have a vulnerability today, but will take a look at the system to see if we could have fuel security issues in the future,” Andy Ott, president and CEO of PJM Interconnection, said in a conference call. The fuel mix used to generate power in PJM, which serves 65 million people, has changed over the past several years with coal and nuclear plants retiring as energy firms add more natural gas and renewable units. That transition has caused economic pain for owners of the retiring units, like FirstEnergy Inc, along with concern by some in the administration of President Donald Trump that the grid is becoming more vulnerable to the loss of a big gas pipeline or an extreme weather event. FirstEnergy in March asked Energy Secretary Rick Perry to evoke emergency powers to help several struggling nuclear and coal plants remain open, including units owned by its FirstEnergy Solutions subsidiary, which sought bankruptcy protection just days after saying it would shut nuclear reactors in Ohio and Pennsylvania. “We don’t think there is an emergency today, but we do think these are legitimate questions to ask,” Ott said. PJM’s Ott described potential fuel security issues as those that could cut fuel supply to critical resources due to extreme weather conditions or physical or cyber attacks on power plants and gas pipelines. The Energy Department was encouraged by PJM’s study, said spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes. “Premature retirements” of nuclear and coal plants put the grid at risk and undermine national security, she said. Hynes urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent agency of the Energy Department, to take immediate action to stop the shutting of power plants. The Energy Department is reviewing its options to ensure that the grid can withstand extreme threats, she added. PJM said it plans to complete its assessment over the next six months. It will stress-test the system under various fuel supply disruption scenarios to understand potential future reliability concerns. “We have the ability to identify risks to the system and to put a value on resources that offset that risk,” Ott said, noting certain generators with weeks of fuel on hand or multiple sources of fuel could receive more money for the resiliency they provide. Some coal plants, for example, keep weeks of fuel on hand or have access to mines on site. Nuclear plants can hold up to two years worth of fuel in their reactors. Some gas plants can also burn oil and have access to multiple pipelines, gas straight out of the ground and liquefied natural gas supplies.

2018-04-30,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic lawmakers asked Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt on Monday for documents related to proposed changes to vehicle fuel emission standards and California’s authority to set its own measures, and accused him of misleading Congress of the agency’s plans. U.S. Representatives Doris Matsui of California and Paul Tonko of New York sent the letter after reports on Friday that the EPA and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration had prepared a proposal that would likely freeze fuel economy standards from 2020 through 2026 and assert that a 1975 federal law pre-empts states from imposing their own emissions rules. Matsui said the reports, which came a day after Pruitt testified about ethics and travel concerns before two House committees, contradicted his response to her question about whether the EPA would revoke California’s Clean Air Act waiver that enables it to set more stringent fuel economy standards. He said: “Not at present.” “If true, these reports directly contradict your testimony last week. As you were reminded at the start of that hearing, it is a violation of the law to knowingly make false statements to a Congressional committee,” the letter said. The lawmakers requested all emails related to the development of the proposal, drafts, a list of staff that participated in the proposal and a list of all meetings held with industry and stakeholders about it.   They also asked for data used by the EPA earlier this month when it determined earlier proposed standards were too stringent.    “The Agency is continuing to work with NHTSA to develop a joint proposed rule and is looking forward to the interagency process,” EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said.  Bowman said the proposal had not yet been sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. An administration source familiar with the proposal said it would be sent to the OMB by the end of the week. Other California lawmakers raised concerns about reports that the EPA could undermine California’s waiver. “Like many Californians from across the political spectrum, I support our state’s long-standing waiver and I have shared my views with Administrator Pruitt on many occasions,” said Republican Representative Ken Calvert, who said he would “facilitate” a discussion between the EPA and California officials in the coming days and weeks. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said his office was monitoring the EPA’s plans. “I’m ready to take any and all action necessary to defend our progress,” the Democratic official said.

2018-04-30,"(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) agreed to buy rival Andeavor ANDV.N for more than $23 billion (16.7 billion pounds) in a deal creating one of the largest global refiners that will benefit from access to booming U.S. shale fields and growing U.S. fuel export markets. The United States has become the world’s top fuel exporter, shipping more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline and diesel. Refiners have capitalized on booming output from shale fields in Texas and North Dakota and are building out export terminals and processing facilities. Buying Andeavor gives Marathon more exposure to the booming U.S. shale oil sector, thanks to Andeavor’s logistics and terminal operations in Texas and North Dakota shale regions. Rising output from the Permian Basin, the largest oilfield in the United States, has driven the nation’s crude production to an all-time record above 10.5 million bpd. “The combination of the two companies allows us to go after and find ways to create a bigger presence in the Permian,” said Marathon Chief Executive Gary Heminger, who will lead the combined companies. The company would be able to process 3.1 million bpd of crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. Its capacity would be the sixth largest globally, behind China’s Sinopec (600028.SS), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), PetroChina, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Aramco, according to consultancy IHSMarkit.  U.S. motorists consume more fuel than any other country in the world and overall demand nationwide hit a record 9.3 million bpd in 2017.  Operations that have capacity to refine light crude produced in shale fields such as Andeavor will be better positioned to take advantage of the production boom. Both North Dakota’s Bakken and Texas shale regions primarily produce light, sweet crude oil.  The deal also gives Marathon a line into fast-growing Mexican fuel markets. Andeavor is expanding its network of filling stations in the country. Mexico’s dilapidated refineries cannot meet the growing population’s demand for gasoline and other products. U.S. fuel exports to Mexico rose to 1.4 million bpd as of January, up more than 85 percent from two years ago. The deal values Andeavor, formerly known as Tesoro, at about $152 per share, or about 24 percent more than Friday’s closing price of $122.38.  “We view this as pretty full value for Andeavor,” Scotia Howard Weil analysts said in a note. “Not many saw this one coming.” Shares of Ohio-based Marathon lost $6.52, or 8 percent, to close at $74.91 a share. It also missed Wall Street forecasts for quarterly profit by a wide margin on Monday as expenses rose.   Shares of Andeavor, based in San Antonio, closed up 13 percent at $138.32.  Including Andeavor’s debt, Marathon is paying $35.6 billion to hold 66 percent of a combined company worth some $58 billion at Friday’s close.  Andeavor operates 10 refineries in the United States, largely in the western part of the country. It has pipeline, trucking and terminal operations in the Permian and in the Bakken region, the second-most prolific state for oil production in the country after Texas. (To see an image from the companies, click here: reut.rs/2JFgc58)  “This creates one coast-to-coast, border-to-border refining and marketing company that seems well balanced with a pretty broad footprint,” said Garfield Miller, CEO of Aegis Energy Advisors.     Marathon’s six refineries are largely in the Midwest, with one in Texas City, Texas. The Midwest region has reduced its reliance on crude oil from the Gulf Coast in recent years, pulling more of its barrels from Canada and North Dakota. Now, it is producing more products than it needs and has looked to export markets for additional opportunity.     Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said they expected the location of the two companies’ operations to allow them to avoid antitrust hurdles.  Combining the companies’ logistics subsidiaries will not happen immediately, Marathon CEO Gary Heminger said on a conference call following the transaction. He referred to that combination as a “day two issue.” Andeavor is expanding a retail network of motor fuel stations in the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora under its ARCO brand.  U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are becoming more integrated in the region’s energy industry, filling shortages created by underinvestment in refining across Latin America.  “There’s no question the new company has greater resource capability going forward into Mexico,” Andeavor CEO Gregory Goff said on a conference call with analysts. The deal, which is expected to close in the second half of this year, could spur other North American refiners to look harder at acquisitions, said IHSMarkit refining and marketing director Rob Smith. “This may end up being the biggest of the bunch,” said Smith. “But it would not be surprising to see other mid-tier companies merge.”  Reporting by John Benny and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru, Gary McWilliams in Houston; additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in Philadelphia and Jessica Resnick Ault in New York; Editing by Susan Thomas, Marguerita Choy and Cynthia Osterman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/andeavor-us-ma-marathon-petroleum/update-10-marathon-to-become-top-u-s-refiner-with-23-bln-andeavor-buy-idUKL3N1S71P6,30 Apr 2018,"* Andeavor assets include pipelines, logistics in Texas's

2018-04-30,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil major BP Plc (BP.L) is closely following oil auctions in Brazil and Mexico, which are expected to announce new awards later this year, to decide whether to submit bids and expand its presence in the region, Felipe Arbelaez, the firm’s chief for Latin America, said on Monday. Rising crude prices and energy reforms in several Latin American nations have reinvigorated the oil majors’ appetite for a region that once imposed nationalizations, forced contract changes and strict rules for foreign investors. More companies are becoming interested in offshore prospects from Brazil to Guyana, which present potential new reserves and could diversify investment portfolios.  “Our emphasis in the region right now - in terms of bidding rounds - is in Brazil and Mexico. We are also looking at Argentina, though it is still early,” Arbelaez said. Brazil will receive bids for blocks in its coveted presalt region in June, after awarding majors including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) offshore blocks in previous rounds in 2017 and 2018. Brazil’s government also is in negotiations with Petrobras (PETR4.SA) to accept foreign investment in the remaining areas of fields assigned to the state-run oil company. The resulting blocks would be auctioned this year, along with hundreds of areas that were not awarded in previous rounds.     For its part, Mexico plans to announce results in September from two onshore rounds, including its first offer of unconventional areas for foreign investment.  In Colombia and Uruguay, the investors’ interest has not been as high. The Andean nation has postponed several times the offer for its Sinu-San Jacinto onshore round, while Uruguay received no bids at its third offshore auction in April. The auctions in many Latin American countries come as presidential elections this year increase the political risk because some candidates have promised to slam the brakes on reforms, revise the signed contracts or change fiscal terms. “Every country is different... (The elections) don’t change our perspective in the medium or long terms,” Arbelaez said. BP is trying to increase the number of oil projects it operates in the region, especially in Brazil. In countries including Guyana, Colombia and Suriname, the firm is seeking opportunities to participate in offshore areas. “These countries are reopening for foreign investment. We think that will benefit the countries because they will have a wider number of experienced operators and because they will be capable of better developing and marketing their resources,” he said.

2018-04-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday after Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had lied about pursuing nuclear weapons after signing a 2015 deal with global powers, while U.S. stocks fell with declines in healthcare shares. Netanyahu said Iran had continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge after the deal.  U.S. President Donald Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on Iran that were lifted after the 2015 agreement over its nuclear program. Prices of the Brent June contract LCOc1, which expires Monday, gained 53 cents to settle at $75.17 a barrel. Prices for the more actively traded Brent July contact LCOc2 gained 90 cents to settle at $74.69. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures CLc1 were up 47 cents on the day to settle at $68.57.  “The larger issue driving this is what will Trump do with Iran? And what will Iran do in response? And that uncertainty is the fundamental driver, not so much Netanyahu,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst for United-ICAP. Higher oil prices added to weaker sentiment in the stock market. While earnings have been strong this reporting period, U.S. companies have raised concerns about rising oil and other commodity prices. But the healthcare sector .SPXHC, which dropped 1.6 percent, weighed most heavily on the S&P 500, as shares of Allergan plc (AGN.N) and Celgene Corp (CELG.O) led the sector’s slide. The possibility that temporary exemptions on steel and aluminium tariffs might expire for several U.S. allies also weighed on U.S. stocks. Without an extension from Trump, the exemptions will expire on Tuesday. Earnings and deal news provided support early in the session.  Reports of big M&A deals included U.S.-based Marathon Petroleum Corp’s (MPC.N) agreement to buy Andeavor ANDV.N and a tie-up between British supermarket chains Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L) and Walmart Inc’s (WMT.N) ASDA.[nL8N1S70YQ] “The market doesn’t have a lot of upside momentum going. It rallies for a day or two but it just doesn’t follow through, and that’s been the case since the January-February correction,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 148.04 points, or 0.61 percent, to 24,163.15, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 21.86 points, or 0.82 percent, to 2,648.05 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 53.53 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,066.27. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.21 percent. MSCI's all-country index of global equities < .MIWD00000PUS> shed 0.32 percent. The MSCI global stock index rose for the month of April, its first positive month since January. In the U.S. Treasury market, the yield curve flattened for a third straight session after economic data missed expectations. The yield gap between U.S. 5-year notes and 30-year bonds narrowed to 27.20 basis points US5US30=TWEB, the tightest spread in more than six years. Investors look at the U.S. yield curve for clues about the future economic outlook. Data showed U.S. personal income rose just 0.3 percent in March, compared with expectations of 0.4 percent.  Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.955 percent, from 2.957 percent late on Friday. Weaker-than-expected German data hurt the euro early against the U.S. dollar.  German monthly retail sales unexpectedly dropped in March, dampening cheer around a consumer-led upswing in Europe’s biggest economy. Regional data showed annual inflation in four German states steady in April. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.33 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.02 percent to $1.2075. The Federal Reserve is also due to meet this week, and while no rate hike in benchmark U.S. interest rates is expected, investors will look for clues on the future pace of increases.

2018-04-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday, bouncing off early losses after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had proof that “Iran lied” about its nuclear capabilities, and that he was sure U.S. President Donald Trump would do “the right thing” in reviewing the country’s nuclear deal with western powers. Prices of the Brent June contract LCOc1, which expires Monday, gained 53 cents to settle at $75.17 a barrel. Prices for the more actively traded Brent July contact LCOc2 gained 90 cents to settle at $74.69.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 were up 47 cents on the day to settle at $68.57 a barrel. Earlier in the session, both benchmarks had been down about 1 percent. Both started to gain after Netanyahu said he would soon have an announcement regarding Iran.  “Oil reacted very severely” to Netanyahu’s announcement, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.     Oil prices jumped after Netanyahu said Israel has evidence that Iran lied about its nuclear program after signing the 2015 agreement with global powers.  Iran dismissed Netanyahu’s accusations, calling them “propaganda.” “Netanyahu may be the flavour of the day, but the larger issue driving this is what will Trump do with Iran? And what will Iran do in response? And that uncertainty is the fundamental driver, not so much Netanyahu,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst for United-ICAP.  Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on Iran that were lifted after the international agreement.     Oil prices have risen this month to their highest since late 2014, driven by concern over potential disruptions to Iranian crude flows. Analysts said the market is extremely sensitive to any developments on the nuclear deal and sanctions. “Until May 12, you’re not going to see any significant downward correction,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said. “Reimposing U.S. sanctions is not a foregone conclusion just yet.”     Meanwhile, U.S. crude production jumped 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.26 million bpd in February, the highest on record, the Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday. In the latest development in the U.S. shale boom, Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) agreed to buy rival Andeavor ANDV.N for more than $23 billion. The largest-ever tie-up between U.S. refiners will give the combined company a nationwide presence and increased access to growing export markets.

2018-04-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, exempting the Oklahoma facility from requirements under a federal biofuels law, according to two industry sources briefed on the matter. The waiver enables Icahn’s CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N) to avoid tens of millions of dollars in costs related to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. The regulation is meant to cut air pollution, reduce petroleum imports and support corn farmers by requiring refiners to mix billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline and diesel each year. The Small Refiners Coalition, which represents companies that operate small refining facilities, said the EPA is required by law to help small refineries struggling with these regulations and that such exemptions are crucial to their financial well-being. It applauded EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt for protecting small refineries, regardless of ownership, from the RFS requirements. But the exemption for CVR’s Wynnewood, Oklahoma plant prompted criticism from a corn state lawmaker and the powerful corn lobby, which has already accused Trump’s EPA of overusing the hardship waiver program in a way that hurts demand for ethanol. “Hundreds of millions - and in some cases billions - of dollars in profits isn’t my definition of ‘hardship,’” Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in statement condemning the CVR waiver. “President Trump promised to support home-grown biofuels, and Administrator Pruitt is breaking that promise.” “This one’s going to be hard for Pruitt to explain,” Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council industry group, said in an email. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said that the agency does not comment on specific refineries. “But, what I can tell you is that the criteria used to grant waivers has not changed since previous administrations,” Bowman added. CVR spokeswoman Brandee Stephens declined to comment regarding the waiver. Efforts to reach Icahn and his attorney for comment were not successful. An early supporter of Trump’s 2016 presidential run and a key supporter on Wall Street, Icahn had met with Pruitt when Pruitt was being vetted in late 2016 for the EPA administrator job, according to news reports at the time. Icahn stepped down from his position as special regulatory adviser to the Republican president last August after lawmakers cited potential ethical problems in his dual role as an adviser and an investor. Icahn is currently under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for his role in influencing biofuels policy while serving as Trump’s adviser. Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that Icahn may have used his presidential access to benefit his investments, a charge Icahn has rejected. The EPA has said it has granted more than two dozen waivers for 2017 but has declined to name the recipients. Under Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, the EPA granted about eight waivers annually.  Records show CVR had been denied on at least one occasion. The Small Refiners Coalition said the Obama administration had wrongly denied waivers to firms like CVR. Reuters has reported that Andeavor ANDV.N, one of America’s biggest refining companies, which reported about $1.5 billion in net profit last year, was among the other companies that have received hardship waivers from Trump’s EPA for its small refineries. To prove RFS compliance, refiners must earn or purchase tradable blending credits - awarded by the government for each blended gallon of fuel - and hand them in to the EPA yearly. The EPA has the authority to exempt small refineries of under 75,000 barrels per day from the requirement under the hardship waiver program if they can prove that compliance would cause them “disproportionate financial hardship.” With the exemption, CVR would not have to turn over the credits related to the Wynnewood facility for 2017, according to the two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The waiver was granted in recent months but the sources did not say precisely when. The Trump administration has encouraged small refiners to apply for the hardship waivers. A surge of applications has come to the EPA since a 2017 court ruling that the agency had used too narrow a definition of “financial hardship” under Obama. The waivers have the potential to save companies tens of millions of dollars, by allowing them to avoid blending or paying for credits on the open market and by permitting them to sell any credits they have on hand to others. CVR has reported a $23 million profit in the biofuels credit market in the first quarter of 2018 due to what it called a lower RFS obligation, an unusual return for a refiner that has no biofuel blending facilities. The company also said it expects its cost of complying with the RFS requirements to fall to $80 million for the entirety of 2018 from a previous estimate of $200 million, and from roughly $249 million in 2017.

2018-04-30,"(Adds details on total oil, gasoline and distillate demand) NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production jumped 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.26 million bpd in February, the highest on record, the Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday. Production in Texas rose by 106,000 bpd to above 4 million bpd, also a record high based on the data going back to 2005. The Permian basin, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, is the largest U.S. oilfield. Output from North Dakota declined marginally to 1.15 million bpd, while output in the federal Gulf of Mexico rose by 89,000 bpd to 1.72 million bpd. The agency also revised January U.S. oil production up by 40,000 bpd to about 10.004 million bpd. U.S. natural gas production in the lower 48 states rose to an all-time high of 87.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in February, up from the prior record of 87.3 bcfd in December, according to EIA’s 914 production report. Output in Texas, the nation’s largest gas producer, increased 1.5 percent in February to 22.4 bcfd, the most since December. In Pennsylvania, the second biggest gas producer, production increased 2.1 percent to a record high 16.4 bcfd in February. That compares with 15.0 bcfd in the same month a year ago. Total oil demand in February was up 2.4 percent, or 460,000 bpd, to 19.62 million bpd versus last year, EIA data showed, as strong demand for distillates helped soften weakness in gasoline demand.

2018-04-30,"WILMINGTON, Del., April 30 (Reuters) - Contura Energy Inc and Alpha Natural Resources Holdings Inc said on Monday they agreed to merge, creating the largest U.S. producer of metallurgical (met) coal, used in steelmaking, and reuniting the two businesses that were split following a 2015 bankruptcy. The deal comes as investors look for consolidation in an industry that is recovering from a deep downturn in 2015 and 2016, when several coal producers filed for bankruptcy in the wake of cheap natural gas and stricter regulations. Under terms of the all-stock deal, Alpha shareholders will end up owning 46.5 percent of the merged entity. The two companies said they sold a combined 12.6 million tons of metallurgical coal in 2017, vaulting the merged company ahead of Coronado Resources Ltd of Vancouver. The merged company will own 1 billion tons of coal reserves, according to a securities filing. The deal gives Alpha and Contura increased scale and financial muscle, and the merged company expects to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange when the deal closes, giving it capital for more acquisitions. Contura’s stock, which currently trades over the counter, was unchanged at $66.50 per share in afternoon trading, giving the company a market capitalization of about $685 million, according to Eikon. Alpha’s reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy significantly reduced the company’s debt, which had totaled more than $7 billion when it filed. Contura owned mines in Wyoming that produced more thermal coal, while Alpha owned mines centered in Appalachia. Last year, Contura sold its Wyoming mines and Alpha reduced its clean-up obligations for idled mines. The merged company will have mines concentrated in West Virginia and southwest Virginia and a large coal export terminal on Virginia’s coast to serve the global market for met coal. The combination will produce cost savings of up to $50 million per year, according to a statement. The combined company will be led by Kevin Crutchfield, who took over as chief executive officer of Alpha in 2009 and took on that role at Contura after the bankruptcy. Alpha’s current chairman and CEO, David Stetson, will join the board of the combined company. Prices of coal have rallied since the bankruptices of Alpha and other coal companies such as Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc, thanks to strong demand from Asia. For the first time in years, up to 90 percent of global coal miners are profitable.

2018-04-30,"(Adds context, bondholder comment) By Corina Pons and Paul Kilby CARACAS/NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA has begun making payments towards $100 million it owes in interest on a bond maturing in 2020 to some holders, according to three sources in the financial sector. The government began quietly halting interest payments on some $50 billion in publicly traded debt last year. At least one Venezuelan bondholder committee has hired a financial adviser, ahead of potential litigation in the face of continued breaches. The latest payments would have reached some holders through U.S. custody firm DTC, the sources said on Monday. PDVSA used Citgo Petroleum, its refining unit in the United States, as 51 percent collateral on the 2020 bond. Venezuela may be complying with the payment in order to avoid putting the valuable asset at risk in a potential legal battle. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has blamed financial sanctions imposed by the United States for preventing international transfers. However, the sanctions do not block routine operations such as debt payments. Earlier this month, the government paid interest on PDVSA’s 2022 bond, which was mostly bought by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in a controversial operation last year. That transfer upset some bondholders still waiting payments. “With the new PDVSA 2020 payment, legal action from investors in other bonds could take place,” said a holder of other Venezuelan debt who asked not to be identified.

2018-04-30,"* World stock index set for first monthly rise since January * Netanyahu: Iran lied after signing 2015 nuclear deal * M&A activity keep stocks in spotlight (Updates to U.S. afternoon trading) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied on Monday after Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had lied about pursuing nuclear weapons after signing a 2015 deal with global powers, while global stock indexes dipped with the S&P 500 led down by losses in technology. Netanyahu said Iran had continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge after the deal. U.S. President Donald Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on Iran that were lifted after the 2015 agreement over its nuclear program. U.S. crude rose 0.87 percent to $68.69 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.79, up 1.36 percent. MSCI’s all-country index of global equities shed 0.15 percent, “The immediate worry would be that the Trump administration ditches the Iran deal, causing oil prices to go up... but the bigger (issue) is - would it lead to a larger confrontation militarily in the Mideast,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida. In the U.S. equity market, top tech names including Microsoft Corp were among the biggest weights on the S&P 500. Earnings and deal news provided some support. Starting off another busy week for first-quarter earnings, McDonald Corp’s reported a better-than-expected rise in sales and its shares jumped 4.3 percent. Apple Inc is set to report on Tuesday. Reports of big M&A deals included U.S.-based Marathon Petroleum Corp’s agreement to buy Andeavor and a tie-up between British supermarket chains Sainsbury’s and Walmart Inc’s ASDA. “The market doesn’t have a lot of upside momentum going. It rallies for a day or two but it just doesn’t follow through, and that’s been the case since the January-February correction,” Bittles said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58.48 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,252.71, the S&P 500 lost 13.56 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,656.35 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 41.56 points, or 0.58 percent, to 7,078.24. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.21 percent. The MSCI global stock index was on track for a gain for April, its first positive month since January. Friday’s seemingly successful summit between the leaders of North and South Korean added to positive market sentiment. In the U.S. bond market, the U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened for a third straight session after U.S. economic data missed expectations. The yield gap between U.S. 5-year notes and U.S. 30-year bonds narrowed to 27.20 basis points, the lowest spread in more than six years. Data showed U.S. personal income rose just 0.3 percent in March, compared with expectations of 0.4 percent. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.9438 percent, from 2.957 percent late on Friday. Weaker-than-expected German data hurt the euro against the U.S. dollar. German monthly retail sales unexpectedly dropped in March, dampening cheer around a consumer-led upswing in Europe’s biggest economy. Regional data showed annual inflation in four German states steady in April. The dollar index rose 0.27 percent, with the euro down 0.35 percent to $1.2086. The Federal Reserve is also due to meet this week, and while no rate hike in benchmark U.S. interest rates is expected, investors will look for clues on the future pace of increases.

2018-04-30,"* Vedanta chair convinced Anglo of S. Africa’s potential * Sees himself as a “facilitator” for Anglo American * Plans to produce cobalt in Zambia By Ed Stoddard JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Reuters) - The chairman of Vedanta Resources Plc, who is also Anglo American’s biggest shareholder, said on Monday he had convinced Anglo not to sell off key assets in South Africa. Indian industrialist Anil Agarwal has an almost 20 percent stake in Anglo through his family trust Volcan Investments and has played down speculation that he is seeking a tie-up with Anglo. But in an interview with Reuters, Agarwal made it clear that he has not been a passive shareholder. “I always believed that South Africa has a lot of potential, and Anglo management may not have always believed that ... and they wanted to sell some assets,” he said. “When I became the biggest shareholder I advised them (not to sell). And I am very pleased that they have not sold those assets. And personally I was right because the share price is now up 50 percent and the profits are getting better.” In the midst of the commodity slump, Anglo said it would sell 16 assets including its South African business Kumba Iron Ore to focus on copper, diamonds and platinum. But last year the company said it would no longer be a forced seller of its bulk businesses after metal prices rebounded. Anglo’s share price has risen as much as 50 percent since Sept. 20 when Agarwal’s Volcan Investments said it was raising its stake and is now about a third higher, according to Thomson Reuters’ data. Agarwal said he wanted Anglo to focus on the Indian market. “We have 1.3 billion people in India ... India is a huge market for them, they can sell all the coal there, they can sell platinum there, they can sell iron ore there, they are selling 80 to 90 percent of diamonds there.” Agarwal said he saw his role as a “facilitator” of Anglo’s strategy and felt he had good “chemistry” with the management. “I can only facilitate them, I am not in the management, they have very good management,” he said. With Vedanta, Agarwal said its KCM copper business would boost its cobalt production with a possible refinery as it looks to meet soaring demand for the metal’s for the lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars. There is a global scramble on to find sources outside of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country racked by instability and violence, which is currently the main cobalt source. Cobalt is often a by-product of copper and Agarwal said this was the case with Vedanta’s Zambia copper operations but the company was looking at “a parallel project focused on cobalt.” He said the company currently was looking at the feasibility of how to set up a refinery for cobalt to produce it in “a very high tech, sustainable manner.” (Editing by Jane Merriman)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/vedanta-res-plc-anglo-american/interview-vedanta-chairman-told-anglo-not-to-sell-south-african-assets-idUKL8N1S76SA,30 Apr 2018,"The chairman of Vedanta

2018-04-30,"April 30 (Reuters) - PJM Interconnection, operator of the biggest U.S. power grid, said on Monday it would look for fuel security vulnerabilities in its Mid-Atlantic and Midwest system and, if needed, compensate generators for the resiliency their units provide. “We do not feel we have a vulnerability today, but will take a look at the system to see if we could have fuel security issues in the future,” Andy Ott, president and CEO of PJM, said in a conference call. The fuel mix used to generate power in PJM, which serves 65 million people, has changed over the past several years with coal and nuclear plants retiring as energy firms add more natural gas and renewable units, raising potential resilience risks beyond existing reliability standards. That transition has caused economic pain for owners of the retiring units, like FirstEnergy Inc, along with concern by some in the Trump Administration that the grid is becoming more vulnerable to the loss of a big gas pipeline or an extreme weather event. FirstEnergy in March asked U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to evoke emergency powers to help several struggling nuclear and coal plants remain open, including units owned by its FirstEnergy Solutions subsidiary, which sought bankruptcy protection just days after saying it would shut nuclear reactors in Ohio and Pennsylvania. “We don’t think there is an emergency today, but we do think these are legitimate questions to ask,” Ott said. PJM’s Ott described potential fuel security issues as those that could cut fuel supply to critical resources due to extreme weather conditions or physical or cyber attacks on power plants and gas pipelines. PJM said it plans to complete its vulnerability assessment over the next six months. The assessment will stress-test the system under various fuel supply disruption scenarios to better understand potential future reliability concerns. “We have the ability to identify risks to the system and to put a value on resources that offset that risk,” Ott said, noting certain generators with weeks of fuel on hand or multiple sources of fuel could receive more money for the resiliency they provide. Some coal plants, for example, keep weeks of fuel on hand or have access to mines on site. Nuclear plants can hold up to two years worth of fuel in their reactors. Some gas plants can also burn oil and have access to multiple pipelines, gas straight out of the ground and liquefied natural gas supplies.

2018-04-30,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition signalled on Monday the end of major combat operations against Islamic State in Iraq by announcing the “deactivation” of its land forces command headquarters. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over the Islamic State in December, five months after his forces recaptured the country’s second city Mosul in a protracted battle with the jihadist militants.  Islamic State, however, continues to carry out bombings, assassinations and ambushes in different areas of Iraq, and remains active in neighbouring Syria. In a statement, the U.S.-led coalition said its relationship with the Iraqi armed forces would evolve “from supporting and enabling combat operations to the training and development of self-sufficient Iraqi security-related capabilities”. “The Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command Headquarters was deactivated today at a ceremony in Baghdad, signifying the end of major combat operations against ISIS(Islamic State) in Iraq and acknowledging the changing composition and responsibilities of the coalition.”  Brett Mc Gurk, the U.S. envoy to the coalition, tweeted: “From Falluja to Tikrit, Baiji, Ramadi, Sinjar, Mosul and points in between, our coalition has been proud to stand beside Iraqi forces and (Kurdish) Peshmerga as they liberated their country and 4.5 million fellow citizens from ISIS.”  NATO nations agreed in February to a bigger “train-and-advise” mission in Iraq as part of a broader international effort to help rebuild the country from more than a decade of war as combat operations wind down. The United States wants to avoid a repeat of its 2011 withdrawal from Iraq and the subsequent rise of Islamic State as security unravelled. “The lesson learnt from Iraq (is that) it is dangerous to leave too early because we may be forced back into combat operations,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in February.

2018-04-30,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan became the sole candidate for the post of interim prime minister on Monday after a key deadline passed without other candidates registering. Whether or not he gets the job, left open by the resignation of long-time leader Serzh Sarksyan after two weeks of anti-government protests, depends on a parliamentary vote to be held on Tuesday. Pashinyan has received the support of all opposition parties in parliament, who hold 47 seats in the 105-seat legislature, but he will require a majority to win. Anti-government demonstrations, driven by public anger over perceived political cronyism and corruption in the South Caucasian former Soviet republic, led to Sarksyan’s resignation a week ago. At a meeting with the governing Republican party on Monday, as well as with the opposition bloc Way Out, Pashinyan said that a vote for him on Tuesday would be a vote for an end to the crisis. “I think this is a unique and great opportunity to resolve the domestic political crisis and to register the victory of the people, the kind of victory in which there are no losers,” Pashinyan, a former journalist turned lawmaker, said. After a break during the day, protests restarted in Yerevan towards the evening, with a column of demonstrators marching to the capital city’s main square. Speaking with journalists on Monday, Pashinyan said his main project as interim prime minister would be to organise new free and fair parliamentary elections for the post of prime minister. Although demonstrations have been peaceful, the upheaval has threatened to destabilise Armenia, an ally of Russia, in a volatile region riven by Armenia’s decades-long, low-level conflict with neighbouring Azerbaijan.

2018-04-30,"HAVANA (Reuters) - French energy firm Total SA (TOTF.PA) and German industrial giant Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) hope to sign a deal soon with Cuba to build a 600 megawatt gas-fired power plant on the island, according to diplomats and businessmen with knowledge of the talks. The two are leading a consortium that has been in negotiations with Communist-run Cuba since last year when they won a tender for the project, said the sources, who did not identify the other members “Total, with some international partners, is looking at a LNG power project in Cuba, one of several countries where Total is exploring similar LNG potentials,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. A Siemens spokesman in Germany was not immediately available for comment. The sources cautioned that many details of the project were under negotiation and that the combination of U.S. sanctions and Cuban bureaucracy meant there was no guarantee the agreement would be finalised, though they were hopeful. The potential deal is the latest example of companies from the European Union moving to take advantage of Cuba opening to foreign investment. “The EU has become Cuba’s first trade partner and was already the first in investment and development cooperation,” the European Union’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini said in January while visiting the country. Siemens signed a letter of intent with the Cuban power authority in 2016 to help modernize the grid. “With this important agreement ... we will assist and support Cuba on the development of a sustainable and modern electricity system,” Willi Meixner, head of Siemens Power and Gas division, said at the time. In the Matanzas Bay project, 124 kilometres (77 miles) east of Havana, Total would obtain the liquid gas from abroad, and then store, process and supply it to the plant, which would be built by Siemens, the sources said.    The project would mean less dependence on oil and less pollution, Jorge Pinon, a Cuban energy expert at the University of Texas in Austin, said. “It could be the best decision that the Cuban government has made towards an energy policy able to react to changes in price, geopolitical events and or supply-demand disruptions,” he said. Cuba was left in the lurch when its sole oil supplier, the Soviet Union, collapsed in 1991. More recently it has been scrambling to find alternative oil supplies as ally Venezuela’s economy and oil production implode. Cuba’s total generating capacity is around 6,000 megawatts and demand is increasing due to growing tourism, digitalisation and a new private sector. Around 95 percent of electricity in Cuba is generated by fossil fuels. The government has begun a programme to generate 24 percent with renewable sources by 2030. Total and Siemens have engaged in commerce with the Caribbean island nation for decades. Total was the first foreign company to drill for oil just off shore in the 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed. The company failed to find a commercially viable field. It also has a joint venture with Cuban state oil monopoly Cubapetroleo (CUPET), Elf Gas Cuba, which for 20 years has packed a liquid propane and butane gas mix into cylinders and distributes them for use by households and businesses in eastern Cuba. The Cuban state power authority, Union Electrica, and CUPET did not respond to a request for comment.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 32.12 million barrels per day this month, the survey found, down 70,000 bpd from March. The April total is the lowest since April 2017, according to Reuters surveys. OPEC is reducing output by about 1.2 million bpd as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers to get rid of excess supply. The pact started in January 2017 and runs until the end of 2018. Adherence by producers in the deal rose to 162 percent of agreed cuts from a revised 161 percent in March, the survey found. There was, again, no sign that Saudi Arabia or other big producers had boosted output significantly to cash in on higher prices or to compensate for the Venezuelan decline. “Thus, higher U.S. oil production is needed to plug the supply gap,” said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, referring to the lack of extra barrels from other OPEC members to compensate for declines. Oil has topped $75 a barrel LCOc1 this year for the first time since 2014, and was trading near $74 on Monday. Still,  OPEC says supply restraints should be maintained to ensure the end of a glut that had built up since 2014. In April, the biggest decrease in supply came from Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds because of economic crisis. Output dropped to 1.50 million bpd in April, the survey found, a new long-term low. Production in Angola, where natural declines at some fields are weighing on output, slipped and the country is pumping over 260,000 bpd less than its OPEC target. Nigerian exports, which have risen this year, slipped in April. Production in Libya, which remains unstable due to unrest, edged lower after a suspected act of sabotage briefly stopped flows from Waha Oil Co.’s fields, industry sources said. OPEC’s two largest producers, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, pumped slightly more but not enough to offset the declines elsewhere. Output in top producer Saudi Arabia edged up due to higher exports, sources in the survey said, but remained below the kingdom’s OPEC target. Iraq, the second-largest, pumped more because of an increase in exports from the south, the outlet for most of the country’s crude, despite maintenance at a loading terminal.  Output in the country holding the OPEC presidency this year, the United Arab Emirates, remained steady in April as it continues to show higher compliance than in 2017, sources close to the matter said. Kuwait also maintained full compliance. Nigeria and Libya were originally exempt from cutting supply because their output had been curbed by conflict and unrest. For 2018, both told OPEC that output would not exceed 2017 levels. OPEC has an implied production target for 2018 of 32.73 million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and taking into account changes of membership since, plus Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output. According to the survey, OPEC pumped about 610,000 bpd below this implied target in April, not least because of the involuntary declines in Venezuela and Angola. The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-04-30,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Marine salvage experts are floating a plan to tug icebergs from Antarctica to South Africa’s drought-hit Cape Town to help solve the region’s worst water shortage in a century. Salvage master Nick Sloane told Reuters he was looking for government and private investors for a scheme to guide huge chunks of ice across the ocean, chop them into a slurry and melt them down into millions of liters of drinking water. “We want to show that if there is no other source to solve the water crisis, we have another idea no one else has thought of yet,” said Sloane, who led the refloating of the capsized Italian passenger liner Costa Concordia in 2014. South Africa has declared a national disaster over the drought that hit its southern and western regions after 2015 and 2016 turned into two of the driest years on record. Tough water restrictions are already in place and Cape Town authorities have warned that taps could run dry altogether as soon as next year if winter rains do not come to the rescue of the port city’s 4 million residents. Cape Town-based Sloane said his team could wrap passing icebergs in fabric skirts to protect them and reduce evaporation. Large tankers could then guide the blocks into the Benguela Current that flows along the west coast of southern Africa. A milling machine would then cut into the ice, producing a slurry and forming a saucer structure that will speed up the natural process, he said. A single iceberg “could produce about 150 million liters per day for about a year,” around 30 percent of the city’s needs, said Sloane, a director at the U.S. marine salvage firm Resolve Marine. He said he was planning to hold a conference later this month to try and sell the $130 million project to city officials and investors. The city council was not immediately available for comment.

2018-04-30,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria plans to lift a ban on imports of cell phones, household appliances and food and bring in high customs duties instead, its trade minister said on Monday, a new attempt to generate more tax revenue to ease pressure on state finances. The North African country brought in the import ban at the start of this year with the aim of reducing spending after a fall in energy earnings. The ban replaced a license system the government imposed in 2016 in a failed attempt to ease the imports bill. “We consider imposing additional customs duties for finished goods. This is part of our search for (a) more efficient instrument,” the trade minister, Said Djellab, told a conference. “This plan will be discussed by the government in June,” he said. He did not say when the ban on imports would be lifted. Energy accounts for 60 percent of the state budget and 95 percent of total export revenues for the OPEC member country. Oil and gas earnings have almost halved since crude oil prices started falling in mid-2014, hitting state finances significantly “These are temporary preventive measures. The crisis taught us lessons,” Djellab said. In apparent reference to discontent from Algeria’s partners after the import restrictions, the minister said the government had started talks with suppliers including the European Union. “We explained to our partners, including the European Union, that we are experiencing a difficult period. They understood the situation. A dialogue is still going on with them,” he said. Measures regarding imports will be accompanied by steps to boost domestic production and a five-year plan aimed at diversifying exports will be discussed in July, he said. Algeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo discussed on Sunday possible exports to the African country of some industrial products including buses, household appliances and  electrical industry equipment. “We are targeting African markets but we need to improve the quality of our products,” Djellab said.

2018-04-30,"SAN JOSE, April 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Costa Rica will reach 200 years of independence in 2021 and the country’s new president plans to mark it with a revolution of his own: A plan to end the use of fossil fuels in transport. “When we reach 200 years of independent life we will take Costa Rica forward and celebrate ... that we’ve removed gasoline and diesel from our transportation” plans, Carlos Alvarado promised in his victory speech this month. The 38-year-old progressive beat rival Fabricio Alvarado, an evangelical preacher and musician, with 60 percent of the vote in second-round elections, and will take office on May 8. The president-elect’s promise marks the first time a Costa Rican leader has backed such a move, though green organizations have previously urged it. According to Alvarado’s environmental advisors, no date has yet been set for a full phase out of fossil fuels in transport, but the plan should be ready by 2021. Achieving zero-carbon transport quickly - even in a Central American country well-known for its environmental commitment - will be a significant challenge, energy experts say. Jose Daniel Lara, a Costa Rican energy researcher at the University of California-Berkeley, said completely eliminating fossil fuels within just a few years is probably unrealistic – though the plan will lay the groundwork for faster action toward the goal. “A proposal like this one must be seen by its rhetoric value and not by its technical precision,” Lara told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Oscar Echeverría, president of the Vehicle and Machinery Importers Association, said the transition away from fossil fuels in transport can’t be rushed as the clean transport market is so far undeveloped. “If there’s no previous infrastructure, competence, affordable prices and waste management we’d be leading this process to failure. We need to be careful,” Echeverría said. But economist Mónica Araya, a Costa Rican sustainability expert and director of Costa Rica Limpia, which promotes renewable energy and electric transport, said that in a country already rapidly weaning itself off fossil fuels, focusing on transport – one of the last major challenges – could send a powerful message to the world. “Getting rid of fossil fuels is a big idea coming from a small country. This is an idea that’s starting to gain international support with the rise of new technologies”, she said in an interview. Costa Rica’s push toward clean energy faces no large-scale backlash, in part because the country has no significant oil or gas industry. But demand for cars is rising, as is use of other transport systems, and that may prove one of the biggest challenges in meeting the new goal, Lara said. According to data by the National Registry – the country’s records agency – there were twice as many cars registered as babies born in 2016. Transport is today the country’s main source of climate changing emissions. According to the country’s National Meteorological Institute, 64 percent of Costa Rica’s emissions come from energy use, and more than two thirds of that is from transport. According to data from the State of the Region report, put together by a council of Costa Rica’s university leaders, public transport has struggled to meet the transport needs of the country. As a result, demand for private vehicles has risen dramatically, with the car industry growing 25 percent in 2015 alone, making Costa Rica one of the fastest growing auto markets in Latin America, according to the report. One problem in cutting back on fossil fuels is that the country’s budget depends on them, Lara said. According to Ministry of Treasury data, 22 percent - more than a fifth – of the government’s income comes from fossil fuel taxes, and most of those are levied on transport. That is particularly problematic because the country has run a budget deficit since 2009, with its debt now having climbed to more than 6 percent of GDP last year, according to the Treasury. The International Monetary Fund noted in 2017 that “public debt continues to rise rapidly” despite efforts to curb it. But the president’s proposal to eliminate fossil fuel use for transport could force a rethink of Costa Rica’s financial dependence on a pollution source, Lara said. The country could, for instance, consider broader new taxes on carbon emissions, Araya said, a move that could provide cost-savings benefits, including less spending by the country’s health services on respiratory problems. The new president-elect, a former national employment minister under the country’s current center-left government, envisions eliminating transport fuels as just another step toward a full phase-out of fossil fuels. Such an achievement would be a defining moment in the country’s history, akin to the country’s abolition of its army in 1948, he said. The effort to end the use of transport fossil fuels is expected to start with reform of the country’s hydrocarbon laws. Araya said that the rapid international scale-up of renewable power and electric transport could make things easier – and be a big economic opportunity for Costa Rica. “For example, it took almost 20 years to get to one million electric cars (worldwide). It took 18 months to reach two million. The third million happened in around the next eight months. This is exponential growth”, she said. Prices are falling and efficiency growing in new clean energy technologies, including battery storage, she said. The biggest barrier to seeing them much more widely used may simply be that people aren’t yet used to them, she added. “Tackling resistance to change is one of the most important tasks we have right now” Araya said.

2018-04-30,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil ethanol producers stand to lose a big chunk of their largest market, Japan, to U.S. agribusiness, after Tokyo bent to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump and tweaked requirements for gasoline additives. Until recently, nearly all the ethanol used to make ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) for Japanese consumption has come from Brazil, whose sugarcane-based ethanol boasts lower emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than U.S. ethanol made from corn. But in mid-April, Japan’s government loosened emissions requirements on ETBE while its prime minister was visiting the United States. Brazilian cane industry group Unica accused Tokyo of backsliding on environmental controls. But American ethanol producers cheered the move, a rare trade victory for U.S. farmers who have suffered much of the blowback from Washington’s escalating trade row with China. “For the first time, the U.S. ethanol industry will have the opportunity to compete for a portion of Japan’s fuel blending market,” said Emily Skor, head of Washington-based ethanol group Growth Energy, in a statement. Brazilian cane producers are the latest casualties in a trade dispute kicked off by Trump last year. China boosted imports of Brazilian soybeans and threatened tariffs on U.S. soybeans. Steep duties on U.S. sorghum imports made shippers find new homes for 20 bulk vessels worth more than $200 million that were already en route to China. Japan’s new ethanol rules started with a public consultation last year to review fuel blending standards.  However, a senior Brazilian diplomat said on condition of anonymity that Brasilia had expected the move as a way for Japan to ease Trump’s concerns about that country’s trade surplus with the United States. “Due to the large U.S. trade deficit, it was clear that ethanol could be one of those products used to reduce the imbalance,” the diplomat said. Japan consumes nearly 45 percent of Brazil’s ethanol exports, or about 800 million liters annually, including the volumes used for ETBE, much of which is made by U.S. producers. Much of the ETBE used in Japan is already made in the United States using Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, so the new rules should make it easy for producers to switch quickly to U.S. corn-based sources. A U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report said the Japanese policy change could create a market opportunity for U.S. ethanol producers of 366 million liters, valued at around $170 million. “In the end, whatever you take away from Brazil you give to the U.S.,” an ethanol export trader said. The shift adds to rising tension in the ethanol industry. Last year, Brazil slapped a 20 percent tariff on U.S. exports in an effort to slow south-bound flows. Even with the tariff, U.S. ethanol exports hit a record high in February, thanks largely to rising Brazilian demand as higher gasoline prices and low international sugar prices made ethanol more competitive at the pump.

2018-04-30,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is fully committed to its gas joint venture in Iraq, after the energy major exited its oil assets in the OPEC country, and plans to boost its gas output there to 1.4 billion cubic feet (bcf) a day by 2020, a senior executive said.  Iraq’s gas development plans have long focussed on Basra Gas Co (BGC), a $17 billion, 25-year project in which Iraq has 51 percent, Shell 44 percent and Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) 5 percent. The project was designed to aggregate gas from fields in the south including West Qurna 1, operated by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N); Zubair, operated by Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI); and Rumaila, developed by BP (BP.L).   Frits Klap, managing director of BGC, told Reuters that gas output from the JV, the main producer of the fuel in southern Iraq, was currently at 938 million standard cubic feet (scf) per day with further expansion planned. “Since 2013 (when operations commenced), we have more than tripled the processing capacity,” Klap said in a telephone interview from Basra. “We are going to go for something called BNGL, or Basra NGL (natural gas liquids) expansion, which really is going to take us from 1 bcf to 1.4 bcf through two trains, each of 200 million scf per day,” he said.  He said he expected those trains to be up and running by the end of 2020. The number of trains could be raised to five, he said, with a final investment decision due around the year-end. “So that’s about a 40 percent expansion, and that would be massive,” he said. Iraq plans to stop flaring by 2021. Gas flaring costs nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue for the government and would be sufficient to meet most needs for gas‐based power generation, according to the World Bank. Shell had said it would focus its efforts on the development and growth of BGC after handing over operations at the Majnoon field to the Iraqi government. Shell also sold its stake in West Qurna 1 to Japan’s Itochu Corp (8001.T) Klap said Shell was committed to BGC. “Shell will just be in a stronger position to focus its efforts on the development and growth of BGC and of course potentially the Nebras petrochemicals project,” he said.  “Shell remains fully committed to Iraq through BGC.” In 2015, Shell signed a deal with Iraq worth $11 billion to build a petrochemicals plant in Basra, part of Iraq’s plans to diversify its income. The Nebras complex, which is still in the pre-FEED (front end engineering design) stage, could make Iraq the largest petrochemical producer in the Middle East. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is in talks to join Shell as a partner in the Nebras project, an Iraqi official told Reuters in February. Klap declined to comment on specific discussions but said Shell was holding talks with several partners on the project. Iraq’s production of associated gas is expected to grow as the country increases its oil output capacity. Iraq plans to  raise the country’s crude oil production potential to 6.5 million barrels per day by 2022, from about 5 million bpd now. Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, is producing about 4.4 million bpd, below its capacity, in line with global supply cuts led by OPEC to boost oil prices.

2018-04-30,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Taiwan is becoming the next battleground for the world’s top offshore wind developers as they seek a foothold in Asia for a technology that has been expanding fast in Europe. Taiwan announced results on Monday of its first major offshore wind farm auction that aims to add 3.8 gigawatts (GW) of capacity to its existing network of just 8 megawatts (MW). The island’s offshore wind market is expected to expand to 5.5 GW by 2025, and the government aims to invest $23 billion on onshore and offshore wind projects by 2025, law firm Jones Day says. Taiwan is making a big push to attract investments in renewable technology as it phases out nuclear power by 2025, after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan highlighted the risks of using nuclear energy in a region prone to earthquakes. For developers in Europe, where expanding offshore wind projects particularly in the North Sea has driven down costs, Taiwan is seen as a route into Asian markets, such as Japan and South Korea, where the technology is still barely used. Denmark’s Orsted and Germany’s wpd were Monday’s biggest winners, securing contracts to install 900 MW and 1 GW of capacity, respectively. “We see Taiwan as a stepping stone into Asia-Pacific,” said Matthias Bausenwein, the regional general manager for Orsted, the world’s largest owner of offshore wind power sites that was previously known as DONG Energy. GRAPHIC - tmsnrt.rs/2rr299K Taiwan’s auction drew bids from the world’s biggest international players, attracted by the island’s strong winds, a stable regulatory framework and the offer of 20-year power purchase agreements with a feed-in-tariff above European benchmarks. “We have aggressive targets in Taiwan and, with things going on in China, South Korea and other markets, that amounts to it becoming the fastest-growing region globally,” said Bausenwein. Offshore wind power is costlier than onshore projects or solar power, and still only accounts for about 3.5 percent of global wind energy capacity. But Europe has been leading the way in using the technology, adding 3 GW last year and taking total offshore capacity to 19 GW, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. Costs have plunged as a result. In last week’s auction in Germany, the world’s second biggest offshore wind power market, some bids offered capacity with no subsidies. In Britain, the world’s biggest market, the cost of wind power fell below new nuclear generation for the first time last year. This has been encouraged by an expanding regional grid, greater ability to manage variable wind power supplies and the growing scale of turbines, expected to have capacity of 10 to 15 MW each in two or three years, roughly twice as powerful as today. Taiwan is not considering firms from China, the world’s third biggest offshore market and which claims Taiwan as Chinese territory. Chung-Hsien Chen, director of the energy technology division at Taiwan’s Bureau of Energy, said Chinese bids were excluded “due to concerns of national security”. Alongside Orsted and wpd, other bidders included Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Canada’s Northland Power, Yushan Energy, a subsidiary of Singapore based Enterprize Energy and Taiwanese firms China Steel Cooperation and Taipower.  After awarding 3.8 GW capacity on Monday, a further 2 GW will be allocated through a competitive price tender this summer. Monday’s auction had included an assessment of factors such as the amount of local content included. European firms want local suppliers to avoid the cost of shipping bulky equipment used in the turbines from Europe. “The requirements for local content are increasing step by step,” said Andreas Nauen, offshore chief executive for Siemens Gamesa, adding some European equipment would initially be used. Siemens Gamesa is working to develop the Port of Taichung as a regional hub and has signed non-binding agreements with some local partners that could provide gear locally. MHI Vestas, a venture between Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Danish turbine maker Vestas, is also considering developing local manufacturing. “We want to produce locally because we want to be competitive,” the joint venture’s chief executive, Philippe Kavafyan, told Reuters.

The TAPI pipeline - named after the countries involved, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India - was first proposed three decades ago. But the region’s complex geopolitics and security concerns have hindered its construction. TAPI will transport 33 billion cubic meters of gas a year along an 1,800 km (1,125 mile) route from Turkmenistan’s Galkynysh, the world’s second-biggest gas field, to Fazilka in northwest India. “We have announced our readiness to Turkmenistan for exporting their natural gas to Pakistan, but have not received any response from them,” Araqi said. “Given Iran’s situation in the centre of the region, we can join every gas pipeline that passes around the country.” (Writing by Parisa Hafezi, editing by Louise Heavens and Alexander Smith)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-turkmenistan-pipeline/update-1-iran-views-turkmenistan-india-gas-pipeline-as-unlikely-report-idUKL8N1S759G,30 Apr 2018,"Iran is ready to participate in

2018-04-30,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday dealt another setback to a proposed natural gas pipeline running from Pennsylvania to New York, rejecting Constitution Pipeline Co’s bid to challenge New York state’s refusal to issue a needed water permit for the project. The high court left in place an August 2017 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in favor of the state. Partners in the 125-mile (201-km) pipeline project include Williams Cos Inc, Duke Energy Corp, WGL Holdings Inc and Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates pipelines, first approved construction of the project in 2014 and then again in 2016, conditional upon other approvals. Constitution, which filed with FERC to build the pipeline in 2013, separately sought water quality certification with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation in August 2013. But the state denied the application in April 2016, saying the company failed to provide sufficient information to determine whether the project would comply with the state’s water quality standards.  Constitution appealed that decision to the 2nd Circuit, but lost. The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear the company’s appeal of the 2nd Circuit’s ruling does not necessarily kill the project. The company has separately petitioned FERC to overturn the state agency’s decision. In March, the federal regulator gave itself more time to consider the issue. If built, the pipeline would transport 0.65 billion cubic feet per day of shale gas. New York uses on average about 3.6 bcfd of gas.

Oil dipped after a rising rig count in the United States pointed to higher production there, but markets held near their highest in more than three years. The Dubai index added 0.6 percent, fuelled by gains in property stocks and financials. Lender Emirates NBD was up 0.9 percent. Emaar Properties jumped 2.7 percent, while its unit Emaar Development climbed 0.9 percent after the development firm recorded a net profit of 819 million dirhams ($223 million) in the first quarter of 2018, versus 506 million a year earlier. SICO Bahrain had forecast a net profit of 767 million dirhams and EFG Hermes’ forecast was 800 million dirhams. “The results from Emaar Development as well as Emaar Malls suggest the group is navigating the current downturn rather well,” said Vrajesh Bhandari, a portfolio manager at Al Mal Capital. Emaar Malls’ net profit rose 1.7 percent to 548 million dirhams, in line with SICO Bahrain’s forecast. Emaar and other property stocks have been a drag on the Dubai stock market this year due to concerns over the outlook for property prices. The Dubai index is down 9 percent so far this year. In Saudi Arabia, the main index was down 0.2 percent, with banks largely providing support. Energy stocks were hit by oil’s correction and profit-taking after recent gains. Rabigh Refining and Petrochemical dropped 5.6 percent as investors took profit after the stock’s big rally this year. The stock is up 67 percent so far this year. Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) dropped 2.9 percent, a day after its earnings broadly met analysts’ forecasts. Al Rajhi Bank rose 0.3 percent and Banque Saudi Fransi added 0.9 percent. Saudi National Petrochemical Co (Petrochem) jumped 2 percent after solid quarterly results, making a net profit of 333.9 million riyals versus 167.9 million a year earlier. In Abu Dhabi, Etisalat lost 0.9 percent and Aldar Properties declined 0.5 percent, pulling down the main index. Dana Gas rose 4 percent, rebounding from a sharp drop in the previous session. The stock has been volatile after an English court refused the company’s application to overturn a previous order restraining Dana Gas from distributing dividends to its shareholders for 2017. Qatar’s index lost 0.3 percent as lender Masraf al Rayan shed 0.5 percent and Barwa Real Estate fell 1.8 percent. In Egypt, Global Telecom Holding continued its downward spiral, falling 3 percent. The stock has been under pressure since the start of the month after majority shareholder Veon withdrew an offer to buy the rest of the company and said it would not make another. It has lost more than a fifth of its value in the last month. The benchmark index was flat.

Friday’s seemingly successful summit between the leaders of North and South Korean was the icing on the cake, pushing Asian bourses higher on Monday. MSCI’s all-country index of global equities is up 1.3 percent for April ahead of another torrent of first quarter earnings. Apple is set to be the standout report on Tuesday. Strong earnings from Facebook and Amazon gave global technology stocks a shot in the arm last week. Reports of big M&A deals, including T-Mobile’s proposed merger with Sprint in the United States and a tie-up between British supermarket chains Sainsbury’s and ASDA, kept global stock markets firmly in the spotlight. “Large M&A news shows that confidence is there for making big deals. And while I would suggest not all of the recent deals are positive, the ASDA-Sainsbury’s one looks particularly good and the stock price reactions seems to bear that out,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Sainsbury’s shares shot up 20 percent at the open after the retailer agreed a 13.3 billion pound merger with Walmart’s ASDA. The news shook up retail stocks across Europe. Overall, the pan-continental STOXX index rose 0.1 percent while Germany’s DAX gained a similar amount. Futures pricing pointed towards another higher open on Wall Street. <1YMc1 Asian shares had earlier extended gains as tensions in the Korean Peninsula eased and first-quarter earnings shone, although some investors were cautious about the outlook against the backdrop of a simmering U.S.-China trade dispute. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1 percent, adding to a similar rise on Friday. The index is now poised for a modest rise this month after two consecutive losses. South Korea’s KOSPI index jumped 0.8 percent and is set to end April more than 2.5 percent higher following record profits from tech giant Samsung Electronics and after a successful inter-Korean summit. On Friday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the North’s leader Kim Jong Un agreed to end hostilities and work toward “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula. “The direction of travel is more positive that it was at the end of last year and geopolitics is now not the concern it was in the beginning of April,” said Hewson of CMC Markets. “But the potential for trade wars would be the main issue for me going forward, that’s the clear and present danger, and what effect it may have on oil prices.” Oil eased from recent highs with Brent crude futures off 62 cents at $74.02 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 66 cents to $67.44. The dollar meanwhile held steady just below its strongest level since mid-January against a basket of currencies as traders awaited U.S. consumer spending numbers to see whether the greenback can continue its recent run of gains. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also due to meet this week, and while no rate hike is expected, investors will look for clues on the future pace of hikes. “There might be a tweak to the inflation language acknowledging the move towards 2 percent on year-on-year inflation rather than ‘have continued to run below 2 percent’”, Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note. U.S. payrolls numbers are also due Friday. In Europe, the prospect of fresh Italian elections sent Southern European bond prices tumbling while Italian stocks fell on a day of gains for most European share indexes. The leader of Italy’s 5-Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, said on Monday the only solution was to hold fresh elections, and called on the League’s Salvini to back him in calling for a fresh vote in June. The yield on Italy’s 10-year government bond spiked 6 basis points to 1.80 percent and the gap over benchmark Germany was at its widest in nearly two weeks. Bond yields move inversely to their prices.

2018-04-30,"ALGIERS, April 30 (Reuters) - Algeria’s state energy firm Sonatrach said on Monday it boosted its gas output by 5 percent to 135 billion cubic metres in 2017, marking the first time the company has used a news conference to disclose production data. Sonatrach’s CEO, appointed a year ago, has been trying to overhaul the company, a sprawling and secretive empire not used to change, and increase transparency as the North African country wants to attract more investment. Total oil and gas output rose by 2 percent in 2017 to 196.5 tonnes of oil equivalent, Chief Executive Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour told reporters. Oil production fell 3 percent due to OPEC quotas, he said. The company’s turnover from oil and gas in 2017 was $33.2 billion, he said, adding that the firm had invested $8.1 billion in 2017, down 8.8 percent from the previous year. Kaddour, a U.S.-trained engineer, took the reins at Sonatrach last year to overhaul a company plagued by contract disputes with foreign firms, red tape, stagnant production and corruption scandals. He gave no details of the firm’s future strategy at the news conference, beyond previously stated general messages. “We need to transform Sonatrach into one of the top five national companies in the world,” Kaddour said. “Less bureaucracy and more professionalism.” Algeria, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a major gas supplier to Europe, has been hit by a slump in oil prices and struggled to attract investment to help develop new fields and increase existing production. In December, Sonatrach said it planned to work more closely with France’s Total on offshore, petrochemical, solar energy and shale exploration projects after settling disputes over profit-sharing on oil and gas contracts. Algeria remains dependent on oil and gas earnings, which provide 60 percent of the state budget, and Sonatrach’s performance is key to the economy. The country has been working on a new energy law to provide better incentives for foreign firms, which had been deterred by current terms. But there are still divergent views within Algeria over how hard to push for foreign investment and domestic economic reform to boost revenue and growth.

2018-04-30,"(Repeats with no change to text or headline) * Marathon paying $152/share to create biggest independent refiner * Andeavor assets include pipelines, refineries, gas stations * Marathon CEO Heminger to head combined firm * Andeavor shares surge 14.5 pct By John Benny April 30 (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp said on Monday it would buy rival Andeavor for more than $23 billion, forming a company that would leapfrog Valero Energy Corp as the largest independent U.S. refiner by capacity. Shale oil fields have pushed U.S. crude production to record highs and industry experts argue operations that have capacity to refine light crude like Andeavor will be better positioned to take advantage of the boom. Andeavor also runs refineries in  Alaska, California, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington which should complement Marathon’s largely Mid-West and Gulf Coast-based operations. The cash-and-stock deal values Andeavor, formerly known as Tesoro, at about $152 per share, a premium of about 24 percent to closing prices on Friday, driving shares 14.5 percent higher in initial premarket trading on Monday. Marathon’s board also approved an additional $5 billion share buy back, but its shares were just over 1 percent lower. Including Andeavor’s debt, Marathon is paying $35.6 billion to hold 66 percent of a combined company which will have the ability to process about 3.1 million barrels per day along with a large network of filling stations and oil and natural gas pipelines. Marathon Chief Executive Gary Heminger, who oversaw a 20 percent rise in net profit in the first quarter, will run the combined company, with a senior role for Andeavor’s chief executive, Gregory Goff. “Each of our operating segments are strengthened through this transaction,” Heminger said in a statement. “It geographically diversifies our refining portfolio into attractive markets......enhances our midstream footprint in the Permian basin, and creates a nationwide retail and marketing portfolio,” he added. The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.

2018-04-30,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2JEyL9A By John Kemp LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - For all the bullish chatter, hedge fund managers have become cautious about increasing their exposure to crude oil, though they are becoming increasingly optimistic about the outlook for refined fuels again. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by six million barrels in the week to April 24. Net length was reduced in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-17 million barrels), Brent (-7 million) and European gasoil (-2 million) but increased in U.S. heating oil (+7 million) and especially U.S. gasoline (+13 million). Portfolio managers have not really increased their net long position in WTI and Brent since the start of April and arguably not since the start of February, which is perhaps a sign they are now fully invested. In contrast, fund managers have been adding net long positions in gasoline and heating oil, after cutting them in February and March, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges. By April 24, funds held a record net long position in U.S. gasoline equivalent to 111 million barrels as well as a net position in heating oil equivalent to 69 million barrels (tmsnrt.rs/2JEyL9A). Hedge fund managers have amassed a near-record position of 1.405 billion barrels in petroleum and show no signs of rushing to take profits despite the rise in prices to their highest level since 2014. But if there has been no liquidation, there has also been no further buying, except for refined fuels, and overall there has been no upward buying momentum in the petroleum complex for over two months. For the time being, most funds have already put on their positions, and are now waiting to see if the fundamentals will validate their bullish expectations.

2018-04-30,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Privately held U.S.-based POET Llc has overtaken industry pioneer and global grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) to become the top ethanol producer in the world, the companies told Reuters. ADM had been the biggest ethanol maker since the United States began requiring refiners to mix billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline more than a decade ago, under the Renewable Fuel Standard. The shift highlights the differing tacks top biofuel makers are taking to address lacklustre profits, a supply glut and the oil lobby’s push against the U.S. biofuels programme. ADM is reducing exposure while POET is expanding in an effort to increase profits through efficiency and scale.   POET’s annual biofuel capacity has grown to 1.9 billion gallons and will reach 2 billion by 2019; ADM’s has shrunk to about 1.6 billion gallons, according to figures provided by each company. Prior to this year, both had capacities of about 1.8 billion gallons. The U.S. ethanol industry has total output potential of more than 16 billion gallons. ADM, which will report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Tuesday, diverted some of its capacity to beverage and industrial alcohol at its plant in Peoria, Illinois, as part of a strategy to make higher-margin products. The company last year had also put some of its plants up for sale but did not find a buyer. Meanwhile, POET boosted output by adding grain fermenters and other upgrades at several of its 27 ethanol plants and is expanding a facility in Marion, Ohio. POET constantly finds “new ways to increase yield, make gains in efficiency and maximize returns,” Jeff Broin, POET chief executive officer, told Reuters on Friday. Possible acquisitions by POET of other U.S. ethanol plants are also a possibility, Broin said. Both POET and ADM are pushing for increased U.S. ethanol exports and more sales of higher-ethanol blends to draw down abundant supplies of both grain and biofuel. “There are 20 billion bushels of corn, wheat and soybeans stockpiled globally with no end in sight,” Broin said. “This oversupply has led to four straight years of declining farm income, which is why we’re entering into a modern-day (agriculture) crisis.”  Reporting by Michael Hirtzer; Editing by Simon Webb and Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-ethanol-poetllc-archer-daniels/poet-unseats-adm-as-top-global-fuel-ethanol-maker-idUKL1N1S4258,30 Apr 2018,"Privately held U.S.-based POET

Starting in July, CEFC could take eight cargoes of about 740,000 barrels, or 5.92 million barrels of ESPO crude, from Rosneft, the four sources said. The cargoes are part of a five-year supply contract with the Russian producer for 12 million tonnes of oil per year it signed late in 2017 that jump started CEFC’s oil trading business. Previously, Rosneft supplied CEFC with six ESPO cargoes, two cargoes of Sokol crude and two Urals shipments. CEFC will swap the Sokol cargoes with the ESPO, the sources said. Rosneft said in an email on Friday that it will supply its term contracts based on the agreed timing and volumes without saying that it is increasing ESPO shipments to CEFC. The swap arrangement is a sign that CEFC’s landmark crude oil deal with top Russian producer Rosneft remains intact even as the Chinese firm’s planned $9 billion investment in Rosneft has stalled. News that CEFC’s founder and chairman Ye Jianming was investigated by Chinese authorities for suspected economic crimes spooked CEFC’s trading partners in March, but market participants are convinced that China’s government may step in to take over the private company. “Now the market believes that chances are high that the Chinese government will step in and take care of the problems. It has gone past the earlier panic in March,” said a Beijing-based trading executive who deals with CEFC’s Russian barrels. The increase in ESPO cargoes gives CEFC control over about 30 percent of the total seaborne ESPO sold in a month, up from 19 percent, making it a key Russian crude supplier to China, the world’s largest oil importer. Russia was China’s top oil supplier in March, retaining the lead spot for a 13th consecutive month. CEFC’s number of counterparties has also grown to between six and seven buyers for its cargoes for loading in May to June while the firm last month won for the first time a tender to supply ESPO to Chinese independent refiner Hontop Energy via a third party, one of the sources said. CEFC has six staff in Singapore to handle crude sales and operations while the team’s managing director Ocean Qiu sits in Shanghai.

2018-04-30,"LONDON/SYDNEY, April 30 (Reuters) - Chevron will idle the second production unit at its Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in May to carry out modifications already implemented at the other two units, a senior executive said. Pat Yarrington, Chevron’s vice president and chief financial officer, said in an earnings call on Friday that Gorgon Train 2 in Australia has a planned “pit stop” in May for crews to replicate performance improvement modifications. Traders said the maintenance is expected to last 30 days. The work will focus on remedying vibration problems already fixed on Trains 1 and 3, they said. A company spokesman declined to comment on the maintenance duration or the issues being addressed. Meanwhile, work on Chevron’s second Australian LNG mega-project in Australia, at Wheatstone, is progressing, Yarrington said. LNG production at Wheatstone’s first train started in October 2017. The company expects to start LNG production from the second train this quarter, Yarrington said, bringing the facility to its annual target output of 8.9 million tonnes. Chevron also plans to exploit global gas supply deficits forecast early in the next decade by boosting production from existing trains at Gorgon and Wheatstone through a process known as debottlenecking, vice-president of midstream Mark Nelson said. “Only the most cost-competitive projects will be able to move forward in this space and we will be very disciplined with our investment and will fund only those projects that will generate top returns,” he said, adding it was premature to consider building entirely new trains.

2018-04-30,"OSLO (Reuters) - Britain and the United States launched a $25 million project on Monday to study the risks of a collapse of a giant glacier in Antarctica that is already shrinking and nudging up global sea levels. The five-year research, involving 100 scientists, would be the two nations’ biggest joint scientific project in Antarctica since the 1940s. Ice is thawing from Greenland to Antarctica and man-made global warming is accelerating the trend.   The scientists would study the Thwaites Glacier, which is roughly the size of Florida or Britain, in West Antarctica, the UK Natural Environment Research Council and U.S. National Science Foundation said in a joint statement. “Rising sea levels are a globally important issue which cannot be tackled by one country alone,” UK science minister Sam Gyimah said. Thwaites and the nearby Pine Island Glacier are two of the biggest and fastest-retreating glaciers in Antarctica.  If both abruptly collapsed, allowing ice far inland to flow faster into the oceans, world sea levels could rise by more than a meter (3 feet), threatening cities from Shanghai to San Francisco and low-lying coastal regions. The scientists would deploy planes, hot water drills, satellite measurements, ships and robot submarines to one of the remotest parts of the planet to see “whether the glacier’s collapse could begin in the next few decades or centuries,” the statement said. Despite satellites, “there are still many aspects of the ice and ocean that cannot be determined from space,” said Ted Scambos, of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the lead U.S. scientific coordinator. Other scientists from South Korea, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand and Finland would also contribute. The United States is keeping up research even though U.S. President Donald Trump doubts mainstream scientific findings that human activities, led by the burning of fossil fuels, are the main cause of global warming.

2018-04-30,"(Reuters) - Strong compliance with OPEC-led production cuts, robust demand and supply disruptions in the Middle East are likely to lift oil’s average price this year to above $67 a barrel, a Reuters poll showed on Monday. The survey of 38 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude LCOc1 would average $67.40 in 2018, more than 5 percent higher than the $63.97 projected in the previous month’s poll. It is also the highest 2018 average forecast for Brent since at least December 2015. Oil analysts polled by Reuters have raised their price forecasts every month since last August. “With the market situation tightening, the stance of OPEC on production cuts is a key driver of prices going ahead. Additionally, crude oil demand is expected to remain healthy in 2018 and 2019, higher than expected GDP growth,” said Rahul Prithiani, director at CRISIL Research. “Strong compliance (with production cuts) is expected at an overall level during the year ... Global GDP growth is expected to rise to 3.9 percent this year and in 2019. As a result, oil demand growth is also expected to remain robust over the next two years.” Led by Saudi Arabia, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers have curtailed output since 2017 to tackle a global supply overhang that had depressed oil prices between 2014 and 2016. As a result of a gradually tightening market, Brent and U.S. WTI crude hit their highest since November 2014 in April at $75.47 and $69.56 per barrel respectively. Brent prices have risen nearly 11 percent so far this year, while WTI prices are up 12.6 percent. Analysts saw U.S. light crude CLc1 averaging $63.23 a barrel this year, versus $59.85 in the March poll. “With the rise in oil prices, U.S. production is expected to expand rapidly in the upcoming months,” ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said. “Crude prices may remain elevated in the short run, until an increase in drilling activity in the U.S. accelerates growth in production.” U.S. output C-OUT-T-EIA has grown by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.54 million barrels per day, making it the world’s second-biggest crude oil producer behind Russia, which pumps almost 11 million bpd. However, analysts expect rising demand from Asia, led by China, to absorb part of the increase in U.S. supply.  Demand in Asia, the world’s biggest oil-consuming region, has hit a record as new and expanded refineries start up from China to Vietnam. “At the moment, I don’t see signs of demand getting weaker ... Inventory tightening will go on as long as OPEC will stick to their policy of limited production,” said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW. Geopolitical tension in the Middle East and an economic crisis in OPEC member Venezuela could also keep prices elevated for the rest of 2018, analysts said.  While the possibility of a reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran led to the recent rally, any significant development could push prices even higher, analysts said.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to pull the United States out of a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six major powers, will decide by May 12 whether to restore economic sanctions on Tehran. “While we assume that part of the risk is already priced in, we nevertheless believe that a termination of the deal would lead to an immediate increase of the oil price by $2-3 per barrel,” Hannes Loacker of Raiffeisen Capital Management said. “It cannot be ruled out that the Brent price will even temporarily peak above the $80 mark.” Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-prices/poll-opec-discipline-healthy-demand-likely-to-power-oil-rally-through-2018-idUKL8N1S465A,30 Apr 2018,"* Venezuelan output dip, Asian demand to help offset U.S.

A seemingly successful Korean summit between the leaders of the North and South on Friday added the icing on the cake, pushing Asian bourses higher on Monday. MSCI’s all-country index of global equities is up 1.3 percent for April ahead of another torrent of first quarter earnings, with Apple the standout report on Tuesday. This after strong earnings reports from Facebook and Amazon gave tech stocks across the world a shot in arm last week. Reports of large M&A deals, led by T-Mobile’s proposed merger with Sprint in the U.S. and the Sainsbury’s and ASDA merger in the UK, also kept global stock markets firmly in the spotlight. “Large M&A news shows that confidence is there for making big deals. And while I would suggest not all of the recent deals are positive, the ASDA-Sainsbury’s one looks particularly good and the stock price reactions seems to bear that out,” said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. Sainsbury’s shares shot up 20 percent at the open after the retailer agreed a 13.3 billion pound merger with Walmart’s ASDA, and the news shook up retail stocks in Europe. Overall, the pan-continental STOXX index rose 0.1 percent while Germany’s DAX gained 0.3 percent, buoyed by investors’ improved risk appetite. This after Asian shares extended gains on Monday as tensions in the Korean Peninsula eased and first-quarter earnings shone, although some investors were cautious about the outlook amid the backdrop of a simmering U.S.-China trade dispute. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed one percent, adding to a similar rise on Friday. The index is now poised for a modest rise this month after two consecutive losses. South Korea’s KOSPI index jumped 0.8 percent and is set to end April more than 2.5 percent higher following record profits from tech giant Samsung Electronics and after a successful inter-Korean summit. On Friday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the North’s leader Kim Jong Un agreed to end hostilities and work toward “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula. “The direction of travel is more positive that it was at the end of last year and geopolitics is now not the concern it was in the beginning of April,” said Hewson of CMC Markets. “But the potential for trade wars would be the main issue for me going forward, that’s the clear and present danger and what effect it may have on oil prices,” he added. Oil prices eased from recent highs with Brent crude futures off 94 cents at $73.70 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 67 cents to $67.43. The dollar meanwhile held steady just below its strongest level since mid-January against as basket of currencies as traders awaited U.S. consumer spending numbers to see whether the greenback can continue its recent run of gains. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also due to meet this week, and while no rate hike is expected, investors will look for clues on the future pace of hikes. “There might be a tweak to the inflation language acknowledging the move towards two percent on year-on-year inflation rather than ‘have continued to run below two percent’”, Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note. The U.S. payroll number is also due Friday. German inflation numbers are also set to be reported later on Monday, with investors expecting the continent’s largest economy to record consumer price rises of 1.6 percent. The question is whether this will translate to a push for euro zone inflation towards the European Central Bank target of just below two percent. Euro zone bond yields have remained well below the year’s highs. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield was up a basis point on Monday but still firmly below the 0.60 percent mark.

2018-04-30,"SINGAPORE, April 30 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil is launching a mass flow metering (MFM) system for marine gasoil (MGO) refuelling barges in Singapore, with the first deliveries under the system set to start next month, the company said in a statement on Monday. The meters will enhance the transparency of the marine refuelling, or bunkering, process by keeping better track of volumes and reduce refuelling times by up to three hours, the company said. ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, said the new system for MGO deliveries will start ahead of a deadline Singapore authorities announced last week. Singapore’s Maritime Port Authority (MPA) said it would extend the mandatory use of MFMs to bunker barges delivering distillate fuels to large ships from July 1, 2019, ahead of an expected pick-up in the use of distillates to meet caps on sulphur content in marine fuels. New rules by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will significantly cut the amount of sulphur that ships can burn in their engines from 2020. The new rules will increase gasoil consumption by close to 1 million barrel per day at the expense of the high-sulphur fuel oil that is typically used to power ship engines. Singapore, the world’s largest marine refuelling hub, became the first port to mandate the use of mass flow meters in 2017, making them compulsory for marine fuel oil bunker barges licensed by the MPA.

Known for his passion for detail when he was business minister, Javid, who backed staying in the European Union, will take over Britain’s Home Office at a time it is under scrutiny for using targets for the deportation of illegal migrants. He may also change the balance adopted by May’s team in negotiating Britain’s departure from the EU.

His predecessor, Amber Rudd, was forced to resign after she admitted in a letter to May that she had “inadvertently misled” a parliamentary committee last Wednesday by denying the government had targets for the deportation of illegal migrants.

2018-04-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s interior minister resigned on Sunday after Prime Minister Theresa May’s government faced an outpouring of indignation over its treatment of some long-term Caribbean residents who were wrongly labelled illegal immigrants. The loss of one of May’s closest allies is a blow as she navigates the final year of negotiations ahead of Britain’s exit from the European Union in March 2019. It also deprives the cabinet of one of its most outspoken pro-European members. In a resignation letter to May, Amber Rudd said she had inadvertently misled a parliamentary committee last Wednesday by denying the government had targets for the deportation of illegal migrants. May accepted her resignation. For two weeks, British ministers have been struggling to explain why some descendants of the so-called “Windrush generation”, invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, had been denied basic rights. The Windrush scandal overshadowed the Commonwealth summit in London and has raised questions about May’s six-year stint as interior minister before she became prime minister in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum. “The Windrush scandal has rightly shone a light on an important issue for our country,” Rudd said in a resignation letter to May.  Rudd, who was appointed Home Secretary in 2016, said voters wanted those who had the right to reside in Britain to be treated fairly and humanely but also that illegal immigrants be removed. The opposition Labour Party, which had repeatedly called on Rudd to resign, said May was responsible and should explain her own role in the government’s immigration policies. “The architect of this crisis, Theresa May, must now step forward to give an immediate, full and honest account of how this inexcusable situation happened on her watch,” said Diane Abbott, Labour’s spokeswoman on interior affairs. Abbott called on May to give a statement to the House of Commons explaining whether she knew that Rudd was misleading parliament about the deportation targets. Facing questions over the Windrush scandal, Rudd, 54, told lawmakers on Wednesday that Britain did not have targets for the removal of immigrants, but was forced to clarify her words after leaked documents showed some targets did exist. The Guardian newspaper on Sunday reported a letter from Rudd to May last year in which she stated an “ambitious but deliverable” aim for an increase in the enforced deportation of immigrants. After repeated challenges to her testimony on the deportation of immigrants, Rudd telephoned May on Sunday and offered her resignation. “I feel it is necessary to do so because I inadvertently misled the Home Affairs Select Committee over targets for removal of illegal immigrants,” Rudd told May. With her Conservative Party split over Brexit, May will have to be careful to preserve the uneasy balance in the cabinet after the loss of such a senior pro-EU minister. Possible contenders who could replace Rudd include Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, Northern Irish Secretary Karen Bradley and former Northern Irish Secretary James Brokenshire. The government has apologised for the fiasco, promised citizenship and compensation to those affected, including to people who have lost their jobs, been threatened with deportation and denied benefits because of the errors. But the controversy over policies which May is closely associated with has raised awkward questions about how the pursuit of lower immigration after Brexit sits alongside the desire to be an outward-looking global economy. The immigrants are named after the Empire Windrush, one of the first ships to bring Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948, when Commonwealth citizens were invited to fill labour shortages and help rebuild the economy after World War Two. Almost half a million people left their homes in the West Indies to live in Britain between 1948 and 1970, according to Britain’s National Archives. A week before local elections, May apologised to the black community on Thursday in a letter to The Voice, Britain’s national Afro-Caribbean newspaper.   “We have let you down and I am deeply sorry,” she said. “But apologies alone are not good enough. We must urgently right this historic wrong.” The crisis has focussed attention on May, who as interior minister set out to create a “really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants, imposing tough new requirements in 2012 for people to prove their legal status. Rudd’s resignation comes four months after another close ally and her then most senior minister, Damian Green, was forced out of his job for lying about whether he knew pornography had been found on computers in his parliamentary office. Anna Soubry, a Conservative lawmaker, predicted Rudd may one day return to a senior job in government. “She is a woman of great courage and immense ability,” Soubry said. “If there is any justice she will soon return to the highest of office.” Reporting by Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-politics-rudd/update-4-british-interior-minister-rudd-resigns-after-immigration-scandal-idUKL8N1S60XH,30 Apr 2018,"* Rudd says she inadvertently misled parliament

2018-04-30,"BARCELONA, April 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Parts of Africa will get left behind in the global push to provide electric power to all unless national governments and the international community agree on a plan for faster action in places that are lagging, a top energy official has warned. Of the roughly 1 billion people who still lack access to electricity around the world, nearly 600 million live in sub-Saharan Africa, with the vast majority in rural areas. “The proportion of the billion that lives in sub-Saharan Africa is increasing,” said Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), a body set up by the United Nations. “Within Africa, some countries are going faster than others, but those that aren’t going fast are going to get left behind because you need that electricity ... you need that clean energy for the urban growth and economic development they all want,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. Some African countries, such as Kenya and Ethiopia, are setting a good example, said Kyte, who also serves as the U.N. secretary-general’s special representative on energy access. Others - especially those mired in conflict and political instability, or emerging from war - are falling behind, shunned by investors as tough places to do business, she said. They include countries like Central African Republic and Sierra Leone. This week, governments, energy businesses and development experts will gather in Lisbon at a two-day forum organised by SEforALL to discuss ways to close the gap in making sustainable, affordable energy available to everyone. A set of global development goals includes key energy targets to be met by 2030: ensuring universal access to modern energy, increasing substantially the share of renewables used, and doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency. But data shows rates of progress are still too slow to meet the targets, with poor, marginalised people set to suffer most as a result of that shortfall, experts say. Kyte gave examples of those most likely to be overlooked: a woman running a household in a rural community where men have left to seek work in the city; a disabled family head living in an urban slum; or an indigenous nomad in Mongolia or the Sahel. Such households may be the hardest to reach using the traditional method of connecting homes to the power grid - but there are alternatives, Kyte emphasised. “With mini-grids, micro-grids or off-grid systems, those people are reachable, and they are reachable with clean energy and they are reachable affordably,” she said. Governments of countries doing badly on energy access need to set national targets, invest in infrastructure, and tackle corruption, Kyte said. Even for the poorest states or those emerging from conflict, “prioritising energy access is a real value-for-money approach to take, because lots of other things happen,” she added. Switching from polluting fuels such as kerosene and diesel to solar power can improve people’s health, help children study and allow small businesses to flourish, experts say. “Distributed energy” solutions - small-scale systems that operate independently of the main grid and are often powered by renewables - can be built quickly and nimbly in difficult situations, Kyte said. They are also suitable for use in and around camps for refugees and displaced people, where failure to provide solar lamps or efficient cooking stoves can lead to deforestation. Kyte hopes international agencies and businesses will put in place a global action plan in the coming months to provide clean power to people forced to flee their homes. Similarly, she urged development banks, governments and companies to team up and work out what financial and technical aid is needed for the 20 countries that are home to four-fifths of the 1 billion still in the dark. Another priority for poor nations is energy efficiency, she said, which could help avoid pollution and smog in their cities. ""If you talk about energy efficiency as the way to ensure clean air, clean water, low energy bills, buildings you want to live in, transport you want to travel in, then that becomes a big part of leaving no one behind,"" Kyte said.

But investors have grown increasingly jittery with the U.S. Federal Reserve signalling faster rate rises this year and the European Central Bank seen likely to end its generous bond-buying programme soon. “The key question for 2018 remains to what extent can the benign environment persist?” said Jacob Mitchell, Chief Investment Officer of Australian investment boutique Antipodes which has A$7 billion in assets under management. Global shares had a dream run in 2017 helped by the first synchronous world growth in decades coupled with easy monetary policies in most of the developed world. “We believe the unusually favourable goldilocks combination of accelerating growth and tepid inflation experienced in 2017 will not repeat,” Mitchell added. “Instead, normalisation of interest rate policy will likely upset the rhythm with more volatile and less forgiving markets.” Indeed, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is almost flat so far in 2018 compared with a more than 13 percent jump in the same period last year. Investors will turn their focus to a torrent of data from the United States this week including consumer spending later in the day, the Fed’s policy decision on Wednesday, and a jobs report on Friday. Separately, a delegation of U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Donald Trump’s top economic and trade advisers - Larry Kudlow, Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro are all expected in China later this week for trade negotiations. The U.S.-China relationship had turned sour earlier this year when Trump announced stiff tariffs on some Chinese imports, setting off a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. Political tensions in the Korean Peninsula are also showing signs of easing, following a historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korea’s Moon Jae-in last week at which they vowed “complete denuclearization”. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that he told Kim that the North Korea leader would have to agree to take “irreversible” steps toward abandoning nuclear weapons if he was to reach a deal with Trump. In currencies, sterling held near two-month lows as Britain’s interior minister resigned - adding to the considerable troubles of Prime Minister Theresa May’s government. The pound was last buying $1.3778, after falling 0.9 percent on Friday when disappointing economic growth data challenged expectations the Bank of England would raise rates in May. A couple of weeks ago it had been as high as $1.4377. “The GDP print missed the already-lowered-expectations and May quickly repriced to around a 25 percent chance of a hike,” wrote analysts at Citi in a note. “We do not expect a hike next month and expect a more dovish meeting than is currently anticipated.” The U.S. dollar was barely changed after retreating on Friday, with its index against six major peers at 91.54. The euro also trod water at $1.2128, while the dollar inched up on the yen to 109.18 though it has had a tough time trying to break resistance at 109.50.

2018-04-30,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world’s third-biggest sovereign wealth fund, said it may invest more in renewable energy, as climate change fears prompt fund managers even in the oil-rich Middle East to look beyond fossil fuels. “The world’s energy industry is in the early stages of a fundamental shift from fossil fuels to a more sustainable reliance on a range of renewable technologies,” ADIA said in its 2017 annual review on Monday.  The ADIA’s comments show how global sovereign funds are waking up to growing calls from governments to address climate change and to build a low-carbon society in the future. Two years ago ADIA invested in Greenko Energy Holdings, one of India’s renewable energy companies, with Singapore’s GIC. ADIA manages the reserves of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, part of the United Arab Emirates and which produces about 3 percent of the world’s oil output. The fund manages $828 billion in assets, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, making it the world’s third- largest sovereign wealth fund.  Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund said earlier this year it will step up its assessment of the risks posed by climate change to its investments in power producers, oil firms and basic materials companies.[nL8N1QH2NK] ADIA said it conducted a review last year of climate change and its potential impact, in order to assess how markets and governments could respond to this impending transition. Overall, ADIA’s latest review showed that its long-term returns improved in 2017, helped by rising equity markets. In U.S. dollar terms, the 20-year and 30-year annualized rates of return for the ADIA portfolio were 6.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively. This compared to 20-year and 30-year annualized rates of return of 6.2 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, in 2016. ADIA said 55 percent of assets are managed by external managers. ADIA also said it completed a reorganization of its private equity department last year with a move from a product-focus to regional teams focusing on five industry sectors: financial services, healthcare, industrials, technology and consumer. During the year, a new head of Asia-Pacific was appointed in addition to sector heads for financial services, healthcare and industrials. Recruiting for the technology and consumer sectors has started, it added. Late in 2017, the department purchased a significant minority stake in KKR India Financial Services, an alternative credit provider.  This year, the department will continue to deploy capital in line with its strategy of increasing its sector-led investment activity, with a focus on evaluating structured equity opportunities, defensive industries and other private-asset investments, ADIA said. However, it warned current valuation levels and increasing competition for deals amongst market participants suggests that the industry might enter a period of lower returns than those experienced in recent years.

2018-04-30,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 30 (Reuters) - The term “demand destruction” is again entering the lexicon of the current crude oil market as the sharp rise in prices raises concerns about when do consumers start cutting back on their fuel consumption. While it’s probably impossible to pick the exact point at which this happens, the risk in the current cycle of rising prices is that it happens earlier than in the past in Asia, the main region driving rising crude demand. The reason for this is that many countries in Asia used the prior period of falling crude prices to end, or dramatically scale back, their fuel subsidies. This means that this time consumers in countries such as India, Indonesia and Malaysia are fully exposed to rising crude prices, something that hasn’t been in the case in previous bull cycles. The combined oil consumption of those three countries is about 6.5 million barrels per day (bpd), with India alone accounting for about 4.3 million bpd. Even a 5 percent drop in demand for fuel in those countries would knock about 325,000 bpd from global crude oil consumption. So far, it appears that consumers in those countries haven’t been exposed to the full extent of the crude oil increase. Global benchmark Brent crude closed at $74.64 a barrel on April 27, up 11.6 percent since the end of last year and 66.5 percent from last year’s low in June. The price of a litre of diesel in New Delhi was 65.93 rupees on Sunday, according to data on the website of Indian Oil. This is equivalent to about $1 a litre. At the end of last year, the price of a litre of diesel was 59.64 rupees, meaning it has risen by 10.5 percent so far this year, not quite keeping pace with the rise in Brent crude oil. When crude was at its 2017 low in June, diesel was 53.46 rupees a litre in New Delhi, meaning it has risen about 23.3 percent since then, while Brent has jumped by 66.5 percent. What appears to have happened is that the state-controlled oil majors such as Indian Oil have largely absorbed the cost of rising crude prices, partly because of government pressure to do so. But there has to be a question mark as to how long this can continue to be the case. Indian Oil’s share price has plunged 28 percent since its 2017 high, reached in August, and there will likely come a point where the pain of the slumping stock price outweighs the political pressure to keep absorbing the cost of higher crude oil prices. There is also some preliminary evidence that India’s appetite for crude oil is levelling off, with imports trending lower so far this year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. For the first 29 days of April, the data, which has been filtered to show only cargoes that have been discharged, show imports running at 3.97 million bpd. This is down from 4.05 million bpd in March, 4.7 million bpd in February and 4.5 million bpd in January. While there may be some seasonal slowing in India’s crude demand, it’s worth noting that April this year appears to be slightly weaker than the 4.01 million bpd imported in the same month in 2017. In Indonesia, which ended gasoline subsidies in 2015 and lowered the diesel subsidy to 500 rupiah (3.6 U.S. cents) per litre in 2016, retail prices also haven’t risen by as much as the price of crude oil. Diesel was about the equivalent of about 75 cents a litre last week, up from 68 cents at the start of the year, according to data on the website GlobalPetrolPrices.com. Similar to India, this means Indonesian consumers have only been partially slugged the increase in the price of crude oil, meaning the state-owned fuel retailer has been absorbing the difference via shrinking profit margins. Again, how much longer this can continue is uncertain, but one would imagine at some point rising crude prices will have to be reflected in higher retail prices for diesel and gasoline. Even when retail fuel prices do rise, picking the exact level at which consumers cut back on usage, either directly by driving or flying less, or indirectly by purchasing fewer goods and services as they divert income to rising fuel bills, is a challenge and will vary from country to country. But the absence of fuel subsidies in most Asian nations is likely to mean the region feels the pain of the jump in crude prices far faster than was the case previously.

2018-04-30,"* AGL says considering bid * AGL wants to hold on to Liddell until 2022 * AGL plans to replace Liddell with $1 bln of new capacity * Alinta would spend about A$750 mln to improve Liddell-source (Adds analyst comment) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, April 30 (Reuters) - Chinese-owned Alinta Energy offered A$250 million ($189 million) on Monday for Australia’s ageing Liddell coal-fired power plant, creating a headache for owner AGL Energy amid a national debate over energy security. AGL has long flagged plans to shut the plant in 2022 as part of a phased exit from coal-fired power, but has come under pressure from the federal government to sell it to ensure back-up generation for intermittent wind and solar power. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told AGL’s chairman this month it would be in the public interest to keep the plant open or sell it, after Alinta, owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, expressed interest in buying it. Any sale would be unlikely to run into regulatory hurdles despite growing concerns about Chinese ownership of key assets, given the worries about energy security and a boost to competition from a beefed-up Alinta. It won approval last year to buy another coal-fired plant. However, AGL would have to weigh a range of factors, including that it needs Liddell to meet customer demand until 2022, it wants the site for a battery installation after 2022, and selling Liddell would bolster Alinta’s competitive position. “It’s a very difficult decision to make,” said Royal Bank of Canada analyst Paul Johnston. AGL wants to replace Liddell’s capacity by 2022 by spending about A$1.36 billion ($1.03 billion) on a mix of gas-fired and renewable power, as well as a battery at the Liddell site and other measures. However, Alinta, and others see an opportunity in keeping open the plant in Australia’s most populous state New South Wales (NSW), as coal-fired power could fetch a premium at times when the market is short on renewable energy. “Alinta Energy has .. submitted a non-binding offer for the Liddell power station to AGL, which we believe represents a compelling commercial proposition for AGL shareholders,” Alinta said in an email to Reuters. AGL, which said it was considering the offer, reiterated that it wanted to hold on to Liddell until 2022. “AGL has not sought to sell the Liddell power station, as it requires Liddell to provide energy to its customers until 2022 and for repurposing as part of its NSW generation plan post 2022,” the company said in a statement. AGL paid virtually nothing for Liddell when it acquired Macquarie Generation in 2014, but has since spent around A$920 million to keep the plant operating reliably until 2022, when it will be 50 years old. Alinta would have to spend about A$750 million more to improve the plant, a person familiar with the company’s plan said. Alinta last year bought a newer coal-fired plant, Loy Yang B, in Victoria state for more than A$1.1 billion, helping it to compete with Australia’s biggest generators — AGL, Origin Energy and Energy Australia, owned by Hong Kong’s CLP Holdings. $1 = 1.3214 Australian dollars

2018-04-30,"* U.S. rig count rises to 825, highest since March, 2015 * Production dips in Angola, Venezuela support prices By Koustav Samanta SINGAPORE, April 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Monday as a rising rig count in the United States pointed to higher production, but prices held near more than three-year highs and were on track to rise for a second consecutive month. The oil complex has been driven by supply concerns amid prospects of the United States reimposing sanctions on Iran, while OPEC-led producers continue to withhold supplies. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, dipped 34 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $74.30 a barrel in early trading. Prices climbed as high as $75.47 last week, levels not seen since November, 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $67.98 a barrel, down 12 cents, or about 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. “There’s a small drop in trading this morning but volumes are low and there’s not much commitment in the selling. The overall trend is positive and there’s potential for the market to close higher again today,” said Michael McCarthy, chief marketing strategist at CMC Markets. “The underlying strength in crude markets is quite impressive and a lot of it is predicated by sanctions... Other than that it’s the demand picture around the globe, and if that continues we could see higher prices.” U.S. drillers added five oil rigs in the week to April 27, bringing the total count to 825, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said. “The increase in rigs is modestly bearish for oil prices because increasing rigs is usually associated with increasing supply,” Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management said in an email. “However, the increase in rigs was modest and this news is overshadowed by other things, including Angola’s production decline, the potential for an end to the Iranian nuke deal, continued threats by Houthis to Saudi oil shipping and infrastructure.” U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has soared more than 25 percent since mid-2016 to a record 10.59 million barrels per day (bpd). Only Russia currently produces more, at around 11 million bpd. Brent prices have gained nearly 6 percent this month, buoyed by expectations the United States will renew sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on Iran that were lifted after an agreement over its disputed nuclear programme. “Precisely what happens with Tehran’s nuclear program remains the most significant driver in oil price sentiment,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA.

The company also said it was looking in 2019 to restart exploration and appraisal activity in the Beetaloo Basin shale gas field, which it says contains 6.6 trillion cubic feet of contingent reserves, weeks after Australia’s Northern Territory lifted a nearly two-year moratorium on fracking to extract gas. The firm’s revenue from APLNG during the three months to March 31 rose to A$491.9 million ($372.6 million) from A$385.3 million a year ago thanks to increased LNG sales and higher prices, Origin said. That excludes revenue from production from Lattice Energy. Origin completed its sale of Lattice Energy gas assets to Beach Energy in January, a move that helped cut its debt. Production for the quarter rose 10 percent to 62.7 petajoules equivalent (PJe), from a year earlier. APLNG is a joint venture between Origin, ConocoPhillips and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec).

2018-04-30," LONDON (Reuters) - The oil market is becoming extremely tight as consumption outstrips production, and traders expect it to tighten even further over the next six months. The balance between production, consumption and inventories is intimately connected with the shape of the oil futures curve. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Kkn74M) If consumption is expected to exceed production, and inventories are already low and falling, spot prices tend to trade at a premium to forward prices. The premium for spot prices over forward prices, known as backwardation, acts as a signal to conserve remaining stocks as much as possible. The premium for spot prices is intended to boost supply in the short term while encouraging consumers to defer purchases. Backwardation is the most important and reliable signal of a tight and tightening oil market. Front-month Brent futures have recently been trading in a backwardation of more than $3.40 per barrel over the seventh-month contract. The current backwardation in Brent is among the most extreme in the last quarter of a century and in the 91st percentile of all trading days since 1992. If the backwardation was confined mostly to one or two months, it could be dismissed as an aberration or a sign of market manipulation. But big backwardations are evident for all months through 2018 and 2019. The increasing backwardation is consistent with statistics from the physical market showing oil inventories are becoming increasingly tight. Stocks of crude oil and refined products in the OECD industrialised countries have fallen to just 43 million barrels above the five-year average, from a surplus of 340 million barrels at the start of 2017. If OECD stocks are adjusted for the rise in consumption, current inventories are now below the five-year average. Stocks are expected to decline even further in the second half of the year, which traditionally sees higher consumption. Global oil consumption is expected to rise by more than 1.5 million barrels per day in 2018, mostly as a result of strong economic growth. Production from Venezuela is already falling. Traders are concerned about further output declines if the United States imposes sanctions on Venezuela and/or Iran. OPEC members have indicated they will not increase output before the end of the year, which will tighten the market further. The oil market is currently on an unsustainable trajectory, with global demand growth systematically outrunning supply. If something cannot continue forever, it will stop, according to Stein’s Law, one of the most fundamental constraints in economics, popularised by Herbert Stein, the chief economic adviser to President Richard Nixon. Logically, there are five ways in which the oil market can be moved off its currently unsustainable course and brought back towards balance: (1) Slower consumption growth (in response to higher prices, an economic slowdown, or a combination of both) (2) OPEC and its allies lift their output (3) Supply disruptions (existing and threatened) ease (4) U.S. shale output increases even faster than expected (5) Non-OPEC non-shale output increases faster than predicted. The most likely path to rebalancing of the oil market is likely to involve a combination of some or all of these factors. Global consumption is sensitive to price changes, albeit the response tends to be slow at first before accelerating later, and is notoriously slow to appear in the statistics. The relationship between prices and consumption is highly non-linear. The higher prices rise and the longer they are expected to stay high the bigger the eventual response from oil consumers. Experience suggests by the time “demand destruction” is evident in the data, the oil market will be well on its way to the next slump (this was true in 2007/08 and again in 2013/14). Some of the actual and anticipated supply disruptions may ease, especially if the rise in oil prices causes the United States to hesitate before imposing tough sanctions on Venezuela and Iran or to leave loopholes. U.S. shale output is likely to accelerate further in the second half of 2018 and into 2019: the number of rigs drilling for oil is rising again in response to the increase in prices. Escalating prices should also filter through into increasing exploration, production and development in the non-OPEC, non-shale sector. Finally, OPEC and its allies may decide to start lifting their production, via a formal decision or a decrease in compliance, before the end of 2018. The oil market is already tight and on track to get tighter. The backwardation is high and could rise even further. But experience suggests such large imbalances between production, consumption and inventories are not stable for long. Something will have to give soon. Supply. Demand. Or both.

2018-04-30,"MEXICO CITY, April 29 (Reuters) - A security official with Mexico’s state oil company, Pemex, was killed in an attack in the border state of Tamaulipas, the company’s chief executive said on Sunday. Jaime Juarez, 53, was in a vehicle doing surveillance work in the city of Matamoros on Friday when it was hit with 60 bullets. His colleague survived the attack. Juarez was just a few months from completing 20 years with Pemex, the company said in a statement, and had most recently worked combating the fuel theft that costs Pemex more than $1 billion a year. Drug cartels seeking to diversify income streams have preyed on Pemex, making fuel theft one of Mexico’s most pressing security issues. The head of security at one of Mexico’s six state-run oil refineries was shot to death in January.

In mid-April, the company announced that it had resumed production at the facility a fortnight ahead of schedule.
