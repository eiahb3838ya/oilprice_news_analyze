2018-05-02,"(Adds Alberta energy minister quotes) By Julie Gordon CALGARY, Alberta, May 2 (Reuters) - Alberta will hold talks with rail operators and oil producers aimed at smoothing the path to get more crude moving by rail amid a transportation bottleneck in the Western Canadian province, Alberta’s energy minister said on Wednesday. The first session on Friday will include senior executives from Canada’s top oil producers and the two main railways, Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway , the minister, Margaret McCuaig-Boyd, told reporters at a Calgary conference. “We’re hearing there’s constraints and there’s gaps between the rail companies and producers, so what are those gaps and how can we address them,” she said. Railways, who added crude by rail capacity earlier this decade only to have the market vanish as pipeline space opened up, have been slow to move back in the oil transport business, asking producers to sign longer-term deals. But oil producers want flexibility to switch to pipeline, which is far cheaper, if capacity becomes available. “A pipeline isn’t going to be built overnight. So we need to have strategies for all market access,” said McCuaig-Boyd. Canada’s energy producers are struggling as increased oil sands output has run up against a lack of new export pipelines and tight rail capacity, sending the differential between Canadian oil prices and the U.S. crude benchmark to multi-year highs. Adding to the crunch, Kinder Morgan Canada paused work last month on its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, citing opposition in British Columbia, and said it would decide by May 31 on whether to go ahead with the build or not. Both Alberta and Canada’s federal government have pledged financial support to the project, which would nearly triple capacity on an existing line from Alberta to a B.C. port. When asked about Alberta’s financial pledge, McCuaig-Boyd said the government was open to “all options,” though she declined to clarify if the province was considering an ownership stake in just the project or the entire pipeline or company.

2018-05-02,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Apache Corp (APA.N) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, as it benefited from higher U.S. light crude prices. Oil prices have recovered from lows hit in 2016, currently trading around $70 per barrel. This helped selling prices at the Houston, Texas-based company to rise to $64.27 per barrel from $51.20 last year. Apache said total production fell 8.5 percent to 440,336 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) compared to a year earlier, but the figure beat analysts’ estimates of 430,940 boe/d according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Production was largely helped by an increase in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, which rose 24 percent compared with a year-ago and was 41.6 percent of total production. The company specifically noted that the Permian Basin will be a key operation in 2018. Apache also raised its full-year U.S. output forecast to 250,000-258,000 boe/d from a previous range of 245,000-255,000 boe/d, driven mostly by more operating wells in the first quarter. Net income attributable to Apache's common shareholders fell to $145 million, or 38 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $213 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. [bit.ly/2KuYKRO] Excluding items, the company earned 32 cents share, higher than analysts’ average expectation of 30 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-05-02,"(Adds earnings estimate, production details, stock move) By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON, May 2 (Reuters) - Continental Resources Inc , the U.S. shale producer controlled by billionaire Harold Hamm, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday thanks to rising oil prices and spiking output in its core North Dakota Bakken shale operations. For the second consecutive quarter, Continental bested rival Whiting Petroleum Corp to be the largest oil producer in the Bakken, solidifying that crown and its place as one of the most-prolific U.S. shale companies. “We are breaking away from our peers and capitalizing on decades of exploration success and operational,” Hamm, the company’s chief executive and largest shareholder, said in a statement. The quest to regain the top producer spot in one of the most-prolific U.S. shale basins had eluded Hamm’s Continental since at least 2014, when Whiting bought smaller rival Kodiak Oil and Gas. That deal, though, saddled Whiting with billions in debt just as oil prices cratered, giving Continental an edge as it spent cash to improve ways it fracks wells. Continental’s success for the second consecutive quarter over Whiting highlights the importance of improving hydraulic fracturing processes, including the use of larger amounts of sand, which the Oklahoma City-based company has helped pioneer. Continental’s North Dakota production jumped about 50 percent in the first quarter, leap-frogging Whiting’s output in the state by about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). “We are clearly seeing a structural uplift in well performance across the Bakken field,” Jack Stark, Continental’s president, said in a statement. Denver-based Whiting, which posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit of its own on Monday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Continental posted net income of $233.9 million, or 63 cents per share, compared with $469,000, or less than a penny per share, in the year-ago quarter, when oil prices plummeted - and the company’s production costs were higher. Excluding one-time items, Continental earned 68 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 64 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall production rose 35 percent to 287,410 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Continental plans to hold a conference call to discuss the quarterly results on Thursday.

2018-05-02,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is planning a meeting next week between President Donald Trump and senior leaders of major U.S. and foreign automakers to discuss planned fuel efficiency rule changes through 2026, automakers and administration officials said on Wednesday. The meeting, expected on May 11 with chief executives and other senior executives of large automakers, comes as the Trump administration has drafted a proposal that would freeze fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. California and 16 other states on Tuesday filed suit to block the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken the requirements. General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, and Toyota Motor Corp are among at least a dozen automakers expected to attend the meetings. A White House spokeswoman and the companies declined to comment. The meeting was sought by the White House, automakers said. Automakers could also use the meeting to also raise proposed controversial changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement, officials said. Democrats and environmental advocates have vowed to aggressively challenge the Trump administration’s plans to weaken the vehicle rules touted by the Obama administration as one of its biggest climate actions. In March 2017, Trump suggested he would soften the mandates. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he told autoworkers. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group that represents major automakers, said the companies are happy to meet with the White House. “When the White House wants to meet with us about our sector and policy, we welcome the opportunity,” she said. “Details are still being confirmed and I cannot comment further.” Automakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and the shift in U.S. consumer preferences to bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles, but also want the administration and California to reach agreement on national standards. The Trump administration plans to argue the weaker rules will lead to cheaper vehicles, boost sales and employment and improve safety by prodding faster turnover of older vehicles, Reuters reported on Tuesday. The Obama rules adopted in 2012 sought to double average fleet-wide vehicle fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025, but included an evaluation due by April 2018 to determine if the rules were appropriate.

2018-05-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as investors digested a statement from the Federal Reserve, which left interest rates steady and said inflation had “moved close” to its target, while the dollar climbed late against a basket of currencies. Stocks, which initially gained after the Fed statement, reversed course as potential U.S. restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies reinforced investor concerns about trade relations between the United States and China. In its statement, the Fed expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation to near the U.S. central bank’s target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June. It also said inflation “on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.” “There wasn’t any particular news to get it going other than the Fed staying the course, and that contributed to the slide in stock prices,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.  The Fed raised rates in March and currently forecasts another two increases this year. Ahead of the statement, some investors were nervous it might sound more hawkish on policy tightening after recent concerns about rising inflation. The U.S. dollar fell from 2018 highs set earlier in the day after the Fed statement raised concerns that monetary accommodation will stay loose even as the central bank hikes rates. But the greenback later reversed course to trade higher. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.3 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.02 percent to $1.1952. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 174.07 points, or 0.72 percent, to 23,924.98, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 19.13 points, or 0.72 percent, to 2,635.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 29.81 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,100.90. U.S. President Donald Trump is considering issuing an executive order restricting certain Chinese companies from selling telecommunications equipment in the United States.  Trade relations between the United States and China have already been strained as Trump has weighed imposing tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports. A Trump administration delegation is scheduled to visit Beijing on Thursday and Friday for talks with top Chinese officials. “It’s hard to see investors willing to take increasing risk ahead of a couple more weeks of trade discussions and negotiations to come,” said Matthew Miskin, market strategist at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Forecast-beating results from the world’s biggest company, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), lifted tech shares, limiting losses in the S&P 500. Apple shares were up 4.4 percent. Apple beat profit and revenue expectations in the first quarter, thanks to robust iPhone sales, and it announced a $100 billion share buy-back. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.39 percent. U.S. Treasury yields for most maturities fell as a quarterly refunding program that aims to finance the country’s massive fiscal deficit came in short of expectations. Treasury yields had risen overnight in the run-up to the refunding announcement. U.S. 10-year yields were at 2.970 percent US10YT=RR, down from 2.976 percent late on Tuesday.  In the oil market, U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 68 cents to settle at $67.93 a barrel, while Brent LCOcv1 gained 23 cents to settle at $73.36.

2018-05-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices strengthened slightly ahead of the settlement Wednesday as the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation would be sustained. The Fed’s rate-setting committee also downplayed a recent slowdown in economic and job growth, saying that activity had been expanding at a moderate rate and job gains, on average, had been strong in recent months.  Oil demand is closely tied to broader indicators of economic growth.  Earlier in the session, the market shrugged off a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories because the move was largely concentrated on the U.S. West Coast.  Crude stockpiles posted a surprise build of 6.2 million barrels in the week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S]. Nearly 5 million barrels were concentrated on the West Coast. “That’s why the market isn’t reacting that much, because sometimes the West Coast numbers are erratic and usually when you get a big build in the West Coast, it’s followed with a big draw the next week,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. “The market is putting that in perspective,” he said. At the same time, distillate demand was strong, he said, offsetting the downward pressure on crude.  July Brent futures LCOc1 settled up 23 cents at $73.36 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up 68 cents at $67.93.     Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, re-emerged as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when some international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. The United States has questioned Iran’s sincerity in implementing the nuclear curbs and President Donald Trump has threatened to reimpose sanctions if adjustments are not made to the agreement. Iran’s oil exports hit 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, according to the Oil Ministry, a record since the lifting of sanctions. China and India bought more than half of the oil. “The expectation that the U.S. will leave the sanctions waivers is leading Iran to sell as much as it can,” Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said. Trump will decide by May 12 whether to restore U.S. sanctions on Iran, which would likely reduce its oil exports. “If Trump abandons the deal, he risks a spike in global oil prices,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, noting that reintroducing U.S. sanctions could remove 300,000-500,000 bpd of Iranian oil from global supplies. However, the rising value of the dollar since mid-April .DXY and soaring U.S. supplies have helped check further oil price gains, traders said.

2018-05-02,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - IronNet Cybersecurity Inc, a startup led by former U.S. National Security Agency chief Keith Alexander, has raised $78 million in additional funding, the company told Reuters on Wednesday, a day ahead of a planned announcement. The Fulton, Maryland-based company plans to disclose the financing on Thursday as it releases the first details about deployment of new threat-sharing technology it has developed, which is dubbed IronDome, Alexander said.  The series B round was led by London-based investor C5 Capital and joined by existing investors ForgePoint Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. IronNet declined to disclose the company’s overall valuation following the financing, which is in addition to a $32.5 million series A round announced in September 2015.  The company, whose 150 employees include former high-ranking officials from U.S. military and intelligence agencies, said it will use the funds to develop cyberdefense tools and support other growth initiatives. Five major U.S. energy suppliers deployed IronDome in November to help them share data on cyber threats in real time, Alexander said in an interview. The company intends to use the funding to set up similar IronDome systems for the healthcare and financial firms, Alexander said. “If our nation is under attack by another nation, we need to be able to share information in time to be able to prevent it,” he said. IronNet developed IronDome to be faster and more automated than traditional methods used for sharing information about cyber threats, he said. IronNet declined to disclose the energy suppliers who are using IronDome, citing customer confidentiality. It said those companies collectively serve 25 U.S. states. The energy providers adopted IronDome amid growing concern among about the threat that hackers pose to the U.S. power grid and other critical infrastructure.  The U.S. government has issued multiple warnings in recent years about attempts by Russia, North Korea and Iran to infiltrate those organizations. The Trump administration in March accused Kremlin-linked hackers of gaining remote access to energy sector networks, though it did not identify specific victims. Alexander ran the NSA from 2005 to 2014, making him the agency’s longest-serving director.  He was at the helm of the NSA in 2013 when former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden leaked data about classified U.S. surveillance programs that sparked an international debate about digital privacy. “You want to protect civil liberties and privacy and you want to protect critical infrastructure,” Alexander said. “We believe we can do both.” Reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington; Editing by Jim Finkle and Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-energy/ex-nsa-chiefs-startup-raises-78-mln-helps-defend-u-s-power-grid-idUKL1N1S91UZ,02 May 2018,"IronNet Cybersecurity Inc, a

2018-05-02,"(Adds details about proxy battle, comment from Cation, background; updates share price) By John Tilak TORONTO, May 2 (Reuters) - Canadian energy producer Crescent Point Energy Corp is poised to win support for its director nominees based on a preliminary counting of votes, shrugging off opposition from activist investor Cation Capital, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. Final results are expected to be announced on or before Friday, when the company is holding its annual general meeting of shareholders. The proxy fight for Crescent Point is the biggest in the Canadian energy sector in at least about four years. The outcome is being closely watched by energy investors, nursing losses after an historic slide in oil prices beginning in 2014 weighed on energy stocks. Calgary, Alberta-based Crescent Point, whose stock has underperformed the broader market in recent years, is under pressure from Cation Capital to change its board. With ISS supporting some of the activist’s nominees and Glass Lewis supporting the company’s choices, investors expect a close vote. The deadline for voting was 10 a.m. MDT (1600 GMT) on Wednesday. A Crescent Point spokeswoman, Andree Morier, said the company has not received the final results but is pleased with the shareholder support for its refreshed board. Cation Capital spokesperson Dan Gagnier said “there was a large amount of share movement leading up to the deadline. The vote is too close to call and any representation otherwise is false.” Alberta-based Cation Capital is an investment firm founded by Sandy Edmonstone, a former deputy head of global oil and gas at Macquarie Capital. Activism in the Canadian oil and gas sector started to pick up just before the oil price slide began. A number of activist investors were burnt by the sector downturn and have been reluctant to venture back in an environment of increasing volatility. However, with crude oil prices rebounding in recent months, activists are taking another look at the space. Cation, which owns a 0.3 percent stake in Crescent Point, began its public push for change at the company last month. ISS in April recommended that shareholders vote for Cation board candidates Dallas Howe and Herbert Pinder. Crescent Point shares were up 0.6 percent at C$11.25 in late-afternoon trading on Wednesday, while the Canadian benchmark share index was up 0.1 percent. Shares of Crescent Point have lost 64 percent of their value in the last three years.

2018-05-02,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The chairman of En+ Group (ENPLq.L) said on Wednesday he was working on implementing a plan that En+ hopes will lead to the United States lifting sanctions on the company, the biggest shareholder in aluminium giant Rusal (0486.HK). Greg Barker welcomed a decision by the U.S. Treasury on Tuesday to give investors an extra month to divest or transfer their holdings in En+ Group and other sanctions targets. Washington last month imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and several companies in which he is a large shareholder, including Rusal and En+, in response to what the United States called Russia’s “malign activities.” Deripaska’s En+ Group holds his 48 percent stake in Rusal, Russia’s largest aluminium producer. Deripaska has since made efforts to distance himself from the companies, and agreed last week to lower his stake in En+ Group to less than 50 percent, after the United States said it could lift company sanctions if the billionaire ceded control. “In my capacity as independent chairman, I reached an agreement in principle with Oleg Deripaska on 26 April 2018 that in order for sanctions to be removed he would reduce his shareholding below 50 percent and relinquish control of the Board,” Barker said in a statement. “In light of this very welcomed licence extension, I am now actively seeking to put the details of that plan into place,” said Barker, a former British energy minister. The London Stock Exchange said it would no longer suspend trading in En+ GDRs on Wednesday, minutes before the planned suspension was supposed to take place, following the U.S. Treasury Department’s decision.  “Suspension of trading will now take place from 17:15 (end of trade reporting) on Friday 1 June 2018 (if there are no further timing changes),” the Exchange said. The U.S. Treasury’s decision boosted En+ Group’s rouble-based shares (ENPLDR.MM) on Wednesday.

Steve Williams would not say what exactly he expected Trudeau to do to guarantee the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project gets built, but told reporters he was encouraged by a long conversation he had with the prime minister last month. “I’m encouraged by the comments they’ve made, but the proviso I put on it is that we’ve got to see these plans roll out that they’ve been working on and I think we see that over the next few weeks,” Williams said. Kinder Morgan paused work last month on the Trans Mountain expansion, citing opposition in British Columbia, and said the company would decide by May 31 whether to go ahead with the project, which would nearly triple capacity on an existing line from Alberta to British Columbia’s coast. Both Alberta and the federal government have pledged support to the project, including financial backing. Trudeau’s Liberal government has also said it will assert its jurisdiction, even as British Columbia has gone to court to attempt to prove its right to block increased crude shipments west. Williams said earlier on Wednesday that Suncor’s current growth plan was not constrained by pipeline bottlenecks but that the Calgary-based company did not expect to make any further major investments in the oil sands until market access improves. “We have existing pipeline access to accommodate all of our oil sands production,” he said. Canadian energy producers are struggling as increased oil sands output has run up against a lack of new export pipelines and tight rail capacity, sending the differential between Canadian oil prices and the U.S. crude benchmark to multi-year highs. Suncor said that while the discount that Canadian producers face nearly doubled in the first quarter compared with last year’s quarter, it had no impact on the company’s earnings or cash flow, as low crude prices were offset by better midstream and downstream returns. Williams said he was confident that both the Trans Mountain expansion and Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 replacement, along with others moving crude south, would move ahead. “I don’t think in the last five years I’ve had a higher degree of confidence that these lines are going to be built,” he said. “So I’m greatly encouraged.” Suncor shares were up 0.66 percent at C$49.19 on Wednesday afternoon.

Algeria used to be a net importer of grey cement, but new plants all over the country have boosted its output to beyond 25 million tonnes per year, according to industry ministry figures. “GICA, a state owned group has realised its first 200,000 tonnes export operation of grey cement to European countries,” Groupe Industriel Ciment Algérie (GICA) said in a statement. GICA output reached 14 million tonnes in 2017 versus 12.4 million tonnes in 2016. Algeria’s total cement output capacity is expected to reach 40.6 million tonnes by 2020, and domestic demand is estimated at 24 million tonnes, according to official figures.

2018-05-02,"* Fed keeps rates unchanged, on track to raise rates in June (Updates to after Fed statement) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher while the dollar and Treasury yields fell on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and said inflation had “moved close” to its target. That would leave the central bank on track to raise borrowing costs in June. “Their outlook is roughly balanced. The fact is that they are not in a rush to raise rates faster. They may still raise rates in June. This has allowed Treasuries to bounce here and the dollar is coming off,” said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York. In a statement following the end of a two-day policy meeting, the Fed also said that “on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.” The dollar index fell 0.12 percent, with the euro up 0.13 percent to $1.2008. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36 points, or 0.15 percent, to 24,135.05, the S&P 500 gained 1.48 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,656.28 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.21 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,159.92.

2018-05-02,"BOGOTA, May 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - New York has said it will become the first city to report its progress towards U.N. global development goals, underscoring the growing importance of urban centres in combating poverty, inequality and climate change. National governments have made commitments to tackle these problems as part of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted unanimously by member nations in 2015. But many of the actions required to achieve the SDGS - such as planning, housing, infrastructure and basic services - are the responsibility of local governments. Addressing urban challenges is also a standalone goal that will have its first review in July at a U.N. forum in New York, when the city will report on its progress. “New York City is showing how localities across the country can implement the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement on Tuesday. The city of 8.5 million people is expected to show what has been done to achieve its 2015 pledges, which include lifting 800,000 residents out of poverty, addressing climate change and expanding access to nutritious and affordable food. More than half of the world’s seven billion people live in urban areas, while cities account for 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.N. “Cities are key for the achievement of the global goals,” said Emilia Saiz, secretary-general of the Barcelona-based cities network United Cities and Local Governments. “And we are thrilled that New York City is one of the pioneers to report on their contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, improving the lives of New Yorkers and setting an example for thousands of cities around the world.” Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by

2018-05-02,"MIDLAND, Texas (Reuters) - (This May 1 story has been refiled to correct name of professor to Lutz Kilian, not Kilian Lutz, in thirteenth paragraph.) In West Texas, rising oil prices are fueling a sharp economic upswing, lifting employment and pay to records, driving up spending at hotels, restaurants, and car dealerships, and raising the cost of housing and other essentials. This parched patch of land, under which lies the largest oil-producing rock formations in the United States, is the epicenter of a growth binge that shows just how tight the link remains between low unemployment, rising wages, and upward pricing pressure. After a two-year crash, the price of crude CLc1 began to recover in 2016 and pierced $60 a barrel early this year. But oil is still far cheaper than at the peak of the previous eight-year boom that began in 2006 North Dakota’s Bakken oil patch and supercharged the city of Williston. In the Permian basin, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the latest boom is being helped by advances in technology that allow drillers to extract much more from each acre. “$60 is like the new $100,” said Dallas Fed economist Michael Plante in a mid-April interview.  Breakeven costs are now as little as $25 per barrel, according to the Dallas Fed’s most recent survey, so energy companies here no longer need $100 oil to make lots of money.  And Midland and its neighbor Odessa, the biggest towns for miles and the regional base for major oil producers in the Permian Basin, including Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Apache Corp (APA.N) and Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N), are feeling the surge. “It is a full-fledged boom,” says Dale Redman, chief executive of Propetro, a Midland, Texas, firm that supplies heavy-duty horsepower to drill sites, where energy companies coax crude from the ground with sand and water. He has tripled his workforce since early 2016, drawing workers from towns and cities hundreds of miles away. Over half of his 1,200 employees make more than $100,000. “What it has done is raised wages for all these folks. But housing and the cost of living has gone up as well.”  To Midland Mayor Jerry Morales, “It’s a good story right now.” He says the city is trying to keep up with the drop in housing inventory and rise in rents by approving new apartment complexes and working with developers to put in water and sewer pipes.  But as owner of two restaurants in town, including Gerardo’s Casita, he sees the other side too. “The biggest problem I face is low unemployment - finding workers,” he said in a phone interview, adding that he is increasing pay every six months to keep staff from leaving for other jobs, and he is hiking his menu prices as well. Investment by the energy sector, for years a drag on growth, has in recent quarters begun to add to it, U.S. government figures show. But oil is only about 2 percent of U.S. GDP, says Lutz Kilian, an economics professor at the University of Michigan. That limits the effect of swings in the industry on the overall economy.  And though exports of oil have increased, helping to shrink the U.S. trade deficit in energy by half from fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2017, the improvement has had negligible impact on the much larger overall U.S. trade deficit, which grew during that period. But as an object lesson in the connection between low unemployment and rising prices, Midland and Odessa does have macroeconomic implications. On a national level, wage growth and inflation have remained surprisingly subdued even after 90 consecutive months of jobs gains, and an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent and expected to head still lower. “If the rest of the country starts to look more like West Texas ... then we will certainly see stronger wage gains” nationally, said David Berson, chief economist for Nationwide Mutual.  Berson predicts that when wage gains start to accelerate nationally, probably by early next year, they will boost inflation more than expected. Oil companies are drilling wells faster, and putting more wells on a single site, using technology to find the best angles and depths to get the most out of each layer of shale.  That has helped boost per-employee output by Texas oil and gas companies to an estimated $820,000, according to Waco, Texas-based economist Ray Perryman.  “Companies are making enough money to be able to afford to pay higher wages,” he said.  Unemployment was 3.2 percent in Odessa and 2.5 percent in Midland in February. Average weekly earnings in March hit records in both towns, which have a combined population of about 250,000. Sales tax receipts have soared.  “You have people that move in, you train them and then someone else offers them a job: there is constant raiding going on,” says Jeff Sparks, chief operating officer of family-owned Discovery Oil in Midland, who has only recently shifted to the more efficient and capital-intensive drilling techniques that have pushed per-barrel extraction costs down so steeply.  At the Odessa car dealership the Sewell family has run since 1935, Colin Sewell sold 1,073 trucks in the first three months of this year, up from 670 last year. He is building a brand new service center on the outskirts of town.  Jason Tarulli, senior project manager at general contractor UEB, is using an out-of-town crew to build a downtown Odessa construction project he is overseeing, because local hiring would have been impossible.  His costs are rising; rent for a one bedroom in his building rose by more than $1,000 in less than a year, to $3,630. Everyone who has lived here a while knows that the boom is not going to last, including Sondra Eoff, who is footing about half the $80 million bill for the downtown project, meant to help keep the town vibrant for the long run and not just during boomtimes. “When there’s an up, there’s a down,” she says.

2018-05-02,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian energy firm Forte Oil (FO.LG) said it plans to sell its upstream services and power businesses in Nigeria and divest from Ghana to focus on its core fuel distribution operation at home. The move comes as a surprise about-turn for a company whose Chief Executive Akin Akinfemiwa told investors in Lagos in August that he wanted to aggressively pursue M&A opportunities along the energy value chain and acquire marginal oilfields to boost its upstream business.  The company, majority owned by billionaire Femi Otedola,  had also been in talks with a major refinery to form a strategic partnership for local refining of petroleum products. Forte Oil’s share price plunged 49 percent last year after the company struggled to get hard currency to import products. It now has a total market value of 57.3 billion naira ($188 mln) but gave no indication on Wednesday of how much the businesses for sale might fetch. It said interest costs attributable to the businesses to be sold stood at 2.2 billion naira as of December. It now plans to seek shareholder approval for the sale on May 23 and appoint advisers, it said in a notice to investors. Forte Oil did not give a reason for the change in direction but said the downstream sector in Nigeria had gone through changes in recent years and was expected to evolve further.  It added that the industry has operated under a tightly regulated fixed margin but could be deregulated especially given its impact on the Nigerian currency and import bill. The government increased petrol prices by 67 percent to 145 naira in 2016 to cut subsidies paid for fuel imports after a plunge in oil prices hit state revenues, caused dollar shortages and halted infrastructure projects with firms laying off tens of thousands of workers. However, the hike did not prevent gasoline shortages which have plagued Nigeria for much of last year and this year. Nigeria’s existing and ageing refineries have a daily domestic refining capacity of 6 million liters, while the daily consumption stands at 35 million liters, so the country has to import the bulk of what it consumes. Forte Oil has two storage depots, five aviation fuel depots and a lubricant blending plant. It also has 100 trucks for distribution of products across its more than 500 retail outlets which would require a lot of capital to expand. Its 57-percent owned power unit, Amperion Power Distribution Company, has a lot of receivables due from the state-backed offtaker and its upstream unit has contributed less than 7 percent to group earnings over the past three years. The unit in Ghana has declared losses over the last three years and has uncollectible trade debts due to tough economic conditions and a currency devaluation in the cocoa-rich country. Forte Oil said proceeds from the divestment would be used to expand its downstream fuel distribution business and to invest in storage infrastructure. “The changing landscape also suggests backward integration would be essential to remain competitive within the sector, particularly in the face of impending deregulation,” it said in the notice. Forte’s pretax profit nearly doubled in 2017 to 10.63 billion naira, though sales fell by 15 percent to 129.4 billion naira, the company said in March. Shares in Forte closed flat on Wednesday at 44 naira, and have risen 4 percent this year.

2018-05-02,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration has invited a group of U.S. senators to the White House early next week to discuss biofuels policy, the latest in a series of such meetings aimed at helping refiners cope with the Renewable Fuel Standard, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The senators will include Republicans Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of corn state Iowa, along with Pat Toomey and Ted Cruz of refinery states Pennsylvania and Texas, according to the sources, who asked not to be named. The meeting will take place on Monday or Tuesday, they said. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Biofuels groups have complained that the Trump administration is granting too many exemptions to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires refineries to mix increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel or to purchase credits from rivals that do. The law was intended to support farmers, reduce pollution, and cut petroleum imports. Exemptions were meant to benefit smaller refiners who may not be able to do the blending or purchase the credits. While the 2005 regulation has created a multibillion-gallon market for ethanol, refiners complain the requirements now costs them hundreds of millions of dollars per year. They have urged the Trump administration to make changes, like capping the price of blending credits or shifting the blending obligation away from refiners entirely. The ethanol industry has vehemently opposed those proposals, saying they would undermine demand for biofuels and also hurt farm income. Numerous meetings on the topic since late last year appeared to end in deadlock. Last month, President Donald Trump announced he would consider expanding the times of year that high ethanol blend gasoline can be sold, a concession to the corn industry keen to boost its share of the motor fuel market. At the same time, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been issuing more RFS exemptions to small refineries than the Obama administration did. While plants receiving the exemptions are small, their owners are some of the largest U.S. refiners, including Andeavor, which Marathon Petroleum hopes to acquire for $23 billion.  The surge in exemptions follows a federal court ruling in August that says the EPA was using guidelines in denying applications that were too strict. Biofuel groups say the EPA is using the court decision to justify gutting the RFS. Prices of compliance credits have plummeted on news of the refinery exemptions. The EPA also granted a waiver to a refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, according to two industry sources briefed on the matter.  Oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron have also applied for waivers at their small U.S. refineries.  A biofuels trade group asked a federal court on Tuesday to rule whether the EPA violated the law in granting a growing number of small refineries exemptions from renewable fuel laws, according to a court filing.

2018-05-02,"CALGARY, Alberta, May 2 (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Wednesday that its current growth plan is not constrained by pipeline bottlenecks and it does not expect to make any further major investments in Canada’s oil sands until market access improves. The Calgary-based company, Canada’s second-largest energy producer, will continue to look at assets available in the market, but is “not chasing anything,” Chief Executive Steve Williams said on an investor call. “The real strength of our growth plan for the next five or six years is our high level of certainty, and it’s not constrained by market access issues,” he said. “We have existing pipeline access to accommodate all of our oil sands production.” Canadian energy producers are struggling as increased oil sands output has run up against a lack of new export pipelines and tight rail capacity, sending the differential between Canadian oil prices and the U.S. crude benchmark to multi-year highs.

Forecast-beating results from the world’s biggest company, Apple Inc, lifted tech shares, limiting losses in stocks. Expectations that the Fed will signal more policy tightening ahead kept some investors cautious. The Fed is likely to announce at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) that it is holding interest rates steady, but it could encourage expectations of a rate increase in June. A hawkish-sounding Fed could further boost the dollar, which has roared higher in recent weeks, erasing its year-to-date losses versus a basket of currencies. The gains came amid signs the Fed will be the only major central bank to raise rates in the coming months. The Fed may be reluctant to increase market expectations of further tightening until it sees more data, however. Markets are currently pricing in an additional two rate hikes this year. “I don’t think the Fed is going to want markets to price in more tightening at this point,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index rose 0.16 percent, with the euro down 0.18 percent to $1.1971. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.28 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,039.77, the S&P 500 lost 5.9 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,648.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.99 points, or 0.06 percent, to 7,134.69. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.60 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.06 percent. Apple, the world’s biggest company by market capitalization, beat profit and revenue expectations in the first quarter, thanks to robust iPhone sales, and it announced a $100 billion share buyback. Apple shares rose 4.0 percent. Chipmakers STMicroelectronics , Infineon, BE Semiconductor and ASML also gained, enjoying the positive mood about the sector. U.S. Treasury yields hovered near four-year highs. Data earlier showed U.S. private-sector payrolls for April came roughly in line with market forecasts.

2018-05-02,"(Adds details, oil prices, quotes) May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stocks rose sharply last week, bringing overall supply to its highest level since December, and gasoline inventories also rose, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories jumped by 6.2 million barrels to about 436 million barrels in the week to April 27, compared with expectations for an increase of 739,000 barrels. The build was largely concentrated on the West Coast, where inventories rose by nearly 5 million barrels. “Sometimes the West Coast numbers are erratic and usually when you get a big build in the West Coast, it’s followed with a big draw the next week,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Gasoline stocks rose 1.2 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 587,000-barrel drop. The oil market initially reacted negatively to the news, with prices dropping on the build in crude and gasoline. Crude later recovered, though gasoline prices were still lower. U.S. crude oil futures were up 22 cents at $67.46 a barrel as of 10:59 a.m. EDT (1459 GMT), while Brent crude fell 14 cents to $72.98 a barrel. U.S. gasoline futures fell 0.7 percent to $2.0724 a gallon. Price Futures’ Flynn said he anticipates strong demand going forth that will keep refinery output high, which remains bullish for oil prices. Refinery crude runs fell by 60,000 barrels per day and refinery utilization rates rose by 0.3 percentage points to 91.1 percent of total capacity, EIA data showed. “This implies that maybe we’ll start to ramp up that refinery utilization rate which had been sliding,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. The jump in crude and gasoline stocks was offset by a bigger-than-anticipated fall in inventories of diesel, jet fuel and other distillates. Distillate stockpiles slumped by 3.9 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.4 million-barrel drop, the EIA said. Crude production continued to rise, hitting a new weekly record of 10.62 million bpd. Weekly figures are considered less reliable, and the industry relies more on monthly data; the EIA on Monday said production in February rose to a record 10.26 million bpd, which ranks it second in the world behind Russia. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 416,000 barrels, the EIA said. Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 263,000 bpd.

2018-05-02,"BRUSSELS, May 2 (Reuters) - The European Commission announced on Wednesday proposals for a new multi-year budget that is expected to see EU countries squabble among themselves over how to fill the funding gap left by Britain’s exit next year. The draft 2021-27 budget plan, around 1.11 percent of the bloc’s economic output versus the current 1.03 percent, aims to cut farm subsidies while increasing spending on research and digital technology, euro zone stability, security and defence. The key elements are: The introduction of a mechanism by which governments would see EU funds withheld if they are deemed not to be respecting the rule of law — in effect targeting ex-communist states where Brussels sees the independence of judges under threat. Spending to almost triple to 33 billion euros ($39.57 billion) from current 13 billion in order to fund 10,000 border guards by 2027. In its most ambitious defence plan for decades, the Commission proposed to spend 22 times more than in the 2014-2020 period - some 13 billion euros - on a joint weapons fund, research, shared financing for battlegroups and allowing a coalition of the willing to conduct more missions abroad. Overall, the next EU budget sets aside 27.5 billion euros for security and defence over the seven-year period. That includes 2.5 billion euros for an internal security fund to fight extremism and cybercrime. A reform support programme with a 25-billion-euro budget to help EU countries with structural reforms, a new convergence facility to aid non-euro EU countries join the common currency, a European Investment Stabilisation Function, backed by loans guaranteed by the EU budget up to 30 billion euros, which will grant preferential loans to crisis hit EU countries. Funding up by 26 percent to 123 billion euros to maintain stability and tackle migration. An off-budget 10.5 billion European Peace Facility to fund schemes with non-EU countries. Some 22 billion euros annually targeted to be raised from new revenue streams, accounting for about 12 percent of the total budget, which include EU countries contributing 20 percent of revenues from emissions trading system auctions, a three percent call rate on a new common consolidated corporate tax base and 80 cents per kilogram of non-recycled plastic packaging waste for a total amount of about seven billion euros. 1.58 billion euros in one-off aid to workers laid off due to adverse developments in global trade and economic disruption Direct payments will be reduced by four percent and better targeted, compulsory capping of subsidies will be imposed at farm level, with funds diverted to smaller farms in the same country. A new crisis reserve would be set up to deal with problems arising from unexpected developments resulting from the actions of non-EU countries. The overall EU agricultural budget will be cut by five percent. 12 billion euros — a ninefold increase Funding up by 50 percent, with 100 billion euros for flagship programmes Horizon Europe and nuclear research programme. All rebates to be phased out over five years and the rebate EU countries keep for collecting customs revenues to be halved to 10 percent from 20 percent. $1 = 0.8339 euros

2018-05-02,"May 2 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people will descend on Omaha, Nebraska this weekend for the annual shareholder weekend for Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate that billionaire Warren Buffett has run since 1965. Buffett calls the three-day weekend, the largest corporate gathering in the United States, “Woodstock for Capitalists.” It features shopping discounts, a five-kilometer run, the takeover of a shopping mall for a cocktail reception, and Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 5, broadcast on Yahoo Finance.

2018-05-02,"(Reuters) - He thinks of himself as a teacher, and to many he is an icon. But to Wall Street, Warren Buffett is something quite different. A disappointment. Tens of thousands of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders and fans may think otherwise as they flock to Omaha, Nebraska, this weekend to see Buffett, 87, and his longtime partner and fellow billionaire Charlie Munger, 94. The weekend will celebrate their long-term success running a conglomerate, now with 90-some businesses overseen on a daily basis by two potential Buffett successors, newly-installed Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain. But recent results, relative to what analysts were counting on, were of a sort that might make chief executives at other companies hang their heads. Berkshire’s operating profit, excluding investments and derivatives, has fallen short of Wall Street forecasts for eight consecutive quarters, while its cash stake swelled to $116 billion (85.3 billion pounds) because Buffett could not find enough worth buying. In contrast, just 21 percent of Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX companies typically miss forecasts in any given quarter, while 64 percent beat forecasts. Berkshire has a chance to break its streak on Saturday morning when it is scheduled to report first-quarter results. “Obviously, the quarterly results matter, but I care year-to-year about what they’re doing,” said Paul Lountzis, founder of Lountzis Asset Management LLC in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, who has been to more than 20 meetings and is attending this weekend. “Though you may be upset with all the cash they have, if there is a challenge across the world, or liquidity dries up, he’s going to step in and take advantage,” he added, referring to Buffett. Predicting results can be hard because Berkshire’s tentacles spread far. Its products and services include car insurance (Geico), mobile homes (Clayton), wind power (Berkshire Hathaway Energy), cowboy boots (Justin Brands), chocolate (See’s), helium balloon inflators (Western Enterprises) and electronic sow feeding systems (perhaps unsurprisingly, PigTek). “Berkshire Hathaway is a challenging company to analyse,” and “does not manage its results to meet Street expectations,” Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote last week. Insurance underwriting has dragged on recent results, and Berkshire last year paid out billions of dollars for hurricane losses. But a tailwind from an improving U.S. economy boosted shipments on the BNSF railroad, and bolstered Berkshire’s building materials and consumer businesses.  Gelb expects operating profit to rise 45 percent in 2018. That could help Berkshire’s stock price, which closed on Tuesday about 10 percent below its peak on Jan. 29. Questions about Berkshire will likely comprise a majority of the roughly 60 questions that Buffett and Munger will field over five hours at Saturday’s annual shareholder meeting. “There’s always something to learn,” said Brandon Taylor, managing partner of Taylor Hoffman Wealth Management in Richmond, Virginia, attending his sixth meeting this year. “Knowledge compounds over time, and the more I expose myself to investors who are better than me, the better off I will be.” Berkshire sent out slightly more tickets to this year’s extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett’s 50th year at the helm. A couple of million may watch Buffett and Munger online this year via Yahoo Finance. As usual there will also be events across Omaha, including investing conferences and shareholder shopping at Berkshire-owned businesses. At the jeweller Borsheim’s, for example, silver pens bearing Buffett’s signature fetch $14, while a 1.93-carat argyle pink diamond can be yours for the bargain price of $1,046,750 (normally $1.57 million). But the meeting remains the highlight. It may give Buffett and Munger a chance to address progress on Berkshire’s joint venture with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to lower employee healthcare costs, or the scandals hurting the stock price and reputation of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), one of Berkshire’s biggest investments. Buffett and Munger will likely also get questions about matters outside their comfort zones, such as bitcoin, or perhaps dysfunction in Washington. While Buffett is a Democrat and Munger a Republican, both are equal-opportunity critics of shortsightedness and stupidity. The meeting is “a rejuvenation of all the investment values and principles that Warren and Charlie impart,” Lountzis said.

2018-05-02,"(Reuters) - Worldwide investments in limiting climate change are far too low and as flimsy as using an umbrella in a hurricane, the United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa said on Wednesday. Espinosa, a former Mexican foreign minister, also told delegates from almost 200 nations meeting in Germany that more storms, droughts and floods linked to man-made greenhouse gas emissions threatened “global destabilisation”. She urged far more investments to limit global warming, by shifting from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy, and to protect people from the worsening effects of extreme weather. “Trying to address climate change at current financing levels is like walking into a Category 5 hurricane protected by only an umbrella,” she said in a speech. “Right now we are talking in millions and billions of dollars when we should be speaking in trillions,” said Espinosa, who is head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat. “The impacts of extreme weather are already creating chaos.” Nations at the April 30-May 10 meeting in Bonn are working on a detailed rule book for the 2015 Paris Agreement, aiming to have it in place by the end of 2018, and are reviewing actions so far to limit global warming. Developing nations at the talks want firmer guarantees of funds - rich nations have promised to mobilise $100 billion a year in climate finance, from both public and private sources, by 2020 to help them tackle warming. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has estimated that climate finance for the poor totalled $62 billion in 2014. Developing nations say the accounts are exaggerated. “There remains a vast gap between the support needed and support received,” Gebru Jember Endalew, who chairs the least developed nations group, said in a statement. Espinosa said average world surface temperatures were set to rise by 3.0 degrees Celsius (5.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, based on current commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement seeks to limit warming to “well below” a 2C rise. U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts climate change is primarily man-made, plans to quit the Paris pact and instead promote domestic fossil fuels. Espinosa said a three degree rise “will lead to nothing less than global destabilisation. It will cost lives. It will raise competition over resources, it will increase instability and conflict.” Inia Seruiratu, Fiji’s agriculture minister who is tasked with driving more ambitious action to meet Paris Agreement targets, said countries face limits on how much they can adapt to coming changes - such as worsening cyclones. “We live in constant fear that a direct hit from intensifying cyclones could wipe out our economy altogether and set back our development by decades,” he said in Bonn.

2018-05-02,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed a bigger new multi-year budget on Wednesday that will trigger battles among member states over how to fill the funding gap left by Britain’s exit next year. The Dutch led the charge for rich northern states unwilling to step into the Brexit breach: “A smaller EU ... should have a smaller budget,” Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. Against that, France’s agriculture minister called it “simply unthinkable” to shave 5 percent off Brussels’ hefty spending on farm subsidies. Poland, which the Commission has in its sights with a new mechanism to penalize authoritarian governments that impinge on independent judges, warned of “a long road ahead” to reach the unanimous compromise required to put the budget into effect. Germany, the biggest paymaster, was cautious, repeating its readiness, like France, to spend more but only if it was “fair”. “With today’s proposal we have put forward a pragmatic plan for how to do more with less,” Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the European Parliament in launching the proposal to spend about 10 percent more in 2021-27 as a share of output. Among highlights are sharp increases in spending on border defenses against illegal immigration as well as on foreign aid, plus more investment in common EU defense schemes, research and technology and on helping euro zone governments in difficulty. His plan to spend about 1.11 percent of the 27 nations’ combined economic production compare to 1.03 percent of the pre-Brexit, 28-country Multiannual Financial Framework now in place.  It is worth 1.28 trillion euros ($1.53 trillion), adjusting for future inflation, or 1.14 trillion euros at today’s prices — about 160 billion euros a year, compared to 150 billion now. That, the Commission argues, will be less than a daily cup of coffee for 440 million Europeans and is cheap at the price. National governments typically tax and spend 40 times as much. The proposal asks member states to let Brussels raise new money directly from new taxes on plastics — designed also to help the environment — and on big global tech firms. But it will also require governments in the wealthier west to chip in more as Britain stops paying its annual 10 billion euros or so. Some will also see EU rebates phased out over five years. “A budget for a Europe that protects, empowers and defends,” was the Commission’s chosen slogan for the day. That language reflects a campaign from Brussels to persuade voters the bloc remains relevant after a decade of crisis that has seen ferocious austerity in countries hit by the euro zone debt crisis and uproar over the arrival of more than a million irregular migrants across the Mediterranean in 2015 alone. “A Europe that protects,” has also become a familiar demand from French President Emmanuel Macron, as he tries to work with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to tighten integration after the ever-skeptical British have left, while easing fears among voters that the EU means open borders and jobs exported abroad. Furious battles among member governments, however, may cast a shadow over the Commission’s efforts to patch over rifts as Juncker tries to rally east and west, north and south, big and small states behind a post-Brexit relaunch next year. EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger, who has called for states to show unprecedented speed and agree the budget within a year or so, said it was inevitable that there will be disputes: “There will be cuts, which many countries will complain about,” he told German television. “And there will be new spending, which the others will complain about.”  Additional reporting by Robin Emmott, Foo Yun Chee, Robert-Jan Bartunek, Gabriela Baczynska, Peter Maushagen and Alissa de Carbonnel; Editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/eu-budget/update-2-eu-launches-battle-for-bigger-post-brexit-budget-idUKL8N1S933Z,02 May 2018,"* Dutch lead charge for cuts, France fears for farmers

2018-05-02,"(Adds info, comments from sustainable energy conference) By Megan Rowling LISBON, May 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world is moving too slowly to meet targets to provide electric power and clean cooking to everyone on the planet by 2030, with progress on using less-polluting fuels in the kitchen especially poor, international agencies said on Wednesday. The number of people living without access to electricity in 2016 was a billion, or 13 percent of the global population, with the vast majority in rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, new data released by the World Bank, the United Nations and other organisations showed. Unless efforts to get power to hard-to-reach areas are ramped up, an estimated 674 million people - about 8 percent of the world’s population - will still live without electricity in 2030, they said in a report. In 2016, 3 billion people, more than 40 percent of the global population, did not have access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Indoor air pollution from burning wood, dung, kerosene and other dirty fuels causes over 4 million deaths a year, with women and children at highest risk, the report said. “We must be more ambitious in harnessing the power of renewable energy to meet sustainable development and climate goals, and take more deliberate action to achieve a sustainable energy future,” said Adnan Z. Amin, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency, which worked on the report. Among the global development goals now being pursued are universal access to electricity and clean cooking, as well as a doubling of the rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and a substantial increase in the share of renewables in the world’s energy mix. The Energy Progress Report, released at a two-day forum in Lisbon tackling how to meet the targets, highlighted that some countries - particularly in East Africa - have made big strides in getting electric power to their people in recent years. Vivien Foster, global lead for energy economics with the World Bank, noted that in sub-Saharan Africa the number of people living without electricity had begun to fall for the first time in history, which could be “a turning point for electrification on the continent”. Previously, efforts to add power capacity were unable to keep up with population growth. “The battle for universal (electricity) access will be won or lost in sub-Saharan Africa,” Foster told the forum. Progress in East Africa has been fuelled by a jump in small-scale solar power, driven by a rise in “pay-as-you-go” systems in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, where users can make payments via mobile phones. Germaine Kamayirese, Rwanda’s minister of state for energy, water and sanitation, said her country was pushing off-grid solar power hard as a way of hitting its goal of providing electricity to all its people by 2024. Today, 42 percent have access compared with just 6 percent in 2009. At least 30 million people around the world are benefiting from solar home systems, yet only about “a dozen” countries are embracing this revolution, World Bank experts said. “If more countries would turn to this resource, we think electrification could accelerate even more rapidly,” said Foster, noting the need for governments to develop clean energy markets and ensure good-quality products. A shift towards cleaner cooking is lagging partly because it lacks policymakers to champion the cause in many places, she added. Markets for modern cookstoves also remain undeveloped. On current trends, by 2030, only 73 percent of people will have access to clean fuels for cooking, said Maria Neira, director for public health and environment at the World Health Organisation. “This is absolutely not acceptable,” she told the conference, noting that such a failure would have “an enormous impact on the health of people”. Progress on boosting use of renewable energy also is set to fall short of the 2030 target, the report said. As of 2015, the world got 17.5 percent of all energy that goes to end users, such as households, industry and agriculture, from renewables. Solar and wind have become far cheaper, allowing them to compete with conventional power sources such as coal. But electricity accounted for only 20 percent of energy consumption in 2015, said the report, flagging the need to speed up the transition to cleaner energy in transport and heating. Energy efficiency is improving, with economic growth outpacing increases in energy use in all regions except for Western Asia from 2010-2015, the report said. That means countries - and particularly industries - are using less energy to produce more. Transport and residential buildings have not shown the same rate of improvement in energy efficiency. Several wealthy developed countries such as Japan and the United States may have reached a peak in energy use, the report said, while among large developing countries, China and Indonesia are rapidly becoming more energy efficient. ""To meet 2030 targets, we must make every unit of energy work harder,"" said Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All, a body set up by the United Nations.

2018-05-02,"TURKMENBASHI, Turkmenistan (Reuters) - Turkmenistan on Wednesday opened a new $1.5 billion cargo and passenger seaport on the Caspian Sea aiming to boost its export revenues by handling shipping traffic between Asia and Europe. The Central Asian country’s main source of hard currency is its gas exports, which took a hit when Russia, once its main customer, stopped all purchases in 2016 after a pricing dispute. The port, in the city of Turkmenbashi, will more than triple Turkmenistan’s cargo handling capacity to 25-26 million tonnes a year, the government has said. Speaking before the official opening ceremony, Turkmen President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov said Ashgabat was ready to discuss the use of the seaport with its landlocked neighbors, a reference to Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.     Turkmenistan already has a railway link with China through neighboring Kazakhstan and the new port could help Ashgabat win a slice of cargo flows moving between China, the Middle East and Europe. Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Iran also have Caspian ports. The new port also has container handling facilities and a polypropylene terminal which will handle products from a nearby plant which is set to be launched later this year. Turkmenistan does not report how much cargo its existing Caspian port currently handles. Reporting by Marat Gurt; Writing by Olzhas Auyezov.

2018-05-02,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki fulfilled his life-long goal of wresting power from the country’s minority Sunnis after the fall of Saddam Hussein but his drive to entrench Shi’ite dominance proved his downfall.     Blamed for the widespread corruption and divisive policies that contributed to the collapse of the Iraqi military and the rise of Islamic State, Maliki lost the premiership to fellow Dawa Party member Haider al-Abadi after a 2014 election.     Now, after four years sidelined as one of three largely ceremonial vice-presidents, Maliki is taking on Abadi in a May 12 election in a bid to win a third term as prime minister, and is posing again as Iraq’s Shi’ite champion.     Posters of Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Sadr who was executed by Saddam in 1980 fly at Maliki’s rallies, the dominant colour of his campaign banners is the green of Islam and he is proposing to do away with the power-sharing formula that has ensured government roles for the dominant non-Shi’ite groups.     Sentenced to death under Saddam for being part of the outlawed Shi’ite Islamic Dawa Party, Maliki spent nearly a quarter of century in exile mainly in Syria and Iran, continually agitating for the dictator’s downfall.     After returning in 2003, Maliki joined Iraq’s interim government and became prime minister in 2006, establishing a reputation as a shrewd political operator and the Shi’ite leader who pulled Iraq back from the brink of civil war.     Maliki’s supporters praise him for signing Saddam’s death warrant in 2006 and for refusing to allow U.S. forces to stay in Iraq beyond 2011.     But during eight years in office, Maliki was also perceived as an inveterate sectarian who alienated the minority Sunnis and Kurds by shutting them out of key security positions and undermining power-sharing.     “When he became prime minister, he continued to function as an underground Dawa operative. He put in place shadow Dawa cells in each ministry reporting directly to him, and not the minister,” said a non-Shi’ite who served in Maliki’s cabinet.     “It wouldn’t be far-fetched to say that he created a parallel government and parallel security services reporting directly to him,” the former minister told Reuters. Responding to accusations Maliki ran a parallel government, his media adviser, Abbas al-Musawi, said the former prime minister was at times forced to launch initiatives directly to boost the economy when he felt ministers from other groups were delaying or obstructing the work of government.     Blamed for letting Islamic State seize a third of Iraq in 2014, Maliki was blocked from winning a third term by Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, opening the door for Abadi to become prime minister. On the face of it, Maliki’s campaign call for a multi-ethnic “political majority” government to make the administration more efficient and cohesive could be seen as a break with his past.     Maliki is proposing to replace the system whereby the cabinet must reflect the parliamentary representation of political parties with a multi-ethnic governing majority and a multi-ethnic opposition minority.     But non-Shi’ite politicians fear the plan could keep the main non-Shi’ite groups out of government and reduce their influence, in contrast to the more inclusive policies of Abadi. “Shi’ite religious parties have been controlling the key positions of the state, public administrations and security services since 2003. Having a political majority rule under these conditions will remove all the checks and balances non-Shi’ite parties have,” said Jaber al-Jaberi, a Sunni MP.     Opponents say the proposed system would, in practise, allow a prime minister to chose Kurd or Sunni ministers who are not representatives of the main Kurdish or Sunni parties, as long as they were qualified and agreed on a common programme. “The claims that there is a deep state controlled by the Dawa is a big lie,” said Saad al-Muttalibi, a lawmaker from Maliki’s group in parliament. “The previous (Maliki) governments were partnership cabinets and the political forces that took part in them share the credit of success and the blame of failure,” he said. Maliki’s followers see his removal in 2014 as a conspiracy because he championed Shi’ite interests in Iraq and the region.     “He is a strong leader, he is not afraid of confrontation,” said Mohamed Ghabbar, a student in the Shi’ite holy city of Kerbala, south of the capital Baghdad. In Syria, Maliki sided with Shi’ite neighbour Iran and Bashar al-Assad in the civil war pitting the Syrian president against predominantly Sunni opponents backed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey.     Like many Iraqi Shi’ite leaders Maliki is closely tied to Iran, where he built relationships during his exile.     In his election campaign, Maliki continues to advocate an anti-Saudi line, implicitly criticising Abadi for rebuilding bridges with Riyadh and other Sunni capitals.     “I had told these countries that I won’t allow the regime in Syria to fall,” he said in an April 24 interview to Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese TV channel close to Assad, who belongs to the Alawite sect which is an offshoot of Shi’ism.     “Saudi Arabia failed (in Syria) and it is trying now to bring Iraq to the Saudi alliance. Iraq can’t be part of this alliance,” he said, in an apparent reference to a conference in Kuwait in February to raise funds for Abadi to rebuild Iraq.     As the leader of the Dawa Party, Maliki will command a solid base of Shi’ite support in the election, especially from religious Shi’ites wary of power-sharing.     But this time round, the Shi’ite vote looks set to be split between three frontrunners: Abadi, Maliki and another ally of Iran, militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, whose stature and popularity rose after he commanded the fight against Islamic State.     If no clear winner emerges, Maliki will have to call on all his negotiating skills again to secure a governing alliance, or risk being sidelined once more.

2018-05-02,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, May 2 (Reuters) - The new Shanghai crude oil futures have been trading for just over a month and have so far managed to build up reasonably strong volumes, but this success may only mask some wider concerns. The yuan-denominated contracts were launched on March 26 by the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) and are enjoying trading volumes averaging around 80,000 a day, with the open interest around 16,000. The INE contract offers seven grades of Middle Eastern and domestic crude for delivery to various locations in China, the world’s largest oil importer. While the contract is well-designed to match China’s crude buying, it is structured so that delivery is for several months ahead, making it difficult to compare to other crude oil benchmarks, such as Brent, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s Oman. The Shanghai contract includes a freight component and a currency factor, making it challenging for traders to work out arbitrage opportunities against the other benchmarks. Nonetheless, the volumes and open interest compare very favourably to those of the DME contract, which is perhaps the best comparison given that Oman crude is similar in quality to the grades being offered by the INE. Daily front-month volumes for the DME contract are usually between 3,000 and 5,000, well below the levels that Shanghai futures are achieving. However, both are dwarfed by Brent and WTI, both of which trade in the hundreds of thousands of contracts every day. It’s also the nature of the volumes on the INE that may be cause for concern, with trade dominated by Chinese players, including the major state-owned refiners, smaller traders and retail investors. There is nothing wrong with this mix per se, but the INE contract may end up like the iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange insofar as they attract huge volumes, but mainly from domestic players who respond more to local news flows than market fundamentals. This raises the risk that the INE contract effectively becomes a Chinese domestic vehicle for investors to “play” in the crude oil market. If this does happen, it would undermine the aim of establishing Shanghai as a major pricing hub for crude oil. So far, it appears that participation by Western oil companies, traders and investors in the INE has been limited. That’s not to say there isn’t interest among Western players in the Shanghai market, but it seems that they are being cautious as how best to benefit from participating. One of the logical ways to participate would be to hedge Middle East crude against the delivered price in China, and to pocket any arbitrage difference. This means the price of Oman futures would have to be below those in Shanghai, and other costs such as currency transactions and freight would also have to be factored in. The third-month Oman contract, which is for July delivery, ended at $69.33 a barrel on Tuesday. This is the contract most suitable for comparison to the front-month INE future, which is for delivery in September. The Shanghai future ended at 442.5 yuan a barrel on April 27, with there being no trade on Monday and Tuesday due to public holidays. This equates to about $69.87 a barrel, meaning there is only a tiny premium of 54 cents a barrel currently between the INE and DME equivalent contracts. This isn’t enough to cover the cost of freight and currency conversion, meaning the arbitrage window between Dubai and Shanghai is currently closed. Of course, this won’t always be the case, but market participants outside China appear to be adopting a wait-and-see attitude when it comes to the INE contract. Having a dollar-denominated mirror contract for the INE futures, perhaps based in the regional trading hub of Singapore, may boost interest in the Shanghai futures. But for now, the initial success of the Shanghai contract is tempered by signs that it may not be working as intended, and that it’s still some way from achieving the goal of becoming the benchmark for crude trade in Asia.

2018-05-02,"(Reuters) - U.S. solar and wind energy companies have donated far more money to Republicans than Democrats in congressional races this election cycle, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance data, an unprecedented tilt to the right for an industry long associated with the environmental left. While the money is modest compared with that donated by fossil fuel interests, the support provides GOP candidates with added credibility on clean energy, an issue polling shows swing voters care about.   Renewable energy has typically depended on government subsidies and policies to help fuel its growth, and the donations come at a time when Republicans control both houses of Congress as well as a majority of state houses across the country. Republicans have so far left subsidies for the industry largely intact. “We support those leaders who share our vision,” said Arthur Haubenstock, vice president of policy and strategy at 8minutenergy Renewables LLC, a California-based solar project developer, and treasurer of a newly formed employee-funded political action committee that shares the company’s name. So far, the PAC has donated only to Republicans. Overall, political action committees representing solar and wind companies have donated nearly $400,000 to candidates and PACs in the 2018 election cycle, including $247,000 to Republicans, $139,300 to Democrats, and $7,500 to independents, according to the Reuters analysis.  That marks a record. During the 2016 presidential elections, the first cycle during which the clean energy industry gave more to the GOP than to Democrats, Republicans received just over half of the combined $695,470 in political contributions from major wind and solar PACs.  Before that, solar and wind companies mainly donated to Democrats, who were broadly seen as more supportive of policies that could help the nascent sector grow. In 2014, 70 percent of the contributions from seven major wind and solar PACs went to Democrats.  The U.S. solar and wind industries have expanded greatly over the last decade and now employ some 300,000 workers nationwide, nearly six times more than coal mining. The hottest growth has been in states that voted heavily for President Donald Trump in 2016. That has helped strengthen the industry’s appeal to Republican lawmakers, allowing it to rebrand as a jobs engine for the heartland, instead of as a tool for combating global warming, an issue that played better with Democrats. “Solar is creating economic activity in so many districts,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, head of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), whose donations have tilted heavily toward the GOP. Global warming “is certainly not our lead talking point,” she said. SEIA has contributed more than twice as much to Republicans as to Democrats this cycle, $56,500 versus $26,700.  Prior to 2016, SEIA’s contributions to Democrats were reliably double what the group gave to Republicans. The American Wind Energy Association’s PAC, too, has shifted its giving. In 2014 it gave Democrats twice as much money as Republicans, while in the current cycle it has given $87,500 to Republicans compared to $67,500 for Democrats.  Polls have found widespread support for renewable energy among voters, including among Republicans. Most recently, a Gallup poll from early March found 73 percent of adults favor an emphasis on alternatives like wind and solar over traditional fossil fuels. Just over half of Republicans - 51 percent - favored alternatives, compared with 88 percent of Democrats, Gallup said. Among moderate Republicans and voters who lean Republican, there is even wider support for renewable energy. A poll conducted by Pew Research Center in early 2017 found that nearly two-thirds of that group favored alternative energy sources over fossil fuels. The polls also found that attitudes toward clean energy are not necessarily linked to those about climate change. The Gallup poll, for instance, found just 35 percent of Republicans think climate change is caused by human activities, and 69 percent think the seriousness of global warming is exaggerated. “Clean energy works every time and it doesn’t alienate the base,” said Jay Faison, Chief Executive of ClearPath, a group that aims to help elect Republicans supporting clean power. Independent-minded voters view support for alternative energy as a signal that a candidate is “not an errand boy for the party leadership,” he added. Nevada incumbent Senator Dean Heller is among the chief Republican beneficiaries of support from the clean energy industry. His re-election effort has drawn more than $15,000 in backing from solar and wind this election cycle.  Nevada ranks fourth in the nation in solar installations and generates more than 11 percent of its electricity from the sun. One in every 203 people is employed by the solar industry in Nevada, putting it second only to ultra-green California. Heller told Reuters he supports clean energy because of the jobs it has brought to his state. Nevada has been able to attract employers like Tesla, he said, in part because its abundant sunshine can produce renewable power for factories and other business operations. He added he doesn’t see a conflict with supporting both solar energy and fossil fuel interests:  “I’m very pro ‘all of the above,’ and I think that’s where the GOP is,” he said. Other Republicans receiving solar and wind donations include Kevin Brady of Texas, Carlos Curbelo of Florida, George Holding of North Carolina and Tom Reed of New York, all members of the House Committee on Ways and Means, which is responsible for writing tax policy.  All four hail from states with sizeable solar markets, and Curbelo is also co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers working on policies to address climate change.   House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has received about $13,500 in contributions from the renewable energy PACs, and SEIA held a fundraiser for him in his California district last year. McCarthy’s congressional district, which includes a swath of the Mojave desert, boasts more solar capacity than any other district in the nation, most of it in large-scale projects for utilities. ROCK-BOTTOM MARKS Democratic and environmental groups downplay the clean energy industry’s shifting financial support, saying companies are simply trying to protect their interests by supporting the party in power.  “AWEA and SEIA are trade associations representing the financial business interests of their member companies,” said Sara Chieffo, vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, which has found itself at odds with solar and wind PACs on many candidates, including Heller.  The league gives Heller rock-bottom marks for his environmental voting record and has endorsed his Democratic opponent, Jacky Rosen, in the Nevada senate race.  Most environmental groups still primarily back Democrats. The League of Conservation Voters, for example, has contributed $1.3 million to Democratic congressional candidates this cycle but has not supported a single Republican. Billionaire Tom Steyer’s NextGen Climate Action Super PAC has spent tens of millions of dollars in recent election cycles on campaigns against Republicans and for Democratic candidates.   Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Sabrina Singh questions why solar and wind companies would support Republicans over Democrats. Republicans, she said, “consistently seek to defund efforts to promote clean energy,” while “Democrats at both the federal and state level have been fighting to promote renewable energy.”   The Republican National Committee did not respond to a request for comment.

2018-05-02,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Richard Valdmanis May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. electric utilities are expected to shut hundreds more of their coal-fired power generators in the coming years, extending a long trend away from coal and toward natural gas that has cast a pall over the mining industry. But not every U.S. coal company sees a bleak future. Ramaco Resources, which produces coal for steel mills, and Consol Energy, which supplies coal to larger power plants, have ramped up investments even as the industry shrinks. President Donald Trump has promised to revive the coal sector by stripping away burdensome regulation. But the two companies say their confidence stems more from market forces than any policy. Their bullish bets illustrate how pockets of profitable growth can survive in troubled industries facing almost certain decline. Ramaco, for example, expects global demand for metallurgical coal to rise in step with economic growth, despite the slump in U.S. demand for the type of coal used in electric power generators. And Consol says it has found a way to turn the rapid decline of coal-fired power into a strength: It has cultivated a clientele that owns big generators that are not expected to shut down anytime soon - making them likely to take over business from rivals that do close. “We can sell every ounce of coal we can produce,” said David Khani, Consol’s Chief Financial Officer. “This isn’t true for everyone.” Consol, which mines thermal coal for power plants in Pennsylvania, boosted capital spending last year by 50 percent to $81.4 million, and it aims to bump that to $125 million in 2018, according to its filings. Ramaco, meanwhile, more than tripled capital expenditures in 2017 to $75 million, making it one of the few coal producers investing in new U.S. mines. The company went public in February 2017 at a tough time for the industry. Those spending increases far outpace the broader sector. Overall, the U.S. coal industry increased capital spending in 2017 by about 27 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of filings from publicly-traded miners - a rebound from years of steep declines, targeted mainly at sustaining operations rather than expanding. Many individual coal firms have cut back capital spending. “They’re spending as much as they need to, to maintain production,” said analyst John Bridges of JP Morgan. U.S. coal production is expected to dip 6 percent in 2018 to 738 million tons, down from 1.17 billion tons a decade ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Ramaco’s spending reflects its opening of five new coal mines in the past twelve months in West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, said Randall Atkins, Ramaco’s executive chairman. The company expects to produce more than 2 million tons of coal in 2018 from less than 600,000 in 2017. The company said the downturn in the U.S. thermal coal industry has little to do with its business. It and other metallurgical coal producers are enjoying robust demand from steel producers around the globe. “Met coal is a proxy for steel, which is in turn a proxy for a nation’s GDP,” Atkins said. “The world finds itself economically in a good place.” He said Trump’s steel tariffs could shift some of the demand for metallurgical coal to the domestic market, but that foreign demand for U.S. exports also remains strong. Ramaco’s share price has been volatile since launching last year. It is trading at about $6.80, up from about $4 late last year after strong earnings estimates. But that’s only about half of its share price last year, in part because one of its new mining projects was delayed. Most miners producing coal for electricity are getting battered, meanwhile, by cheap natural gas and increasingly stringent pollution controls. Consol is betting it can generate hefty profits from a smart play on the downturn. It plans to serve “very large, retrofitted coal plants that compete well against natgas and which are going to be running at a higher capacity as other units are retired,” said CFO Khani. Those plants are currently running at only about 70 percent capacity, he said, providing room for growth. The EIA predicts that coal-fired generators that remain open could operate above 70 percent capacity for decades as other aging plants close. Industry-wide, plants are using less than 60 percent of their capacity now. Consol - whose shares are up to about $31 a share from about $22 late last year - supplies East Coast power generating companies including Dominion, Southern, Duke and DTE. Both Consol and Ramaco applaud the Trump administration’s pro-coal stance, but their reasons for optimism lie elsewhere. “There has been no game-changing legislation that would allow for increasing domestic demand for U.S. coal,” said Ramaco’s Atkins.

2018-05-02,"PARIS (Reuters) - Reden Solar, a niche solar energy player backed by private equity funds, is looking to buy solar projects to take advantage of a government push to boost renewable energy in France. France has been a laggard in renewables as its relies on nuclear for about three quarters of its electricity needs. But this could change now President Emmanuel Macron has made solar energy the focus of French renewable energy policies.  Against this backdrop, Reden hopes to grow quickly rather than risk being swallowed by big companies like Engie or Total. “With the financial clout of our shareholders we can grow. If a company comes on the market, we could be interested,” Reden CEO Thierry Carcel said.  An IPO is a possibility, though there are no plans currently. Based in Agen, southern France, Reden split off from renewables group Fonroche last year, when infrastructure fund InfraVia bought a 53 percent stake alongside listed investment company Eurazeo, which has 47 percent.  Reden has a 1.7 percent market share of France’s solar market, with 180 megawatts of installed capacity. This puts it in the top ten in a country where market leader EDF Energies Nouvelles’ 290 megawatt accounts for only about 4 percent of total capacity, according to consultancy Finergreen. France had just 7.7 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity installed at the end of 2017 - compared to Germany’s 43 GW.  But state-owned utility EDF plans to build 30 GW by 2035 and the French government has doubled tender volume for solar projects, sparking a race for size among the many small-to medium size companies in the industry. “There are four to six significant players left in France, including Reden. The small ones will be eaten, maybe by Total, maybe by us,” said InfraVia CEO Vincent Levita.  InfraVia - which manages 1.9 billion euros ($2.28 billion) of assets - in 2016 sold stakes in solar firms Soparsol and Soley after holding on to them for about five years.  “We are ready to follow Reden if it makes acquisitions,” said Renaud Haberkorn head of Eurazeo Patrimoine, one of the funds under Eurazeo, which has 15 billion euros under management in total. Finergreen CEO Damien Ricordeau sees rapid consolidation in the next year, with the top 20 solar firms capturing 50 percent of installed capacity.  “Things are moving fast, we expect 2-3 of the top 25 players will disappear by year-end,” Ricordeau said.  Since France’s energy giants have been slow to invest in solar, about the only way to catch up is through M&A.  Engie in 2015 bought Solairedirect. Total in September bought into renewables firm Eren and last month bought power retailer Direct Energie, which itself had just bought solar and wind firm Quadran.

2018-05-02,"* World stocks inch higher as Apple results lift tech shares * Fed likely to keep interest rates steady but signal June hike * Eyes on Fed’s view of economy, inflation outlook * Dollar off 3 1/2-mth high but hems in equities, emerging markets (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Forecast-beating results from the world’s biggest company, Apple, lifted tech shares on Wednesday, putting Wall Street on track for a firmer session despite some trepidation over a Fed meeting later in the day. Expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal more policy tightening ahead kept investors wary of big market moves, especially after currency markets were roiled this week by the dollar’s surge to 3 1/2-month highs against a basket of currencies. But the dollar edged back down after Tuesday’s 0.7 percent rise, allowing world stocks to rise after two days of losses , especially following Apple’s 4 percent after-market gains. The world’s biggest company by market capitalisation beat profit and revenue expectations in the first quarter, thanks to robust iPhone sales, and it announced a $100 billion share buyback. Germany-listed Apple shares jumped 5.7 percent and the New York-listed stock was 3.6 percent higher in pre-market trade. “The headline news from Apple on iPhone sales has been taken well and there’s a relief bounce today across Apple supply chain names which had been hit in recent weeks,” said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. The results lifted Europe’s tech index 1.2 percent to a six-week high, led by an 8 percent surge in shares in AMS , provider of the facial recognition technology used in iPhones. Chipmakers STMicroelectronics, Infineon, BE Semiconductor and ASML also gained 1.1 to 3.8 percent, enjoying the positive mood on the sector. U.S. equity futures signalled the S&P500 would open 0.2 percent higher. Futures for the Nasdaq tech benchmark were half a percent higher. Tech gains were less marked in Asia, where markets in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong all closed weaker. Campling said the Apple results had raised some “red flags”, including high inventory levels and a lower average selling price for its handsets. “It’s a strange thing to do, to increase inventory so sharply. There will be more questions about ‘where do we go from here’,” he said. That uncertainty about future profits, alongside the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates, is weighing on other sectors too, even though S&P500 companies posted 10 percent earnings growth in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Oil and metals prices near multi-year highs are a major concern, leaving market players wondering if “perhaps this is as good as it’s going to get,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore. U.S. 10-year yields hovered just below recent four-year highs above 3 percent. German yields, dragged to six-week highs by the U.S. bond selloff, stood just below those levels. The Fed is likely to announce at 1800 GMT that it is holding interest rates steady. But it will probably encourage expectations of a rate increase in June. Those expectations were strengthened after a survey on Tuesday suggested inflationary pressures were building . A hawkish-sounding Fed could further boost the dollar, which has roared higher in recent weeks  erasing its year-to-date losses versus a basket of currencies. The gains came amid signs the Fed will be the only major central bank to raise rates in the coming months. “It is this concern around inflation and the robustness of the U.S. economy that is likely to dominate when the Fed concludes its meeting,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London. “It will offer policymakers a decent opportunity to critique the health of the U.S. economy.” In contrast to the United States, rate rise expectations elsewhere have receded after disappointing economic data. Expectations of a Bank of England rate rise this month have virtually been priced out. The European Central Bank and central banks in Japan, Switzerland and Sweden have all hinted that policy tightening remains some way off. Fresh data confirmed that expectation for the euro zone, showing first-quarter growth at 0.4 percent, below the 0.7 percent quarterly increases seen in the past three quarters . HSBC analysts said the data showed the euro zone was experiencing “a slowdown not a slump” but they added that with inflation staying weak, “there is every reason for the ECB to maintain a dovish stance for the time being”. The euro was flat, staying just off 3 1/2-year lows hit to the dollar on Tuesday. Reporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Masayuki

The company also predicted another record profit for the current financial year, which kicked off last month. Japanese trading houses are enjoying their best profits in several years, driven by higher prices for commodities from metals and coking coal to oil and natural gas. “The biggest growth came from our metal division which benefited from higher coal prices, dividend from our Colombia’s coal mine and strong trade in our metal products units,” CFO Tsuyoshi Hachimura told an earnings news conference. Non-resource segments, which account for 80 percent of Itochu’s profit, including U.K. tyre sales, Indonesia’s natural rubber operation and its pulp business in Brazil and Finland, along with food and retail in Japan, also lent support, he added. Itochu’s net profit for the year ended March 31 came to 400.33 billion yen ($3.7 billion), marking a record for the second straight year. That came in line with its own forecast of 400 billion yen, but fell short of a mean estimate of 432 billion yen among 9 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, sending its shares down by 2.6 percent. Tokyo’s overall stock market slid 0.2 percent on Wednesday. The results were affected by large one-off losses booked in the January-March quarter, including a 29 billion yen impairment loss on its stake in C.P. Pokphand Co. Ltd, a Hong-Kong listed agri-food company which faced falling pork prices due to China’s decision to cut imports. For the year until the end of March 2019, Itochu forecast a record net profit of 450 billion yen, beating a mean estimate of 431 billion yen among 9 analysts. It also forecast a record annual dividend of 74 yen per share for this year, up from 70 yen for the year just ended. “We are aiming at third consecutive year of record profit through expanding and evolving existing businesses as well as aggressively promoting next-generation businesses,” CEO Masahiro Okafuji said, pointing to projects using new technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). $1 = 109.7400 yen

2018-05-02,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil output stood at 10.97 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, unchanged from an 11-month high in March and above a target set by a deal with OPEC on curbing output, Energy Ministry data showed on Wednesday.  Russia agreed to cut oil production by 300,000 bpd from the 11.247 million bpd level it reached in October 2016, the baseline for reductions under a pact with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers.  The deal is valid until the end of the year. OPEC and some non-OPEC countries, including Russia, will gather in Vienna in June to review the deal.  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has said a joint organization for cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries may be set up once the oil deal expires at the end of 2018. Russia’s total output for April reached 44.878 million tonnes versus 46.39 million tonnes in March. Output by Rosneft (ROSN.MM), the biggest producer among listed firms, edged up by 0.1 percent from March, while production at Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM), Russia’s fastest growing oil producer, rose by 0.9 percent. The gains were offset by smaller producers, whose combined output fell by 0.9 percent. Russian oil pipeline exports in April rose to 4.367 million bpd from 4.163 million bpd in March. Gas production was at 61.86 billion cubic meters (bcm) last month, or 2.06 bcm a day, versus 65.68 bcm in March.

Forecast-beating results from U.S. tech giant Apple helped lift shares in technology shares worldwide, but with investor focus firmly on the Fed, equity futures were tipping only a marginally firmer open for Wall Street later in the day. Currency markets have been in the limelight this week, with the dollar roaring higher to erase all year-to-date losses versus a basket of currencies. It stands now at 3-1/2 month highs on growing signs the Fed will be the only major central bank to raise interest rates in the coming months. In contrast to the United States, where inflation and growth indicators have generally surprised to the upside, rate rise expectations elsewhere have receded after a string of disappointing economic data. Expectations of a Bank of England rate hike this month have virtually been priced out, while the European Central Bank as well as central banks in Japan, Switzerland and Sweden have all hinted that policy tightening remains some way off. The Fed should announce at 1800 GMT that it is holding interest rates steady but will likely encourage expectations of an increase in borrowing costs in June. Those expectations were strengthened after a survey on Tuesday suggested inflationary pressures were building. “It is this concern around inflation and the robustness of the U.S. economy that is likely to dominate when the Fed concludes its meeting,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London. “It will offer policymakers a decent opportunity to critique the health of the U.S. economy.” That dollar eased slightly, however, after two days of robust gains, as the euro firmed 0.3 percent off 3-1/2-month lows hit on Tuesday. But world stocks remained under pressure, eking out a meagre 0.16 percent rise after two days of hefty losses. That was despite a stronger close for Wall Street, driven by optimism over trade issues and generally buoyant company results . Shares in Apple rose 4 percent in after-market trade after its results exceeded expectations, especially in smart-phone sales. Apple shares listed in Germany surged almost 6 percent and were some 3.6 percent higher in pre-market trade. Its results also helped European equities almost half a percent higher. European tech firms, including Apple suppliers such as AMS rose strongly, with a tech shares index hitting a six-week peak. The tech giant’s forecast-beating results are the icing on the cake for U.S. companies on the S&P500 index, which have posted first-quarter earnings growth around 10 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. But markets have reacted cautiously due to concerns for the profits outlook, given cost pressures stemming from oil and metals prices hitting multi-year highs in recent weeks. Market participants may be starting to wonder that “perhaps this is as good as it’s going to get,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore. Stock markets are also nervous about the recent rise in U.S. bond yields, with 10-year yields at 2.99 percent, just below recent four-year highs above 3 percent. German yields, dragged to six-week highs by the U.S. bond selloff, stood just below those levels. Markets are awaiting first-quarter growth data - a number drawing more attention than usual, because of recent signs of slowdown. Economists polled by Reuters predicted 2.5 percent year-on-year growth versus a 2.7 percent increase in the previous quarter. “National GDPs released so far point to a sharper slowdown in Q1 than forecast,” analysts at Mizuho said in a note.

He rose to be editor of Armenian newspaper Haykakan Zhamanak. * During the 2008 presidential campaign, Pashinyan aligned himself with Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia’s first president since it became an independent state in 1991, who was making an unsuccessful comeback bid. * Pashinyan was imprisoned in June 2009 on charges of fomenting unrest during post-election protests that turned violent. Pashinyan was sentenced to four years in prison. He was released two years later under an amnesty. * In a 2017 parliamentary election, Pashinyan was elected a member of the national assembly. * Pashinyan emerged as the leader of a protest movement after Sarksyan, forced to step down as president because of constitutional term limits, announced he would seek to become prime minister instead. After days of mass protests, Sarksyan announced he was quitting the prime minister’s post. * Pashinyan has not questioned Armenia’s geopolitical alignment with Russia under Sarksyan and his criticism has focused on domestic issues such as corruption and poverty. * In public appearances, he often wears a camouflage T-shirt and cap, though he swapped that outfit for a jacket and tie on Tuesday when he asked parliament to choose him as the next prime minister.

2018-05-02," LONDON (Reuters) - Rising oil prices over the last two years have put the issue of demand destruction back on the agenda, as producers, traders and analysts try to estimate how consumers will respond. Demand destruction always becomes a topic of discussion during this stage of the price cycle, and the current discussion resembles previous episodes of high and rising prices in 2005-2008 and 2011-2014. Brent prices have surged by $47 per barrel (170 percent) from their low point in early 2016 and are now trading close to $75 per barrel. Over the same period, weighted-average U.S. gasoline pump prices have risen by almost $1.13 per gallon (61 percent) and now stand just a few cents below $3 per gallon. Crude and gasoline prices are still well below the levels of $115 per barrel and $3.80 per gallon where they stood just before oil prices started slumping at the end of June 2014. But crude and fuels are no longer particularly cheap and most traders and oil exporting nations expect prices to increase further over the next year. In real terms, oil prices are close to the average level for the whole of the last cycle from late 1998 through early 2016. As the price-cycle matures and prices move towards their next peak, the focus on consumer responses is set to intensify. In an early sign of political sensitivity in consuming countries, U.S. President Donald Trump blamed OPEC for rising oil prices via a message on his Twitter account on April 20. “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted”, the president wrote with his customary directness. In contrast, OPEC officials have indicated they see no adverse impact on oil consumption as a result of price increases so far. “I have not seen any impact on demand with current prices. We have seen prices significantly higher in the past – twice as much as where we are today,” Saudi Arabia’s oil minister told reporters in Jeddah. “Reduced energy intensity and higher productivity globally of energy input levels leads me to think that there is capacity to absorb higher prices,” the minister said on April 20. This part of the cycle is normally characterised by a game of ‘guess the threshold at which rising prices start to destroy oil demand’. In recent weeks, some analysts have suggested demand destruction will begin if and when prices rise above $80 per barrel while others put the threshold as high as $100. Others express the same idea by suggesting $3 per gallon or even $4 is the psychologically important limit for U.S. motorists. But identifying a specific price threshold is probably the wrong way to think about the issue of prices and consumption. In reality, there is a continuum of consumer responses to price - ranging from demand stimulation to demand destruction. The lower prices fall and the longer they are expected to stay there, the more consumption tends to be stimulated. The higher prices rise and the longer they are predicted to stay up, the more consumption tends to be destroyed. The response of consumption to prices is continuous but highly non-linear. The response also takes time to materialise, as consumers slowly adjust their behaviour and buy new equipment, and it takes even longer to appear in the official consumption statistics due to reporting delays. Adding to the complexity, oil consumption is also responsive to other factors, including economic growth and incomes; car ownership and vehicle fleet growth; average miles travelled and average miles per gallon. Some of these factors are themselves more or less related to oil prices, at different timescales, which makes the analysis even more complicated. For example, oil prices have an impact on choices about fuel economy when new vehicles are purchased. As a result it is notoriously difficult to estimate the price-elasticity of oil demand and economists have generated widely varying estimates. But the bottom line is that oil consumption does respond to price changes and the response is not geared to any particular threshold. The relationship between prices and oil consumption is evident in the global statistics, at least for the high-income countries in the OECD, though it is not so clear for low and middle-income countries outside the OECD. Oil consumption in non-OECD countries has increased every year since 1970, with the single exception of 1993. (For a chartbook, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2I6tESb) In these countries, rising consumption has been driven by fast economic growth, rising household incomes and increasing vehicle ownership, which has dominated and masked any price effects. By contrast, in the OECD, growth in incomes and vehicle ownership has been more moderate and the impact of prices on consumption is readily apparent. OECD oil consumption fell in 1973-74, 1980-83, 2006-2009, 2011-2012 and 2014, all periods associated with high real oil prices. Conversely, OECD consumption rose very rapidly between 1970 and 1973 and again between 1986 and 1999, when real prices were relatively low. There are some nuances, including the elimination of oil from heating and power generation during the 1970s and 1980s, and the complicated interaction between the oil shocks and recessions. But the basic relationship between prices and consumption for the OECD is clear. Oil prices have not usually risen high enough to reduce total global demand because non-OECD consumption has continued growing. But high prices tend to temper demand growth through their impact on OECD consumption. The same basic relationship can be traced between U.S. gasoline prices, traffic volumes and gasoline consumption, punctuated by the occasional recession. The decline in gasoline prices contributed to a notable acceleration in U.S. gasoline consumption growth in 2015-2016 compared with the preceding years. But gasoline consumption was flat in 2017 and is expected to grow by just 30,000 barrels per day in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, April 2018). REAR-VIEW MIRROR The escalation of oil prices since the start of 2016 has probably started to restrain consumption growth (compared with a baseline in which prices had remained at $30 per barrel). So far, the demand restraint from increasing prices has been offset by synchronised global growth, especially in the middle-income countries that account for a rising share of oil use. If prices continue to increase, however, there will come a point at which consumption growth starts to slow in a much more pronounced fashion. Unfortunately, experience suggests the extent of the demand deceleration will only become apparent after it is already well underway. And the slowdown in consumption growth will continue even once prices stop rising, given the long lags in the system. Between 2011 and 2014, when oil prices averaged over $100 per barrel, declining consumption in the OECD and slowing consumption growth in the non-OECD created the conditions for the last oil slump. If oil prices continue to increase, as most hedge fund managers and oil-exporting nations expect, the same scenario could play out again between 2019 and 2021. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-05-02,"LISBON, May 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world is moving too slowly to meet targets to provide electric power and clean cooking to everyone on the planet by 2030, with progress on using less-polluting fuels in the kitchen especially poor, international agencies said on Wednesday. The number of people living without access to electricity in 2016 was a billion, or 13 percent of the global population, with the vast majority in rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, new data released by the World Bank, the United Nations and other organisations showed. Unless efforts to get power to hard-to-reach areas are ramped up, an estimated 674 million people - about 8 percent of the world’s population - will still live without electricity in 2030, they said in a report. In 2016, 3 billion people - more than 40 percent of the world’s population  - did not have access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Indoor air pollution from burning wood, dung, kerosene and other dirty fuels causes over 4 million deaths a year, with women and children at highest risk, the report said. “We must be more ambitious in harnessing the power of renewable energy to meet sustainable development and climate goals, and take more deliberate action to achieve a sustainable energy future,” said Adnan Z. Amin, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency, which worked on the report. Among the global development goals now being pursued are universal access to electricity and clean cooking, as well as a doubling of the rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and a substantial increase in the share of renewables in the world’s energy mix. The Energy Progress Report, released at a two-day forum in Lisbon tackling how to meet the targets, highlighted that some countries - particularly in East Africa - have made big strides in getting electric power to their people in recent years. Vivien Foster, global lead for energy economics with the World Bank, noted that in sub-Saharan Africa the number of people living without electricity had begun to fall for the first time in history. Previously, efforts to add power capacity were not able to keep up with population growth. “This has finally reversed, and we think it may be a turning point for electrification on the continent,” Foster told reporters. Progress has been fuelled by a jump in off-grid solar power, driven by a rise in “pay-as-you-go” systems in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania, where users can make payments via mobile phones. At least 30 million people around the world are benefiting from solar home systems, yet only about “a dozen” countries are embracing this revolution, World Bank experts said. “If more countries would turn to this resource, we think electrification could accelerate even more rapidly,” said Foster, noting the need for governments to develop clean energy markets and ensure good-quality products. A shift towards cleaner cooking is lagging partly because it lacks ministries that champion the cause in many places, she added. Markets for modern cookstoves also remain undeveloped. “We see it being systematically neglected by policy makers around the world,” she said. Progress on boosting use of renewable energy also is set to fall short of the 2030 target, the report said. As of 2015, the world got 17.5 percent of all energy that goes to end users, such as households, industry and agriculture, from renewables. Solar and wind have become far cheaper, allowing them to compete with conventional power sources such as coal. But electricity accounted for only 20 percent of energy consumption in 2015, said the report, flagging the need to speed up the transition to cleaner energy in transport and heating. Energy efficiency is improving, with economic growth outpacing increases in energy use in all regions except for Western Asia from 2010-2015, the report said. That means countries - and particularly industries - are using less energy to produce more. Transport and residential buildings have not shown the same rate of improvement in energy efficiency. Several wealthy developed countries such as Japan and the United States may have reached a peak in energy use, the report said, while among large developing countries, China and Indonesia are rapidly becoming more energy efficient. ""To meet 2030 targets, we must make every unit of energy work harder,"" said Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All, a body set up by the United Nations.

2018-05-02,"(Repeats Tuesday’s story with no changes to text) * Brudermueller prefers ‘everything under one roof’ * Says focus will be on science and technology * Strategy update planned for end of year * Chemical industry has seen several split-ups By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss FRANKFURT, May 1 (Reuters) - The incoming boss of BASF has thrown his weight behind the chemical titan’s contentious strategy of keeping divergent businesses folded into one company, at a time when its major rivals such as DowDuPont are breaking themselves up. The comments from Martin Brudermueller, who will take over as CEO on Friday, provide clarity on a key strategic issue that is dividing investors, in marked contrast to predecessor Kurt Bock who would not be drawn on which path he favoured. The German group has grown from a 19th century indigo dye workshop to a diversified juggernaut worth $95 billion. It is the only major Western chemicals player banking on an integrated value chain - which it dubs “Verbund” - where a company owns businesses throughout the production process. “We often hear the Verbund getting criticised for being too rigid. That’s not true,” said 56-year-old Brudermueller. “If you have everything under one roof, you can coordinate things much better, that is the sense in which we will develop it further. You wouldn’t normally want to sell attractive businesses that are growing,” he told Reuters and other reporters in remarks released late on Tuesday. At its Ludwigshafen headquarters and at five other hubs abroad, BASF runs close-knit networks of chemical reactors that churn out products as diverse as basic commodities, coatings, vitamins, drug ingredients and engineering plastics. Bock, when asked in February whether BASF would continue to have diverse businesses under one roof or was considering other options, said the company might learn from what rivals did but did not say which path he favoured. Both strategies have potential advantages; break-ups can create more focused individual companies and allow stronger units to attract investors unshackled from weaker ones, while an integrated model can reduce costs. U.S. rival DowDuPont is planning to break up into a Materials Science division that relies on in-house basic petrochemicals plants and a Specialty Products unit selling more differentiated and complex materials. A third spin-off will focus on agriculture. In other recent separation deals in the industry, Bayer spun off its Covestro plastics unit and is now selling down the shares, Air Products spun-off specialty chemicals unit Versum and coatings group Akzo Nobel is selling its specialty chemicals division. BASF competes with DowDuPont in areas such as pesticides, engineering plastics, nutrition, insulation foams and petrochemicals. Its rival’s three-way split will restore BASF’s position as the world’s largest chemical maker but some investors and analysts would rather see it lose that crown. Patrick Jahnke, portfolio manager at Deka Investments, which owns BASF stock, said he favoured the firm selling its upstream petrochemical assets, saying the benefits of physical proximity to downstream operations could be shared with a new owner. “You can sell the assets but the factory remains in place,” Jahnke said. “There are many who would pay a high price (for upstream BASF assets). Private equity would run the business with higher debt and optimised for cash flows and would arrive at a better profitability,” he added. Upstream refers to basic petrochemicals, and downstream to more complex specialty chemicals. A portfolio manager at a top 20 BASF shareholder, who declined to be named as they are not authorised to comment publicly on the investment, also saw the merits of a break-up. “Downstream, speciality chems could work separately,” the manager said. “To de-clutter and reduce complexity ... tends to increase multiples and returns, but German companies are not well known for it.” BASF has said that sharing logistics, excess energy and by-products within its chemical complexes saves it more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) per year. There are also supporters of the integrated approach among BASF’s shareholders. Arne Rautenberg, of Union Investment, said there was still a lot of value in the model. “The results this year wouldn’t have been good without the basic chemicals assets,” he said. Any move to separating them from the rest “would very much surprise me and I wouldn’t be excited”, he added. BASF has been a tale of two sectors over the past year. Supply bottlenecks at rivals and strong industrial demand have flung BASF’s basic chemicals business into a surprise upward cycle. Meanwhile, margins of its more complex, specialty products, the group’s designated growth drivers, have been squeezed by higher raw materials prices. “If upstream strength dissipates and the downstream margin struggles continue, then we think investor focus will turn to portfolio questions,” HSBC analyst Sriharsha Pappu said in a recent research note. If allowed to strike out on their own, BASF units making construction chemicals, coatings and catalytic converters could bolster their earnings and fetch better trading multiples on the stock market, the HSBC analyst said. Brudermueller, a BASF veteran, is currently chief technology officer and deputy CEO at the firm, which is due to report first-quarter results on Friday. He said that his focus would be on new technologies after taking over from CEO Bock, who by contrast had been the company’s finance chief before taking the helm and has a background in business administration. The CEO-designate cited cathode materials for car batteries as one area of focus, and also using BASF’s new supercomputer to speed up discovery of new compounds. “The fact that I have a background in technology and science will result in us having a change in perspective,” he said, adding that he would provide an update on BASF’s strategy towards the end of the year.

2018-05-02,"(Repeats story from Tuesday) * War-torn state only recently drew investment * Feud in Gulf region drives new interest * Gulf rivalries draw in Somalia’s biggest investor Turkey By Maggie Fick NAIROBI, May 1 (Reuters) - A battle for access to seaports is underway in one of the world’s unlikeliest places: Somalia, now caught up in a regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on one side, with Qatar backed by Turkey on the other. At stake: not just the busy waters off the Somali coast but the future stability of the country itself. Somalia has been at war for decades and until the last few years it has struggled to attract foreign investment. But rivalries in the nearby Arabian peninsula are resulting in serious inflows into Somalia. A year ago, a company owned by the United Arab Emirates government signed a $336 million contract to expand the port of Bosaso, north of Mogadishu in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland. Less than a year before that, another UAE-owned firm took control of the Berbera port in the breakaway northern region of Somaliland and pledged up to $440 million to develop it. In March, Ethiopia took a stake in the port for an undisclosed sum. At the same time, Turkey, an ally of UAE rival Qatar, is ramping up a multi-billion dollar investment push in Somalia. A Turkish company has run the Mogadishu port since 2014, while other Turkish firms have built roads, schools, and hospitals. The rivalries have intensified since June, when the most powerful Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and including the UAE, cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Iran and Islamist militants. That Middle Eastern feud is driving the desire to control the Horn of Africa and its waters, according to diplomats, businessmen, scholars and Somali officials. Somalia is close to vital oil routes and its ports could also serve landlocked Ethiopia, which has a population of 100 million. Gulf nations have had trade and religious ties with Somalia for centuries, but those relationships are now up in the air as new rivalries emerge. “Somalia has been caught in the middle of this effort to try to expand influence, commercial and military, along the coast,” said Rob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. Saudi Arabia and the UAE increasingly view the Somali coastline - and Djibouti and Eritrea to the north - as their “western security flank”, according to a senior western diplomat in the Horn of Africa region. Qatar and Turkey, whose investments are almost all in Mogadishu, are focussed on supporting President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. He and his chief of staff are widely viewed in Somalia and by western diplomats as loyal to Doha after receiving funds for their 2017 election campaign. A Qatari official told Reuters Doha had provided $385 million in infrastructure, education and humanitarian assistance to the central Somali government. The official said making deals directly with regional governments in Somalia, as the UAE has done, undermined the central government. Somali finance minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh agreed. “The Gulf region has a lot of money and if they want to invest in Somalia we welcome them with open arms,” he told Reuters. “But it’s a question of going through the right doors.” The federal government in Mogadishu has long been at odds with the semi-autonomous regions of Puntland and Somaliland. The latter operates virtually as an independent state and has for years sought to secede from Somalia, but has not won international recognition. Less than a decade ago there was virtually no commercial interest in Somalia. That began to change in 2011 when al Qaeda-backed al Shabaab militants retreated from Mogadishu. Months later, Turkey launched famine relief operations, opening the door for projects that now make it Somalia’s biggest foreign investor. The government hopes new investment, especially in infrastructure, can help the country rebuild. Better tax collection is boosting government revenues, but this only covers public sector salaries. Huge amounts of capital are needed for roads, schools and other basics. Middle Eastern companies and charities could provide some of it. However, the money could also destabilise the country further by deepening tensions between the central government, aligned with Turkey and Qatar, and Puntland and Somaliland, which both receive money from the UAE. “These investments are having a detrimental effect on our political stability and worsening the relationship between our federal government and the regions,” said former national security adviser Hussein Sheikh-Ali. “This could cause a constitutional crisis that only al Shabaab will benefit from.” The Gulf crisis has already deepened rifts in Somalia. The central government has stayed neutral, to the annoyance of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which Puntland and Somaliland have backed against Qatar. “Getting out of this mess is very difficult,” Sheikh-Ali said. “Without unity we cannot.” The Somali presidency and the UAE government did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Western nations fear the Gulf rivalries playing out in Somalia could sideline their multi-billion dollar, U.N.-led efforts to build a functional Somali army to fight Shabaab before the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers in 2020. Political crises between Mogadishu and the regional authorities are undermining government efforts to strengthen financial systems and embark on other core tasks of a state, diplomats say. The Gulf rivalry is also being felt on the ground in Somalia. In mid-April, Somalia and the UAE ended military cooperation. Since 2014, the UAE had trained and paid the salaries of Somali troops in Mogadishu and built an anti-piracy force in Puntland. Hundreds of weapons were looted from the training centre in Mogadishu as it shut down. This came after Somali security forces seized nearly $10 million flown in from the UAE to pay soldiers and temporarily held the plane which brought the cash. The UAE also closed a hospital that offered free care. Last week Puntland officials travelled to Dubai to meet UAE counterparts and P&O, the state firm developing its port. “Investing millions of dollars in Somalia at this critical juncture in history is very important for us,” Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said. Similarly, Somaliland officials hosted UAE diplomats last week to discuss “enhancing bilateral ties”. “For Somalis themselves, this kind of geopolitical game of chess, where Somalia is solely a proxy conflict to the trouble in the Gulf, this is obviously bad news,” said Harry Verhoeven, professor at Georgetown University in Qatar.

The Fed is seen set to hold interest rates steady this week but will likely encourage expectations that it will lift borrowing costs in June on the back of rising inflation and low unemployment. The U.S. central bank is due to announce its decision at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.2 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 is seen opening up 20 points, while Germany’s DAX is expected to open 20 points lower, according to financial bookmakers. Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said that in addition to focusing on the Fed’s policy statement equity investors may be turning cautious on the outlook for corporate profits, given potential cost pressures from recent rises in oil prices. Market participants may be starting to wonder that “perhaps this is as good as it’s going to get,” Innes said, referring to corporate profits. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.25 percent on Tuesday, helped by optimism over U.S. trade negotiations. Apple’s shares rose about 4 percent after the closing bell. The company beat revenue and profit expectations in its March quarter, with its shares ending the regular session up 2.3 percent. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27 percent while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 percent. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies traded near a four-month high set on Tuesday, with the dollar having surged into positive territory for 2018 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision. The dollar index eased 0.1 percent to 92.403. It had risen on Tuesday to a peak near 92.570, its strongest level in nearly four months. The dollar was underpinned by the outlook for a strong U.S. economy amid signs of slowdown elsewhere, especially in Europe. The euro zone’s economic momentum has been faltering and that seems to have prompted market players to trim their long positions in the euro, said Hirofumi Suzuki, an economist for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. Against this backdrop, the dollar-buying trend will probably persist for a while, Suzuki added. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2002. On Tuesday, the common currency had touched a low of $1.1981, its weakest level since Jan. 11. Against the yen, the dollar struck its highest level in nearly three months at 109.92 yen in early Asian trade. It later pulled back to 109.78 yen, down 0.1 percent. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was steady on the day at 2.979 percent. Last week, the U.S. 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, had set a four-year high of 3.035 percent as bond prices fell on worries about the growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from rising oil prices.

2018-05-02,"TOKYO, May 2 (Reuters) - Japanese trading house Itochu Corp on Wednesday said its annual net profit jumped 13.7 percent to a record level in the last financial year, boosted by higher coal prices and a strong performance in its food and retail operations. The company also predicted another record-profit for the current financial year, which kicked off last month. Itochu’s net profit for the year ended March 31 came to 400.33 billion yen ($3.7 billion), marking a record for the second straight year. That was in line with its own forecast of 400 billion yen, but fell short of a mean estimate of 432 billion yen among 9 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results were affected by large one-off losses booked in the January-March quarter, including a 29 billion yen impairment loss on its stake in C.P. Pokphand Co.

2018-05-02," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The new Shanghai crude oil futures have been trading for just over a month and have so far managed to build up reasonably strong volumes, but this success may only mask some wider concerns. The yuan-denominated contracts were launched on March 26 by the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) and are enjoying trading volumes averaging around 80,000 a day, with the open interest around 16,000. The INE contract offers seven grades of Middle Eastern and domestic crude for delivery to various locations in China, the world’s largest oil importer. While the contract is well-designed to match China’s crude buying, it is structured so that delivery is for several months ahead, making it difficult to compare to other crude oil benchmarks, such as Brent, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s Oman. The Shanghai contract includes a freight component and a currency factor, making it challenging for traders to work out arbitrage opportunities against the other benchmarks. Nonetheless, the volumes and open interest compare very favourably to those of the DME contract, which is perhaps the best comparison given that Oman crude is similar in quality to the grades being offered by the INE. Daily front-month volumes for the DME contract are usually between 3,000 and 5,000, well below the levels that Shanghai futures are achieving. However, both are dwarfed by Brent and WTI, both of which trade in the hundreds of thousands of contracts every day. It’s also the nature of the volumes on the INE that may be cause for concern, with trade dominated by Chinese players, including the major state-owned refiners, smaller traders and retail investors. There is nothing wrong with this mix per se, but the INE contract may end up like the iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange insofar as they attract huge volumes, but mainly from domestic players who respond more to local news flows than market fundamentals. This raises the risk that the INE contract effectively becomes a Chinese domestic vehicle for investors to “play” in the crude oil market. If this does happen, it would undermine the aim of establishing Shanghai as a major pricing hub for crude oil. So far, it appears that participation by Western oil companies, traders and investors in the INE has been limited. That’s not to say there isn’t interest among Western players in the Shanghai market, but it seems that they are being cautious as how best to benefit from participating. One of the logical ways to participate would be to hedge Middle East crude against the delivered price in China, and to pocket any arbitrage difference. This means the price of Oman futures would have to be below those in Shanghai, and other costs such as currency transactions and freight would also have to be factored in. The third-month Oman contract, which is for July delivery, ended at $69.33 a barrel on Tuesday. This is the contract most suitable for comparison to the front-month INE future, which is for delivery in September. The Shanghai future ended at 442.5 yuan a barrel on April 27, with there being no trade on Monday and Tuesday due to public holidays. This equates to about $69.87 a barrel, meaning there is only a tiny premium of 54 cents a barrel currently between the INE and DME equivalent contracts. This isn’t enough to cover the cost of freight and currency conversion, meaning the arbitrage window between Dubai and Shanghai is currently closed. Of course, this won’t always be the case, but market participants outside China appear to be adopting a wait-and-see attitude when it comes to the INE contract. Having a dollar-denominated mirror contract for the INE futures, perhaps based in the regional trading hub of Singapore, may boost interest in the Shanghai futures. But for now, the initial success of the Shanghai contract is tempered by signs that it may not be working as intended, and that it’s still some way from achieving the goal of becoming the benchmark for crude trade in Asia. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-crude-china/column-shanghai-crude-oil-futures-look-successful-but-issues-lurk-russell-idUKL3N1S91LJ,02 May 2018,"The new Shanghai

2018-05-02,"(Reuters) - U.S. electric utilities are expected to shut hundreds more of their coal-fired power generators in the coming years, extending a long trend away from coal and toward natural gas that has cast a pall over the mining industry. But not every U.S. coal company sees a bleak future.  Ramaco Resources (METC.O), which produces coal for steel mills, and Consol Energy (CEIX.N), which supplies coal to larger power plants, have ramped up investments even as the industry shrinks. President Donald Trump has promised to revive the coal sector by stripping away burdensome regulation. But the two companies say their confidence stems more from market forces than any policy. Their bullish bets illustrate how pockets of profitable growth can survive in troubled industries facing almost certain decline. Ramaco, for example, expects global demand for metallurgical coal to rise in step with economic growth, despite the slump in U.S. demand for the type of coal used in electric power generators. And Consol says it has found a way to turn the rapid decline of coal-fired power into a strength: It has cultivated a clientele that owns big generators that are not expected to shut down anytime soon - making them likely to take over business from rivals that do close. “We can sell every ounce of coal we can produce,” said David Khani, Consol’s Chief Financial Officer. “This isn’t true for everyone.” Consol, which mines thermal coal for power plants in Pennsylvania, boosted capital spending last year by 50 percent to $81.4 million, and it aims to bump that to $125 million in 2018, according to its filings. Ramaco, meanwhile, more than tripled capital expenditures in 2017 to $75 million, making it one of the few coal producers investing in new U.S. mines. The company went public in February 2017 at a tough time for the industry. Those spending increases far outpace the broader sector. Overall, the U.S. coal industry increased capital spending in 2017 by about 27 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of filings from publicly-traded miners - a rebound from years of steep declines, targeted mainly at sustaining operations rather than expanding. Many individual coal firms have cut back capital spending. “They’re spending as much as they need to, to maintain production,” said analyst John Bridges of JP Morgan. U.S. coal production is expected to dip 6 percent in 2018 to 738 million tons, down from 1.17 billion tons a decade ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Ramaco’s spending reflects its opening of five new coal mines in the past twelve months in West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, said Randall Atkins, Ramaco’s executive chairman.  The company expects to produce more than 2 million tons of coal in 2018 from less than 600,000 in 2017.  The company said the downturn in the U.S. thermal coal industry has little to do with its business. It and other metallurgical coal producers are enjoying robust demand from steel producers around the globe. “Met coal is a proxy for steel, which is in turn a proxy for a nation’s GDP,” Atkins said. “The world finds itself economically in a good place.” He said Trump’s steel tariffs could shift some of the demand for metallurgical coal to the domestic market, but that foreign demand for U.S. exports also remains strong. Ramaco’s share price has been volatile since launching last year. It is trading at about $6.80, up from about $4 late last year after strong earnings estimates. But that’s only about half of its share price last year, in part because one of its new mining projects was delayed. Most miners producing coal for electricity are getting battered, meanwhile, by cheap natural gas and increasingly stringent pollution controls. Consol is betting it can generate hefty profits from a smart play on the downturn. It plans to serve “very large, retrofitted coal plants that compete well against natgas and which are going to be running at a higher capacity as other units are retired,” said CFO Khani.  Those plants are currently running at only about 70 percent capacity, he said, providing room for growth.  The EIA predicts that coal-fired generators that remain open could operate above 70 percent capacity for decades as other aging plants close. Industry-wide, plants are using less than 60 percent of their capacity now. Consol - whose shares are up to about $31 a share from about $22 late last year - supplies East Coast power generating companies including Dominion (D.N), Southern (SO.N), Duke (DUK.N) and DTE (DTE.N). Both Consol and Ramaco applaud the Trump administration’s pro-coal stance, but their reasons for optimism lie elsewhere. “There has been no game-changing legislation that would allow for increasing domestic demand for U.S. coal,” said Ramaco’s Atkins.

2018-05-02,"NEW DELHI, May 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As the pre-monsoon summer heat takes hold in New Delhi, two things are as inevitable as 40-degree-Celsius days: power cuts and air pollution from the diesel generators that then kick in. But a team of Indian engineers has figured out away to bring some good from choking generator exhaust: They are capturing it and turning it into ink. “The alarming thing about diesel generators is they are located in the heart of densely populated areas. It’s spitting smoke right there,” said Kushagra Srivastava, one of the three engineers who developed the technology, now installed in Gurgaon, a satellite city of New Delhi, and in the southern city of Chennai. The idea, Srivastava said, came about when he and his co-founders stopped at a sugarcane juice stall on a hot day. They noticed a wall that had turned black behind the stand’s diesel generator, where exhaust emerged from a pipe. They wondered if diesel exhaust might be used to produce paint – and set out to try. The device they came up with, which attaches to generators, captures 90 percent of the soot particles from cooled diesel exhaust. The material can then be sold to ink manufacturers. Their company, Chakr Innovation, has so far installed 50 of the devices for government firms such as Indian Oil, real estate developers and other state government offices, earning more than 11 million rupees ($200,000) in revenue in the first year, Srivastava said. The company has plans to install another 50 devices over the coming year, he said. It has so far sold 500 kg of collected soot, which has been used to create 20,000 litres of ink, he added. Chakr Innovations is not the first start-up to see cash in diesel exhaust. A competitor called Graviky Labs, based in Bangalore, is using similar technology to turn diesel exhaust from vehicles into ink. Srivastava and his co-inventors Arpit Dhupar and Prateek Sachan see themselves as part of a movement towards cleaner air and energy in a country where major cities struggle with choking air. About 1.1 million people a year die from the impacts of air pollution in India, according to a 2015 survey by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute. That is about a quarter of the total number of air pollution deaths worldwide, it said. In New Delhi, levels of the most dangerous particles in the air are sometimes 10 times higher than the safe limit, the survey noted. Srivastava and Dhupar both grew up in New Delhi, which the World Health Organization in 2014 declared the most polluted city in the world. Sachan comes from Allahabad, the third most polluted city in WHO’s 2016 rankings. “Earlier I remember there were a lot less cars on the road, there was a lot less congestion, and a lot more greenery,” said Dhupar, Chakr’s chief technology officer. But as trees were felled and roads widened to accommodate more cars, Dhupar – then in high school – developed chronic respiratory problems. Doctors put him on medication and warned him to stop playing sports. “My problem is, whenever I start to run out of air, the anxiety levels shoot up,” he said. Dhupar said many of his family and friends have also developed long-term respiratory issues. Diesel exhaust contributed to just 2 percent of all air pollution deaths in India in 2015, according to the Health Effects Institute. But in “confined spaces” in urban areas, where many generators are used, it represents a larger risk, said Pankaj Sadavarte, one of the report’s researchers. India has in place policies to monitor and restrict air pollution, but they can be difficult to enforce, experts say. Worries about air pollution are growing, however. Last November, the capital launched its first air quality emergency action plan during a particularly hazardous week when pollution spiked. The government halted construction within the city, raised parking fees to discourage driving and shut schools to keep children indoors. The national Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is drafting a national policy to clean India’s air, though its release has been delayed, said Sunil Dahiya, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace India. ""The air pollution debate and health debate is picking up in India,"" Dahiya said in a telephone interview. “That momentum is forcing the policymakers to make our cities more livable.” (Reporting by Huizhong Wu ; editing by Laurie Goering : (Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.

2018-05-02,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific steady, Nikkei eases 0.2 pct * Fed’s policy statement coming later on Wed * Fed expected to keep interest rates steady * Eyes on Fed’s view of economy, inflation outlook By Masayuki Kitano SINGAPORE, May 2 (Reuters) - Asian equities held steady on Wednesday, while the dollar traded near a four-month high as investors await the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy statement for clues on the future pace of U.S. monetary tightening. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed, while Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.2 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.3 percent. Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said that in addition to focusing on the Fed’s policy statement, equity investors may be turning cautious on the outlook for corporate profits, given potential cost pressures from recent rises in oil prices. Market participants may be starting to wonder that “perhaps this is as good as it’s going to get,” Innes said, referring to corporate profits. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.25 percent on Tuesday on positive comments by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on China, and Mexico’s economy minister on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Apple’s shares rose about 4 percent after the closing bell. The company beat revenue and profit expectations in its March quarter, with its shares ending the regular session up 2.3 percent. Technology sector results so far – at least from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Samsung and SAP – have broadly beaten forecasts for the first quarter, and overall aggregate U.S. earnings growth is tracking seven-year highs of almost 25 percent. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies traded near a four-month high set on Tuesday, with the dollar having surged into positive territory for 2018 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision due on Wednesday. The Fed is seen set to hold interest rates steady this week but will likely encourage expectations that it will lift borrowing costs in June on the back of rising inflation and low unemployment. Investors have all but priced out the chance of a rate hike at the end of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, particularly given its adherence in recent years to only raising rates at meetings that are followed by news conferences. The central bank is due to announce its decision at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is not scheduled to hold a news conference. The dollar held near a four-month high against a basket of major currencies, buoyed by the outlook for a strong U.S. economy and rising yields amid signs of slowdown elsewhere, especially in Europe. The dollar index last traded at 92.437. On Tuesday, it had risen to a high near 92.57, its highest level in nearly four months. Against the yen, the dollar struck its highest level in nearly three months at 109.92 yen in early Asian trade and was last down 0.1 percent at 109.79 yen. The euro held steady at $1.1997, not far from Tuesday’s low of $1.1981, the common currency’s weakest level since Jan. 11. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield eased about 1 basis point in early Asian trade to 2.970 percent. That came after the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose 4 basis points on Tuesday, as bond prices came under pressure ahead of a quarterly refunding announcement. The U.S. Treasury is scheduled to announce its findings from a refunding survey on Wednesday, with analysts projecting an increase in auction sizes, or new issuance at different points on the yield curve. Oil prices slid on Tuesday as the dollar remained near a four-month high, but worries that U.S. President Donald Trump will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal underpinned the market. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery settled down nearly 2 percent on Tuesday, at $67.25 a barrel. Spot gold last stood at $1,307.14. On Tuesday gold had slid to a four-month low of $1,301.51 as the dollar strengthened. Reporting by Masayuki Kitano

2018-05-02,"* U.S. could re-impose sanctions on Iran this month * Iran’s April oil exports hit new record * Surging U.S. supplies cap market By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, lifted by concerns that the United States may re-impose sanctions on major exporter Iran, although soaring U.S. supplies capped gains. Brent crude oil futures were at $73.25 per barrel at 0020 GMT, up 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $67.45 per barrel. Iran re-emerged as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran’s oil exports hit 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, the Oil Ministry’s news agency SHANA reported on Tuesday, a record since the lifting of sanctions, with China and India buying more than half of Iran’s oil. The United States, however, has expressed doubts over Iran’s sincerity in implementing those curbs and President Donald Trump has threatened to re-impose sanctions. Trump will decide by May 12 whether to restore U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which would likely result in a reduction of its oil exports. “As May 12 Iran nuclear deadline nears ... geopolitical developments will continue to drive (oil market) sentiment,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. Despite this generally bullish oil market sentiment, Innes said high U.S. oil supplies were capping prices. Crude inventories rose by 3.4 million barrels to 432.575 million in the week to March 27, according to a report by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday. The rising inventories are in part a result of soaring U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by more than a quarter in the last two years to 10.6 million barrels per day (bpd), making the United States the world’s number two crude oil producer behind only Russia, with 11 million bpd.
