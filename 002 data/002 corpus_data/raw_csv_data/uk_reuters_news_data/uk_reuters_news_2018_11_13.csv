2018-11-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices plunged 7 percent on Tuesday on persistent concerns of oversupply and weakening global demand, causing Wall Street stocks to reverse early gains that were driven by the resumption of trade talks between the United States and China. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX ended lower as energy stocks declined with the fall in prices of Brent and U.S. crude futures.  U.S. crude touched its lowest level in a year, and Brent also extended Monday’s fall, which was triggered when U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on OPEC to not cut supply to prop up prices. Both crude benchmarks have fallen more than 20 percent since peaking at four-year highs in early October. Wall Street stocks reacted sharply to the oil price slump. “The market does not like such a violent move in an asset class,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. “Low oil prices are good for consumers, but they will hurt energy companies, whose earnings estimates have been rising over the past year,” he added, nothing that there could also be a decline in capital spending. U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled down $4.24, or 7.1 percent, to $55.69 a barrel. It was the largest one-day percentage decline for the contract since September 2015. Brent LCOc1 ended down $4.65, or 6.6 percent, to $65.47 a barrel, its largest one-day loss since July. Earlier, U.S. stocks rose after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington had resumed trade talks with China, calling the development “very positive.” The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which has steadily climbed as the U.S.-China trade dispute has escalated, dipped 0.2 percent but remained near a 16-month high reached on Monday. “If you’re looking at market action today, that reflects an unsuredness and lack of direction,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. The pound GBP=D3 rose 0.9 percent to $1.2966 after reports that Britain and the European Union had agreed upon the text of a Brexit agreement and that British Prime Minister Theresa May would hold a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The euro EUR= rose from a 16-month low, last up 0.6 percent to $1.1284.

2018-11-13,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) * Eyes on $7 bln hydrogen market in Asia by 2030 * Production cost seen as biggest hurdle * Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries working to drive down costs * Woodside sees “blue hydrogen” from gas as key to scale By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Australia, the world’s biggest coal exporter and second-biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, wants to build its next big energy industry around exploiting solar and wind power along with brown coal to produce hydrogen. The same fuel used to power rockets into space, hydrogen has untapped energy potential without the downside of the carbon emissions from natural gas and coal. Australia is seeking to supply what could be a $7 billion market for hydrogen to China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore by 2030, according to a report done for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency by consultants ACIL Allen. While initially just a fraction of Australia’s LNG exports, forecast at A$48 billion ($35 billion) in 2019, hydrogen exports could grow the same way that Australia’s LNG industry has over the past 30 years, according to ACIL Allen, the Australian government, and local gas producer Woodside Petroleum. The global drive to cut carbon emissions and the falling cost of wind and solar power has turned hydrogen fuel into an opportunity now after the idea was mooted more than four decades ago. “Many of our traditional gas markets — Japan, Korea — have adopted strategies that put hydrogen and ultimately renewable hydrogen at the core of their energy future. So we want to make sure we’ve got the capability of providing for that market,” Western Australia’s Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan told Reuters. The state on Oct. 25 launched a Renewable Hydrogen Council, including Woodside, French power producer Engie SA, and Norway’s Yara International, to form a plan to use land, wind and solar resources to produce hydrogen. “The development of a hydrogen business is similar to the early days of the LNG business,” said Shaun Gregory, Woodside’s executive vice president for exploration and technology. To reduce global warming, hydrogen could be used in fuel cells for vehicles and manufacturing plants, and could eventually replace natural gas for space heating, water heating and cooking in homes. Output may start through the gasification of brown coal with the hydrogen and carbon dioxide separated out. But eventually wind and solar power would be used to crack water to become the biggest hydrogen source. Currently, hydrogen derived from coal gasification is cheaper to produce than from water. The goal is drive down the costs of a hydrogen cargo by 2030 to a level that Japanese buyers would accept, said Australia’s Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, who is advising the government on a hydrogen strategy. “The biggest potential show-stopper is that we can’t meet the price target,” he told Reuters. Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) is leading a A$500 million demonstration project to produce hydrogen from brown coal from Australia’s largest coal mine, Loy Yang in Victoria. “At this point it is clearly cheaper (than hydrogen from renewables), but in the future they might be the same,” KHI Executive Officer Eiichi Harada told Reuters at the GHGT-14 conference in Melbourne on Oct. 25. Meanwhile, Woodside is working with Korea Gas Corp to potentially produce “blue hydrogen” in a carbon-neutral process of reforming methane from natural gas while eventually shifting to solar or wind to crack water to make “green hydrogen” “We believe blue hydrogen – carbon neutral hydrogen, sourced from gas - is the key to building scale and lowering costs in hydrogen transport and distribution, which will enable an earlier transition to green hydrogen,” Woodside’s Gregory said in an email.

2018-11-13,"Nov 13 (Reuters) - Paradise, California had long prepared for wildfires but only in its worst nightmares did it imagine the kind of “megafire” that last week destroyed most of the town and killed at least 42 people. Born of tinder dry conditions and erratic winds, the “Camp Fire” was the latest California megafire, a huge blaze that burns more intensely and quickly than anything the state has experienced before. In recent years authorities in California have reported an increase in such large, explosive and swiftly spreading wildfires over a virtually year-round fire season. Four out of the five largest fires in California history have occurred in the last six years. Paradise had not seen significant rain for 211 days, and the town, on a ridge in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, was surrounded by a potential bonfire of dry or dead trees following a five-year drought that ended in 2017. Less rain and longer droughts are the major cause of the blazes, which consume more than 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares), according to recent research by the U.S. Forest Service and University of Montana. After a wildfire destroyed 87 homes in Paradise in 2008, the town of 27,000 put evacuation plans in place and fined homeowners if they did not clear brush and prune trees to reduce fire risk. But all it took was some kind of spark on Camp Creek Road, west of Paradise, and “El Diablo” fall winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kph), to unleash the most destructive and deadly wildfire in California history. As the blaze roared west, devouring nearly 6,500 homes, it created its own fire whirlwinds or “firenados,” incinerating an area equivalent to 80 American football fields (100 acres) per minute. “This event was the worst case scenario. It was the event we have feared for a long time,” local sheriff Kory Honea told reporters. This has been one of the state’s worst fire years, with nearly twice the acreage burned so far compared with 2017 in areas managed by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). Former U.S. Forest Service officials such as Jerry Williams say too much emphasis is put on fighting fires instead of accepting that they are a natural part of the environment and minimizing their impact. Forests that for millennia had fire as part of their ecosystems have become choked with growth and unhealthy, and ultimately tinder for megafires, he said. “Every year we set a new record, we invest more in suppression, invest less in mitigation and wonder why we’re not getting on top of it,” Williams, a former director of fire and aviation for the U.S. Forest Service, said in an interview. Fire officials say the trend to larger, more destructive fires is driven by drought-stricken vegetation, erratic winds and triple-digit temperatures that are part of climate change. President Donald Trump has blamed California’s failure to thin fuel-choked forests. Cal Fire spokeswoman Lia Parker said there were a lot more factors at play than cutting down trees. “A lot of it is climate related; we’ve seen a significant increase in temperatures; we’ve seen an increase in dry and dead conditions,” Parker said. As the Camp Fire raged, similar conditions nearly 450 miles to the south were fueling the Woolsey Fire, which killed two people and destroyed 370 homes near Los Angeles. “It was a fire storm, the worst I’ve ever seen it,” said Malibu resident Tony Haynes, 59, who fought blaze as it threatened his home.

2018-11-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil’s slide accelerated on Tuesday, with U.S. futures suffering their steepest one-day loss in more than three years due to ongoing worries about weakening global demand and oversupply. U.S. futures closed down 7.1 percent, for a record 12th straight decline and the lowest since November 2017. More than 980,000 contracts changed hands, as funds shed positions.  “It’s like a run on the bank,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “It’s getting to the point where it doesn’t seem to be about fundamentals anymore, but a total collapse in price.”  Traders said the selling was an extension of Monday’s, which was triggered after U.S. President Donald Trump posted a tweet meant to put pressure on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries not to cut supply to prop up prices.  Trump’s tweet followed weekend reports that Saudi Arabia was considering a production cut at the December OPEC meeting, on increased alarm that supply has started to outpace consumption.  Speculators have pulled back on heavy bets on an oil rally, a process that continued Tuesday, traders said. As of last week, hedge funds and other money managers had reduced their long position in oil contracts to their lowest since August 2017. Traders said that recent weakness in equities has fanned concerns about global growth, which is also contributing to declines in oil.  U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled down $4.24 a barrel, or 7.1 percent, to $55.69 a barrel. It was the largest one-day percentage decline for the contract since September 2015. U.S. crude has lost 28 percent since its early October peak. Brent LCOc1 ended down $4.65, or 6.6 percent, to $65.47 a barrel, the largest one-day loss since July. Brent has lost 25 percent since peaking at a four-year high in early October. It now sits at levels not seen since March.  In its monthly report, OPEC said world oil demand next year would rise by 1.29 million barrels per day (bpd), 70,000 bpd less than predicted last month and the fourth consecutive forecast cut. Output, however, rose by 127,000 bpd to 32.9 million bpd, OPEC said. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday that OPEC agreed there was a need to cut oil supply next year by around 1 million barrels per day from October levels to prevent oversupply. Even as the Saudis have promised to reduce output, U.S. production reached 11.6 million bpd in the most recent week, a new record. Russia has given mixed signals about a cut, with Lukoil Chief Executive Vagit Alekperov saying on Monday that he did not see cuts being necessary. “They can’t make up their minds on a cutback or not,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. “These strange bedfellows no longer seem like they’re in the same bed anymore.”  Reporting by David Gaffen in New York; additional reporting from Christopher Johnson in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-12-oil-slumps-7-pct-to-one-year-low-as-rout-extends-to-12-days-idUKL4N1XO07F,13 Nov 2018,"* Crude prices slump: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PWBkdL

2018-11-13,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - “Failures and possible crimes” led to a February leak of mineral byproduct at Norsk Hydro ASA’s Alunorte alumina refinery in the Amazonian state of Para, a special commission in Brazil’s lower house said in a report released on Tuesday  A congressional commission assembled to look into the incident blamed both the company and regulators, and called for civil and criminal investigations to continue. “The matter of criminal and civil responsibility was emphasized, not only for the company involved in the matter, but principally for those who have the duty of enforcing and issuing operating licenses,” Éder Mauro, who represents Para in Brazil’s lower house, said in comments to the legislature’s official news service. In a statement sent to Reuters, a representative for Alunorte rejected several assertions made by the commission, saying that “there was no leak or overflow of bauxite waste” as the report asserted.   Norsk Hydro has been in a months-long dispute with Brazilian authorities after the metals maker admitted to unlicensed emissions of untreated water during severe rains. The nature of those emissions has been a matter of hot dispute between the company and Brazilian authorities. The Alunorte refinery is currently barred per court order from operating at more than 50 percent capacity. At full capacity, the plant can produce some 6.4 million tonnes of alumina, or 10 percent of the world’s capacity outside China. Alunorte transforms bauxite into alumina, which is turned into aluminum at huge smelter.

2018-11-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil output from seven major shale basins was expected to hit a record of 7.94 million barrels per day (bpd) in December, according to a monthly government forecast released on Tuesday.  The total oil output from the basins was expected to rise 113,000 bpd, driven largely by increases in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, where output was forecast to climb by 63,000 bpd to about 3.7 million bpd in December, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Output was also expected to rise in each of the other basins, except for the Haynesville, where it would remain unchanged at 43,000 bpd.  U.S. natural gas production, meanwhile, was projected to increase to a record 75.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December. That would be up more than 1.0 bcfd over the November forecast and would be the 11th monthly increase in a row. A year ago in December output was just 63.9 bcfd. The EIA projected gas output would increase in all the big shale basins in December. Output in the Appalachia region, the biggest shale gas play, was set to rise 0.4 bcfd to a record 30.4 bcfd in December. Production in Appalachia was 26.9 bcfd in the same month a year ago. EIA said producers drilled 1,577 wells and completed 1,308 in the biggest shale basins in October, leaving total drilled but uncompleted wells up 269 at a record high 8,545, according to data going back to December 2013. That was the most wells drilled in a month since February 2015 and the most completed in a month since March 2015, according to EIA data.

The utility said nuclear output in its French home market rose by 6.6 terawatt hours (TWh) to 290 TWh, mainly because 2017 nuclear output was heavily impacted by several reactor outages linked to and investigation in the manufacturing records of the Creusot plant and problems with carbon segregation in the steel of its reactors. EDF slightly lowered its full-year 2018 French nuclear output target to 393-395 TWh from more than 395 TWh as the Dampierre 4 reactor had been closed longer than expected for maintenance and the Chooz 1 reactor had been closed for 17 days in October due to low water levels in the river Meuse. EDF confirmed its guidance for 2018 core earnings of 14.8-15.3 billion euros and chief financial officer Xavier Girre said on an analyst call that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were expected to come in at the top end of that range. He also said that EDF should achieve positive cash flow this year, which is slightly better than its target for cash flow that is slightly positive or close to balance, excluding investments in its Linky smart meters and asset disposals. Girre said that following the sale of the Dunkerque LNG terminal, EDF’s 10 billion euro asset disposal was now nearly completed and would be finalised before year-end. “We are not planning another asset disposal plan on this scale,” he told analysts in response to questions. Revenue in the first nine months of the year rose 7.2 percent to 49.59 billon euros from 46.25 billion restated under new IFRS 15 accounting standards on contract recognition, but was slightly below the 49.72 billion euros reported for the first nine months of last year.

2018-11-13,"VALENCIA/CARACAS (Reuters) - With chronic shortages of basic goods afflicting her native Venezuela, Veronica Perez used to drive from supermarket to supermarket in her gray Chevrolet Aveo searching for food.  But the 54-year-old engineer has abandoned the practice because of shortages of something that should be abundant in a country with the world’s largest oil reserves: gasoline.  “I only do what is absolutely necessary, nothing else,” said Perez, who lives in the industrial city of Valencia. She said she had stopped going to Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, just 20 miles (32 km) away. Snaking, hours-long lines and gas station closures have long afflicted Venezuela’s border regions. Fuel smuggling to neighboring countries is common, the result of generous subsidies from state-run oil company PDVSA that allow Venezuelans to fill their tank 20,000 times for the price of one kilo (2.2 pounds) of cheese. But in late October and early November, cities in the populous central region of the country like Valencia and the capital Caracas were hit by a rare wave of shortages, due to plunging crude production and a dramatic drop in refineries’ fuel output as the socialist-run economy suffers its fifth year of recession. Venezuela produced more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude last year but by September output had fallen to just 1.4 million bpd. So far in 2018, Venezuela produced an average of 1.53 million bpd, the lowest in nearly seven decades, according to figures reported to OPEC. Bottlenecks for transporting fuel from refineries, distribution centers and ports to gas stations have also worsened, exacerbating the shortages.  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Venezuela’s oil and communications ministries.      Relatively normal supply has since been restored in Caracas and Valencia after unusually long outages but the episode has forced Venezuelans to alter their daily habits.  That could hit an economy seen shrinking by double digits in 2018. For Venezuelans coping with a lack of food and medicine, blackouts and hyperinflation, the gasoline shortages could also increase frustration with already-unpopular President Nicolas Maduro.  “My new headache is fearing I might run out of gasoline,” said Elena Bustamante, a 34-year-old English teacher in Valencia. “It has changed my life enormously.” Venezuela’s economy has shrunk by more than half since Maduro took office in 2013. The contraction has been driven by a collapse in the price of crude and falling oil sales, which account for more than 90 percent of Venezuelan exports.  Three million Venezuelans have emigrated - or around one-tenth of the population - mostly in the past three years, according to the United Nations. Despite a sharp drop in domestic demand due to the recession, Venezuela’s collapsing oil industry is struggling to produce enough gasoline.  Fuel demand was expected to fall to 325,000 bpd in October, half the volume of a decade ago, but PDVSA expected to be able to supply only 270,000 bpd, according to a company planning document seen by Reuters. A gasoline price hike - promised by Maduro in August under a reform package - could further reduce demand but it has yet to take effect. Venezuela’s declining oil production has its roots in years of underinvestment. U.S. sanctions have complicated financing.  The refining sector, designed to produce 1.3 million bpd of fuel, is severely hobbled. It is operating at just one-third of capacity, according to experts and union sources. Its largest refinery, Amuay, is delivering just 70,000 bpd of gasoline despite having the capacity to produce 645,000 bpd of fuel, according to union leader Ivan Freites and another person close to PDVSA who spoke on the condition of anonymity. PDVSA has tried to make up for this by boosting fuel imports, buying about half of the gasoline the country needs, according to internal company figures.  In the first eight months of 2018, Venezuela imported an average of 125,000 bpd from the United States, up 76 percent from the same period a year earlier, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show. But delays in unloading fuel cargoes have contributed to shortages, since Venezuelan oil ports are more oriented toward exports than imports, according to traders, shippers, PDVSA sources and Refinitiv Eikon data.  One tanker bringing imported gasoline mixed with ethanol was contaminated with high levels of water, forcing PDVSA to withdraw the product from distribution centers, a company source said, directly contributing to the shortages in Caracas. The incident was the result of PDVSA seeking fuel from “unreliable suppliers,” in part because the U.S. sanctions have left many companies unwilling to do business with Venezuela, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  The shortages last week prevented Andres Merida, a 29-year-old freelance publicist in Valencia, from attending client meetings.  “I had someone who used to take me from place to place but in light of the gasoline issue he would not give me a lift even when I offered to pay him,” he said. “He said he would prefer to save the gasoline and guarantee it for himself.”  Additional reporting by Anggy Polanco in San Cristobal, Mircely Guanipa in Punto Fijo, Vivian Sequera in Carcas and Marianna Parraga in Mexico City; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Chris Reese",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-shortage-gasoline/feature-fuel-shortages-the-new-normal-in-venezuela-as-oil-industry-unravels-idUKL2N1XJ1LI,13 Nov 2018,"With chronic shortages

2018-11-13,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) plans to raise $4 billion (£3.08 billion) in needed cash by year end, the company said on Tuesday, speeding its planned sale of a stake in oilfield services unit Baker Hughes (BHGE.N). The news boosted GE shares more than 4 percent after days of steep declines but did little to relieve pressure on its bonds. (tmsnrt.rs/2PnISH3) Before the announcement, prices on a number of its bonds had fallen far below par value, after new Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp noted the “urgency” of shoring up the conglomerate’s weak finances.  Once a symbol of American business power and management prowess, GE has faltered badly. Problems with its finance arm caused heavy losses during the 2008 financial crisis and forced it to take a Warren Buffett bailout; since then it has it been trying to rebuild its industrial businesses. It has had three CEOs since July 2017 and its stock has fallen more than 80 percent since 2000. GE said it will sell up to 101.2 million Baker Hughes shares on the open market and that Baker Hughes will buy 65 million of its own shares from GE, using a $1.5 billion repurchase arsenal Baker Huges already has authorized. Based on Tuesday’s share price, the sale would raise about $4 billion.  After the sale, GE will own about 50.4 percent of Baker Hughes, according to analysts. The trades speed up the plan former GE CEO John Flannery laid out in June to sell all of the 62.5 percent Baker Hughes stake over two to three years. GE has a six-month lock up on its remaining stake in the oilfield company and expects sell the remainder over the next several years. The two companies also outlined licensing deals that allow Baker Hughes to sell and use GE’s turbine and digital technology as the two business split apart. “The divorce is obviously final, but at the end of the day they have to share assets and liabilities,” said Chirag Rathi, consulting director for Frost & Sullivan. “Baker Hughes essentially gets access to digital solutions and turbines. It’s not a clean-cut divorce. There will be some overlap of businesses.” GE shares rose 4.5 percent to $8.35. Baker Hughes was up 1.6 percent to $24.01.

Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said on Tuesday the deal provides “clarity for our customers, employees and shareholders.”  The sale comes as improving oil markets have helped Baker Hughes post a third-quarter adjusted net profit.  The oil services firm also said it was optimistic about the near future with oil production in North America climbing to record levels.

2018-11-13,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shares of oilfield services firm Weatherford International (WFT.N) on Tuesday slipped below $1 apiece, to a 29-year low, the latest sign that investors are losing confidence in its turnaround plan. The stock, which peaked at almost $50 in 2008, has fallen sharply since oil prices crashed in late 2014, leading to a string of losses at Weatherford since the third quarter that year. The company has $7.6 billion in long-term debt.  Pressures on its share price intensified in the past two weeks after the Houston-based company missed its free cash flow targets in latest quarter, and said it would no longer disclose deadlines for achieving asset sales, a signal to investors that it was having trouble finding buyers. The shares fell 5 percent to close at 97 cents on Tuesday. Analysts said the decline would not result in a breach of debt covenants, but a stock that closes below $1 for 30 consecutive days can trigger a Nasdaq deficiency notice, potentially leading to delisting. Weatherford did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Weatherford has pinned hopes for a turnaround on newly appointed Chief Executive Mark McCollum, who has pushed to restructure operations, sell businesses and cut costs. “Fixing WFT’s (Weatherford’s) lack of free cash flow generation over the past decade is ultimately the measuring stick by which investors will judge him. So far, the numbers aren’t in his favor,” analysts from Barclays wrote in a note last month. The company was $488 million cash flow negative year-to-date at the end of September, and will likely not meet its plan to break even on cash flow for the full year, Barclays analysts said. U.S. oil producers recently have slowed spending on new wells in the face of surging crude output and transportation bottlenecks. “Markets aren’t helping them a whole lot,” said Sajjad Alam, a senior analyst at debt-rating firm Moody’s Investors Service. “The more the share price drops the harder it becomes for investors to stay in.” Reporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by Richard Chang",https://uk.reuters.com/article/weatherford-stocks/shares-in-oilfield-firm-weatherford-international-drop-below-1-idUKL2N1XO1M2,13 Nov 2018,"Shares of oilfield services firm

2018-11-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices plunged 7 percent on Tuesday on persistent concerns of oversupply and weakening global demand, causing Wall Street stocks to reverse early gains that were driven by the resumption of trade talks between the United States and China. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX ended lower as energy stocks declined with the fall in prices of Brent and U.S. crude futures.  U.S. crude touched its lowest level in a year, and Brent also extended Monday’s fall, which was triggered when U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on OPEC to not cut supply to prop up prices. Both crude benchmarks have fallen more than 20 percent since peaking at four-year highs in early October. Wall Street stocks reacted sharply to the oil price slump. “The market does not like such a violent move in an asset class,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. “Low oil prices are good for consumers, but they will hurt energy companies, whose earnings estimates have been rising over the past year,” he added, nothing that there could also be a decline in capital spending. U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled down $4.24, or 7.1 percent, to $55.69 a barrel. It was the largest one-day percentage decline for the contract since September 2015. Brent LCOc1 ended down $4.65, or 6.6 percent, to $65.47 a barrel, its largest one-day loss since July. Earlier, U.S. stocks rose after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington had resumed trade talks with China, calling the development “very positive.” The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which has steadily climbed as the U.S.-China trade dispute has escalated, dipped 0.2 percent but remained near a 16-month high reached on Monday. “If you’re looking at market action today, that reflects an unsuredness and lack of direction,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.

2018-11-13,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) * Eyes on $7 bln hydrogen market in Asia by 2030 * Production cost seen as biggest hurdle * Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries working to drive down costs * Woodside sees “blue hydrogen” from gas as key to scale By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Australia, the world’s biggest coal exporter and second-biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, wants to build its next big energy industry around exploiting solar and wind power along with brown coal to produce hydrogen. The same fuel used to power rockets into space, hydrogen has untapped energy potential without the downside of the carbon emissions from natural gas and coal. Australia is seeking to supply what could be a $7 billion market for hydrogen to China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore by 2030, according to a report done for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency by consultants ACIL Allen. While initially just a fraction of Australia’s LNG exports, forecast at A$48 billion ($35 billion) in 2019, hydrogen exports could grow the same way that Australia’s LNG industry has over the past 30 years, according to ACIL Allen, the Australian government, and local gas producer Woodside Petroleum. The global drive to cut carbon emissions and the falling cost of wind and solar power has turned hydrogen fuel into an opportunity now after the idea was mooted more than four decades ago. “Many of our traditional gas markets — Japan, Korea — have adopted strategies that put hydrogen and ultimately renewable hydrogen at the core of their energy future. So we want to make sure we’ve got the capability of providing for that market,” Western Australia’s Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan told Reuters. The state on Oct. 25 launched a Renewable Hydrogen Council, including Woodside, French power producer Engie SA, and Norway’s Yara International, to form a plan to use land, wind and solar resources to produce hydrogen. “The development of a hydrogen business is similar to the early days of the LNG business,” said Shaun Gregory, Woodside’s executive vice president for exploration and technology. To reduce global warming, hydrogen could be used in fuel cells for vehicles and manufacturing plants, and could eventually replace natural gas for space heating, water heating and cooking in homes. Output may start through the gasification of brown coal with the hydrogen and carbon dioxide separated out. But eventually wind and solar power would be used to crack water to become the biggest hydrogen source. Currently, hydrogen derived from coal gasification is cheaper to produce than from water. The goal is drive down the costs of a hydrogen cargo by 2030 to a level that Japanese buyers would accept, said Australia’s Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, who is advising the government on a hydrogen strategy. “The biggest potential show-stopper is that we can’t meet the price target,” he told Reuters. Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) is leading a A$500 million demonstration project to produce hydrogen from brown coal from Australia’s largest coal mine, Loy Yang in Victoria. “At this point it is clearly cheaper (than hydrogen from renewables), but in the future they might be the same,” KHI Executive Officer Eiichi Harada told Reuters at the GHGT-14 conference in Melbourne on Oct. 25. Meanwhile, Woodside is working with Korea Gas Corp to potentially produce “blue hydrogen” in a carbon-neutral process of reforming methane from natural gas while eventually shifting to solar or wind to crack water to make “green hydrogen” “We believe blue hydrogen – carbon neutral hydrogen, sourced from gas - is the key to building scale and lowering costs in hydrogen transport and distribution, which will enable an earlier transition to green hydrogen,” Woodside’s Gregory said in an email.

2018-11-13,"Nov 13 (Reuters) - Paradise, California had long prepared for wildfires but only in its worst nightmares did it imagine the kind of “megafire” that last week destroyed most of the town and killed at least 42 people. Born of tinder dry conditions and erratic winds, the “Camp Fire” was the latest California megafire, a huge blaze that burns more intensely and quickly than anything the state has experienced before. In recent years authorities in California have reported an increase in such large, explosive and swiftly spreading wildfires over a virtually year-round fire season. Four out of the five largest fires in California history have occurred in the last six years. Paradise had not seen significant rain for 211 days, and the town, on a ridge in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, was surrounded by a potential bonfire of dry or dead trees following a five-year drought that ended in 2017. Less rain and longer droughts are the major cause of the blazes, which consume more than 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares), according to recent research by the U.S. Forest Service and University of Montana. After a wildfire destroyed 87 homes in Paradise in 2008, the town of 27,000 put evacuation plans in place and fined homeowners if they did not clear brush and prune trees to reduce fire risk. But all it took was some kind of spark on Camp Creek Road, west of Paradise, and “El Diablo” fall winds gusting up to 50 mph (80 kph), to unleash the most destructive and deadly wildfire in California history. As the blaze roared west, devouring nearly 6,500 homes, it created its own fire whirlwinds or “firenados,” incinerating an area equivalent to 80 American football fields (100 acres) per minute. “This event was the worst case scenario. It was the event we have feared for a long time,” local sheriff Kory Honea told reporters. This has been one of the state’s worst fire years, with nearly twice the acreage burned so far compared with 2017 in areas managed by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). Former U.S. Forest Service officials such as Jerry Williams say too much emphasis is put on fighting fires instead of accepting that they are a natural part of the environment and minimizing their impact. Forests that for millennia had fire as part of their ecosystems have become choked with growth and unhealthy, and ultimately tinder for megafires, he said. “Every year we set a new record, we invest more in suppression, invest less in mitigation and wonder why we’re not getting on top of it,” Williams, a former director of fire and aviation for the U.S. Forest Service, said in an interview. Fire officials say the trend to larger, more destructive fires is driven by drought-stricken vegetation, erratic winds and triple-digit temperatures that are part of climate change. President Donald Trump has blamed California’s failure to thin fuel-choked forests. Cal Fire spokeswoman Lia Parker said there were a lot more factors at play than cutting down trees. “A lot of it is climate related; we’ve seen a significant increase in temperatures; we’ve seen an increase in dry and dead conditions,” Parker said. As the Camp Fire raged, similar conditions nearly 450 miles to the south were fueling the Woolsey Fire, which killed two people and destroyed 370 homes near Los Angeles. “It was a fire storm, the worst I’ve ever seen it,” said Malibu resident Tony Haynes, 59, who fought blaze as it threatened his home.

2018-11-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil’s slide accelerated on Tuesday, with U.S. futures suffering their steepest one-day loss in more than three years due to ongoing worries about weakening global demand and oversupply. U.S. futures closed down 7.1 percent, for a record 12th straight decline and the lowest since November 2017. More than 980,000 contracts changed hands, as funds shed positions.  “It’s like a run on the bank,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “It’s getting to the point where it doesn’t seem to be about fundamentals anymore, but a total collapse in price.”  Traders said the selling was an extension of Monday’s, which was triggered after U.S. President Donald Trump posted a tweet meant to put pressure on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries not to cut supply to prop up prices.  Trump’s tweet followed weekend reports that Saudi Arabia was considering a production cut at the December OPEC meeting, on increased alarm that supply has started to outpace consumption.  Speculators have pulled back on heavy bets on an oil rally, a process that continued Tuesday, traders said. As of last week, hedge funds and other money managers had reduced their long position in oil contracts to their lowest since August 2017. Traders said that recent weakness in equities has fanned concerns about global growth, which is also contributing to declines in oil.  U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled down $4.24 a barrel, or 7.1 percent, to $55.69 a barrel. It was the largest one-day percentage decline for the contract since September 2015. U.S. crude has lost 28 percent since its early October peak. Brent LCOc1 ended down $4.65, or 6.6 percent, to $65.47 a barrel, the largest one-day loss since July. Brent has lost 25 percent since peaking at a four-year high in early October. It now sits at levels not seen since March.  In its monthly report, OPEC said world oil demand next year would rise by 1.29 million barrels per day (bpd), 70,000 bpd less than predicted last month and the fourth consecutive forecast cut. Output, however, rose by 127,000 bpd to 32.9 million bpd, OPEC said. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday that OPEC agreed there was a need to cut oil supply next year by around 1 million barrels per day from October levels to prevent oversupply. Even as the Saudis have promised to reduce output, U.S. production reached 11.6 million bpd in the most recent week, a new record. Russia has given mixed signals about a cut, with Lukoil Chief Executive Vagit Alekperov saying on Monday that he did not see cuts being necessary. “They can’t make up their minds on a cutback or not,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. “These strange bedfellows no longer seem like they’re in the same bed anymore.”  Reporting by David Gaffen in New York; additional reporting from Christopher Johnson in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-12-oil-slumps-7-pct-to-one-year-low-as-rout-extends-to-12-days-idUKL4N1XO07F,13 Nov 2018,"* Crude prices slump: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PWBkdL

In a statement sent to Reuters, a representative for Alunorte rejected several assertions made by the commission, saying that “there was no leak or overflow of bauxite waste” as the report asserted.   Norsk Hydro has been in a months-long dispute with Brazilian authorities after the metals maker admitted to unlicensed emissions of untreated water during severe rains. The nature of those emissions has been a matter of hot dispute between the company and Brazilian authorities. The Alunorte refinery is currently barred per court order from operating at more than 50 percent capacity. At full capacity, the plant can produce some 6.4 million tonnes of alumina, or 10 percent of the world’s capacity outside China.

2018-11-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil output from seven major shale basins was expected to hit a record of 7.94 million barrels per day (bpd) in December, according to a monthly government forecast released on Tuesday.  The total oil output from the basins was expected to rise 113,000 bpd, driven largely by increases in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, where output was forecast to climb by 63,000 bpd to about 3.7 million bpd in December, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Output was also expected to rise in each of the other basins, except for the Haynesville, where it would remain unchanged at 43,000 bpd.  U.S. natural gas production, meanwhile, was projected to increase to a record 75.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in December. That would be up more than 1.0 bcfd over the November forecast and would be the 11th monthly increase in a row. A year ago in December output was just 63.9 bcfd. The EIA projected gas output would increase in all the big shale basins in December. Output in the Appalachia region, the biggest shale gas play, was set to rise 0.4 bcfd to a record 30.4 bcfd in December. Production in Appalachia was 26.9 bcfd in the same month a year ago. EIA said producers drilled 1,577 wells and completed 1,308 in the biggest shale basins in October, leaving total drilled but uncompleted wells up 269 at a record high 8,545, according to data going back to December 2013. That was the most wells drilled in a month since February 2015 and the most completed in a month since March 2015, according to EIA data.

The utility said nuclear output in its French home market rose by 6.6 terawatt hours (TWh) to 290 TWh, mainly because 2017 nuclear output was heavily impacted by several reactor outages linked to and investigation in the manufacturing records of the Creusot plant and problems with carbon segregation in the steel of its reactors. EDF slightly lowered its full-year 2018 French nuclear output target to 393-395 TWh from more than 395 TWh as the Dampierre 4 reactor had been closed longer than expected for maintenance and the Chooz 1 reactor had been closed for 17 days in October due to low water levels in the river Meuse. EDF confirmed its guidance for 2018 core earnings of 14.8-15.3 billion euros and chief financial officer Xavier Girre said on an analyst call that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were expected to come in at the top end of that range. He also said that EDF should achieve positive cash flow this year, which is slightly better than its target for cash flow that is slightly positive or close to balance, excluding investments in its Linky smart meters and asset disposals. Girre said that following the sale of the Dunkerque LNG terminal, EDF’s 10 billion euro asset disposal was now nearly completed and would be finalised before year-end. “We are not planning another asset disposal plan on this scale,” he told analysts in response to questions. Revenue in the first nine months of the year rose 7.2 percent to 49.59 billon euros from 46.25 billion restated under new IFRS 15 accounting standards on contract recognition, but was slightly below the 49.72 billion euros reported for the first nine months of last year.

But the 54-year-old engineer has abandoned the practice because of shortages of something that should be abundant in a country with the world’s largest oil reserves: gasoline.  “I only do what is absolutely necessary, nothing else,” said Perez, who lives in the industrial city of Valencia. She said she had stopped going to Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, just 20 miles (32 km) away. Snaking, hours-long lines and gas station closures have long afflicted Venezuela’s border regions. Fuel smuggling to neighboring countries is common, the result of generous subsidies from state-run oil company PDVSA that allow Venezuelans to fill their tank 20,000 times for the price of one kilo (2.2 pounds) of cheese. But in late October and early November, cities in the populous central region of the country like Valencia and the capital Caracas were hit by a rare wave of shortages, due to plunging crude production and a dramatic drop in refineries’ fuel output as the socialist-run economy suffers its fifth year of recession. Venezuela produced more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude last year but by September output had fallen to just 1.4 million bpd. So far in 2018, Venezuela produced an average of 1.53 million bpd, the lowest in nearly seven decades, according to figures reported to OPEC. Bottlenecks for transporting fuel from refineries, distribution centers and ports to gas stations have also worsened, exacerbating the shortages.  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Venezuela’s oil and communications ministries.      Relatively normal supply has since been restored in Caracas and Valencia after unusually long outages but the episode has forced Venezuelans to alter their daily habits.  That could hit an economy seen shrinking by double digits in 2018. For Venezuelans coping with a lack of food and medicine, blackouts and hyperinflation, the gasoline shortages could also increase frustration with already-unpopular President Nicolas Maduro.  “My new headache is fearing I might run out of gasoline,” said Elena Bustamante, a 34-year-old English teacher in Valencia. “It has changed my life enormously.” Venezuela’s economy has shrunk by more than half since Maduro took office in 2013. The contraction has been driven by a collapse in the price of crude and falling oil sales, which account for more than 90 percent of Venezuelan exports.  Three million Venezuelans have emigrated - or around one-tenth of the population - mostly in the past three years, according to the United Nations. Despite a sharp drop in domestic demand due to the recession, Venezuela’s collapsing oil industry is struggling to produce enough gasoline.  Fuel demand was expected to fall to 325,000 bpd in October, half the volume of a decade ago, but PDVSA expected to be able to supply only 270,000 bpd, according to a company planning document seen by Reuters. A gasoline price hike - promised by Maduro in August under a reform package - could further reduce demand but it has yet to take effect. Venezuela’s declining oil production has its roots in years of underinvestment. U.S. sanctions have complicated financing.  The refining sector, designed to produce 1.3 million bpd of fuel, is severely hobbled. It is operating at just one-third of capacity, according to experts and union sources. Its largest refinery, Amuay, is delivering just 70,000 bpd of gasoline despite having the capacity to produce 645,000 bpd of fuel, according to union leader Ivan Freites and another person close to PDVSA who spoke on the condition of anonymity. PDVSA has tried to make up for this by boosting fuel imports, buying about half of the gasoline the country needs, according to internal company figures.  In the first eight months of 2018, Venezuela imported an average of 125,000 bpd from the United States, up 76 percent from the same period a year earlier, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show. But delays in unloading fuel cargoes have contributed to shortages, since Venezuelan oil ports are more oriented toward exports than imports, according to traders, shippers, PDVSA sources and Refinitiv Eikon data.  One tanker bringing imported gasoline mixed with ethanol was contaminated with high levels of water, forcing PDVSA to withdraw the product from distribution centers, a company source said, directly contributing to the shortages in Caracas. The incident was the result of PDVSA seeking fuel from “unreliable suppliers,” in part because the U.S. sanctions have left many companies unwilling to do business with Venezuela, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  The shortages last week prevented Andres Merida, a 29-year-old freelance publicist in Valencia, from attending client meetings.  “I had someone who used to take me from place to place but in light of the gasoline issue he would not give me a lift even when I offered to pay him,” he said. “He said he would prefer to save the gasoline and guarantee it for himself.”  Additional reporting by Anggy Polanco in San Cristobal, Mircely Guanipa in Punto Fijo, Vivian Sequera in Carcas and Marianna Parraga in Mexico City; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Chris Reese",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-shortage-gasoline/feature-fuel-shortages-the-new-normal-in-venezuela-as-oil-industry-unravels-idUKL2N1XJ1LI,13 Nov 2018,"With chronic shortages

2018-11-13,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) plans to raise $4 billion (£3.08 billion) in needed cash by year end, the company said on Tuesday, speeding its planned sale of a stake in oilfield services unit Baker Hughes (BHGE.N). The news boosted GE shares more than 4 percent after days of steep declines but did little to relieve pressure on its bonds. (tmsnrt.rs/2PnISH3) Before the announcement, prices on a number of its bonds had fallen far below par value, after new Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp noted the “urgency” of shoring up the conglomerate’s weak finances.  Once a symbol of American business power and management prowess, GE has faltered badly. Problems with its finance arm caused heavy losses during the 2008 financial crisis and forced it to take a Warren Buffett bailout; since then it has it been trying to rebuild its industrial businesses. It has had three CEOs since July 2017 and its stock has fallen more than 80 percent since 2000. GE said it will sell up to 101.2 million Baker Hughes shares on the open market and that Baker Hughes will buy 65 million of its own shares from GE, using a $1.5 billion repurchase arsenal Baker Huges already has authorized. Based on Tuesday’s share price, the sale would raise about $4 billion.  After the sale, GE will own about 50.4 percent of Baker Hughes, according to analysts. The trades speed up the plan former GE CEO John Flannery laid out in June to sell all of the 62.5 percent Baker Hughes stake over two to three years. GE has a six-month lock up on its remaining stake in the oilfield company and expects sell the remainder over the next several years. The two companies also outlined licensing deals that allow Baker Hughes to sell and use GE’s turbine and digital technology as the two business split apart. “The divorce is obviously final, but at the end of the day they have to share assets and liabilities,” said Chirag Rathi, consulting director for Frost & Sullivan. “Baker Hughes essentially gets access to digital solutions and turbines. It’s not a clean-cut divorce. There will be some overlap of businesses.” GE shares rose 4.5 percent to $8.35. Baker Hughes was up 1.6 percent to $24.01.  The cost to insure GE debt rose hit a fresh six-year high on Tuesday, with the bid spread and upfront price on the five-year credit default swap at 206.7 basis points and 4.67 percent respectively. GE5YUSAX=R GE5YUSAX=MG GE’s bond prices were close to multi-year lows, after falling precipitously on Friday. The $1.3 billion bond coming due in January 2023 was down 150 basis points from its high point on Friday, now trading around 93 cents on the dollar. 36962G6S8=  GE bought Houston-based Baker Hughes in July 2017 and agreed to maintain its 62.5 percent stake until the middle of next year. GE has since focused on debt and focus on its core businesses of jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.  “The agreements announced today accelerate that plan in a manner that mutually benefits both companies and their shareholders,” Culp said in a statement.  Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said on Tuesday the deal provides “clarity for our customers, employees and shareholders.”  The sale comes as improving oil markets have helped Baker Hughes post a third-quarter adjusted net profit.  The oil services firm also said it was optimistic about the near future with oil production in North America climbing to record levels.

Oil prices fell more than 3 percent, but U.S. natural gas futures soared to their highest since November 2014 on forecasts for colder weather. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index rose on reports that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had resumed discussions with China Vice Premier Liu He. Technology stocks bounced back a day after a rout that led the S&P 500’s nearly 2 percent decline. U.S. equities rose further after White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow said Washington had resumed trade talks with China and characterized the development as “very positive.” “It’s potentially good news on the trade war front,” said Edmund Tran, equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management in New York. “Any incremental news point is going to drive market volatility, whether up or down.” The U.S. dollar index, which has steadily climbed as the U.S.-China trade dispute has escalated, dipped 0.4 percent. Conversely, the pound rose 1.4 percent to $1.3033 after reports that the United Kingdom and the European Union had agreed upon the text of a Brexit agreement and that British Prime Minister Theresa May would hold a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The euro also rose from a 16-month low, last up 0.6 to $1.1282, though its gains were capped by concerns over Italy’s budget. The Italian government faces a Tuesday deadline to submit a revised budget to the EU. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.82 points, or 0.13 percent, to 25,420, the S&P 500 gained 14.02 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,740.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 62.16 points, or 0.86 percent, to 7,263.03. The pan-European STOXX 600 added 0.67 percent to 364.44. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.36 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 3.1599 percent, from 3.189 percent late on Friday. The Treasury market was closed on Monday for the Veterans Day holiday. Oil prices extended their fall from Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on OPEC not to cut supply to prop up prices. U.S. crude fell 4.27 percent to $57.37 per barrel and Global benchmark Brent crude was down $2.70 a barrel at $67.42. Both crude benchmarks have fallen more than 20 percent since peaking at four-year highs in early October. But front-month gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 6.1 percent, and the session high was its highest since Nov. 28, 2014.

2018-11-13,"(Adds paragraph 6) ABU DHABI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Sudan’s oil minister said on Tuesday he expected bidding to develop the country’s oil and gas blocks to start in the third quarter of 2019, in a move he said would herald the country’s “second oil boom.” “I really expect a lot of companies to come, particularly now since we are working ... on the second phase of discussions with the United States so we can have this embargo lifted,” Azhari Abdalla told reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference in Abu Dhabi. Although trade sanctions were removed last year, Sudan remains on the United States’ list of state sponsors of terror, discouraging investors and making it ineligible for debt relief. Abdalla said he hoped the embargo on Sudan would be lifted completely by the middle of next year, paving the way for increased investment. Last week, the U.S. State Department said it was working with Sudan on issues such as improving humanitarian access, expanding counter-terrorism cooperation, and making progress on human rights as conditions for removal from the list. It said Sudan’s removal from the list could happen between six months and four years’ times. “All of these blocks ... are onshores we already discovered or they are tested proven hydrocarbon deposits,” Abdalla said. “We are also in bilateral negotiations,” he added. “If we are convinced that an offer will meet our expectations, we will go ahead even before the bid.” One project he said was under discussion with foreign investors was a refinery along the Red Sea with a capacity of 200,000 barrels per day (bpd). The secession of the south of the country in 2011 took with it three quarters of Sudan’s oil output. It is currently producing around 75,000 bpd, the minister said. Abdalla told Reuters he expected Sudan to produce 100,000 to 110,000 bpd of oil by 2021, and for the country to become an exporter at the end of the next five years. With regards to the country’s own fuel shortage, he said a lack of hard currency needed for imports and issues with the country’s oil refinery remained. “I ask God that the crisis that happened last time does not happen again,” he said, referring to this summer when both factors coincided.

2018-11-13,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - New energy saving and renewables targets adopted by the European Union on Tuesday put the bloc on course to overshoot its climate goals, the EU executive said, as it cut its projections of energy usage to account for Brexit.  Under the new rules adopted by the European Parliament on Tuesday, the EU is targeting energy savings of 32.5 percent and a renewable energy uplift of 32 percent by 2030. That will put the bloc on course to cut emissions by 45 percent from 1990 levels by 2030 versus a target of 40 percent, the EU executive said. “With today’s vote we unlock the true potential of Europe’s clean energy transition, helping us meet our Paris Agreement goals, translating into more jobs, lower energy bills for consumers and less energy imports,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said. EU governments informally agreed to the targets in June and are expected to adopt them ahead of United Nations climate talks in Katowice, Poland next month. National governments have until the end of 2019 to draft their own plans for reducing energy usage to keep in line with the bloc’s goals. Planning for after Brexit, the European Commission also said on Tuesday it sees primary energy consumption for the remaining 27 nations as equivalent to 1,128 million tonnes of oil, and final energy consumption at 846 Mtoe in 2030.  That compares to a previous estimate of 1,273 Mtoe and 956 Mtoe with Britain as part of the bloc. As one of the strongest voices on climate change and biggest economies in the EU, Britain’s exit is forcing the bloc to revise the calculations for much of its complicated patchwork of legislation aimed at reducing global warming gases. The European Commission is due to draft its long-term plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by April.  “This is a milestone,” said Jakop Dalunde, a Green lawmaker tasked with shepherding the climate governance bill through Parliament. The energy efficiency goal will require national governments to cut their overall energy usage by 0.8 percent every year between 2021 and 2030. Under the new renewable energy targets, at least 14 percent of fuel in the transport sector should be from renewable sources by 2030. It also calls for biofuels that contribute to deforestation, such as palm oil, to be phased out by the end of 2030. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fueled concerns that climate change is gathering pace, leading some countries to call for tougher action.

2018-11-13,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry called on Hungary and its neighbours to reject Russian gas pipelines which Washington says are being used to cement Moscow’s grip on central and eastern Europe. Energy diversification would be crucial for the region, as Russia has used energy as a weapon in the past, he said. “Russia is using a pipeline project Nord stream 2 and a multi-line Turkish stream to try to solidify its control over the security and the stability of Central and eastern Europe,” Perry added during a visit to Budapest. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Turkish stream, a pipeline under construction from Russia to Turkey, was good news for Hungary, as with annual capacity of 5 to 6 billion cubic meters one of it branches would bring gas to Hungary’s southern border via a new route. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to encourage the purchase of gas from the United States or other suppliers rather than increasing purchases from Russia. “(The) United States strongly opposes these projects and we urge Hungary and its neighbours to join us in rejecting them.” Hungary largely depends on Russia for its natural gas supplies, which now mostly come via a pipeline via Ukraine. Russia is also building a nuclear plant in Hungary. The government would be willing to buy gas from Croatia, which is building a liquefied natural gas terminal, and from Romania, Szijjarto said. Szijjarto said that he had asked for U.S. help to support Hungary’s diversification. A pipeline connection is not yet capable of carrying imported gas from the Black Sea via Romania.

The project, in the works for a decade, was dealt a blow earlier this month when a U.S. judge in Montana blocked construction pending further environmental review. TransCanada is still expecting a separate ruling from a Nebraska court on routing. The company had expected to start construction on the 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline in 2019.

2018-11-13,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may issue fewer biofuel waivers to small refineries under Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler than it did under its previous leadership, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said on Tuesday. “I sense that Wheeler has a feeling that (former Administrator Scott Pruitt) was very liberal on his issuing of waivers,” Grassley told a conference call.  Asked if he thought such an attitude change could lead to fewer waivers, Grassley, one of the most powerful voices for U.S. agriculture interests, said: “Yes.” The small refinery waiver program is among the most controversial issues dividing the U.S. corn industry and Big Oil. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), refiners are required to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply each year to help expand the market for farm products.  But small refineries can apply for waivers if they demonstrate that complying would cause them hardship.  Under Pruitt, the number of waivers granted to small refiners soared, angering the biofuels industry which argued the program was being used to benefit energy companies while undermining demand for corn-based fuel. Wheeler took over the EPA in July after Pruitt resigned in a flurry of ethical controversies.  While Wheeler has said little about his approach to the small refinery waiver program, he has said he would like to introduce reforms to the RFS that can please both the energy and agriculture industries. At Trump’s direction, the EPA is currently working on a proposal to expand sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends year round, a move meant to help corn growers stung by soft domestic demand and a loss of export markets from trade disputes.

2018-11-13,"* Refinery commissioning originally due to complete end-October * New plant could create tight regional sour crude market * Commercial output to start earliest in January * New plant could save Turkey $1.5 bln on fuel imports By Olga Yagova and Julia Payne MOSCOW/LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - The commercial start-up of Turkey’s new $6.3 billion oil refinery has been delayed until early next year and the plant is not expected to reach full capacity until mid-2019, three sources familiar with the matter said, as tests revealed minor faults. The 200,000-barrel-per-day STAR refinery, built by Azerbaijan’s state oil firm SOCAR, is set to be a game changer for Mediterranean oil markets and will increase the country’s total refining capacity by just over a third. The plant was officially opened by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in October but it is not expected to start processing crude commercially until January, one of the sources close to the refinery said, as tests are still being carried out. “They plan to ramp up slowly through the first quarter and it is expected to reach full processing capacity in the second quarter of 2019,” the source said, adding that the start-up has been delayed a few times as tests had revealed small faults. A second source familiar with SOCAR’s plans said that reaching full capacity could slip even further, into the third quarter. Commercial production at new refineries, particularly large ones, often falls behind schedule as testing of the various units reveals minor issues that need ironing out. A SOCAR spokesman said full refining capacity would be reached next year. “We’ve received two crude oil cargoes and refining is in progress on the plant,” the spokesman said. SOCAR said at the start of this year the refinery would start up in the third quarter of 2018 with commissioning, or testing, to be complete by the end of October. STAR is the biggest new refinery to start up in Europe for decades, and Turkey’s first in 30 years. It will transform traditional Mediterranean crude flows once it reaches full capacity, traders said. Erdogan said at last month’s opening ceremony that the plant’s output would cut Ankara’s fuel import bill by about $1.5 billion per year. SOCAR plans to supply the refinery with oil from different producers in Europe, the Black Sea region and the Gulf, the head of SOCAR’s trading arm said in an interview last week. “It may absorb a significant volume of local sour grades and given an outage of Iranian barrels and Kirkuk flow in the market, it may become really tight on the sour side. But the question is how things will look when the actual start-up happens,” a European trading source said. In September, SOCAR signed a contract with Russia’s Rosneft to supply STAR with 1 million tonnes of Urals crude per year, or about 20,000 bpd. Geneva-based SOCAR Trading has already delivered a 600,000 barrel cargo of Azeri Light and a 1 million barrel cargo of Russian Urals.

2018-11-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC built a case on Tuesday for cutting oil output when it meets next month, warning that a supply glut could emerge in 2019 as the world economy slows and rivals increase production more quickly than expected. Worried by a drop in oil prices and rising supplies, OPEC is talking again of reducing production just months after increasing it. Such a shift would anger U.S. President Donald Trump, who on Monday urged OPEC not to cut supply. In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said world oil demand next year would rise by 1.29 million barrels per day, 70,000 bpd less than predicted last month and the fourth consecutive reduction in its forecast.  Oil prices have dropped steeply from a four-year high above $86 a barrel in October, pressured by concern that global demand is weakening amid adequate supply, offsetting U.S. sanctions on Iran that have started to cut the OPEC country’s oil exports.  “Although the oil market has reached a balance now, the forecasts for 2019 for non-OPEC supply growth indicate higher volumes outpacing the expansion in world oil demand, leading to widening excess supply in the market,” OPEC said in the report. “The recent downward revision to the global economic growth forecast and associated uncertainties confirm the emerging pressure on oil demand observed in recent months.” Crude LCOc1 extended an earlier decline after the release of the OPEC report, trading as low as $66.65 a barrel, the lowest since March. [O/R] Together with Russia and other allies, OPEC had agreed in June to boost supply after pressure from Trump to lower prices. The move partially unwound output cuts that began in January 2017 in an effort to clear a glut that formed in 2014-2016. The group meets on Dec. 6 to set policy for 2019. In the report, OPEC said its oil output rose further in October by 127,000 bpd to 32.90 million bpd after the June deal. The biggest rises came from the United Arab Emirates and top exporter Saudi Arabia. These helped offset declines in Venezuela, where economic crisis has curbed output, and Iran, as buyers walked away before sanctions started this month. The October production rate is considerably more than OPEC expects consumers will require next year. OPEC said the world would need 31.54 million bpd from its 15 members in 2019, down 250,000 bpd from last month. This suggests there will be a 1.36 million bpd surplus in the market should OPEC keep pumping the same amount and other things remain equal. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Monday had outlined a case for supply restraint, saying OPEC and its allies agreed that analysis showed a need to cut output next year by around 1 million bpd from October levels. Oil demand is slowing as the world economy decelerates - OPEC nudged down its 2019 growth forecast in the report. The recovery in oil prices that followed the 2017 OPEC-led supply cut is still prompting more growth in rival production. Non-OPEC supply will rise in 2019 by 2.23 million bpd, the Vienna-based organisation said, 120,000 bpd more than previously thought and far more than the increase in world demand.

It mirrors similar action by rivals also adapting to tough market conditions, including brokers Beazley and Hiscox. RSA said it would instead focus instead on International Hull, International Cargo and Transportation, International Property and International Engineering and Renewable Energy. International Marine Cargo and International Marine Transportation would be restructured into a single unit under new leadership and exposures would be cut “significantly” to focus on areas where sustained profitability could be achieved. RSA said it expected to reduce premiums written through the London Market by around a third year on year in 2019. Scott Egan, chief financial officer at RSA, said more details would follow at full year results and that not more than 50 roles would be affected by the changes. At the end of 2017 RSA had 12,600 employees.

The energy branch of France’s CGT union had called the strike in protest over stalled wage negotiations and a possible government-led restructuring of EDF. EDF said around 8.33 percent of its staff had joined the strike by midday local time in Paris. The RTE said electricity generation was reduced at EDF-operated Paluel 1, Chinon 1 and St. Laurent 1 nuclear reactors. Power output had also been reduced to zero at EDF’s Cordemais 4 and 5 coal-fired plants, while an ongoing strike at the Havre 4 coal power plant that began on Oct. 27 was extended by 24 hours until Nov. 14, the RTE added. Electricity generation was reduced by around 1,950 MW at EDF’s hydro power stations across France, RTE said.

2018-11-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices have fallen sharply since passing a cyclical peak at the start of October, amid surging production and mounting concerns about the state of the global economy and the outlook for consumption growth in 2019. Front-month Brent futures prices have dropped by more than $17 per barrel (20 percent) over the last five weeks while WTI futures prices have declined for a record 11 days in a row. OPEC and its allies, who were talking about increasing production as recently as October to offset the impact of sanctions on Iran, are now openly discussing the need for output cuts to avert a build-up in stocks. Some commentators have expressed surprise at the rapid turn round in the market outlook for under- to oversupply but in fact such shifts have been fairly common. The prospective reimposition of sanctions on Iran masked a big shift in the market outlook in recent months as non-OPEC oil production accelerated while consumption growth showed signs of slowing. Once the threat of severe sanctions was lifted, at least for the time being, the market refocused on the deteriorating supply-demand background and prices have adjusted downwards. The reimposition of sanctions on Iran played the same role in 2018 as the disruption of Libya’s oil exports and advance of Islamist fighters across northern Iraq played in 2014. The initial risk of tough sanctions on Iran kept oil prices elevated even as surging U.S. shale production and sluggish growth in oil consumption pointed towards an emerging surplus. In the event, the United States offered more generous waivers to enable Iran’s customers to continue purchasing crude, backing away from an earlier strategy of cutting Iran’s exports to zero. Much the same thing happened in June 2014, when Islamist fighters failed to capture the oilfields around Kirkuk and Iraqi Kurdistan or advance towards the oilfields in the south, contrary to earlier fears. With the resumption of oil exports from Libya and the continuation of shipments from Iraq, oil traders turned their attention to the accelerating shale production and fading consumption growth in the second half of 2014. U.S. crude and condensates production surged by 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 12 months to August 2018, even more than the 1.5 million bpd increase in the 12 months to June 2014. OPEC is again forecasting that non-OPEC production increases will outstrip global consumption growth in 2019, reducing the need for its own oil, a re-run of conditions in the middle of 2014. Faced with accelerating production and decelerating consumption, OPEC and its allies face the same dilemma as in June 2014: cut output to support prices, or allow prices to fall to protect market share. In 2014, OPEC opted to leave output unchanged and allow prices to fall in a bid to curb surging U.S. shale production, a strategy that proved successful ultimately but ravaged the finances of its members. OPEC ministers must decide whether to pursue a similar course in 2018, or cut their own output, at the risk of prolonging the U.S. shale boom and sacrificing more market share. The oil market is a complex adaptive system which exhibits highly non-linear dynamics and regularly cycles between periods of under- and oversupply. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QEVR3A) Like other complex systems, the market can shift from one phase (undersupply) to another (oversupply) very rapidly and with little warning (“Cyclical behaviour of the oil market”, Reuters, June 2018). So the switch from fears about prospective undersupply in August and September to concerns about emerging oversupply in October and November should not really come as a surprise. There have been strong indications for some time that the oil market was nearing a cyclical peak based on accelerating production and decelerating consumption trends. Hedge fund managers have cut their bullish positions in crude to close to the lowest level for two years in a sign that sentiment has shifted decisively. The critical question is whether the price surge will now be followed by a period of consolidation just below the recent peak (as in 2003-2004, 2006-2007 and 2011-2014) or a deep slump (2008-2009 and 2014-2016). At this point, it is impossible to determine which outcome is more likely, but it will most likely depend on the interplay between four main factors: John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-11-13,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain plans to propose a ban on sales of petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2040, government sources said on Tuesday, joining a string of countries taking aim at polluting vehicles to help cut greenhouse gas emissions. The plan is included in a draft document for a law on climate change which Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s government hopes to present to parliament by the end of the year. “Some of the most important necessary changes affect transport,” the document said. “From 2040, the registration and sale in Spain of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles that directly emit carbon dioxide will not be permitted.” Once finalised, the climate change law will require approval by parliament, where Sanchez holds less than a quarter of the seats. Sanchez has struggled to find support for any major proposals, including next year’s budget, in the face of opposition led by the conservative People’s Party which dominates the upper and lower houses. Britain and France have already pledged to ban petrol and diesel cars from 2040, which will mean big changes for the global car industry and put a squeeze on oil producers' profits. [reut.rs/2RTt8II] Some British politicians have said London should bring the ban forward to 2032, a more ambitious deadline already adopted by Scotland, while Denmark wants to make the move by 2030. Underlining his green ambitions, Sanchez brought environment and energy together into one ministry, which has since passed measures aimed at reducing electricity prices and favors promoting renewable energy. Under the current climate change plan, Madrid aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

2018-11-13,"BOGOTA, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Colombian state-run oil company Ecopetrol said on Tuesday that three new bombings of the Cano Limon pipeline have caused contamination in several waterways in the country’s northeastern Arauca province. The attacks on Sunday and Monday brought total bombings of the 485-mile (780-km) pipeline to 82 this year. Cano Limon, which can transport up to 210,000 barrels of oil per day, has been out of service for much of 2018 because of bombings and illegal taps and was not functioning at the time of the latest attacks. It was also bombed on Saturday. The regular bombings have not affected exports or production at the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp , because crude is being moved through the nearby Bicentenario pipeline. The latest attacks sent oil spilling into nearby waterways and the company has alerted towns to possible water contamination, Ecopetrol said. The company does not often name the group it holds responsible for the bombings, but military sources cited fighters from the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group. ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, has about 1,500 combatants and opposes multinational companies that its leaders accuse of seizing natural resources without benefiting Colombians. Colombian President Ivan Duque has demanded the group free all of its hostages and cease criminal activities before he will consider restarting peace talks that began last year under his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos.

2018-11-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Big Oil is today in a spending sweet spot as years of cost cuts and rising oil prices converge but investments will need to rise after 2020 to boost output, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said on Tuesday. Oil and gas giants such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), Chevron (CVX.N) and BP (BP.L) are generating as much cash at today’s oil prices of around $70 a barrel as they did in 2014, before crude spiraled down from over $100 a barrel to lows of below $30 a barrel. As they emerge from the deepest downturn in decades, boards have vowed to remain thrifty and stick to lower spending targets in order to return value to shareholders after years of pain. Alastair Bishop, director and portfolio manager in BlackRock’s natural resources team, which has major holdings in the world’s five largest oil and gas companies, said he did not expect capital expenditure, or capex, to rise in the near term.  “It is a sweet spot for IOCs (international oil companies) where they have relatively low cost inflation, a reasonable oil price and at these levels they can generate significant cashflow to go toward paying down debt (and share) buybacks,” Bishop told Reuters in an interview.     BlackRock is the largest investor in Shell and BP and among the top five in Total (TOTF.PA), Exxon (XOM.N) and Chevron, Eikon Refinitiv data shows. Unlike earlier in the decade, when oil companies raced to grow production to meet soaring demand in China, boards are today focused on returns from investments, Bishop said. “I am not sure investors are wanting large IOCs to be chasing growth. There is much greater interest in generating returns and free cash flow.” But given the nature of the business where fields naturally decline as they age and take years to develop, investments will have to grow after 2020 to avoid a dip in production. “Would I be surprised if beyond 2020 capex budgets start to move higher? No, I wouldn’t. There will be a little cost inflation and they will need to start thinking about their production profile into the 2020s,” Bishop said. The appetite for huge multi-billion-dollar projects such as deepwater oil fields and large gas processing facilities that became the trademark for Big Oil has however weakened, Bishop said.  Instead, companies should opt for smaller-scale and phased projects where spending is better controlled such as shale oil and offshore field expansions as well as non-oil and gas projects such as chemical plants and power generation, he added. “There seems to be less appetite for just ploughing money straight back into the ground,” according to Bishop. “From our side, unless you have new opportunities right at the bottom of the cost curve we are not that desperate for you to drive volume growth in terms of oil.” GRAPHIC: Big Oil cashflow - tmsnrt.rs/2Pn84xn BlackRock sees the transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner low-carbon energy happening faster than many oil companies expect, with oil demand peaking in the early 2030s, Bishop said, around a decade earlier than most other forecasts.  But what role oil majors will play in the transition remains unclear. Europe’s energy giants have stepped up investments in low-carbon energies following the landmark U.N.-backed 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, in contrast with their U.S. rivals. “Levels the Europeans are spending in that area look entirely reasonable to me,” Bishop said. “If they can prove the business model works then it would make sense for them to start allocating more.” Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Adrian Croft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oilmajors-blackrock/oil-majors-spending-sweet-spot-to-last-to-2020-blackrock-idUKL8N1XO45U,13 Nov 2018,"Big Oil is today in a spending

2018-11-13,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Innogy (IGY.DE) lowered profit forecasts for its renewables and retail operations on Tuesday, businesses which will be owned by RWE (RWEG.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE) following a planned breakup of the energy provider. “Since May the average utilisation at our wind power assets was significantly below the annual mean,” Chief Financial Officer Bernhard Guenther told journalists during a call. In retail energy he said intensifying competition in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium was burdening operating profit. The company lowered its adjusted operating profit forecast in renewables to about 300 million euros (260.27 million pounds) from 350 million and cut its retail profit forecast to over 700 million from about 750 million. Innogy, Germany’s largest energy group by market valuation, is set to be broken up and its assets divided between E.ON and RWE under a landmark deal reached earlier this year. “In the context of the E.ON-RWE asset swap, we see negative read-across for E.ON (which will own Innogy’s retail businesses) and RWE (which will own Innogy’s renewables),” Jefferies analysts said in a note. Shares in E.ON, RWE and Innogy were all flat. A day earlier smaller rival EnBW (EBKG.DE) lowered its renewables outlook, also citing unusually low wind levels that hit wind farm profits. On a group level Innogy confirmed it still expected adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of about 2.7 billion euros and adjusted net income of more than 1.1 billion. On Tuesday it reported an 11 percent fall in nine-month adjusted EBIT of 1.9 billion euros. In Britain, Innogy is in the process of forming a retail joint venture with SSE (SSE.L) but the process is being delayed due to renegotiations prompted by toughened market conditions. Guenther said the two sides remain focussed on forming the venture but he could not rule out that the talks with SSE could fall apart.

2018-11-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Electric vehicles and more efficient fuel technology will cut transportation demand for oil by 2040 more than previously expected, but the world may still face a supply crunch without enough investment in new production, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. Oil demand is not expected to peak before 2040, the Paris-based IEA said in its 2018 World Energy Outlook. The IEA’s central scenario is for demand to grow by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) on average every year to 2025, before settling at a steadier rate of 250,000 bpd to 2040 when it will peak at 106.3 million bpd. “In the New Policies Scenario, demand in 2040 has been revised up by more than 1 million bpd compared with last year’s outlook largely because of faster near-term growth and changes to fuel efficiency policies in the United States,” the agency said. GRAPHIC: Oil supply outlook - tmsnrt.rs/2QElVvQ The IEA believes there will be around 300 million electric vehicles on the road by 2040, no change on its estimate a year ago. But it now expects those vehicles will cut demand by 3.3 million bpd, up from a previous estimated loss of 2.5 million bpd in its last World Energy Outlook. “... Efficiency measures are even more important to stem oil demand growth: improvements in the efficiency of the non-electric car fleet avoid over 9 million bpd of oil demand in 2040,” the IEA said.     Oil demand for road transport is expected to reach 44.9 million bpd by 2040, up from 41.2 million bpd in 2017, while industrial and petrochemical demand is forecast to reach 23.3 million bpd by 2040, from 17.8 million bpd in 2017. GRAPHIC: Oil supply and demand outllok -IEA - tmsnrt.rs/2QLCANS All global oil demand growth will stem from developing economies, led by China and India, while demand in advanced economies is expected to drop by more than 400,000 bpd on average each year to 2040, the IEA said. The IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, maintained its forecast for the global car fleet to nearly double by 2040 from today, growing by 80 percent to 2 billion. On the supply side, the United States, already the world’s biggest producer, will dominate output growth to 2025, with an increase of 5.2 million bpd, from current levels around 11.6 million bpd. From that point onwards, the IEA expects U.S. oil production to decline and the market share of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will climb to 45 percent by 2040, from closer to 30 percent today. GRAPHIC: Electricity demand growth -IEA - tmsnrt.rs/2QJGpn6 New sources of supply will be needed whether or not demand peaks, the agency said.  “The analysis shows oil consumption growing in coming decades, due to rising petrochemicals, trucking and aviation demand. But meeting this growth in the near term means that approvals of conventional oil projects need to double from their current low levels,” IEA director Fatih Birol said. “Without such a pick-up in investment, U.S. shale production, which has already been expanding at record pace, would have to add more than 10 million bpd from today to 2025, the equivalent of adding another Russia to global supply in seven years – which would be an historically unprecedented feat.” Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-iea-demand/update-1-global-oil-demand-under-growing-threat-from-electric-cars-cleaner-fuel-idUKL8N1XO4Q9,13 Nov 2018,"* But electric cars, fuel efficiency to have bigger impact

2018-11-13,"(Repeats Nov. 12 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QCWjzw By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have sold the equivalent of almost half a billion barrels of crude oil and refined products in the last six weeks, as worries about slowing demand replaced earlier concern over sanctions on Iran. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six major petroleum futures and options contracts by another 108 million barrels in the week to Nov. 6. Portfolio managers have sold 479 million barrels of crude and products since the end of September, the largest reduction in any six-week period since at least 2013 and probably the largest ever in a comparable timeframe (tmsnrt.rs/2QCWjzw). Funds now hold fewer than four bullish long positions for every short bearish one, down from more than 12:1 at the end of September and the lowest ratio since August 2017. Most of the adjustment has come from the long side of the market, as formerly bullish hedge funds liquidate positions accumulated in the second half of 2017 and earlier in 2018. The number of bullish long positions has fallen to just 849 million barrels, from 1.195 billion six weeks ago and a record 1.625 billion at the start of the year. Bullish positions are now at the lowest level since September 2016, according to an analysis of position data published by regulators and exchanges. But some fund managers have begun to turn outright bearish, with short positions now up to 228 million barrels from just 96 million barrels six weeks ago. Heavy selling by funds has helped push oil prices down more than $15 per barrel (17 percent) since Oct. 3. And since most hedge fund positions are held in contracts near to maturity, the selling has had a disproportionate impact at the front end of the futures curve, pushing crude futures prices deep into contango. Portfolio managers have reacted to an increasingly bearish news flow amid signs the oil market has passed its current cyclical peak. Production growth is accelerating while consumption growth is slowing - conditions reminiscent of cyclical peaks in mid-2014 and mid-2008. OPEC members and their allies have been boosting output, partly in response to political pressure from the White House. U.S. shale producers have ramped up their own production at the fastest rate on record, with output up by more than 2 million barrels per day in the 12 months to August. And the United States has issued waivers to allow some of Iran’s most important customers to continue buying oil despite the reimposition of sanctions, waivers that have been more generous than previously expected. At the same time, oil traders have become increasingly worried about the possibility of a global economic slowdown or even a recession hitting oil demand next year. And there are signs higher oil prices have begun to prompt increased interest in fuel efficiency and other behavioural changes among consumers, with consumption growth slowing from rapid rates in 2016 and 2017. With the market on course for oversupply, oil prices needed to fall from recent highs to curb production, boost consumption and avert a large buildup in excess inventories in 2019. Price falls have already begun to enforce the rebalancing process, with OPEC and its allies starting to discuss production cuts of as much as 1 million barrels per day. Some observers have expressed surprise at how quickly market commentary has shifted from the need for more oil to concerns about oversupply, but the speed of the shift is not unusual. In 2008 and 2014, market commentary shifted from fears about undersupply to oversupply within three to four months around the peak, and something similar appears to be happening this time.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $59.00 per barrel at 0014 GMT, down 93 cents, or 1.6 percent from their last settlement. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, however both oil price benchmarks have shed more than 20 percent in value since early October. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which Saudi Arabia de-facto leads, agreed there was a need to cut oil supply next year by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from October levels to prevent oversupply. U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on Saudi Arabia and OPEC not to cut supply in order to prop up the market. “Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent to a 1-1/2 week trough, with Australian and New Zealand shares opening sharply lower. The Asia ex-Japan index is down 15.5 percent so far this year, after a solid 33.5 percent gain in 2017, with October the worst month since mid-2015. Concerns about a slowdown in China and the Asian region more broadly due to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods had spooked investors, sparking the largest monthly foreign outflows from Asia last month since August 2011, said Khoon Goh, Singapore-based head of Asia research for ANZ Banking Group. Funds returned over the early part of November on hopes that U.S.-China tensions would ease, Goh added, with the focus squarely on a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this month. “The outcome of the meeting will have an important influence on portfolio flows in Asia into the end of the year,” Goh added. Worryingly, the Trump administration is broadening its China trade battle beyond tariffs with a plan to use export controls, indictments and other tools to counter the theft of intellectual property, the Wall Street Journal reported citing sources. Asian markets have also been hammered as risk assets have been hurt by rising U.S. interest rates. Overnight in Wall Street, major U.S. stock indexes dropped more than 1 percent, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumping over 2 percent. Indexes were weighed down by a 4.3 percent slump in index heavyweight Apple, after three iPhone parts suppliers issued warning on results. In Europe, fears about a no-deal Brexit and a growing rift over Italy’s budget hit the euro and the pound, pushing the dollar’s index to 97.64 against a basket of currencies, a level not seen seen mid 2017. The greenback also strengthened on bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will increase interest rates next month. The Fed’s San Francisco President Mary Daly said on Monday the U.S. central bank should continue to raise rates gradually with her “modal” forecast showing two to three rate hikes over the next period of time. The euro was last at $1.12 after breaking below important chart support of $1.13. Sterling fell to $1.285 after three straight sessions of losses took it to the lowest since Nov.1 as there were still considerable unresolved issues with the European Union over Brexit, British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday. Oil prices fell again after declining for a record 11th consecutive session amid softening demand and as Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output reductions. U.S. crude fell 82 cents to $59.11 a barrel. Brent crude futures slipped $1.20 to $68.97. Spot gold was a tad firmer at $1,201.4.

2018-11-13,"* Natural gas will be fastest growing fossil fuel * Global gas demand to rise by 1.6 pct a year to 2040 * Coal to fall behind renewables in power generation mix By Nina Chestney LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Natural gas is expected to overtake coal as the world’s second largest energy source after oil by 2030 due to a drive to cut air pollution and the rise in liquefied natural gas (LNG) use, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday, The Paris-based IEA said in its World Energy Outlook 2018 that energy demand would grow by more than a quarter between 2017 and 2040 assuming more efficient use of energy - but would rise by twice that much without such improvements. Global gas demand would increase by 1.6 percent a year to 2040 and would be 45 percent higher by then than today, it said. The estimates are based on the IEA’s “New Policies Scenario” that takes into account legislation and policies to reduce emissions and fight climate change. They also assume more energy efficiencies in fuel use, buildings and other factors. “Natural gas is the fastest growing fossil fuel in the New Policies Scenario, overtaking coal by 2030 to become the second-largest source of energy after oil,” the report said. China, already the world’s biggest oil and coal importer, would soon become the largest importer of gas and net imports would approach the level of the European Union by 2040, the IEA said. According to Reuters calculations, based on China’s General Administration of Customs data, China has already overtaken Japan as the world’s top natural gas importer. Although China is the world’s third-biggest user of natural gas behind the United States and Russia, it has to import about 40 percent of its needs as local production cannot keep pace. Emerging economies in Asia would account for about half of total global gas demand growth and their share of LNG imports would double to 60 percent by 2040, the IEA report said. “Although talk of a global gas market similar to that of oil is premature, LNG trade has expanded substantially in volume since 2010 and has reached previously isolated markets,” it said. LNG involves cooling gas to a liquid so it can transported by ship. The United States would account for 40 percent of total gas production growth to 2025, the IEA said, while other sources would take over as U.S. shale gas output flattened and other nations started turning to unconventional methods of gas production, such as hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Global electricity demand will grow 2.1 percent a year, mostly driven by rising use in developing economies. Electricity will account for a quarter of energy used by end users such as consumers and industry by 2040, it said. Coal and renewables will swap their positions in the power generation mix. The share of coal is forecast to fall from about 40 percent today to a quarter in 2040 while renewables would grow to just over 40 percent from a quarter now. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will continue to grow at a slow but steady pace to 2040. From 2017 levels, the IEA said CO2 emissions would rise by 10 percent to 36 gigatonnes in 2040, mostly driven by growth in oil and gas. This trajectory was “far out of step” with what scientific knowledge says would be required to tackle climate change, the report said.

2018-11-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Electric vehicles and more efficient fuel technology will cut transportation demand for oil by 2040 more than previously expected, but the world may still face a supply crunch without enough investment in new production, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. Oil demand is not expected to peak before 2040, the Paris-based IEA said in its 2018 World Energy Outlook. The IEA’s central scenario is for demand to grow by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) on average every year to 2025, before settling at a steadier rate of 250,000 bpd to 2040 when it will peak at 106.3 million bpd. “In the New Policies Scenario, demand in 2040 has been revised up by more than 1 million bpd compared with last year’s outlook largely because of faster near-term growth and changes to fuel efficiency policies in the United States,” the agency said. The IEA believes there will be around 300 million electric vehicles on the road by 2040, no change on its estimate a year ago. But it now expects those vehicles will cut demand by 3.3 million bpd, up from a previous estimated loss of 2.5 million bpd in its last World Energy Outlook. “... Efficiency measures are even more important to stem oil demand growth: improvements in the efficiency of the non-electric car fleet avoid over 9 million bpd of oil demand in 2040,” the IEA said.     Oil demand for road transport is expected to reach 44.9 million bpd by 2040, up from 41.2 million bpd in 2017, while industrial and petrochemical demand is forecast to reach 23.3 million bpd by 2040, from 17.8 million bpd in 2017.     All global oil demand growth will stem from developing economies, led by China and India, while demand in advanced economies is expected to drop by more than 400,000 bpd on average each year to 2040, the IEA said. The IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, maintained its forecast for the global car fleet to nearly double by 2040 from today, growing by 80 percent to 2 billion. On the supply side, the United States, already the world’s biggest producer, will dominate output growth to 2025, with an increase of 5.2 million bpd, from current levels around 11.6 million bpd. From that point onwards, the IEA expects U.S. oil production to decline and the market share of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will climb to 45 percent by 2040, from closer to 30 percent today. New sources of supply will be needed whether or not demand peaks, the agency said.  “The analysis shows oil consumption growing in coming decades, due to rising petrochemicals, trucking and aviation demand. But meeting this growth in the near term means that approvals of conventional oil projects need to double from their current low levels,” IEA director Fatih Birol said. “Without such a pick-up in investment, U.S. shale production, which has already been expanding at record pace, would have to add more than 10 million bpd from today to 2025, the equivalent of adding another Russia to global supply in seven years – which would be an historically unprecedented feat.” Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-iea-demand/global-oil-demand-under-growing-threat-from-electric-cars-cleaner-fuel-idUKL8N1XN5DM,13 Nov 2018,"Electric vehicles and more

2018-11-13,"SINGAPORE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - The Singapore unit of Vietnamese oil trader Petrolimex has filed an application in the Singapore High Court to wind up marine fuel supplier Brightoil Petroleum Singapore Pte Ltd, according to a legal notice in The Straits Times newspaper dated Nov. 12. In the notice, law firm Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP, describing itself as solicitors for the plaintiff, said the Vietnamese company was a creditor of Brightoil and the application would be heard on Nov. 23. A High Court official confirmed the hearing date. Under Singaporean law, shareholders or creditors can apply to wind up a company with the goal of collecting and selling assets in order to pay outstanding debt, expenses or costs. Petrolimex Singapore confirmed the authenticity of the notice but declined to comment further. Rajah & Tann Singapore did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. The acting Chief Executive Officer of Brightoil Petroleum Singapore, Stephen Qi, told Reuters on Tuesday by e-mail the company’s operations remained normal and its lawyers were looking into the matter. Port authorities in 2017 ranked Brightoil Singapore, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Brightoil Petroleum, as the 17th largest supplier of marine fuels in Singapore, the world’s largest marine refuelling hub. Brightoil Petroleum suspended trading in its shares in October last year after delaying the release of its 2017 annual financial results.

2018-11-13,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares pared losses on Tuesday as hopes for a de-escalation in the Sino-U.S. tariff war rose on a report that China’s top trade negotiator was preparing to visit the United States ahead of a meeting between the two countries’ leaders. Spreadbetters pointed to a positive start for Europe and U.S. with E-minis for the S&P 500 and the Dow up 0.5 percent each. FTSE futures were up 0.2 percent.  The South China Morning Post reported, citing sources from both sides, that China’s top trade negotiator Liu He may visit Washington to prepare for the talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina later this month. “This news is being perceived as a positive outcome,” said Rodrigo Catril, markets strategist at National Australia Bank. “So, we have seen a broad improvement in sentiment across markets.” “This is good news but there is still some caution. We obviously need more detail on it.” The Australian dollar which is often played as a liquid proxy for Chinese assets, jumped 0.6 percent to $0.7214 in late afternoon trade.  Chinese shares reversed earlier losses with the blue-chip index climbing about 1 percent.  That helped lift MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan off the day’s low. It was still down 0.4 percent after skidding 1.7 percent at one point. Fears of a likely peak in corporate earnings growth, softening global demand and faster rate hikes in the United States have put global investors on edge over the past month, prompting them to take money off the table before year-end. Japan’s Nikkei dived more than 2 percent, led by losses in electric machinery makers and suppliers of Apple’s iPhone parts after three suppliers issued profit warnings, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumping over 2 percent. The weakened outlook triggered a steep selloff in Asian tech firms, with shares in Japan Display plummeting over 11 percent while Murata Manufacturing and TDK Corp dived as much as 8.9 percent and 8.4 percent respectively.   Taiwanese companies in the iPhone supply chain such as Genius and Hon Hai were also deep in the red. “Market participants are gradually thinking that this technology stocks boom is going to end before long,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, Japan-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We are suggesting our clients shift from any technology stocks to quality names, stocks with high return on equity and low leverage,” Shigemi said, without identifying particular shares. The Asia ex-Japan index is now down nearly 17 percent this year, after a solid 33.5 percent gain in 2017, with October the worst month since mid-2015. Investor sentiment has been dented by the deepening trade battle between the United States and China, with Asian emerging markets suffering their largest monthly foreign outflows since August 2011 last month, said Khoon Goh, Singapore-based head of Asia research for ANZ Banking Group. Funds returned over the earlier part of November on hopes that U.S.-China tensions would ease, Goh noted, with the focus on this month’s Trump-Xi meeting. “The outcome of the meeting will have an important influence on portfolio flows in Asia into the end of the year,” Goh added. Risk assets including Asian equities have also been hurt by rising U.S. interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to tighten policy further in December. In Europe, fears that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a Brexit deal and a growing rift over Italy’s budget hit the euro and the pound, pushing the dollar index against a basket of currencies to 97.693, a level not seen since mid 2017. It was last flat at 97.5. The euro gained 0.2 percent to trade at $1.1243 on Tuesday, after tumbling more than one percent versus the dollar on Monday.

2018-11-13,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The liquefied natural gas (LNG) market in Asia appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that China will still buy robust volumes over winter, but not quite at the rate it did last year. In the winter of 2017-18 China’s unrestrained appetite for the super-chilled fuel drove spot prices to what was then a three-year high, upending a market that had previously believed a supply surplus was looming. However, this time around China appears to be managing its winter demand in a more orderly fashion. That means while it will still likely increase cargoes in the coming months, it won’t be trying to suck every available drop of LNG from the market. Having been caught short of natural gas last winter, China has taken steps to ensure that the coming winter will see adequate supplies. It has boosted storage facilities and domestic output, while maximising use of pipelines from Asia and LNG terminals are being maximised. (Graphic: China LNG imports vs spot price: tmsnrt.rs/2QDYeE3) China has expanded use of natural gas in winter, primarily for heating as part of its policy of burning less coal in order to improve air quality. Domestic natural gas production rose 6.2 percent to 116.17 billion cubic metres (bcm), equivalent to about 86 million tonnes of LNG, in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year, according to official data. Natural gas imports from both LNG and pipelines were up 33 percent in the first 10 months of the year to 72.06 million tonnes. State-controlled oil and gas major Sinopec said on Monday that it will boost its supply of natural gas for the heating season by 18 percent from last winter to 18.17 bcm, and that its three LNG receiving terminals are fully booked for December and January. PetroChina, another state-controlled oil and gas major, said on Monday that the Central Asia-China pipeline will operate at 100 percent capacity this winter and supply a record 160 million cubic metres of natural gas per day. The separate announcements on the same day by China’s two largest oil and gas companies is an illustration that Beijing is determined that this winter won’t see a repeat of last year’s supply crunch and price spike. So far, the market seems to be in agreement, with the spot price actually weakening from late September to early November, a period when it has started rising in past years. Spot cargoes for December were assessed last week at $10.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), up 10 cents from the prior week and the first gain in six weeks. The decline in spot LNG prices over the past two months, and the tentative move higher last week, contrast with the 90 percent surge in prices last year between late August and the peak of $11.50 per mmBtu, reached in the week to Jan. 12. Some Chinese LNG buyers have scaled back their winter purchase plans and are re-selling cargoes in the spot market, Wen Wang, a senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie said in a note on Monday. “Industrial coal-to-gas switching in the second half of 2018 could fall short of expectations, reflected by weak domestic LNG prices,” the consultant said. “Policy signals also suggest that winter coal-to-gas switching in the heating sector could be moderate compared to last year.” China did boost LNG imports in October from September, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. Imports were 4.49 million tonnes in October, up from 3.97 million in September but down from August’s 4.52 million. For November, the shipping data suggest that imports will be at least 3.7 million tonnes - although that figure can still rise as more vessels depart for China from Asian and Australian producers. The overall message is that while China is still the key growth market for LNG, it’s unlikely to exert the same influence on prices this winter as it did last year.

2018-11-13,"* Eyes on $7 bln hydrogen market in Asia by 2030 * Production cost seen as biggest hurdle * Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries working to drive down costs * Woodside sees “blue hydrogen” from gas as key to scale By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Australia, the world’s biggest coal exporter and second-biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, wants to build its next big energy industry around exploiting solar and wind power along with brown coal to produce hydrogen. The same fuel used to power rockets into space, hydrogen has untapped energy potential without the downside of the carbon emissions from natural gas and coal. Australia is seeking to supply what could be a $7 billion market for hydrogen to China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore by 2030, according to a report done for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency by consultants ACIL Allen. While initially just a fraction of Australia’s LNG exports, forecast at A$48 billion ($35 billion) in 2019, hydrogen exports could grow the same way that Australia’s LNG industry has over the past 30 years, according to ACIL Allen, the Australian government, and local gas producer Woodside Petroleum. The global drive to cut carbon emissions and the falling cost of wind and solar power has turned hydrogen fuel into an opportunity now after the idea was mooted more than four decades ago. “Many of our traditional gas markets — Japan, Korea — have adopted strategies that put hydrogen and ultimately renewable hydrogen at the core of their energy future. So we want to make sure we’ve got the capability of providing for that market,” Western Australia’s Regional Development Minister Alannah MacTiernan told Reuters. The state on Oct. 25 launched a Renewable Hydrogen Council, including Woodside, French power producer Engie SA, and Norway’s Yara International, to form a plan to use land, wind and solar resources to produce hydrogen. “The development of a hydrogen business is similar to the early days of the LNG business,” said Shaun Gregory, Woodside’s executive vice president for exploration and technology. To reduce global warming, hydrogen could be used in fuel cells for vehicles and manufacturing plants, and could eventually replace natural gas for space heating, water heating and cooking in homes. Output may start through the gasification of brown coal with the hydrogen and carbon dioxide separated out. But eventually wind and solar power would be used to crack water to become the biggest hydrogen source. Currently, hydrogen derived from coal gasification is cheaper to produce than from water. The goal is drive down the costs of a hydrogen cargo by 2030 to a level that Japanese buyers would accept, said Australia’s Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, who is advising the government on a hydrogen strategy. “The biggest potential show-stopper is that we can’t meet the price target,” he told Reuters. Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) is leading a A$500 million demonstration project to produce hydrogen from brown coal from Australia’s largest coal mine, Loy Yang in Victoria. “At this point it is clearly cheaper (than hydrogen from renewables), but in the future they might be the same,” KHI Executive Officer Eiichi Harada told Reuters at the GHGT-14 conference in Melbourne on Oct. 25. Meanwhile, Woodside is working with Korea Gas Corp to potentially produce “blue hydrogen” in a carbon-neutral process of reforming methane from natural gas while eventually shifting to solar or wind to crack water to make “green hydrogen” “We believe blue hydrogen – carbon neutral hydrogen, sourced from gas - is the key to building scale and lowering costs in hydrogen transport and distribution, which will enable an earlier transition to green hydrogen,” Woodside’s Gregory said in an email.

2018-11-13,"MELBOURNE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - China’s appetite for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has not slowed, but its purchases have been spread more evenly, avoiding last year’s sudden spike to meet winter demand, Australia’s top independent LNG producer said on Tuesday. LNG demand from North Asia’s main hubs in Japan, China and South Korea has slowed in recent weeks, raising concern that forecasts for a milder than usual winter may dent consumption. There are also signs that the ongoing Sino-American trade war is starting to dent industry in China. “We’re not seeing a slowdown,” Woodside Petroleum Chief Executive Peter Coleman said. “China learned from last year, from the last winter, that the peakiness in demand in the market really distorted the market. It distorted prices, and it meant they were not able to get gas to consumers in China during the peak of winter.” He said China has flattened that demand by buying across the year, while the volume overall has grown. “So the total is increasing, but the peakiness has gone out of it,” Coleman told reporters after speaking at the Melbourne Mining Club. Woodside sells most of its LNG to customers in Japan and South Korea but has a tie-up with privately owned ENN Group to boost sales in China. Coleman said Chinese demand for cargoes for delivery in February would be the real measure of how prepared the system is for winter. Those cargoes would need to be bought in December. “So in December we’ll start to see how people feel they’re positioned,” he said. Energy consultants Wood Mackenzie expects China’s LNG demand to be 28 million tonnes this winter season, which runs from mid-November to mid-March, up 30 percent from last winter. Coleman said in the short-term there had been no impact from the U.S. trade war with China, as U.S. LNG cargoes were making bigger margins flowing into Europe instead of Asia at the moment. Longer term, the trade war may delay final investment decisions for some new LNG projects in the United States, especially those being built by smaller companies, which need buyers to underpin long term contracts. “You’re not seeing the Chinese buyer in that particular market at the moment,” Coleman said. Australian-listed LNG Ltd last month said it was delaying a final decision on whether to build its Magnolia LNG plant in Louisiana, citing difficulty in lining up Chinese customers due to the trade war.

2018-11-13,"PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Search teams have recovered remains of 42 people killed by a fierce wildfire that largely incinerated the town of Paradise in northern California, marking the greatest loss of life from a wild land blaze in state history, authorities said on Monday. The latest death toll, up from 29 tallied over the weekend, was announced by Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea at an evening news conference in the nearby city of Chico after authorities found the bodies of 13 more victims of the devastating blaze dubbed the Camp Fire. The fire already ranked as the most destructive on record in California in terms of property losses, having consumed more than 7,100 homes and other structures since igniting on Thursday in Butte County’s Sierra foothills, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. Honea said 228 people were officially listed as missing in the disaster, but added that his office had received requests to check on the wellbeing of more than 1,500 people who had not been heard from by loved ones. Of those cases, 231 individuals had turned up safe, he said. Authorities made clear, however, that they are bracing for the number of fatalities to climb. In addition to 13 coroner-led recovery teams working in the fire zone, 150 search-and-recovery personnel were due to arrive on Tuesday, Honea said.  (GRAPHIC: Deadly California fires: tmsnrt.rs/2Plpuui ) The sheriff said he also has requested three portable morgue teams from the U.S. military, a “disaster mortuary” crew and an unspecified number of cadaver dog units to assist in the search for human remains. Three groups of forensic anthropologists were also called in to help, he said. The bulk of the destruction and loss of life occurred in and around the town of Paradise, where flames reduced most of the buildings to ash and rubble on Thursday night, just hours after the blaze erupted. Some 52,000 people remained under evacuation orders, the sheriff said. The 42 confirmed fatalities marked the highest death toll in history from a single California wildfire, Honea said, far surpassing the previous record of 29 lives lost in 1933 from the Griffith Park blaze in Los Angeles. Authorities reported two more people perished over the weekend in a separate blaze, dubbed the Woolsey Fire, that has destroyed 435 structures and displaced some 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near Southern California’s Malibu coast, west of Los Angeles. President Donald Trump, who drew criticism over the weekend for erroneously blaming the fires on “gross mismanagement” of forests, approved California Governor Jerry Brown’s request for a major disaster declaration on Monday. The measure hastens availability of federal emergency aid to fire-stricken regions of the state. The fires have spread with an erratic intensity that has strained firefighting resources while catching many residents by surprise. The bodies of some of the Camp Fire victims were found in burned-out wreckage of vehicles that were overrun by walls of fire as evacuees tried to flee, only to be trapped in deadly knots of traffic gridlock on Thursday night. “It was very scary,” Mayor Jody Jones recounted of her family’s own harrowing escape from their home as fire raged all around them.  “It took a long time to get out. There was fire on both sides of the car. You could feel the heat coming in through the car,” she told CNN. Jones said her family is now living in their mobile home parked in a vacant lot.   More than 15,000 structures were threatened by the Camp Fire on Monday in an area so thick with smoke that visibility was reduced in some places to less than half a mile.  Perilous winds that stoked the fire through drought-parched  brush and chaparral abated on Saturday, giving firefighters a chance to gain some ground against the flames.  High winds returned on Sunday but fell again Monday morning, with crews managing to carve containment lines around 30 percent of the Camp Fire perimeter, an area encompassing 117,000 acres of scorched, smoldering terrain. The Woolsey Fire has blackened nearly 94,000 acres and was also 30 percent contained as of Monday night, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). Winds of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km per hour) were expected to continue in Southern California through Tuesday, heightening the risk of fresh blazes ignited by scattered embers. CalFire said 57,000 structures were still in harm’s way from the Woolsey Fire. Forecasts called for winds to pick up again Monday night in Butte County, though with less force than previous days, National Weather Service meteorologist Aviva Braun told reporters. Nearly 9,000 firefighters, many from out of state, were battling to suppress the Camp Fire, the Woolsey Fire and a handful of smaller Southern California blazes, backed by squadrons of water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers. Some evacuees in Malibu, a seaside community whose residents include a number of Hollywood celebrities, were allowed to return home but were left without power or cellphone service. California has endured two of the worst wildfire seasons in its history over the past couple of years, a situation experts attribute in large part to prolonged drought across much of the Western United States. Forty-six people died in a flurry of wind-driven wildfires that swept northern California’s wine country in October of last year, destroying some 8,900 homes and other structures. The worst of those blazes, dubbed the Tubbs Fire, was blamed for 22 of the deaths.

The South China Morning Post reported, citing sources from both sides, that Liu He may visit Washington as part of the preparations for the talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina later this month. “This news is being perceived as a positive outcome,” said Rodrigo Catril, markets strategist at National Australia Bank. “So, we have seen a broad improvement in sentiment across markets.” “This is good news but there is still some caution. We obviously need more detail on it. This should also be taken in the context of new retaliatory measures that the U.S. is considering against China.” Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources, the Trump administration is broadening its China trade battle beyond tariffs with a plan to use export controls, indictments and other tools to counter the theft of intellectual property. The Australian dollar which is often played as a liquid proxy to China, jumped 0.6 percent to $0.7214 in late afternoon trading. Chinese shares reversed earlier losses to be in the positive territory. The blue-chip index was last up 0.1 percent. That helped lift MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan off the day’s low. It was still down 0.5 percent after skidding 1.7 percent at one point. Fears of a likely peak in corporate earnings growth, softening global demand and faster rate hikes in the United States have put global investors on edge over the past month, prompting them to take money off the table before year end. Japan’s Nikkei dived over 2 percent, led by losses in electric machinery makers and suppliers of Apple’s iPhone parts after three suppliers issued warnings on results, sending tech-heavy Nasdaq slumping over 2 percent. The grim outlook triggered a steep selloff in Asian tech firms, with shares in Japan Display plummeting over 11 percent while Murata Manufacturing and TDK Corp dived as much as 8.9 percent and 8.4 percent respectively. Taiwanese suppliers of the iPhone such as Genius, Pegatron and Hon Hai were also deep in red. “Market participants are gradually thinking that this technology stocks boom is going to end before long,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, Japan-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We are suggesting our clients to shift from any technology stocks to quality names, stocks with high return-on-equity and low leverage,” Shigemi said without naming any shares. The Asia ex-Japan index is now down nearly 17 percent this year, after a solid 33.5 percent gain in 2017, with October the worst month since mid-2015. Investor sentiment has also been dented by the deepening trade battle between the United States and China, with Asian emerging markets suffering their largest monthly foreign outflows last month since August 2011, according to Khoon Goh, Singapore-based head of Asia research for ANZ Banking Group. Funds returned over the early part of November on hopes that U.S.-China tensions would ease, Goh added, with the focus on this month’s Trump-Xi meeting. “The outcome of the meeting will have an important influence on portfolio flows in Asia into the end of the year,” Goh added. Risk assets including Asian equities have also been hurt by rising U.S. interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to tighten policy further in December. In Europe, fears that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a Brexit deal and a growing rift over Italy’s budget hit the euro and the pound, pushing the dollar’s index to 97.693 against a basket of currencies, a level not seen since mid 2017.

2018-11-13,"HANOI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Vietsovpetro, a Vietnam-Russia oil joint venture, will start crude oil production at the Ca Tam field offshore southern Vietnam from Jan. 15, three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. Ca Tam is the first new field to be brought into production in Vietnam in years after a 2014 plunge in oil prices slashed exploration. The start-up is significant as declining production from the country’s key fields has left it struggling to maintain oil and gas output. Production from Ca Tam, jointly developed by Vietsovpetro, PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corp (PVEP) and Bitexco Group, is forecast to be between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels per day, one of the sources told Reuters. The field in block 09-3/12, 160 km (100 miles) southeast of Vietnam, will be hooked up to the facilities in the nearby block 09-1, which houses the country’s largest oil field Bach Ho, Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam) said last month. “The project will benefit its developers and create jobs for other firms in the local oil and gas industry, especially at the current difficult time,” PetroVietnam said. Readul Islam, a research analyst at Rystad Energy in Singapore said: “We could expect an initial few months of peak production, before production stabilizes to plateau rates between 15,000-20,000 bpd perhaps throughout 2020, at which point it could be making up an estimated 15-20 percent of the Bach Ho heavy grade.” “Being a relatively small field, volumes from Ca Tam could already start declining from 2021,” Islam said. Vietnam’s crude oil output is expected to fall by 10 percent a year through to 2025, PetroVietnam said last month. . Output in 2018 was expected to fall 14.7 percent to 11.3 million metric tonnes, the government said in March. The quality of the new crude from Ca Tam could be heavier than the current Bach Ho heavy grade as PetroVietnam’s trading arm PV Oil has offered a heavier grade of Bach Ho in term tenders, traders said. PV Oil offered 30,000 barrels per day of a heavier Bach Ho crude, with an API gravity of 28-35 degrees, for loading between April and June versus 20,000 bpd of Bach Ho heavy, with an API of 33-35, in the first three months of 2019. The company has also offered 10,000 bpd of light Bach Ho crude with an API of 38-40 for loading in the first half of 2019.

2018-11-13,"(Repeats Nov. 12 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QCWjzw By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have sold the equivalent of almost half a billion barrels of crude oil and refined products in the last six weeks, as worries about slowing demand replaced earlier concern over sanctions on Iran. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six major petroleum futures and options contracts by another 108 million barrels in the week to Nov. 6. Portfolio managers have sold 479 million barrels of crude and products since the end of September, the largest reduction in any six-week period since at least 2013 and probably the largest ever in a comparable timeframe (tmsnrt.rs/2QCWjzw). Funds now hold fewer than four bullish long positions for every short bearish one, down from more than 12:1 at the end of September and the lowest ratio since August 2017. Most of the adjustment has come from the long side of the market, as formerly bullish hedge funds liquidate positions accumulated in the second half of 2017 and earlier in 2018. The number of bullish long positions has fallen to just 849 million barrels, from 1.195 billion six weeks ago and a record 1.625 billion at the start of the year. Bullish positions are now at the lowest level since September 2016, according to an analysis of position data published by regulators and exchanges. But some fund managers have begun to turn outright bearish, with short positions now up to 228 million barrels from just 96 million barrels six weeks ago. Heavy selling by funds has helped push oil prices down more than $15 per barrel (17 percent) since Oct. 3. And since most hedge fund positions are held in contracts near to maturity, the selling has had a disproportionate impact at the front end of the futures curve, pushing crude futures prices deep into contango. Portfolio managers have reacted to an increasingly bearish news flow amid signs the oil market has passed its current cyclical peak. Production growth is accelerating while consumption growth is slowing - conditions reminiscent of cyclical peaks in mid-2014 and mid-2008. OPEC members and their allies have been boosting output, partly in response to political pressure from the White House. U.S. shale producers have ramped up their own production at the fastest rate on record, with output up by more than 2 million barrels per day in the 12 months to August. And the United States has issued waivers to allow some of Iran’s most important customers to continue buying oil despite the reimposition of sanctions, waivers that have been more generous than previously expected. At the same time, oil traders have become increasingly worried about the possibility of a global economic slowdown or even a recession hitting oil demand next year. And there are signs higher oil prices have begun to prompt increased interest in fuel efficiency and other behavioural changes among consumers, with consumption growth slowing from rapid rates in 2016 and 2017. With the market on course for oversupply, oil prices needed to fall from recent highs to curb production, boost consumption and avert a large buildup in excess inventories in 2019. Price falls have already begun to enforce the rebalancing process, with OPEC and its allies starting to discuss production cuts of as much as 1 million barrels per day. Some observers have expressed surprise at how quickly market commentary has shifted from the need for more oil to concerns about oversupply, but the speed of the shift is not unusual. In 2008 and 2014, market commentary shifted from fears about undersupply to oversupply within three to four months around the peak, and something similar appears to be happening this time.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $59.00 per barrel at 0014 GMT, down 93 cents, or 1.6 percent from their last settlement. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, however both oil price benchmarks have shed more than 20 percent in value since early October. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which Saudi Arabia de-facto leads, agreed there was a need to cut oil supply next year by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from October levels to prevent oversupply. U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on Saudi Arabia and OPEC not to cut supply in order to prop up the market. “Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday.

2018-11-13,"* Natural gas will be fastest growing fossil fuel * Global gas demand to rise by 1.6 pct a year to 2040 * Coal to fall behind renewables in power generation mix By Nina Chestney LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Natural gas is expected to overtake coal as the world’s second largest energy source after oil by 2030 due to a drive to cut air pollution and the rise in liquefied natural gas (LNG) use, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday, The Paris-based IEA said in its World Energy Outlook 2018 that energy demand would grow by more than a quarter between 2017 and 2040 assuming more efficient use of energy - but would rise by twice that much without such improvements. Global gas demand would increase by 1.6 percent a year to 2040 and would be 45 percent higher by then than today, it said. The estimates are based on the IEA’s “New Policies Scenario” that takes into account legislation and policies to reduce emissions and fight climate change. They also assume more energy efficiencies in fuel use, buildings and other factors. “Natural gas is the fastest growing fossil fuel in the New Policies Scenario, overtaking coal by 2030 to become the second-largest source of energy after oil,” the report said. China, already the world’s biggest oil and coal importer, would soon become the largest importer of gas and net imports would approach the level of the European Union by 2040, the IEA said. According to Reuters calculations, based on China’s General Administration of Customs data, China has already overtaken Japan as the world’s top natural gas importer. Although China is the world’s third-biggest user of natural gas behind the United States and Russia, it has to import about 40 percent of its needs as local production cannot keep pace. Emerging economies in Asia would account for about half of total global gas demand growth and their share of LNG imports would double to 60 percent by 2040, the IEA report said. “Although talk of a global gas market similar to that of oil is premature, LNG trade has expanded substantially in volume since 2010 and has reached previously isolated markets,” it said. LNG involves cooling gas to a liquid so it can transported by ship. The United States would account for 40 percent of total gas production growth to 2025, the IEA said, while other sources would take over as U.S. shale gas output flattened and other nations started turning to unconventional methods of gas production, such as hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Global electricity demand will grow 2.1 percent a year, mostly driven by rising use in developing economies. Electricity will account for a quarter of energy used by end users such as consumers and industry by 2040, it said. Coal and renewables will swap their positions in the power generation mix. The share of coal is forecast to fall from about 40 percent today to a quarter in 2040 while renewables would grow to just over 40 percent from a quarter now. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will continue to grow at a slow but steady pace to 2040. From 2017 levels, the IEA said CO2 emissions would rise by 10 percent to 36 gigatonnes in 2040, mostly driven by growth in oil and gas. This trajectory was “far out of step” with what scientific knowledge says would be required to tackle climate change, the report said.

2018-11-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Electric vehicles and more efficient fuel technology will cut transportation demand for oil by 2040 more than previously expected, but the world may still face a supply crunch without enough investment in new production, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. Oil demand is not expected to peak before 2040, the Paris-based IEA said in its 2018 World Energy Outlook. The IEA’s central scenario is for demand to grow by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) on average every year to 2025, before settling at a steadier rate of 250,000 bpd to 2040 when it will peak at 106.3 million bpd. “In the New Policies Scenario, demand in 2040 has been revised up by more than 1 million bpd compared with last year’s outlook largely because of faster near-term growth and changes to fuel efficiency policies in the United States,” the agency said. The IEA believes there will be around 300 million electric vehicles on the road by 2040, no change on its estimate a year ago. But it now expects those vehicles will cut demand by 3.3 million bpd, up from a previous estimated loss of 2.5 million bpd in its last World Energy Outlook. “... Efficiency measures are even more important to stem oil demand growth: improvements in the efficiency of the non-electric car fleet avoid over 9 million bpd of oil demand in 2040,” the IEA said.     Oil demand for road transport is expected to reach 44.9 million bpd by 2040, up from 41.2 million bpd in 2017, while industrial and petrochemical demand is forecast to reach 23.3 million bpd by 2040, from 17.8 million bpd in 2017.     All global oil demand growth will stem from developing economies, led by China and India, while demand in advanced economies is expected to drop by more than 400,000 bpd on average each year to 2040, the IEA said. The IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, maintained its forecast for the global car fleet to nearly double by 2040 from today, growing by 80 percent to 2 billion. On the supply side, the United States, already the world’s biggest producer, will dominate output growth to 2025, with an increase of 5.2 million bpd, from current levels around 11.6 million bpd. From that point onwards, the IEA expects U.S. oil production to decline and the market share of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will climb to 45 percent by 2040, from closer to 30 percent today. New sources of supply will be needed whether or not demand peaks, the agency said.  “The analysis shows oil consumption growing in coming decades, due to rising petrochemicals, trucking and aviation demand. But meeting this growth in the near term means that approvals of conventional oil projects need to double from their current low levels,” IEA director Fatih Birol said. “Without such a pick-up in investment, U.S. shale production, which has already been expanding at record pace, would have to add more than 10 million bpd from today to 2025, the equivalent of adding another Russia to global supply in seven years – which would be an historically unprecedented feat.” Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-iea-demand/global-oil-demand-under-growing-threat-from-electric-cars-cleaner-fuel-idUKL8N1XN5DM,13 Nov 2018,"Electric vehicles and more
