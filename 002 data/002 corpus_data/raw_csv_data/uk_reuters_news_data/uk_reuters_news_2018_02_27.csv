2018-02-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate’s second highest-ranking Republican on Tuesday expressed doubt that Congress will pass legislation to increase infrastructure spending this year, citing time constraints. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters: “I think it will (be) challenging. I certainly would be happy if we could, but we’ve got a lot of things to do, that being one of them, and I don’t know if we will have time to get to that,” according to a transcript from his office.  President Donald Trump wants Congress to approve $200 billion in federal spending over 10 years designed to spur $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending. But the bill faces strong opposition from Democrats. Under Senate rules, legislation will need the support of at least nine Democrats.  Congress is grappling with a number of big issues including gun law reforms, immigration and budget issues that make it harder to find time to debate infrastructure spending this year. Asked about Cornyn’s comments, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said officials are “encouraged to see Congress acting on the President’s call, with hearings starting in earnest.”     Congress is holding at least four hearings on infrastructure  over the next two weeks, including a House session Tuesday on energy infrastructure. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and R.D. James, the assistant Secretary of the Army for civil works, will testify before a Senate panel on Thursday. After a school shooting in Florida, Trump canceled a Feb. 16 speech on infrastructure in Orlando and the White House has not rescheduled it. Earlier this month, Trump endorsed hiking the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents a gallon in a meeting with lawmakers,  Democratic Senator Tom Carper said. The gasoline tax would generate new revenue for infrastructure, primarily highways and other road projects. The 18.4-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline has not been hiked since 1993.  Some in Congress say they are open to the idea of increasing the gasoline tax but Trump would need to provide cover to win approval for the politically risky move. Other Senate Republicans have come out firmly against a hike.

2018-02-27,"BERLIN (Reuters) - People in Germany will acquire a legal right to fast internet under a proposed coalition between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), the man expected to become Merkel’s top aide said in remarks published on Wednesday. The SPD and conservatives have agreed that if they take power together, they want to ensure that all regions have access to high-speed internet by 2025. But Helge Braun, designated chancellery chief under the planned coalition, said in an interview with mass-selling Bild newspaper that a ‘grand coalition’ would create the legal framework for people to have a right to fast internet. “Fast internet is just as important as the supply of gas, water and electricity and that’s why this issue is a top priority for the chancellor,” Helge was quoted as saying. “There will be a legal entitlement to fast internet in future,” he said, adding that he expected the federal government and industry to spend at least 100 billion euros on expanding broadband by 2025. The chancellery chief is the chancellor’s top assistant, running the chancellery and ensuring cooperation between the ministries. Germany ranks 28th out of 32 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s league table of access to fast internet.   The SPD’s members still have the chance to veto the ‘grand coalition’ deal and the result of a ballot of the SPD’s roughly 464,000 members is due on Sunday. Braun also said the process of asylum applications needed to be sped up and deportations made easier. More than a million migrants have arrived in Germany since mid-2015, many of them fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere. “So that deportations function smoothly, we need more administrative judges and we need to make it easier to put people in pre-departure custody,” he said. “We also need more agreements with the countries of origin for them to take people back.” Reporting by Michelle Martin, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-internet/german-coalition-would-create-legal-right-to-fast-internet-bild-idUKL8N1QH87V,27 Feb 2018,"People in Germany will acquire a

2018-02-27,"BOGOTA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Ecopetrol, Colombia’s state-run oil company, said on Tuesday its net profit during 2017 rose to 6.6 trillion pesos ($2.32 billion), its highest reported earnings in four years and more than four times its profit in 2016. Year-on-year profit increased 323 percent over 2016, when the company was hammered by the global fall in oil prices. “2017 was a year of great operational and financial achievements for Ecopetrol,” Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said in a statement to the country’s financial regulator. “Today we are a more efficient and disciplined company, and we’ve demonstrated our technical capacity and resilience, having come out stronger after the crisis of low oil prices,” Bayon said. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were up 28 percent last year compared with 2016, to 23 trillion pesos, the company said in a filing to the country’s financial regulator, and proven reserves were up to 1.65 billion barrels, the company said. Debt was down by approximately 9 trillion pesos between 2016 and 2017, Ecopetrol said, while total sales were up 15.7 percent to 55.2 trillion pesos, compared with 47.7 trillion in 2016. Shareholders will receive dividends of 89 pesos per share, the company said. Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said on Twitter the government would make 3.2 trillion pesos from the dividend. The company said it met its production goal for 2017, reaching 715,000 barrels per day (bpd) despite ongoing attacks against crude pipelines by leftist rebels. Ecopetrol plans to increase output to between 715,000 and 725,000 bpd in 2018. The company has said it will invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion during 2018, largely in production and exploration projects. Fourth-quarter profit was 3.42 trillion pesos, up 1,742.5 percent from 186 billion pesos in the same quarter of 2016, the statement said. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was up 29.1 percent in the final quarter of 2017, compared with the same period the year before, to 5.77 trillion pesos.

2018-02-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets broadly fell and government debt yields rose on Tuesday as traders perceived tighter U.S. monetary policy than forecast this year after remarks by the new Federal Reserve chief in testimony before the U.S. Congress. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pledged to balance the risk of an overheating economy and the need to keep growth on track in his prepared testimony. But Powell’s remark that inflation has strengthened since December sent yields higher and stocks lower. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury, the global benchmark for commercial lending, jumped past 2.9 percent and equity markets in Europe and Wall Street turned south, with MSCI’s key index of global equity performance falling almost 1 percent. The three major indices on Wall Street fell more than 1 percent. The dollar added to gains against the euro, the yen and a basket of major currencies and gold prices fell as Powell’s comments were in general positive for the greenback, said Brad Bechtel, managing director of FX at Jefferies, in New York. Market participants in general said Powell hewed to a gradual increase in rates, yet some saw his remarks as hawkish. “It seems that Mr. Powell’s personal views on the strength of the economy have been upgraded since December,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial in Salt Lake City.  “So the market is keying off this idea of thinking maybe it won’t be three rate hikes, but maybe four,” Ware said, referring to the Fed’s forecast for 2018. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, noted that the moment Powell indicated there would probably be more than three rate hikes this year, Treasuries rose, the dollar ticked up while stocks went down. “If we see the 10-year approach 3 percent we’d probably be on one more downward leg that could take the indices to levels we saw a few weeks ago,” he said. “A very trying period for the market could be ahead of us.” The dollar index rose 0.6 percent, with the euro down 0.7 percent to $1.223. The Japanese yen weakened 0.41 percent versus the greenback at 107.38 per dollar.  MSCI’s stock index of 47 countries shed 0.89 percent to close at 523.71. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.13 percent to close at 1,498.06. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 299.24 points, or 1.16 percent, to 25,410.03. The S&P 500 lost 35.32 points, or 1.27 percent, to 2,744.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 91.11 points, or 1.23 percent, to 7,330.35. Euro zone bond yields initially rose after Powell’s early comments but soon trimmed those gains in line with U.S. bond yields.  Germany’s 10-year bond yields rose 3 bps to 0.677 percent, shrugging off news that German inflation has slowed. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 11/32 in price to push yields up 2.8989 percent. Oil fell in its first decline in five days, pressured by a firmer dollar and expectations that upcoming weekly data will show an increase in U.S. crude inventories. Oil dipped before weekly data that is forecast to show rising U.S. crude inventories, though investor confidence in OPEC’s ability to curb output helped stem the price slide. Brent crude futures settled at $66.63 a barrel, down 87 cents on the day, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 90 cents to settle at $63.01. April U.S. gold futures settled down $14.20, or 1.1 percent, at $1,318.60 per ounce.

2018-02-27,"(Adds background on Koch Trading, products desk) By Liz Hampton and Catherine Ngai HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Global commodity trader Koch Supply & Trading has cut dozens of workers across at least four offices worldwide, several sources said on Tuesday, as the firm restructures its business. The cuts at the unit of Wichita, Kansas-based Koch Industries Inc, the industrial conglomerate owned by billionaires Charles and David Koch, affected traders and support staff in its United States, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Singapore offices. A string of notable hedge funds in the commodity space have closed over the last year, while restructuring efforts were launched at firms like Goldman Sachs after losses in 2017. Some commodity trading firms and banks posted major losses due to muted client activity and wild fluctuations across energy markets. Bonuses across the industry were also low, and some hedge funds have chosen to exit energy trading. The positions involved at Koch Supply & Trading were primarily in refined products and fuel oil trading and operations, according to the sources. Koch “made adjustments to its global commodity trading presence to better reflect the current market opportunities,” said spokesman Rob Carlton, adding it would retain an active presence in commodity markets globally. He declined to comment on the scope of the layoffs, though sources said at least 10 traders globally had been let go at Koch. Koch’s trading unit is known for having traded the first oil swap over 25 years ago. The privately held company began trading crude oil internationally in 1969, according to an online brochure and employs a total of 500 to 1,000 workers, according to LinkedIn. The company also had a string of departures in the refined products segment last year, with senior traders and blenders leaving to join a rival, according to three market sources. Koch also exited some tank space in the New York Harbor and Gulf Coast last year, the sources said. On Monday, trader AOT Energy separately said it had reduced some staff, including parting ways with its senior management team in Houston, and earlier this year pared its European distillates and U.S. Gulf Coast fuel oil business due to shrinking margins. Several key commodities traders left Goldman Sachs Group Inc earlier this year, sources said, as the Wall Street firm seeks to turn around its commodities unit. Commodity-focused hedge funds including Andy Hall’s Astenbeck Capital Management and Texas tycoon T. Boone Pickens’ BP Capital have shuttered some operations in recent months.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pledged to balance the risk of an overheating economy and the need to keep growth on track in his prepared testimony, but Powell’s remark that inflation has strengthened since December sent yields higher and stocks lower.

Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut said investors keyed off a question to Powell about the number of rate hikes this year. “He said it’s his impression the economy was getting stronger, which subtly gave the indication that he was going to raise his personal forecast for four rate hikes this year,” O’Rourke said.

2018-02-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell on Tuesday, its first decline in five days, pressured by a firmer U.S. dollar and expectations that upcoming weekly data will show an increase in U.S. crude inventories. Brent crude settled at $66.63 a barrel, an 87 cent drop from Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 fell 90 cents to $63.01. Those settlement prices represented a modest recovery from session lows, when benchmarks had slid more than a dollar. The dollar rose after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank would stick with gradual interest rate increases. [FRX/] A strong dollar makes oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies. The oil market had put together a string of four straight days of gains before Tuesday’s pullback.      “We got a little extended on the upside - we had a price advance of more than $6 a barrel in crude in less than two weeks,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates.  Analysts polled by Reuters forecast that data would show U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.7 million barrels last week. Industry group the American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly figures on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EST. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data is out Wednesday morning.  U.S. crude inventories have fallen more than 100 million barrels in 12 months to their lowest in three years.  The EIA will release monthly data on crude supply on Wednesday, which analysts expect to include substantial upward revisions to U.S. oil output, perhaps to an all-time record. Soaring U.S. production has pressured oil futures at a time when OPEC members and Russia have reduced output in an attempt to support prices. The United States will overtake Russia as the world’s biggest oil producer by 2019, International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Tuesday. “U.S. shale growth is very strong... The United States will become the No.1 oil producer sometime very soon,” he said. U.S. output was 10.27 million barrels per day (bpd), according to last week’s government figures, higher than the latest figures for the world’s largest exporter Saudi Arabia and just below Russia. Weekly figures are considered less reliable than the monthly data scheduled for release Wednesday. “It is likely the monthly data will show U.S. crude oil production in December about 200,000-300,000 bpd above what was estimated in the weekly reports,” Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said in a note.

2018-02-27,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has asked for more talks between representatives of the oil and corn industries after a meeting on Tuesday failed to yield an agreement on how to help refiners cope with the country’s biofuels policy. Trump has called the talks between Big Corn and Big Oil amid rising concern in the White House over the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel. The decade-old policy was intended to help farmers and reduce U.S. petroleum imports but has increasingly divided farmers and energy companies - two of Trump’s most important constituencies. A refining company in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania last month blamed the RFS for its bankruptcy. The meeting on Tuesday included Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania - both from major oil refining states - along with Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst of major corn grower state Iowa. “No deal made,” said Grassley in a Twitter post after the meeting, adding the proposals discussed were “not ‘win win’” and would “destroy ethanol demand.” Cruz issued a statement saying the meeting was “positive and productive” and added that Trump had requested another session this week. “After that meeting, I believe we are likely to arrive upon a win-win solution,” Cruz said.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed the Tuesday meeting on biofuels and said: “We’re going to continue having conversations.”  Under the RFS, refiners must cover the costs of blending increasing volumes of biofuels such as ethanol into the nation’s gasoline and diesel each year. To prove compliance with the program, they have to acquire credits called RINs, either by earning them through blending or by buying them. As biofuels volume quotas have increased over the years, so have prices for the credits. That has been good news for companies that blend the fuels, but refiners that do not have blending facilities are facing rising costs. Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc (PES) PESC.N, which employs more than 1,000 people in the Philadelphia area, filed for bankruptcy protection last month and blamed the regulation for its demise.  Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners. Sources told Reuters the PES would have a representative at the next White House meeting, likely on Thursday. Ernst and Grassley have both said they disagree with critics who say RINs are harmful to refiners, underscoring the fact that the two sides cannot even agree on the facts, let alone the solutions. They point out other refiners, such as Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N), are pulling in solid profits despite the biofuels regulation. America’s biggest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) and POET LLC.   At least four options aimed at reducing the cost of RINs were up for consideration, two sources familiar with the agenda of the White House meeting said. One was to count U.S. ethanol exports toward annual biofuels volume mandates, something not currently permitted under the policy. Another was to place a hard cap on the price of a RIN, and a third was to limit RIN trades to blenders and refiners - essentially to remove market speculation, the sources said. To sweeten the deal for the corn industry, any deal would have likely included a waiver to allow gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol to be sold year round. Sales of high-ethanol blends are currently restricted during the summer due to concerns over smog. Discussions could also look at solutions focused more directly on refiner PES, like waiving its current RIN obligation valued at about $350 million, the sources said. But such a move would likely draw a backlash from other refiners who have no hope of receiving such a waiver. While the White House meetings have focused on fixes that could be implemented with executive or regulatory action, there is a separate legislative effort to alter the RFS, led by Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas. But it too faces stiff resistance from corn states.

2018-02-27,"LIBREVILLE, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Gabon accused French environmental services group Veolia on Tuesday of widespread pollution at SEEG, the power and water utility it operates there, amid a growing dispute over the company’s concession. Veolia, which has already threatened legal action after the government seized SEEG earlier this month and said it would cancel its concession, rejected the accusations. Speaking to reporters in the capital Libreville, government spokesman Alain-Claude Bilie By Nze said an environmental inspection of power and water pumping stations discovered “nearly all” SEEG sites were contaminated by petroleum waste. “This is a very serious situation since, at this stage, aside from the obvious environmental damage, no one knows the consequences this pollution could have had or could have on public health,” he said. He said that on top of legal penalties of up to 500 million CFA francs ($946,110) for each polluted site, Gabon would force SEEG to shoulder the clean-up costs. Responding to the accusations, Veolia stated that the water it distributed continued to conform to World Health Organization standards and Gabonese regulations. “It is surprising that none of the inspections of the public authorities ... ever highlighted environmental damage,” it said. “The SEEG is subject to regular audits by the Gabonese authorities, more than 10 in the last 10 years.” Negotiations between the government and Veolia over the concession broke down in October, and authorities seized SEEG earlier this month, citing years of poor service quality.

The United States, which rivals Russia and Saudi Arabia for the position of the world’s largest oil producer, is not participating in cuts as its industry is represented by private producers who can be sued for collusion if they join the deal. The OPEC cut has boosted prices LCOc1, which topped $71 a barrel this year for the first time since late 2014.

2018-02-27,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oklahoma’s oil and gas regulator on Tuesday released new requirements aimed at reducing the risk of earthquakes from hydraulic fracturing in shale regions in central and southern areas of the state. The new protocol, issued by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), comes in addition to existing rules that apply to a 15,000 square mile area targeted by the regulator for its high rate of temblors from wastewater injection.  The new requirements are aimed at completion activities in the SCOOP and STACK shale producing areas, where drilling is picking up as U.S. oil prices have climbed above $60 a barrel this year. The state in recent years saw a surge in earthquakes due to the injection of saltwater produced from oil and gas drilling activities into disposal wells. In 2015, there were 903 magnitude 3.0 or higher earthquakes, versus just 41 temblors of that intensity five years earlier, according to Oklahoma Geological Survey data.  Under the new rules, operators will be required to have access to a seismic array that gives real-time information on earthquakes. The rules also lower the threshold for which an operator must take action to a magnitude 2.0 quake from 2.5, and require some operators to pause operations for six hours in the event of a 2.5 magnitude quake.  Previously, operators were only required to pause operations for a magnitude 3.0 or higher quake.  There have been 80 earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or greater in the SCOOP and STACK area of Oklahoma since December 2016, Matt Skinner, public information manager for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, said on Tuesday.  “Ultimately, the goal is to have enough information to develop plans that will virtually eliminate the risk of a felt earthquake from a well completion operation in the SCOOP and STACK,” said Jeremy Boak, director of the Oklahoma Geological Survey, in a release. Earthquakes that fall below 2.5 magnitude are usually not felt but can be measured on seismographs.  Well completion activities are less likely to produce induced earthquakes than wastewater injection, geologists said in a release issued by the OCC on Tuesday. The SCOOP and STACK have far less water associated with drilling activities than Oklahoma’s Arbuckle formation, which was linked to a high rate of temblors from wastewater injection, they added. The jump in earthquakes has drawn increased attention in recent years, particularly after some larger quakes have occurred near the massive oil storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.

2018-02-27,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria’s prime minister urged the central bank and intelligence service on Tuesday to look into the purchase of key energy assets by a little known local company, denying any involvement in or backing for the deal.  Czech utility CEZ (CEZP.PR) signed a contract on Friday to sell a power distributor that provides electricity to over three million Bulgarians along with other assets to small Bulgarian solar energy producer Inercom. The deal prompted concerns across the political spectrum that strategic energy assets in the European Union country were passing into the hands of owners about which little was known.  In an emotional briefing to parliament, Boyko Borissov said neither he nor the government were “participating in a dark, behind the scenes, deal.” “Not only are we not participating, we have no influence whatsoever on it,” he told reporters. Inercom, with assets worth around 100 million levs ($63 million), is set to acquire a business with annual turnover of about 1.8 billion levs ($1.1 billion) that operates one third of the Balkan country’s power grid. The deal, estimated to cost about 320 million euros ($392 million), is pending approval by Bulgaria’s anti-trust regulator. Inercom has said it will be financed by bank loans, but has declined to elaborate.     Energy prices are politically sensitive in the EU’s poorest member state, and a spike in electricity bills in 2013 toppled Borissov’s first government. He conceded the current furore was reminiscent of this, but said he would not step down. Borissov said he had received confidential documents on the deal from his Czech counterpart Andrej Babis that showed the involvement of Russian-Georgian offshore companies, as well as Russian and Bulgarian banks. Borissov said Bulgaria did not have a mechanism to stop a deal between two private entities, but pledged to use all state resources to provide transparency over the deal and urged state institutions to step in. He also suggested he might not accept the resignation of the energy minister, who decided to step down over links with Inercom’s owners to try to assuage any doubts of government influence on the deal.    On Friday, opposition Socialists demanded the sale be stopped and urged the government to bid in a new sale process.  Borissov, who has previously dismissed Socialists’ calls for the state to buy back private energy assets, said the government was considering legal changes that would allow the state to have a say in similar deals.

2018-02-27,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s government has agreed with Kurdish regional authorities to resume Kirkuk oil exports through Turkey’s Ceyhan port soon, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Tuesday without giving a precise timeline for restarting the flow. “It was agreed with the Kurdish side to start exporting oil from Kirkuk,” Abadi told a weekly news conference, adding that the two sides had agreed to tackle other differences later. Abadi also said discussions with the Kurds and the Turkish government were ongoing, without giving details. Kurdish officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Kirkuk crude sales have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the oilfields from the Kurds in October following a Sept. 25 referendum on Kurdish independence. Baghdad responded to the plebiscite, in which Kurds overwhelmingly voted for independence, by dislodging the Kurdish Peshmerga from territories claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds, including the oil city of Kirkuk. It also introduced a series of measures curtailing the Kurdish region’s autonomy, including a ban on direct international travel to the two main Kurdish airports.   Kirkuk’s oilfields had been under Kurdish control since 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State. The Kurdish move prevented the militants from seizing the region’s oilfields.

2018-02-27,"(New throughout, Adds quotes, context on the blocks to be offered) By Alexandra Valencia QUITO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Ecuador will increase the number of oil and gas areas it plans to offer in an auction next month by including mature crude fields and an offshore gas field, oil minister Carlos Perez told Reuters on Tuesday. Many Latin American countries are trying to improve their offerings and contract rules to secure foreign investment amid intense regional competitions this year, with major auctions expected in Mexico, Brazil and Uruguay. The minister said the Amistad gas field in the Guayaquil Gulf will be added to the Ecuadorian auction, along with at least four mature or small onshore oil blocks that will be developed under service contracts with state-run oil company Petroamazonas. “Our goal is to attract investment and also look for an increase in production and reserves in the future,” Perez told Reuters in an interview before a public event to review the country’s main oil achievements last year. Amistad is the country’s only gas producing field with an output of 39 million cubic feet per day from six active wells, according to official figures. The government has not yet decided the contract model for that area as new legislation for the gas industry is needed, Perez said. The mature onshore oilfields include the Cuyabeno, Oso and Vinita-Blanca areas at Ecuador’s Amazon region, Perez said. Those will be added to eight onshore areas in the country’s Northeast, close to the border with Colombia, under the Intracampos bidding round, whose results are expected in August. Ecuador, which is opening to international markets, tackling tax reform and public-sector austerity measures under the government of President Lenin Moreno, has said it plans to increase crude production by 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year by adding barrels from its ITT block. It is switching to shared profit agreements from service contracts in the areas not operated by Petroamazonas to secure more investments. The new terms will allow producers to be paid in oil and enable them to export or sell the barrels to local refineries. The Andean country’s crude output has fallen to 515,000 bpd, Perez said, below the output ceiling of 520,000 bpd when OPEC agreed to restrain production starting last year. Perez recently started talks with OPEC to be allowed to increase Ecuador’s production this year despite the organization’s joint output cut agreement that is slated to run through the end of this year, he added. “Ecuador’s production is marginal in the OPEC context. It is a commitment with them to maintain OPEC’s unity. We talked about it during the OPEC secretary general’s visit (earlier this month), they are giving Ecuador flexibility,” he said.

2018-02-27,"LEIPZIG/FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuters) - German cities can ban the most heavily polluting diesel cars from their streets, a court ruled on Tuesday, a move that could accelerate a shift away from the combustion engine and force manufacturers to pay to improve exhaust systems. The court said Stuttgart, which styles itself the birthplace of the modern automobile and is home to Mercedes-maker Daimler, should consider gradually imposing a year-round ban for older diesel models, while Duesseldorf should also think about curbs. Many other German cities exceed European Union limits on nitrogen oxide (NOx), known to cause respiratory disease. After the ruling, the northern city of Hamburg said it would start to implement limits on diesel vehicles from the end of April. There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since leading German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests. The scandal has spread across the industry and boosted investment in electric vehicles. Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. France and Britain will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040. Bans in the home of some of the world’s biggest automakers are a further blow for the sector, and an embarrassment for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, which has faced criticism for its close ties to the industry. Germany has long promoted diesel to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and meet climate change goals, but the country now fears a shift away from the combustion engine could endanger hundreds of thousands of jobs. The ruling was praised by environmental groups but angered many politicians and business lobbies who said millions of drivers might end up unable to use or sell vehicles they bought in good faith. “Driving bans have a massive impact on our ownership rights, on mobility and on our profession,” said Hans Peter Wollseifer, president of the association of German tradesmen. “The carmakers are to blame for the diesel problem, not us tradesmen.” The VDA auto industry lobby took comfort from the fact the court had not insisted on bans. “It is a rejection of general driving bans ... They must be proportional and only considered as a last resort,” the VDA’s Matthias Wissmann said in a statement. Merkel said the government would discuss with regions and municipalities how to proceed, while her ministers said they still hoped bans could be averted by steps to bolster public transport and get automakers to improve emissions systems. “We must do everything possible to prevent the loss of personal freedom and the reduction in value of cars,” Transport Minister Christian Schmidt told a news conference. Sales of diesel cars have been falling fast in Europe since the Volkswagen scandal, with fears of driving bans sending demand sharply lower in Germany in the last year. The ruling by the country’s highest federal administrative court came after German states had appealed against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf in cases brought by environmental group DUH over poor air quality. “This is a great day for clean air in Germany,” DUH managing director Juergen Resch said.  “This is a debacle for the policies of the grand coalition, which has sided with the auto industry,” Resch added, referring to the ruling coalition of conservatives and Social Democrats that Merkel hopes to renew in the coming weeks. The court on Tuesday ordered Stuttgart and Duesseldorf to amend their anti-pollution plans, saying city bans could be implemented even without nationwide rules. “It will not be easy to implement,” Stuttgart mayor Fritz Kuhn told a news conference, adding the regional government would probably agree a new plan within six months.  Germany’s police union warned it did not have capacity to enforce any bans. Cars that meet Euro-4 emissions standards could be banned from Stuttgart from next January, while Euro-5 vehicles should not be banned until Sept. 1, 2019, four years after the introduction of the latest Euro-6 standard. Tradesmen and some residents should be exempted, the court added. Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said bans could still be avoided if automakers agree to pay to upgrade the exhaust cleaning systems of older diesels. “The problem was caused by carmakers and we should not release them from their responsibility,” she said. Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany’s roads, only 2.7 million have Euro-6 technology. Evercore ISI has estimated that upgrading the exhaust cleaning of just the Euro-5 fleet could cost up to 14.5 billion euros ($17.9 billion). “By the time these vehicles face the risk of being banned from certain cities, the industry, together with Berlin, will have found solutions to offer practical hardware updates and attractive scrapping schemes,” Evercore ISI analysts said. The government has begun work on legal changes to permit driving bans on certain routes on an emergency basis, transport ministry documents seen by Reuters showed. It is also considering making public transport free in cities suffering from poor air quality.

France has Europe’s most temperature-sensitive electricity grid as about a third of French homes are heated with electric radiators and every one degree Celsius drop in outside temperature requires an extra 2,400 megawatt hours in power, equivalent to the power consumption of the city of Paris. New RTE forecasts show maximum forecast electricity consumption of 95,000 megawatt hours (MW) on Tuesday evening at 1945 Central European Time, which would be the second-highest power consumption level since the 102,100 MW record on Jan 8, 2012. On Wednesday, peak usage of 94,626 MW is forecast for 0930 CET, but peak consumption will level off in the second half of the week as temperatures rise. An RTE spokesman said about 9,500 MW of power is available for import during Tuesday evening’s peak, compared to maximum interconnection capacity of about 12,000 MW. The French transmission grids may not use all that capacity Tuesday evening and are expected to import some 3,500 MW from Germany and Belgium, 2,300 MW from Spain and 1,500 MW from Switzerland during peak usage time, for a total of more than 7,000 MW. France’s highest-ever power import was not Jan. 8, 2012, when the country imported a maximum of 8,260 MW, but 12,119 MW on Dec. 2, 2017, when low availability of utility EDF’s nuclear plants combined with low power prices abroad led RTE to use its interconnection capacity to the fullest. For Wednesday morning, 9,000 MW of foreign power generation capacity is available for import, an RTE spokesman said. France currently has power generation capacity of about 90,000 MW available, from nuclear, hydro, thermal and renewable energy power sources. EDF’s total nuclear capacity is 63,260 MW from 58 nuclear reactors, but because of safety- and maintenance-related outages, nearly 11,000 MW of nuclear capacity is offline. EDF has postponed the start of maintenance and refueling outages of two reactors, Gravelines 6 and Tricastin 4, by a week to March 3.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pledged to balance the risk of an overheating economy and the need to keep growth on track in his prepared testimony, but Powell’s remark that inflation has strengthened since December sent yields higher and stocks lower. The 10-year U.S. Treasury, the global benchmark for commercial lending, jumped past 2.9 percent and equity markets in Europe and Wall Street turned south, with MSCI’s key index of global equity performance falling 0.4 percent. The dollar added to gains against the euro, the yen and a basket of major currencies and gold prices fell as Powell’s comments were in general positive for the greenback, said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies, in New York. “He is hawkish in the context of being very upbeat on the economy but willing to go at a moderate pace to normalize policy,” Bechtel said. The dollar index rose 0.54 percent, while the euro was down 0.61 percent to $1.2241. The Japanese yen weakened 0.49 percent versus the greenback to 107.47 per dollar. MSCI’s stock index <.MIWD00000PUS) of 47 countries shed 0.38 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.19 percent to close at a preliminary 526.18. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.19 points, or 0.15 percent, to 25,670.08. The S&P 500 lost 11.18 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,768.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 44.17 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,377.29. Euro zone bond yields initially rose after Powell’s early comments but soon trimmed those gains in line with U.S. bond yields. Germany’s 10-year bond yields rose 1.5 bps to 0.674 percent, shrugging off news that German inflation has slowed. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 15/32 in price to push yields up 2.9117 percent. Oil dipped before weekly data that is forecast to show rising U.S. crude inventories, though investor confidence in OPEC’s ability to curb output helped stem the price slide.

2018-02-27,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Global commodity trader Koch Supply & Trading has cut dozens of workers across at least four offices worldwide, several sources said on Tuesday, as the firm restructures its business.  The cuts at the unit of Koch Industries Inc, the industrial conglomerate of billionaire conservatives Charles and David Koch, affected traders and support staff in its United States, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Singapore offices. The positions involved were primarily in refined products and fuel oil trading and operations, according to the sources. Some commodity trading firms and banks posted major losses last year due to muted client activity and wild fluctuations across energy markets. Bonuses across the industry were also low, and some hedge funds have chosen to exit energy trading. Koch “made adjustments to its global commodity trading presence to better reflect the current market opportunities,” said spokesman Rob Carlton, adding it would retain an active presence in commodity markets globally.  He declined to comment and the scope of the layoffs. Sources said at least 10 traders globally had been let go at Koch as the company seeks to optimise under-performing units. On Monday, trader AOT Energy separately said it had reduced some staff, including parting ways with its senior management team in Houston, and earlier this year pared its European distillates and U.S. Gulf Coast fuel oil business due to shrinking margins. Several key commodities traders left Goldman Sachs Group Inc earlier this year, sources said, as the Wall Street firm seeks to turn around its struggling commodities unit.

The U.S. government imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela in August, prohibiting dealing in new debt from the Venezuelan government or state oil company PDVSA, in an effort to halt financing that Washington said fuels a “dictatorship.” Venezuela has repeatedly said Washington is trying to force a default. “The renegotiation of external debt is underway, but it has been made more difficult by U.S. sanctions,” foreign minister Jorge Arreaza told reporters in Geneva. “It’s incredible how global banks have reacted with panic. If a bank somewhere in the world works with Venezuela, they feel they are going to be sanctioned.” According to Arreaza, global banks have opted to close accounts belonging to the government, business people and embassies. He added that some U.S. companies were unable to pay for Venezuelan oil. Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised the specter of sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry. The OPEC nation obtains some 95 percent of its export revenue from oil, though production is down significantly in recent months.    “If the international financial system blocks Venezuela, we are working with Russia, China and Turkey to find new mechanisms,” said Arreaza.

2018-02-27,"(Adds more quotes,) By Gabriela Baczynska and Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The European Union’s chief negotiator said Britain was running out of time to agree a transitional deal with the European Union on its departure from the bloc, if it wanted to avoid a cliff edge Brexit - an exit with no divorce deal. Michel Barnier said there were “significant points of disagreement” on the post-Brexit transition period, which the EU wants to end at the end of 2020, adding that London was looking to keep it open-ended. The EU wants a deal on Britain’s future relations with the bloc agreed by October, so EU leaders can approve the whole deal at a summit and launch the ratification process in the 27 remaining EU members. Barnier said London was looking to keep it open-ended, though British officials said their request had always been for a ‘strictly time-limited’ adjustment period after Brexit. Britain is due to become the first country to leave the EU in March 2019 and failure to agree on transitional arrangements would rob firms of the clarity over trade and customs policies they need to make investment decisions. “The clock is ticking, time is going by, we are pressed for time,” Michel Barnier told a news conference a day before presenting the remaining 27 EU states with what said would be a 120-page draft legal agreement on Brexit. “I am worried by the time, which is short between now and autumn. In a few months, we will have to agree with the United Kingdom about their orderly exit from the European Union as they wish,” he said. His comments came as British Trade Minister Liam Fox said the opposition Labour party’s plan to stay in a customs union with the EU would leave Britain in a worse position than now and would be a sellout of Britain’s national interests. For his part Barnier stressed some areas have seen little, or no progress since December, listing outstanding issues around safeguarding the rights of citizens, among others. He repeated that the EU would not accept cherry-picking during any transitional arrangements, dismissing suggestions in London that Britain could stick to EU rules post-Brexit in some areas, diverge moderately in others and go its own way for the rest. “We are responsible for the integrity of the single market,” Barnier said. “We cannot accept the risk of regulatory divergence during the transition period.” He said the EU would push ahead with contingency planning for the island of Ireland for want of concrete ideas on how to reconcile Britain’s desire to leave the EU’s single market and the customs union, with pledges to avoid a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. The EU’s fallback option for Ireland assumes “full regulatory alignment” would be kept between the two after Brexit and Barnier said his text on Wednesday would propose workable solutions.

2018-02-27,"* S.Africa declared national disaster over water shortage * AECI sees growth in water business revenue * Firm applies for desalination tender By Tanisha Heiberg JOHANNESBURG, Feb 27 (Reuters) - South African chemicals group AECI could increase revenue from its desalination and water treatment business by up to 80 percent over the next five years after a severe drought hit Africa, its CEO said. South Africa was declared a national disaster this month after drought afflicted Cape Town and other areas, and Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and most of southern Africa have also experienced low rainfall. AECI, which also makes explosives and announced a sharp rise in earnings on Tuesday, sees revenue growth coming from its subsidiary ImproChem, a water, air and energy management company. “We have to manage our water a lot better as a continent and I think ImproChem can play a big role in that and that will boost sales on those opportunities,” Chief Executive Mark Dytor told Reuters in a phone interview. Revenue from AECI’s water treatment unit rose 3 percent in 2017 to 1.409 billion rand ($121 million), Dytor said, and he expects them to rise by between 50 and 80 percent over the next five years. Cape Town and other parts of South Africa suffering from drought have pledged to use desalination plants and underground water reserves and AECI has applied for government tenders for desalination projects in Cape Town. Since the current drought in the Western Cape, ImproChem has sold some desalination plants in Cape Town to private sector operators, Dytor said. “We have already sold five desalination plants, that’s into the private sector, they give from between 500,000 litres to 1 million litres a day of water that is treated from sea water,” he said. AECI, which has business in Africa, Australia, Indonesia and South America, said its headline earnings per share rose 17 percent for 2017 to 959 cents, thanks to a global recovery in the resources sector.

2018-02-27,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2BTh857 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Hedge funds continued to take profits on their bullish positions in crude and especially refined fuels in the most recently reported week but supportive comments from OPEC helped steady oil prices. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by the equivalent of 48 million barrels in the week to Feb. 20. The hedge funds’ net long position has been cut in each of the four most recent weeks by a total of 263 million barrels, in what has been the largest drawdown for more than seven months. Most of the drawdown has come from the liquidation of bullish long positions rather than the establishment of new bearish short ones and it has been proportionately greater in fuels rather than crude. Portfolio managers have cut their net long position in U.S. heating oil by 58 million barrels, European heating oil by 45 million barrels and U.S. gasoline by 27 million barrels since Jan. 23. Over the same period, the net long position in Brent has been cut by 61 million barrels while WTI is down by 71 million barrels (tmsnrt.rs/2BTh857). Most of this liquidation seems to be attributable to profit-taking after the big rally in oil prices over the last seven months. Few fund managers have dared to initiate new short positions. Short positions across the whole of the petroleum complex total just 137 million barrels. Short positions in NYMEX WTI have fallen to just 30 million barrels, the lowest since July 2014. Fund positioning remains very stretched with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of almost 10:1, but down from almost 12:1 at the end of January. Despite the profit-taking, oil prices have steadied, probably owing to a combination of strong consumption growth, a continued fall in oil inventories, and supportive comments from senior OPEC leaders. Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, has confirmed that it intends to maintain production restraint throughout the remainder of 2018, even if that risks over-tightening the market. “If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little it, so be it. Rather than quitting too early and finding out we were dealing with less reliable information ... stay the course and make sure that inventories are where the industry needs them,” the kingdom’s energy minister said on Feb. 14. Saudi officials have indicated they want to change the organisation’s target for inventories from the five-year average, which is close to being achieved, to something more ambitious. This represents a significant hardening of OPEC’s policy and has partially reversed the recent slide in benchmark Brent prices, which was probably the intention. But with the market still looking very stretched, especially on the crude side, OPEC may need to sustain its verbal intervention to reassure investors and keep prices firm.

2018-02-27,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Up to 14 people were killed in landslides and by collapsed buildings during a powerful earthquake in the remote Papua New Guinea highlands, police and a hospital worker said on Tuesday, with unconfirmed reports of up to 30 dead. The 7.5 magnitude quake that rocked the region early on Monday also damaged mining and power infrastructure and led ExxonMobil Corp to shut its $19 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, the country’s biggest export earner. Two buildings collapsed and along with a landslide killed 12 people in Mendi, the provincial capital of the Southern Highlands, said Julie Sakol, a nurse at Mendi General Hospital, where the bodies were brought to the morgue.  “People are afraid. The shaking is still continuing. There’s nowhere to go but people are just moving around,” she said. Dozens of aftershocks rattled the area, including a 5.7 quake on Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Police in Mendi said 14 people were killed in the initial quake, including three in Poroma, south of Mendi.  “They were killed by landslides destroying families sleeping in their houses,” said Naring Bongi, a police officer in Mendi.  Provincial Administrator William Bando said more than 30 people were believed to have been killed in the rugged region, about 560 km (350 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, the Papua New Guinea Post-Courier reported. The PNG disaster management office said it was verifying the reports but it could take days to confirm a death toll.      With a lack of communications preventing a clear assessment of damage, aid agencies had not yet begun relief efforts, said Udaya Regmi, head of the International Red Cross in Papua New Guinea, in Port Moresby.  “The magnitude of the earthquake is quite huge, so there must be an impact ... but we cannot say how many people are actually affected and what they need,” Regmi said. Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said the defense force was on standby to assist “when the extent of damage has been confirmed.” “We know that there have been houses lost, roads cut by land slips and disruption to services,” he said in a statement.      ExxonMobil said communications with nearby communities remained down, hampering efforts to assess damage to its facilities that feed the PNG LNG plant.  “Communications continue to be one of the most significant challenges,” the company said in an emailed statement. Its partner, Oil Search Ltd, said a review of all of its facilities and infrastructure would take at least a week, and an industry source told Reuters that the Exxon plant will likely be shut at least seven days. Miners Barrick Gold Corp and Ok Tedi Mining also reported damage to infrastructure. The PNG LNG project is considered one of the world’s best-performing LNG operations, having started exports in 2014 ahead of schedule, despite the challenge of drilling for gas and building a plant and pipeline in the remote jungle of PNG.  The liquefaction plant has also been producing at around 20 percent above its rated capacity of 6.9 million tonnes a year.  ExxonMobil said it shut the two LNG processing units, or trains, at its site on the coast near Port Moresby after earlier shutting its Hides gas conditioning plant and Hides production pads in Hela province in the highlands region.  Gas is processed at Hides and transported along a 700 km (435 miles) line that feeds the PNG LNG plant, whose main customers are in Japan, China and Taiwan.  Traders said the impact on the LNG market would depend on the duration of the shutdown, but noted that spot prices have recently fallen from more than $10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) as North Asia is coming out of the period of heavy winter gas demand. [LNG/]  “The global LNG market is likely to respond immediately as the buyers need to seek alternative sources,” said Boseok Jin, a research analyst at HIS Markit.  Barrick said some activities at the Porgera gold mine have been suspended to save electricity as the power station that supplies the mine had been damaged.  The mine is co-owned by Barrick and China’s Zijin Mining.  State-owned Ok Tedi said by email that a landslip had blocked a road and damaged pipelines to its copper and gold mine in the Star Mountains, adding that the road would take up to two days to be cleared.  Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates. Part of PNG’s northern coast was devastated in 1998 by a tsunami, generated by a 7.0 quake, which killed about 2,200 people.

2018-02-27,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund will this year step up its assessment of the risks posed by climate change to its investments in power producers, oil firms and basic materials companies, its CEO told Reuters on Tuesday.  Separately, the board of the central bank will soon decide whether to blacklist from the fund one or more companies — either in the oil, steel or concrete sectors — for producing too much greenhouse gases, the central bank chief told Reuters. The fund, which invests the proceeds from Norway’s oil and gas production for future pensions in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad, is one of the world’s biggest shareholders, with stakes totaling 1.4 percent of all listed companies. In recent years the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund has become a more active shareholder, trying to influence companies’ attitudes.  Among them are the way companies report on climate change, such as their carbon dioxide emissions, or whether companies have scenario analyses of how more heatwaves, droughts or floods might affect their earnings. Chief Executive Yngve Slyngstad said the fund would first focus its efforts on electricity producers. “That is ... the sector that we will first go through and think about in this scenario. The two next ones will be (basic) materials and oil.” “By far the largest ... is electricity producers, which of course has been a specific focus for us because of the so-called coal criteria,” he said referring to the fund not being allowed by parliament to invest in firms that derive more than 30 percent of their revenue from coal.  The proposal to potentially exclude one or more companies in the oil, steel or cement sectors over excessive greenhouse gas emissions is under review by the board of the central bank. “We have received some recommendations on potential exclusions based on that new criteria. The board is working on the issues ... It’s not going to be long,” central bank governor Oeystein Olsen said, declining to give a more precise timeframe.  The moves come as the fund is proposing to drop oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index, which would reduce over time its stakes in oil and gas companies. That proposal is under consideration at the finance ministry and will be voted by parliament at a later stage.   Also on Tuesday, the fund said it doubled its return on investment in 2017, beating its benchmark, as strong global stock markets boosted the value of the portfolio. It earned a return of 13.7 percent in 2017, up from 6.9 percent in 2016. “The fund’s cumulative return since inception has passed 4,000 billion Norwegian crowns ($511 billion). One out of four crowns of return was generated in 2017, after a very strong year for the fund,” Slyngstad said in a statement. “Again, our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to 20 percent.” The fund’s biggest single company investment at the end of 2017 was in Apple Inc (AAPL.O), worth 66 billion crowns, ahead of Nestle (NESN.S) at 51 billion and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) at 50 billion. Apple was also the biggest single contributor to the fund’s returns in 2017, ahead of Chinese tech group Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). The fund’s size is equivalent to $200,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child. The government withdrew 61 billion crowns during 2017 to pay for public expenses, compared with 101 billion crowns in 2016. Slyngstad earned an annual salary of 6.7 million crowns, or roughly $855,000, in 2017, while his chief investment officer for equity strategies, Petter Johnsen, earned more, with 7.4 million crowns.  By comparison, the country’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, earned 1.6 million crowns.

2018-02-27,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Stocks set for third straight day of gains * MSCI ACWI on course for first monthly loss since Oct ‘16 * Dollar index down 0.1 pct * Eyes on Fed Chair Powell’s first congressional testimony By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - World stocks held near three-week highs on Tuesday, helped by a decline in borrowing costs ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first testimony before the United States Congress later in the day. The MSCI All-Country World Index, was up 0.1 percent by afternoon trade in Europe. Although it has recovered two-thirds of its losses from a selloff earlier this month, the index is set to break a 15-month streak of gains since Donald Trump won the U.S. elections in November 2016. This month’s decline will be its worst since January 2016. After gains in opening deals, European shares turned red, with the pan-European STOXX 600 down 0.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to three-week highs while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan also hit a three-week high before giving up gains on profit-taking in Chinese shares. Wall Street was set for a lower open, although falling U.S. bond yields helped the S&P 500 advance 1.18 percent on Monday. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield eased to 2.8715 percent, dropping further from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb. 21, driven by month-end buying as well as position adjustments ahead of Powell’s testimony. Powell’s debut appearance is seen as critical for financial markets at a time when many investors are nervous about the Fed’s policy normalisation following years of stimulus in the wake of the financial crisis almost a decade ago. Many investors expect the Fed to raise interest rates three times this year, with some pundits predicting four, if U.S. inflation starts to take off, especially as growth is set to get another boost from the Trump administration’s tax cuts and spending plans. Yet there are worries that higher dollar bond yields could prompt investors to shift funds to bonds from riskier assets, especially when the valuation of the world’s stocks are quite expensive even after their sell-off earlier this month. The two-year U.S. Treasuries yield was 2.2219 percent, well above the dividend yield of the S&P 500, which stood at 1.88 percent. “The consensus view in the market is that Powell will continue with a gradualist stance and deliver an upbeat view of US economic prospects,” said Neil MacKinnon, economist at VTB Capital Research. “The markets are already pricing in three 25 basis points rate hikes, with the first hike expected to be announced at the 20-21 March FOMC meeting. Investors are alert to the possibility of a fourth hike this year, though if Powell emphasises the likelihood of this then markets might react negatively.” Fed funds rate futures were almost fully pricing in a rate hike at the Fed’s next policy meeting on March 20-21. Any talk of ‘overheating’ or risks of an ‘inflation overshoot’ could result in the money markets revising up estimates of where the terminal fed funds rate might end up in this cycle, MacKinnon said. A rise in dollar interest rates could also bode ill for potential borrowers, including U.S. home buyers and many companies that have expanded borrowing for years to take advantage of low dollar funding costs. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar traded 0.1 percent higher. Elsewhere in currencies, the euro was flat at $1.2317, off its three-year high of $1.2556 hit earlier this month. Oil edged lower ahead of weekly data that is forecast to show a rise in U.S. crude inventories, although investor faith in OPEC’s ability to curtail production helped stem a larger price slide. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fetched $63.65, down 0.4 percent, after hitting a three-week high of $64.24 the previous day. London Brent crude traded 0.3 percent lower at $67.34 a barrel, after hitting a three-week high of $67.90 the previous day. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Jemima

2018-02-27,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has discovered another North Korean tanker it suspects of transferring goods with a vessel in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. It was the fourth time Japan has suspected such an illegal transfer in recent weeks and comes as the Trump administration and key Asian allies prepare to expand interceptions of ships suspected of violating sanctions on North Korea.  North Korea last year conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear armed missile capable of reaching the United States, triggering deeper U.N. Security Council sanctions.  The North Korean-flagged tanker “Chon Ma San”, designated by the United States as a sanction target, was spotted by a Japanese surveillance plane with the Maldivian-flagged tanker “Xin Yuan 18” some 250 km (156 miles) east of Shanghai on Saturday, the Foreign Ministry said in a release. “Judging from the fact that the two vessels lay alongside each other with their lights turned on at night, both vessels could have been engaged in some type of activity,” the release said. “Following a comprehensive assessment, the government of Japan strongly suspects that they conducted ship-to-ship transfers” banned by U.N. Security Council resolutions, it said. In the latest attempt to defuse the crisis over North Korea’s weapons programmes, South Korea urged Washington and Pyongyang to give ground to allow for talks and U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated he would negotiate with North Korea, but only under the right conditions. Washington on Friday slapped sanctions on dozens more companies and vessels linked to North Korea’s shipping trade and urged the United Nations to blacklist a list of entities, a move it said was aimed at shutting down North Korea’s illicit maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal.

His comment echoed those made by Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala, which owns half of EGA, last October. EGA was created in 2013 when state-owned companies Dubai Aluminium and Abu Dhabi’s Emirates Aluminium merged. Its enterprise value was put at $15 billion at the time. Dubai is the likely destination for the listing, people familiar with the matter said, but the company has not said where it will list. EGA on Tuesday also reported its 2017 earnings, reporting a 59 percent rise in full-year profit to 3.3 billion dirhams ($900 million) on stronger aluminium prices and record production levels. It produced 2.6 million tonnes of cast metal, exceeding 2016’s 2.5 million tonnes and making EGA the third-largest producer of primary aluminium outside China, it said. Kalban said preparations for the initial public offering of shares were continuing with advisers which he did not identify. Reuters reported last year, quoting sources, that EGA had picked Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to advise on its IPO. A source familiar with the matter said 10 to 15 percent of the company was likely to be floated. Mubadala has started the process to list another two companies, a spokesman for the state investor told Reuters without providing further details. Mubadala had assets of 465.5 billion UAE dirham ($126.8 billion) at the end of June and is Abu Dhabi’s second biggest state investor after the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Like neighbouring Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi is restructuring its industrial sector, hoping to attract foreign investors via privatisations after lower energy prices depleted its coffers. After the listing of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co’s distribution unit, banking sources have told Reuters Abu Dhabi could list Abu Dhabi Ports and industrial conglomerate Senaat.

2018-02-27,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday she expected the nominee for the next central bank governor to continue to focus on stability and taming inflation, while adopting a “pragmatic” approach to boosting growth. President Joko Widodo’s selection of Perry Warjiyo, a longtime deputy governor of Bank Indonesia, to succeed Agus Martowardojo, was confirmed on Saturday. In her first comments on the nomination, Indrawati said in an interview that she hoped Warjiyo would maintain the bank’s strong reputation for policy credibility built up under his boss and predecessor.  “We, of course, expect because Bank Indonesia is the central bank, they are going to continue maintaining stability but at the same time, they are going to be pragmatic enough to see the opportunity for them to continue to support what the government is actually addressing: poverty, inequality, and growth,” she said. “I think the most important is job creation and growth.” The comments come as the government is redoubles efforts to boost growth, which has struggled to exceed 5 percent in recent years, well below the 7 percent Widodo pledged to deliver while campaigning in 2014. A collapse in commodities prices just as he took office is partly to blame.   Indrawati also emphasized the independence of its central bank was one of the key structural changes that helped Indonesia recover from a painful recession after the 1997-1998 financial crisis forced it to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. Indrawati said that Warjiyo’s experience at Bank Indonesia and previously at the IMF would prepare him well for the role. She added that she had a good relationship with Warjiyo, whom she described as a “likeable person” who tells “a lot of jokes.”  As a deputy governor, Warjiyo’s role includes monetary policy mix formulation, financial market deepening and Islamic financial market development. Indrawati also said it was important for Indonesia to boost consumption growth back towards the 6 percent level seen before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. It has been stuck around 5 percent in recent years. The government has been increasing cash transfers to help its poorest keep pace with inflation. But she said it has yet to understand why construction wages have stagnated, despite increased infrastructure spending and how to capture the growth of digital trade in its consumption statistics. Another way to boost growth is through increased business investment, and Indrawati said the government was considering adding new tax allowances for investment in sectors such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals manufacturing, and downstream processing for agribusiness and mining commodities. These are among 20 previously unnamed sectors that she said last week would be considered for new eligibility for revised tax incentives. “These are all the areas which I think have huge correlation with domestic demand, which is growing very fast,” she said. The government also will begin a “benchmarking” approach of studying neighboring countries’ tax incentives, including those offered by Thailand, to see if they should be matched, she said. Turning to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies, Indrawati said tariff actions that spark deeper trade disputes  could put global growth at risk. This, in turn, could cut demand abroad for the same U.S. exports that Trump wants to boost. Indonesia had a $13.3-billion trade surplus with the United States, largely on apparel, textiles, seafood and palm oil. Its biggest U.S. imports are soybeans, aircraft and cotton.    “If the United States, as the largest economy in the world, creates a weakening global economy, even a recession, it will backfire to the United States’ own interests,” she said. “You can’t say ‘My country first’ and the rest is not important.” Indrawati said the fair and reciprocal trading system that Trump has insisted on would be best ensured by settling disputes through established bodies such as the World Trade Organization. Trump frequently complains about the Geneva-based WTO,  calling it a “catastrophe” on Monday. He is considering several unilateral tariff actions that almost certainly will draw challenges under WTO rules, including steel and aluminum tariffs on national security grounds and potential trade sanctions against China over its intellectual property practices.

2018-02-27,"Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with senators and Cabinet officials on Tuesday to discuss ways to lower the cost of the nation’s biofuels policy to oil refiners, according to sources familiar with the matter. The meeting reflects rising concern in the White House over the current state of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel, after a Pennsylvania refiner blamed the regulation for its recent bankruptcy. The meeting will include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of corn state Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to the sources. The meeting will also include White House legislative director Marc Short, who will seek to ensure any agreement can be achieved through executive orders and regulatory actions defensible in court, the sources said. Representatives for those officials, and the White House, declined to comment. U.S. farm groups urged Trump in a letter on Monday not to weaken the RFS, calling it a critical engine of rural jobs. “Any action that seeks to weaken the RFS for the benefit of a handful of refiners will, by extension, be borne on the backs of our farmers,” according to the letter. Under the RFS, refiners must earn or purchase biofuel blending credits called RINs to prove to the federal government that enough biofuels are being blended into their gasoline and diesel to comply with the policy. As biofuels volumes quotas have increased over the years, however, so have prices for the credits – meaning refiners that buy them instead of acquire them by blending fuels themselves are facing rising costs. Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than 1,000 people in a key electoral state, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise. Reuters reported other factors may also have played a role in the company’s bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners. Two of the sources familiar with the agenda of the Tuesday meeting said at least four options aimed at reducing the cost of RINs to refiners like PES will be considered – though they noted the effort would be constrained by political and legal realities that have derailed previous reform efforts. Prices of RINs tumbled by nearly 20 percent in the past week on expectations of a regulatory tweak. One idea would be to count U.S. ethanol exports toward annual biofuels volumes mandates that are currently focused purely on domestic usage, an idea the sources said had been studied by Agriculture Secretary Perdue who now favors it. Another idea would be to place a cap on the price of a RIN. Senator Cruz late last year suggested capping RIN prices at 10 cents each, far below the current value of over 60 cents, in a move that was roundly rejected by biofuels advocates. The meeting will also consider measures to remove speculation from the RIN market, potentially by limiting RIN transactions to those directly involved in generating and consuming them: blenders and refiners, the sources said. Any plan would also likely include a concession to the ethanol industry, they said, such as a waiver to allow gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol to be sold year round. Sales of high-ethanol blends are currently restricted in the summer due to concerns over smog. The meeting could also look at solutions focused more directly on refiner PES - like waiving its current RIN obligation valued at about $350 million, the sources said. But any such move would likely draw a backlash from other refiners who have no hope of receiving such a waiver.

2018-02-27,"BERLIN, Feb 27 (Reuters) - A top German court ruled on Tuesday in favour of allowing major cities to ban heavily polluting diesel cars, a move likely to hit the value of 12 million vehicles in Europe’s largest car market and force carmakers to pay for costly modifications. Analysts have said the ruling of the Leipzig court will be crucial in shaping demand across Europe where diesel-car sales have been declining for months on the back of a regulatory backlash and amid signs of widespread rigging of emission tests among carmakers. Germany’s DUH environmental lobby sued the regional capitals of Stuttgart and Duesseldorf to force them to comply with European Union air pollution limits they have violated for years. The two associated German states appealed against the rulings, leaving the federal administrative court in Leipzig to decide whether city bans for diesel cars are legal. Diesel-vehicle emissions cause respiratory problems and have been linked to premature deaths. Any driving bans would probably affect vehicles equipped with Euro-5 emissions-control technology and older models. Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany’s roads last year, about 2.7 million were fitted with the latest Euro-6 standard, which has applied to all new cars sold since September 2015, according to the KBA motor vehicle watchdog. Affected cities would need at least six months to redraw their anti-pollution strategies before any bans could take effect, legal experts have said. Germany’s ADAC motorist club does not even expect bans to be launched before the end of the year. Prior to any implementation, German lawmakers will likely be asked to overhaul nationwide road traffic regulations. Any restriction will likely accelerate the drop in demand from consumers already worried about resale values and possible recalls. Carmakers have been adapting their model lineups to make up for consumers’ sudden shift to gasoline vehicles. Traffic bans in Europe’s biggest auto market would likely influence policies across the region. Reporting by Andreas Cremer

2018-02-27,"LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s BASF (BASFn.DE) said it was aiming for a gain of up to 10 percent in group operating profit this year as it bets on a rebound in specialty chemicals to offset an expected weaker performance in basic petrochemicals. The chemicals maker is coming off a strong year where supply bottlenecks and strong demand across the petrochemicals industry boosted earnings. Its basic chemicals unit saw earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) adjusted for one-off items surge by 67 percent in the fourth quarter, the company said on Tuesday. However, it expects adjusted EBIT at the unit to drop by 11 percent or more in 2018, it said. That forecast, combined with a proposed annual dividend of 3.10 euros per share which fell short of expectations, saw BASF shares fall 1.6 percent to 87.44 euros as of 1128 GMT, making them the third-worse performer on Germany's blue-chip DAX .GDAXI index. BASF, which last month reported a 2017 operating profit up 32 percent, issued divisional results on Tuesday which showed that specialty products, something the company is looking to for growth, underperformed. Morgan Stanley analysts said its performance in specialty products was “a little disappointing”. Helping, however, were profit margins at its commodity chemicals unit which rose to close to 26 percent of sales in 2017, almost double their average over the previous five years, mirroring similar developments at rivals such as Covestro (1COV.DE). BASF and its rivals are ramping up output capacity, most notably for chemicals used in building insulation or furniture, which will likely ease supply shortages. BASF also aims to overcome the weakness at its advanced and customised products, such as food nutrients, ingredients for household products or engineering plastics. “The downstream segments in 2018 clearly need to improve their performance,” said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz. BASF also said its Wintershall oil and gas division, which it is seeking to merge with Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s DEA, should help raise profits this year helped by a strong oil price.

There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests, meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx), known to cause respiratory disease. While other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars, a ban in the birthplace of the modern automobile is a new blow for the car industry, and an embarrassment for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, which opposes bans. The ruling by the country’s highest federal administrative court came after German states had appealed against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf in cases brought by environmental group DUH over poor air quality. Merkel’s government, which has come under fire for its close ties to the car industry, had lobbied against a ban, fearing it could anger millions of drivers and disrupt traffic in cities, with public transport not in a position to take up the slack.

2018-02-27,"(Adds details) By Neha Dasgupta NEW DELHI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has approved $1.5 billion in loans to India for infrastructure-related projects in 2018, a senior official of the AIIB said on Tuesday. China plans to invest more than $100 billion through its Belt and Road scheme to build highways, rail lines, ports and other infrastructure linking Asia, Europe and Africa. The funds would be used for investment in India’s energy, roads and urban development projects, and the bank will examine allotting more funds for such projects next year, D.J. Pandian, AIIB’s chief investment officer, said. AIIB’s loans include a $200 million commitment to India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund to spend on roads, housing and urban development, and the bank will let the Indian government decide how to use that money. Energy-related projects will primarily be focused on renewables, Pandian said, without providing additional details. China-backed lenders are taking a more hands-off approach to overseas development financing, unlike western banks whose financing often comes with social and environmental strings and strengthens the voice of non-profits. AIIB wants to encourage the transition to renewable energy but is not against investments in coal-related projects, unlike most of its peers who have campaigned against further investments in coal. Any foreign investment in renewables is crucial for India, which needs at least $125 billion in investments to complete its ambitious target of adding 175 GW in clean energy by the end of 2022.

2018-02-27,"(Reuters) - British power producer Drax Group Plc (DRX.L) beat full-year core earnings expectations on Tuesday, sending its shares higher. Drax has converted three of its six power plant units in Yorkshire in the north of England - once Europe’s most polluting coal-fired power station - to burn wood pellets. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 63.6 percent to 229 million pounds for the year ended Dec. 31, the company said.  That topped the 225.4 million pounds expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also announced a 50 million pound share buy-back which analysts said might disappoint any investors hoping for a special dividend. Revenue grew by about 25 percent to 3.69 billion pounds, helped by higher profit from its biomass power plants and the acquisition of Opus Energy. Drax shares rose as much as 9 percent in early trade and were up 3 percent at 246 pence by 1305 GMT. As well as higher generation and acquisitions, revenue was buoyed by a 35 percent increase in biomass pellet production at the company’s U.S. manufacturing plants. As a part of its efforts to meet climate targets, Britain plans to close all coal-fired power plants by 2025 unless they are fitted with technology which can capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Drax plans to convert a fourth unit to biomass by the end of the year and eventually replace its existing coal units with two large gas units. In an interview with Reuters, Chief Executive Officer Will Gardiner said the company hopes to secure planning permission for first of the gas units by the end of 2019. It would then enter the plants into Britain’s capacity auction, which are held four years in advance and pay power generators to be available during times of high demand. Drax’s two coal units won capacity contracts this month for 2021/22. The biomass units are not eligible to enter the auction since they already receive renewable subsidies. Gardiner also said the company had no plans to follow fellow power generators Vattenfall and Engie in launching a domestic retail business in Britain. Britain’s energy firms are under pressure to reduce domestic bills. Prime Minister Theresa May this week introduced new legislation to force Ofgem to cap what she called “rip-off” prices.

European shares are expected to gain, with spread-betters looking to a higher opening of about 0.4 to 0.5 percent in Britain’s FTSE, France’s Cac and Germany’s Dax Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to three-week highs while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan also hit a three-week high before giving up gains on profit-taking in Chinese shares. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 advanced 1.18 percent on Monday helped by a fall in U.S. bond yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield eased to 2.864 percent, dropping further from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb. 21, driven by month-end buying as well as position adjustments ahead of Powell’s testimony. Powell’s debut appearance is seen as critical for financial markets at a time when many investors are nervous about the Fed’s policy normalisation following years of stimulus after the financial crisis almost a decade ago. Many investors expect the Fed to raise interest rates three times this year, with some pundits predicting four, if U.S. inflation starts to take off, especially as growth is set to get another boost from the Trump administration’s tax cuts and spending plans. Yet, there are worries higher dollar bond yields could prompt investors to shift funds to bonds from riskier assets, especially when the valuation of the world’s stocks are quite expensive even after their sell-off earlier this month. The two-year U.S. Treasuries yield was 2.226 percent, well above the dividend yield of the S&P 500, which stood at 1.88 percent. A rise in dollar interest rates could also bode ill for potential borrowers, including U.S. home buyers and many companies that have expanded borrowing for years to take advantage of low dollar funding costs. “Expectations that Powell will be sensitive to financial markets appear to be running high. But he hasn’t said he will sacrifice policy normalisation for the sake of financial markets. I feel there is room for disappointment in markets,” said Hiroko Iwaki, senior bond strategist at Mizuho Securities. MSCI’s gauge of equity market performance in 47 countries , which gained 0.8 percent on Monday, rose another 0.1 percent on Tuesday, taking it to a new three-week high. Still, it is down 2.2 percent so far this month, suggesting its record 15-month winning streak that began in November 2016 is at risk. “The combination of low interest, low inflation and strong economic growth, the best combination for markets that also kept market volatilities low, is coming to an end,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, He said that while corporate earnings will likely remain strong for some time longer, underpinning stocks, market volatility will be higher. In the currency markets, the euro traded at $1.2327, up 0.1 percent in Asia but off its three-year high of $1.2556 hit earlier this month. The dollar traded at 106.85 yen, stabilising for now above its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16. Fed funds rate futures were almost fully pricing in a rate hike at the Fed’s next policy meeting on March 20-21. Oil prices held firm at three-week highs, supported by supported by signs of stronger demand, robust production curbs led by OPEC and a slight fall in U.S. output. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fetched $63.86, little changed from U.S. close on Monday, after hitting a three-week high of $64.24 the previous day.

2018-02-27,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s regional governments need to take more responsibility for local pollution and stop blaming others, a senior environmental official said on Tuesday, following increases in smog in the Yangtze and Pearl river delta regions in January. While nationwide air pollution fell thanks to a tough winter crackdown in smog-prone northern regions, concentrations of small, breathable particles known as PM2.5 surged 20 percent in the Yangtze delta in eastern China, which includes Shanghai as well as the highly industrialised province of Jiangsu.  A 3.9-percent increase in PM2.5 in the Pearl river delta near Hong Kong also raised fears that polluting heavy industrial output had moved to eastern and southern regions as a result of a crackdown in the north, which forced thousands of factories to curb production.         Speaking at a press briefing on Tuesday, Liu Bingjiang, head of the air quality department at China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), said changes in industrial output could have been responsible for the spike, noting that steel output data for 2017 indicated a shifting “production structure and layout” for industry. “We will analyse more closely to see to what extent the rising PM2.5 is due to increasing industrial emissions,” he added. “I am sure the Yangtze delta governments understand very well what their tasks are.” The top steel producing province of Hebei, which surrounds the capital Beijing, has been at the heart of a campaign to improve northern China’s air quality, and saw output fall 1 percent to 191.2 million tonnes last year, despite a 5.7-percent nationwide production increase. Over the same period, Jiangsu, the country’s second biggest steel producer, saw steel production rise 4.64 percent to 104.3 million tonnes in 2017. It also saw nonferrous metals output surge 32.2 percent year-on-year, according to official data.         Environmental group Greenpeace said the increase in emissions in both the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas was caused by a rebound in polluting industries beginning in 2016.  But it also suggested that unfavourable weather conditions were partially to blame, with the wind that helped cut smog in northern regions responsible for delivering pollution to the eastern coast. Liu said at the Tuesday briefing that favourable weather was responsible for 30 percent of the improvements in air quality in northern China, but it was “irresponsible” to blame smog on wind - or on other regions.   “The (local) government should do its own job well and not focus on blaming other people,” he said. “Otherwise they will miss the best chance to improve their own air quality.”  Liu also said China was preparing to introduce even tougher air quality targets to cover the 2018-2020 period, without giving specific figures.

2018-02-27,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States will overtake Russia as the world’s biggest oil producer by 2019 at the latest, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday, as the country’s shale oil boom continues to upend global markets. IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said at an event in Tokyo the United States would overtake Russia as the biggest crude oil producer “definitely next year”, if not this year. “U.S. shale growth is very strong, the pace is very strong ... The United States will become the No.1 oil producer sometime very soon,” he told Reuters separately.  U.S. crude oil output rose above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) late last year for the first time since the 1970s, overtaking top oil exporter Saudi Arabia.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration said early this month that U.S. output would exceed 11 million bpd by late 2018. That would take it past top producer Russia, which pumps just below that mark.      Birol said he did not see U.S. oil production peaking before 2020, and that he did not expect a decline in the next four to five years.  The soaring U.S. production is upending global oil markets, coming at a time when other major producers - including Russia and members of the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - have been withholding output to prop up prices. [O/R]  U.S. oil is also increasingly being exported, including to the world’s biggest and fastest growing markets in Asia, eating away at OPEC and Russian market share.  Meanwhile, U.S. net imports of crude oil fell last week by 1.6 million bpd to 4.98 million bpd, the lowest level since the EIA started recording the data in 2001, reflecting further erosion in a market OPEC has been relying on for decades.  Birol said production growth was not just strong in the United States.  “Canada, especially the oil sands, and Brazilian offshore projects. These are the two major (non-U.S.) drivers,” he said. On the demand side, Birol said the IEA expected growth of around 1.4 million bpd in 2018.

2018-02-27,"MEXICO CITY, Feb 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cities will be the battleground and women can be effective warriors on the frontlines in the fight against climate change, activists and leaders said on Monday. Investing in the education and leadership of women and girls will provide a much-needed boost in efforts to slow global warming, said attendees at the Women4Climate conference organised by C40, a global alliance of cities, in Mexico City. “For thousands of years we’ve been investing in the education of men, in the professional capacities of men, in their rise to positions of leadership and decisions,” Christiana Figueres, former head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), told the group. “We haven’t done this investment with women,” said Figueres, who now leads “Mission 2020,” a global initiative to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Women4Climate conference brought together mayors, business leaders and leaders working to curb climate change. It was the second such conference held since world leaders agreed in Paris in 2015 on a goal of slowing the rise in average global temperatures. “It is clear the battle will be fought especially in urban areas,” said Patricia Espinosa, the current UNFCCC head. “It’s clear if we want to face climate change, women and girls from all the world should be central actors,” she said. “We have little time left.” Extreme weather related to climate change is hitting urban areas, said Salt Lake City, Utah Mayor Jackie Biskupski. She said the western U.S. city is warming at double the global rate, affecting the snowfall it depends upon for water. Rome’s Mayor Virginia Raggi said her city planned to ban diesel-fueled cars from its centre, plant thousands of trees and invest in zero-emissions busses. “Cities can do a lot to make a difference on climate, but just like women, cities can’t be expected to change the world all by themselves,” said Andrea Reimer, a Vancouver, Canada city official.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 advanced 1.18 percent on Monday helped by fall in U.S. bond yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield eased to 2.864 percent, dropping further from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb 21, driven by month-end buying as well as position adjustments ahead of Powell’s testimony. Powell’s debut appearance is seen as critical for financial markets at a time when many investors are nervous about the Fed’s policy normalisation following years of stimulus after the financial crisis almost a decade ago. Many expect the Fed to raise interest rates three to four times this year, as policy makers look to prevent an overheating of the economy especially as growth is set to get another boost from the Trump administration’s tax cuts and spending plans. Yet, investors are worried rising dollar funding costs could bode ill for potential borrowers, including U.S. home buyers and some emerging market companies. MSCI’s gauge of equity market performance in 47 countries gained 0.82 percent on Monday, rising above its Feb 16 high to hit it a three week top. Still, it is down 2.4 percent so far this month, suggesting its record 15-month winning streak that began in November 2016 is at risk. “The combination of low interest, low inflation and strong economic growth, the best combination for markets that also kept market volatilities low, is coming to an end,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, He said that while corporate earnings will likely remain strong for a while longer, underpinning stocks, market volatility will be higher. In the currency market, the euro traded at $1.23145, off its three-year high of $1.2556 hit earlier this month. The dollar traded at 106.98 yen, stabilising for now above its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16. Fed funds rate futures were almost fully pricing in a rate hike at the Fed’s next policy meeting on March 20-21. Oil prices held firm at three-week highs, supported by strong U.S. demand and comments from Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb production in line with OPEC-led efforts. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fetched $64.00, up slightly on Tuesday, after hitting a 20-day high of $64.24 the previous day.

2018-02-27,"(Corrects time of quake to early Monday, paragraphs 1, 3; fixes typographical error, paragraph 4) MELBOURNE, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Miners in northwest Papua New Guinea reported some damage to infrastructure following a powerful magnitude 7.5 earthquake that hit on Monday, as projects in the resource-rich region assess the impact on their operations. Barrick Gold Corp said a power station that supplies its Porgera gold mine had been damaged, while Ok Tedi Mining Ltd said a landslip had blocked a road and damaged pipelines to its copper and gold mine in the Star Mountains. The PNG government said it had sent disaster assessment teams to the rugged Southern Highlands about 560 km (350 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, following the quake early on Monday and a series of aftershocks. No casualties have been confirmed. “It’s premature to comment on what the impact to Porgera may be as those assessments remain underway. ‎The mine does have limited back up power generation available on site,” Barrick Gold spokesman Andy Lloyd said in emailed comments. Electricity from the power station is mainly used by the processing plant at Porgera. The mining fleet uses diesel. Porgera is co-owned by China’s Zijin Mining Group. State-owned Ok Tedi said that a landslip blocking roads would likely take several days to clear, but did not comment on any direct impact to operations. “Maintenance work on the damaged pipes will begin as soon as road access is restored and spare pipes are transported to the location,” it said in a statement. Early estimates are that it will take at least several days to clear the road to allow for normal traffic flow, with work due to start on Tuesday morning, it said. Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates. Part of PNG’s northern coast was devastated in 1998 by a tsunami, generated by a 7.0 quake, which killed about 2,200 people. ExxonMobil said on Monday it had shut its Hides gas conditioning plant and that it believed administration buildings, living quarters and a mess hall had been damaged. Gas is processed at Hides and transported along a 700 km (435 miles) line that feeds a liquefied natural gas plant near Port Moresby for shipping. PNG oil and gas explorer Oil Search said in a statement on Monday it had also shut production in the quake-affected area.

2018-02-27,"TOKYO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose for a fourth session on Tuesday to near a three-week high hit a day earlier, supported by signs of robust production curbs by OPEC and non-OPEC countries and a slight fall in U.S. production. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery was up 10 cents at $64.01 a barrel by 0020 GMT. The contract hit $64.24 on Monday, its highest since Feb. 6. London Brent crude had yet to start trading after settling up 19 cents at $67.50. Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih indicated on Saturday that its crude production would be well below the production cap as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies were committed to reducing output to bring balance and stability to the market. Prices were also supported by U.S. Energy Information Administration data on Thursday that showed domestic oil production dipped to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.271 million bpd the week before. U.S. crude inventories are forecast to have risen by 2.7 million barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday. Gasoline stocks are seen down by 600,000 barrels, while distillate inventories, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, were seen down 700,000 barrels. The American Petroleum Institute is scheduled to release its weekly data later in the day.

2018-02-27,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s total spending on research and development is estimated to have hit 1.76 trillion yuan ($279 billion) last year, China’s science minister said on Monday, a year-on-year increase of 14 percent. “China needs to enter the ranks of innovative countries and become a big technological innovation power by 2050,” minister Wan Gang told a media briefing.  “Basic research and frontier exploration is the big lesson that must be done now,” he said. China has been trying to ease its dependence on low-end heavy industries and to develop less-polluting ways to promote  economic growth and move up the global value chain.  The 2017 spending amounts to around 2.1 percent of total gross domestic product, Reuters calculated. This compares with around 2.8 percent in the United States, 2.9 percent in Germany and 3.3 percent in Japan, World Bank data for 2015 shows. China’s annual R&D spending has risen 70.9 percent from 2012, Wan noted.       China has established dozens of new high-tech industrial parks and incubators aimed at promoting technologies such as  artificial intelligence, robotics and big data.  The country is also investing heavily to dominate industries such as nuclear and renewable energy, high-speed trains and electric vehicles. Wan told reporters that China was aiming to bring output of electric vehicles up to 2 million units by 2020, double the estimated volume for this year.
