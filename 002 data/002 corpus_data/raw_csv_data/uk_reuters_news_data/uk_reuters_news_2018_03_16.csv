2018-03-16,"(Adds case name, court and number) By Swati Verma and Liz Hampton March 16 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court overturned a District Court’s preliminary injunction that prevented construction on part of Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Bayou Bridge crude oil pipeline in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana. In February U.S. district judge Shelly Dick issued a temporary injunction preventing work on an extension to the Bayou Bridge system, revoking a permit and siding with environmentalists and fishermen who expressed concerns about its potential effect on the local economy and wildlife. “Judge Dick’s ruling ran counter to the collective efforts of federal, state, and local regulatory officials, who thoroughly reviewed – and ultimately approved – the Bayou Bridge Pipeline for construction,” Thursday’s court filing said. The disputed 162-mile (261-km) pipeline is an extension to an existing line, which transports crude from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. The new segment would extend the system to St. James, Louisiana, and have capacity to transport up to 480,000 barrels per day of oil. The project is 60 percent owned by ETP with the remainder controlled by refiner Phillips 66. Energy Transfer Partners on Friday said it was pleased with the court ruling and would begin mobilizing for construction activities as soon as possible. One of the three judges that heard the appeal filed a dissent, agreeing with the District Court’s ruling that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had violated the law when issuing permits for the pipeline. Groups opposing the pipeline vowed to continue fighting. “Today’s ruling is a setback but it’s not the end of this fight,” Jan Hasselman, an attorney for Earthjustice, the group representing the plaintiffs, said in a release. Energy Transfer Partners last year prevailed over environmental and Native American groups that had temporarily blocked construction of its Dakota Access Pipeline, a separate line that transports crude from North Dakota to a pipeline system terminating on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

2018-03-16,"(Adds final statement from MPLA) By Stephen Eisenhammer LUANDA, March 16 (Reuters) - Angola’s ruling MPLA party said on Friday it would discuss next month when to appoint a new leader, potentially undermining party chief and former president Jose Eduardo dos Santos who hours earlier said he might stay on until next year. Dos Santos handpicked Angola’s new president, João Lourenço, to succeed him when he stepped down last September after ruling for 38 years, but held onto his position as head of the party, creating two centres of power in the oil-producing nation. Since then dos Santos has been under increasing pressure to give up the presidency of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) that has governed Angola continuously since independence from Portugal in 1975. State radio said many in the MPLA leadership had taken issue with dos Santos’ intervention at Friday’s meeting of the central committee when, in a rare public statement, he told the party it should wait until December or April 2019 to replace him. Consensus is building within the inner circle of the MPLA that a new party leader should be appointed as early as June, the radio reported. In a statement published at the end of the meeting, the MPLA said the decision to discuss the issue in April had as “its only goal the strengthening of the MPLA and the reinforcement of its internal cohesion”. Lourenço has moved against some of dos Santos’ old allies and has removed family members from key positions, including his daughter Isabel from the chair of state oil company Sonangol and José Filomeno from the sovereign wealth fund. Party stalwarts have also come out to say they intended to ensure dos Santos sticks to previous assurances that he would leave “active political life” in 2018. After a flurry of rumours on social media suggesting Friday’s central committee meeting could see a date for his removal forced upon him, dos Santos moved pre-emptively to set his own timeline. “I recommend that it would be most prudent that the party’s extraordinary congress which will resolve the question of the leadership of the MPLA be in December 2018 or April 2019,” he told the central committee at the opening of the meeting. As head of the party, dos Santos, 75, remains hugely powerful, with influence over the way lawmakers vote in parliament and on party policy proposals, but relations with Lourenço have broken down. “I understand that the relationship... has deteriorated since late 2017 and that they are no longer in communication with each other,” said Alex Vines, head of the Africa Programme at London’s Chatham House. “A transition of power after almost 38 years was never going to be simple or smooth, and the tug-of-war over the MPLA presidency is a reminder that this transition is still in its infancy,” Vines said.

2018-03-16,"(Reuters) - Pennsylvania environmental regulators on Friday issued another notice of violation to Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Sunoco Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipeline for releasing drilling fluids into a stream.  The company told the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) it released about 50 gallons of fluid into the Snitz Creek on Thursday while drilling under the steam in West Cornwall Township in Lebanon County, about 30 miles east of the state capital Harrisburg. It was ETP’s third inadvertent release into the Snitz Creek, following spills in August and September 2017. It was also the project’s 40th Notice of Violations and 107th inadvertent release since May, according data from the DEP. “Drilling was immediately stopped, the mud was contained and removed, and the DEP was notified,” ETP spokesman Jeff Shields said in an email. The DEP said it must give its approval before ETP can resume drilling at the site. The latest spill comes about a week after Pennsylvania utility regulators suspended operations of ETP’s Sunoco Mariner East 1 liquids pipeline after sinkholes were discovered near the project. “Regarding Mariner East 1, we are focused on performing the required work and preparing to share our information with regulators so we can safely return (the pipeline) to service,” Shields said. Mariner East 1 transports up to 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) of propane and ethane from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in western Pennsylvania to customers in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, including ETP’s Marcus Hook industrial complex near Philadelphia. The sinkholes were near the area where construction is under way for the $2.5 billion Mariner East 2. The order stopping flows on Mariner East 1 did not affect work on Mariner East 2. Construction of Mariner East 2, which started in early 2017, was originally expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017 but has been delayed by a couple of work stoppages by Pennsylvania regulators, among other things. ETP currently expects to complete Mariner East 2 by the end of the second quarter. Once complete, Mariner East 2 will expand the total capacity of the Mariner East project to 345,000 barrels per day. ETP’s other projects include the Dakota Access crude line from North Dakota to Illinois and the Rover natural gas pipe from Pennsylvania to Michigan, which have also come under intense regulatory scrutiny over the past year or so.

2018-03-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices finished the week at a gain after a big Friday rally, and U.S. stock indices ended flat-to-higher, to close a bumpy week on a high note. Crude prices had been on track for a weekly loss, but spiked on Friday as energy investors looked to cover short bets ahead of a televised interview Sunday by the U.S. news programme “60 Minutes” with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The prince will be “comparing Iran’s Ayatollah to Hitler, and the battle in Ghouta, Syria, is ramping up,” said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York. “You can’t be short oil over the weekend with all that going on in the region.”  U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 1.72 percent to $62.24 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $66.12, up 1.54 percent on the day. During the session, Brent hit $66.42, its highest since Feb. 28. Gains on Wall Street also supported crude futures, which have recently been moving in tandem with U.S. stock indices. The S&P 500 .SPX, which was down 1.5 percent on the week through Thursday, avoided its first five-day losing streak of 2018, gaining 4.68 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,752.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 72.85 points, or 0.29 percent, to 24,946.51, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.25 points, or 0 percent, to 7,481.99. Wall Street nevertheless posted losses for the week, as shares struggled to weather a growing sense of turmoil in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and signs that protectionist policies could spur a trade war. Those fears took a back seat on Friday to economic data showing U.S. factory output jumped 1.1 percent in February. “Today, there are not a lot of headlines out of Washington, so the focus is more on the economy,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. Energy led the S&P with a 0.9 percent gain amid the spike in oil prices.  Retailer Walmart Inc (WMT.N) added 1.9 percent, and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) half a percent, after the University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment index rose more than expected to 102.0.     Both of those gains were down, however, from higher climbs earlier in the day. European shares lost ground for the week, despite a modest gain on Friday, driven by exchange operator NEX Group Plc’s NXGN.L 30-percent jump after a takeover offer from U.S.-based peer CME Group Inc (CME.O). The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.29 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS was about flat.

2018-03-16,"(Reuters) - SunPower Corp (SPWR.O) on Friday asked the Trump administration to exempt a segment of its solar panel imports from new tariffs, saying the move would allow it to reverse proposed investment cuts and ease plans to expand U.S. panel manufacturing. The request by SunPower, which is majority owned by France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA), marks the first attempt by a major U.S. solar company to sidestep a controversial 30 percent levy on imported panels announced by President Donald Trump in January.  Trump had said the tariff would boost U.S. manufacturing, but many in the industry have warned of higher costs and thousands of layoffs in the much-bigger installation end of the solar industry. “We understand the administration’s goals,” SunPower Chief Executive Tom Werner said in an interview. “We think we can contribute positively to those objectives.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It could not determined which other companies had filed such requests with the U.S. Trade Representative by the deadline on Friday. SunPower’s request covers only its imported premium, high-efficiency panels, and not the less efficient and cheaper “P-series” panels which dominate the market, Werner said. San Jose, California-based SunPower manufactures most of its panels in the Philippines and Mexico. Werner said an exemption would allow SunPower to “materially” reverse a decision made immediately after the tariff announcement in January to cancel a $20 million investment in its next-generation cell technology that would have created hundreds of jobs in California and Texas . SunPower last month said the tariff would force it to cut 150 to 250 non-manufacturing jobs.  The cheaper P-series panels could be made at a new U.S. facility that the company would build, probably in the Southwest, Werner said, noting that SunPower was in the process of narrowing down its options to two locations. “This is not hypothetical. We’re ready to make this happen,” he said, adding that an exemption for premium panel imports would “facilitate” this plan. A big investment in solar panel manufacturing as a result of the tariff would mark a win for the Trump administration, but so far the industry remains focused on the fate of the installation business, which employs tens of thousands of people.  Only China’s JinkoSolar (JKS.N) has said it plans to build a U.S. manufacturing facility, and SolarWorld, one of the panel producers behind the trade case that resulted in the tariffs, has said it will hire 200 employees this year. Suniva, the bankrupt company that first petitioned the administration in April to impose tariffs, has not publicly outlined its plans. The exemption request will undergo a 30-day comment period before the U.S. Trade Representative makes a decision.

2018-03-16,"March 16 (Reuters) - A group of senators from U.S. corn states have asked President Donald Trump for a meeting about the nation’s biofuels law, amid expectations the administration will soon act to lower the regulation’s costs to the oil refining industry. The group of Republican senators wrote a letter to Trump on Thursday in which they opposed a plan he is considering to limit the price of credits that oil refiners must acquire to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard. “Let there be no doubt - the consequences of a waiver would be severe and immediate across the Midwest, impacting farmers and biofuel stakeholders alike,” the senators wrote. The letter was written by Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, of Iowa; John Thune, of South Dakota; Roy Blunt of Missouri; and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Trump has not publicly commented on his plans. But he told lawmakers and industry officials in a closed-door meeting earlier this month that he supported capping the price of RFS compliance credits, known as RINs, at 10 cents each, according to a source who attended but who asked not to be named. The credits are currently trading around 42 cents each, having fallen nearly 40 percent in recent weeks amid the political uncertainty. White House spokeswoman, Kelly Love, did not respond to a request for comment. In the closed-door meeting this month, Trump also supported expanding sales of high-ethanol gasoline – a tweak long-sought by ethanol producers, according to the source. The Environmental Protection Agency bans the use of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol during the summer months, a measure intended to reduce ozone emissions and smog during the peak driving season. The corn-state senators, along with the biofuel industry, like the idea of lifting the summer ban on 15-percent ethanol blends, but oppose any credit price caps. They argue the proposed caps would take away any incentive to blend higher volumes of ethanol. Grassley took to Twitter on Thursday night and Friday morning to oppose the RIN caps. “@realDonaldTrump I want to shake up what u might be planning abt RINs cap for a short period. It will be CATASTROPHIC to ethanol,” Grassley wrote.

WTI hit a high of $62.54, its highest since March 7. Brent futures gained 1 percent for the week, while WTI marked a weekly rise of 0.4 percent. It was the second straight weekly rise for both contracts. Gains on Wall Street also supported crude futures, which have recently been moving in tandem with U.S. stock indices.  Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish bets on U.S. crude oil futures and options in the week to March 13, as crude prices fell for a second week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 24,667 contracts to 453,864 during the period. The cuts marked the second consecutive week in which speculators cut their net long positions in the market.  U.S. drillers added four oil rigs this week, bringing the total count to 800, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said. It was the seventh U.S. rig count rise in eight weeks.  On Thursday the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted global oil demand would pick up this year, but supply is growing at a faster pace, which should boost inventories. The agency raised its forecast for oil demand this year to 99.3 million barrels per day (bpd) from 97.8 million bpd in 2017, and said it expected supply from non-OPEC nations to grow by 1.8 million bpd in 2018 to 59.9 million bpd, led by the United States. OPEC and other producers have cut output to reduce a global crude glut.

2018-03-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A science advocacy group urged the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday to reject a longstanding industry request to limit cyber attack protections at nuclear plants, a day after the Trump administration publicly blamed Moscow for hacking into nuclear power and other energy infrastructure. The Nuclear Energy Institute industry group petitioned the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in June 2014 to limit the scope of the agency’s cyber-protection safeguards to only systems with a direct impact on safety. The institute said in the petition that such limits would be “less burdensome” for operators of nuclear power plants while being “adequately protective” of public health and safety. The petition is “foolhardy at best and, at worse, downright dangerous,” said Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advisory group.  The Department of Homeland Security and FBI on Thursday said that the Russian government hacking campaign on energy and other facilities stretched back at least two years. “In light of the growing cyber threat to nuclear plants highlighted by yesterday’s alert, the agency should now simply reject it,” Lyman said. NRC spokesman David McIntyre said the agency sent the institute a letter in September telling them it was deferring consideration of the petition until it completes a round of inspections related to cyber security. The inspections started late last year and will continue through 2019.  Systems that control the most critical safety equipment at nuclear plants are largely immune to cyber attacks because they are analog-based and not connected to the internet. But many other systems with key safety and security functions are digital-based and could be compromised via their internet connections, Lyman said.   Hackers could disable or reprogram systems including electronic locks, alarms, closed-circuit television cameras, and communications equipment, the group said. Some plants have equipment, such as cranes that move highly radioactive spent fuel, that use network-based systems that could be manipulated to cause an accident, it said. The United States is the world leader in nuclear power, with 99 operating reactors. But the industry has suffered numerous closures in recent years in the face of a glut of cheap natural gas, a competing fuel for power plants, and soaring safety protection costs as a result of measures put in place after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. NEI spokesman John Keeley said his group had no comment on the request by the Union of Concerned Scientists.

2018-03-16,"SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela imposed electricity rationing this week in six western states, as the crisis-hit country’s creaky power grid suffered from a drought that has reduced water levels in key reservoirs needed to run hydroelectric power generators. The four-hour formal outages began on Thursday. But many residents scoffed at the announcement, wryly noting that they have been suffering far more extended blackouts during the last week.  “We have spent 14 hours without electricity today. And yesterday electricity came and went: for six hours we had no power,” said Ligthia Marrero, 50, in the western state of San Cristobal, noting that her fridge had been damaged by the frequent interruptions.  Crumbling infrastructure and lack of investments have hit Venezuela’s power supply for years. Now, the situation has been exacerbated by dwindling rains.  In the worst-hit western cities, business has all but ground to a halt at a time when the OPEC nation of 30 million is already suffering hyperinflation and a profound recession. Many Venezuelans are unable to eat properly on salaries of just a couple of dollars per month at the black market rate, sparking malnutrition, emigration and frequent sights of Venezuelans digging through trash or begging in front of supermarkets.      Maybelin Mendoza, a cashier at a bakery in Tachira state, said business has been further hit because points of sale stop working during blackouts - just as Venezuelans are chronically short of cash due to hyperinflation.  In the most dramatic cases, the opposition governor of Tachira state said three people, including a four-month-old, died this week because they failed to receive assistance during a power outage. “Because of electrical failures, the machines weren’t able to revive the people and they died,” said Laidy Gomez.  Reuters was unable to confirm the report.     Authorities have acknowledged that interruptions will continue for at least two weeks, but they have not said whether they will spread to other states. “Of a possible 1,100 megawatts, we are only generating 150 right now,” Energy Minister Luis Motta told reporters referring to the Fabricio Ojeda dam, in the western Andean state of Merida. Capital city Caracas and other major cities have not been hit by rationing yet. Two years ago, rationing there lasted five months when a drought hit the Guri dam, the country’s largest hydroelectric dam. But because of the economic crisis, Venezuela has reduced electricity consumption to about 14,000 megawatts at peak hours, according to engineer and former electricity executive Miguel Lara. Two years ago, state-run Corpoelec put the figure at 16,000 megawatts.

2018-03-16,"RIBEIRÃO PRETO, Brazil, March 16 (Reuters) - Brazilian mills are doing everything they can to keep raw sugar off the global market as Brazil’s cane harvest kicks off, to avoid worsening a glut that has driven prices to their lowest in two years. With the benchmark raw sugar contract trading below 13 cents per pound in New York and production costs in Brazil’s center-south varying from 13.5 cents to 15 cents, directors of sugar companies are weighing bold moves to avoid negative profit margins. “We have to cut the supply of sugar to help reduce the global surplus,” said Hugo Cagno, a partner along with French sugar group Tereos in the Vertente mill, in the town of Guaraci, deep in Brazil’s main cane belt in the state of Sao Paulo. This week Datagro analysts said they expect Brazilian producers to cut sugar volumes in the 2018/19 center-south crop area to 31.6 million tonnes, from 36 million tonnes a year ago. The obvious move, for those who are able, is turning as much cane as possible into ethanol, since domestic prices and demand for the biofuel are strong, paying the equivalent of a raw sugar price around 17 cents per pound, mill owners said. Others with access to capital are looking to stock and carry the unsold sugar until prices rise, possibly in the inter-harvest period at the start of next year. Another strategy is to increase production of white sugar to sell domestically to food and drink companies such as PepsiCo Inc, Nestle SA and AmBev SA. In some cases, producers have been so desperate to avoid money-losing sugar sales that they have negotiated so-called washouts, canceling export contracts for the sweetener. Luiz Gustavo Junqueira Figueiredo, commercial director at the Alta Mogiana mill, says washouts are not widespread but rather a last resort for mills that entered contracts without price protection. Alta Mogiana has not done any. “Stock and carry is a more interesting strategy, if you have the capital to build or rent storage capacity,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference this week in Ribeirão Preto, where millers discussed prospects for the new cane crop starting officially in April. Bernardo Biagi, owner of two mills crushing around 7 million tonnes of cane annually in the Ribeirão Preto area, says he has started processing at one of his mills but only ethanol so far. “We had cane left in the field from last year, so we are processing that for now, but only for fuel.

2018-03-16,"(Updates with afternoon trading) * Oil prices rise ahead of “60 Minutes” interview * Wall Street indexes higher on strong economic data * Dollar falls against yen, gains against other currencies By Nick Brown NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied on Friday afternoon ahead of a much-anticipated television interview with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, while Wall Street rose on strong economic data as U.S. stocks tried to end a rocky week on a high note. Crude prices had been on track for a weekly loss, but spiked on Friday, putting oil in position for a gain on the week. Energy investors were looking to cover short bets ahead of a televised interview Sunday by the U.S. news program “60 Minutes” with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The prince will be “comparing Iran’s Ayatollah to Hitler, and the battle in Ghouta, Syria, is ramping up,” said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York. “You can’t be short oil over the weekend with all that going on in the region.” U.S. crude rose 1.78 percent to $62.28 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.15, up 1.58 percent on the day. Brent crude prices hit their highest in more than two weeks as U.S. stock prices rose and investors looked to cover short bets. The S&P 500, which was down 1.5 percent on the week through Thursday, was trying to avoid its first five-day losing streak of 2018. Shares have struggled to weather a growing sense of turmoil in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and signs that protectionist policies could spur a trade war. But those fears took a back seat, at least temporarily, to economic data showing U.S. factory output jumped 1.1 percent in February. Retailer Walmart was up around 2.75 percent, and Home Depot had gained nearly 1 percent, after the University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment index rose more than expected to 102.0. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 114.48 points, or 0.46 percent, to 24,988.14, the S&P 500 gained 7.1 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,754.43 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.61 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,483.35. European shares lost ground for the week, despite a modest gain on Friday, driven by exchange operator NEX Group’s 30-percent jump after a takeover offer from U.S.-based peer CME Group. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.29 percent, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.04 percent. Trade volume in U.S. government bonds was low and, save for a modest steepening, yields were little moved, as the market quieted in anticipation of next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates at that meeting for the first time this year. “We’re looking towards next Wednesday,” said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst and trader at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.85 percent, from 2.824 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond last fell 14/32 in price to yield 3.0835 percent, from 3.061 percent Thursday. The solid economic data, which bolstered the consensus expectation of a rate hike, also pushed the dollar up slightly against a basket of six currencies, with the dollar index rising 0.11 percent. The euro was down 0.18 percent to $1.2282. But fears of political tensions did not disappear entirely, boosting the safe-haven Japanese yen, which strengthened 0.23 percent versus the greenback at 106.13 per dollar. The dollar had earlier fallen as low as 105.61 against the yen, the lowest since March 7. Sterling was last trading at $1.3939, up 0.02 percent on the day. Euro zone bond yields kept falling after another European Central Bank policymaker warned that inflation in the bloc remained sluggish, a potential hurdle to the withdrawal of monetary stimulus.

2018-03-16,"LONDON/LUANDA (Reuters) - Angolan state oil company Sonangol awarded its rare refined products buy tender to Glencore (GLEN.L) and Total (TOTF.PA), Sonangol said on Friday, cutting out long-time supplier Trafigura. Total will supply Angola with gasoline while Glencore will supply diesel and marine diesel. Sonangol issued the tender in January. For years Trafigura had an effective monopoly on lucrative fuel supply deals with OPEC member Angola, though Vitol edged in two years ago by taking over the gasoline imports.  Links between Trafigura and Angola stretch beyond fuel imports, with Sonangol and Angolan company Cochan Holdings having the significant stakes in trader’s global midstream and downstream business Puma Energy.  The choice to give the lion’s share of imports to other trade houses is a significant change under the country’s new president Joao Lourenco.  Shortly after taking office in September, Lourenco said he was committed to economic reforms and ordered a review of the country’s oil industry. He has already shaken up the old order by pushing out prominent figures from key state roles, including the former president’s daughter Isabel dos Santos, who was head of Sonangol. In Friday’s statement Sonangol said that it had received bids from 20 companies and that the contract would last one year, with an option for a nine-month extension. Sonangol added that the new tender award would bring a significant reduction in fuel import costs. The tender closed on Jan. 31, having sought 1.2 million tonnes of gasoline, 2.1 million tonne of gasoil and 480,000 tonnes of marine fuel. Heavily reliant on oil sales for government income, Angola was hit hard by the 2014 oil price crash, which pushed its economy into recession and created foreign currency shortages that crippled business.

2018-03-16,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The most likely leftist contender in Brazil’s presidential race, Ciro Gomes, is warning investors to hold off buying state assets in the energy sector because he would expropriate them if he wins in October. That includes rights to oil fields granted last year and a legislative push to dilute state control of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras, the country’s largest power utility. “What I want to say is: ‘Don’t buy. Wait a bit,’” Gomes said in an interview on Thursday in which the former governor of Ceara state detailed plans to raise taxes on wealthy Brazilians, reduce the country’s hefty public debt and change the Central Bank’s sole focus on fighting inflation. Gomes maintains that President Michel Temer is illegitimate because he took office in the controversial impeachment of leftist Dilma Rousseff, arguing that his policies should be revised by the next government elected by the Brazilian people. Gomes will benefit the most if former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s most influential politician, is barred from running due to a corruption conviction. A Datafolha poll in January showed that if Lula cannot run, Gomes would have 13 percent of voter intentions in a field led by far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro with 20 percent. Gomes expects to at least double his standing if he becomes the standard bearer of the left and hopes to win the backing of Lula’s Workers Party, which could provide his running mate, he said. While he would roll back many of Temer’s market-friendly policies, Gomes said he was no “juvenile leftist.” Oil companies that won concessions last year in Brazil’s pre-salt offshore region, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp, Statoil ASA and Total SA, would be compensated when the state revokes their contracts, Gomes said.  Even though he would redirect public spending to boost the economy and reduce social inequality, Gomes vowed he would be fiscally responsible. “I will pay the debt,” he said, adding that it would take several governments to do that, but he would start the trend. If elected, he plans to levy taxes on profits and dividends, while increasing inheritance taxes. Gomes thinks his main rival will be centre-right candidate Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of Sao Paulo. However, Gomes said he would relish the chance to face Bolsonaro, a pro-gun, anti-gay former army captain whom he called a “right-wing scarecrow.” Writing and additional reporting by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Susan Thomas",https://uk.reuters.com/article/brazil-politics-gomes/interview-brazil-presidential-contender-gomes-would-reverse-privatizations-idUKL1N1QY0AL,16 Mar 2018,"The most likely leftist

2018-03-16,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Friday it has agreed to purchase two gas turbines from Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) for installation at a power plant it is building in Russia’s Caucasus Chechnya region. Siemens said last year that it was reviewing aspects of its dealings with Russia after claiming that four of its power-generating turbines meant for southern Russia had been delivered to Crimea, which is subject to European sanctions on technology supplies after Russia annexed the region. In October, however, Siemens said it was ready to participate in the modernisation of power plants in Russia. Gazprom, whose electric power arm Gazprom energoholding is one of Russia’s biggest power suppliers, plans to open a plant in the Chechnen capital Grozny next year with a capacity of up to 360 megawatts. It did not say in its statement on Friday how much it would pay for the two turbines.   Chechnya fought two wars against Russia after the 1991 Soviet collapse, but now, in return for generous subsidies and a wide degree of autonomy, pledges loyalty to Moscow.  Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been blacklisted as part of Western sanctions against Russia but businesses in Chechnya are not subject to sanctions.

2018-03-16,"VIENNA, March 16 (Reuters) - The United States and three European allies have had “very good” talks on President Donald Trump’s demand that their nuclear deal with Iran be improved by a May 12 deadline, a U.S. envoy said on Friday. Trump has threatened to withdraw the United States from the accord between Tehran and six world powers, signed in 2015 before he took office, unless France, Britain and Germany help agree a follow-up pact by that date. Trump does not like the deal’s limited duration, among other things. A State Department cable obtained by Reuters last month, however, outlined a path under which the three key European allies would simply commit to try to improve the deal over time in return for Trump keeping the pact alive by renewing U.S. sanctions relief in May. Senior officials from the countries which signed the deal held a quarterly meeting in Vienna on Friday. Separately, the U.S. delegation met their counterparts from France, Britain and Germany on Thursday, U.S. envoy Brian Hook said. “What the president has asked us to do is to work with our European allies and see if we can come to an agreement before May 12 and we don’t have any instructions beyond May 12,” Hook said at a news conference, three days after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He reiterated the three broad complaints Trump has of the nuclear deal - its limited duration, the fact it does not cover ballistic missile testing, and U.N. inspections of Iranian facilities - but did not say what form of agreement he was seeking. “I don’t want to prejudge what kind of mechanisms that we will use to reach an agreement with the Europeans. What the president said on Jan. 12 is that we much reach a supplemental agreement with the European allies in three specific areas,” he said. “This is the third meeting that we have had with the E3, (we) had very good discussions. There is a lot that we agree on and where we disagree we are working to bridge our differences,” Hook said, adding: “We are taking things one week at a time.” Asked if Tillerson’s sacking had affected the negotiations, he told reporters: “It hasn’t affected the talks at all”.

2018-03-16,"(Adds details, quote) ABUJA, March 16 (Reuters) - Nigeria hopes a long-delayed bill to overhaul parts of the country’s oil industry can be sent to President Muhammadu Buhari to be signed into law by the end of March, the head of a parliamentary petroleum committee said on Friday. The OPEC member is Africa’s largest oil producer. Crude sales are the nation’s economic mainstay, making up two-thirds of government revenue, but the sector’s development has been held back for decades by mismanagement. The Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) is the first part of a larger piece of legislation, known as the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), to pass through parliament. The PIB, debated for over a decade, was broken up into sections to help it pass into law more easily. Nigeria’s lower house of parliament in January passed a version of the PIGB which was the same as one approved by the Senate last year - the first time both houses have approved the same version of the bill. It needs the president’s signature to become law. “Hopefully, by the end of the month, the National Assembly will transmit it to the president for assent,” said Senator Tayo Alasoadura, who chairs the upper house of parliament’s committee on upstream petroleum. The PIGB would create four new entities whose powers would include the ability to conduct bid rounds, award exploration licences and make recommendations to the oil minister on upstream licences.

2018-03-16,"ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and its adversaries in Yemen’s armed Houthi movement are holding secret talks to try to end a three-year-old war that has unleashed the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, diplomats and Yemeni political sources said. A Saudi-led coalition is fighting to counter the influence of Riyadh’s arch-foe Iran, an ally of the Houthis, who deny any help from Tehran and say they are fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and Gulf powers in thrall to the West. Speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, two diplomats and two Yemeni officials said the Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam had been in direct communication with Saudi officials in Oman on a comprehensive solution to the conflict. “There are consultations between the Houthis and the Saudis, without a representative of the internationally recognised government, and it is clear that there is a desire of the Houthis and the coalition to go towards a comprehensive agreement,” one diplomat told Reuters. A coalition official denied that Saudi Arabia had any negotiations with the Houthis, and reaffirmed support, in a statement to Reuters, for U.N. peace efforts aimed at reaching a political solution. Houthi officials did not provide an official comment. Hailing from Yemen’s Zaydi Shi’ite sect, the Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, and drove the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into Saudi exile. Fearing the advance was part of a regional power grab by Tehran, Riyadh and other mostly Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states armed and supported by the United States and Britain intervened to restore his rule. The hoped-for accord would begin with a truce to pause fighting on nationwide battlefronts and culminate in the signing of a peace deal addressing the political interests of the warring parties, the sources added. Thousands of Saudi-led air strikes have killed hundreds of Yemeni civilians, while Houthi-led cross-border rocket attacks on Saudi Arabia have led to hundreds of casualties. Coalition forces have made modest territorial gains but appear far from seizing back the capital from seasoned Houthi fighters. With no victory in sight, and as the war pushes the country towards famine, Saudi officials including the powerful crown prince and Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman have expressed a desire to wrap up the conflict. Diplomats said the Saudi-Houthi dialogue had been going on for about two months and appeared aimed at providing a framework for a resolution to coincide with the arrival of a new U.N. envoy to Yemen, former British diplomat Martin Griffiths, who began his term on Sunday. But it was not immediately clear how much progress had been achieved. U.N.-backed peace talks between the Houthis and the Yemeni government were last held in Kuwait in August 2016. That round of dialogue and two previous ones in Switzerland, where there was no Saudi presence, ended without success. The current talks appear to have bypassed Yemen’s Riyadh-based government, whose restoration was the justification for the Saudi-led intervention, underlining a series of deepening Yemeni squabbles which have hobbled the coalition war effort. Two Hadi government officials contacted by Reuters were unaware of the dialogue, and their criticism of the coalition has mounted in recent days, accusing them of barring Hadi and other Riyadh-based officials from returning to the country. Hadi has mostly resided in Riyadh, while government-held areas in Yemen experienced a series of deadly attacks by Islamic State militants. He last visited in February 2017.

2018-03-16,"March 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. appeals court on Friday overturned a District Court’s preliminary injunction that prevented construction on part of Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Bayou Bridge crude oil pipeline in the Atchafalaya Basin. In February U.S. district judge Shelly Dick issued a temporary injunction preventing work on an extension to the Bayou Bridge system, revoking a permit and siding with environmentalists and fishermen who expressed concerns about its potential effect on the local economy and wildlife. “Judge Dick’s ruling ran counter to the collective efforts of federal, state, and local regulatory officials, who thoroughly reviewed – and ultimately approved – the Bayou Bridge Pipeline for construction,” Friday’s court filing said. The disputed 162-mile (261-km) pipeline is an extension to an existing line, which transports crude from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. The new segment would extend the system to St. James, Louisiana, and have capacity to transport up to 480,000 barrels per day of oil. The project is 60 percent owned by ETP with the remainder controlled by refiner Phillips 66. Energy Transfer Partners on Friday said it was pleased with the court ruling and would begin mobilizing for construction activities as soon as possible. One of the three judges that heard the appeal filed a dissent, agreeing with the District Court’s ruling that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had violated the law when issuing permits for the pipeline. Groups opposing the pipeline vowed to continue fighting. “Today’s ruling is a setback but it’s not the end of this fight,” Jan Hasselman, an attorney for Earthjustice, the group representing the plaintiffs, said in a release. Energy Transfer Partners last year prevailed over environmental and Native American groups that had temporarily blocked construction of its Dakota Access Pipeline, a separate line that transports crude from North Dakota to a pipeline system terminating on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Eni was the first oil major to cut its dividend three years ago after a steep decline in the oil price forced the industry to tighten its belt. But as crude prices recover, the focus of the world’s biggest oil companies is slowly shifting from slashing jobs and investment to boosting shareholder returns and growth. So far this year, Total has raised dividends, BP flagged a resumption of share buybacks and Shell scrapped its scrip dividend. State-controlled Eni said in its new business plan to 2021 that it would pay a dividend this year of 0.83 euros ($1.02) per share, 3.7 percent more than last year. It also said a share buyback remained an option to distribute excess cash. “All the work of the last three-four years is finally paying dividends. It’s a much better company now,” said Alessandro Pozzi, oil analyst at Mediobanca. Eni, the world’s most successful explorer in recent years after finds in Egypt and Mozambique, said it would not be cutting investments, spending almost 32 billion euros over the duration of the plan. It said it aimed to increase production by 3.5 percent per year, up from a 3 percent target in its previous plan. Output would grow by 4 percent this year. “During the downturn we tripled our acreage and this is the big potential Eni has,” Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said. The company, the biggest foreign oil and gas producer in Africa, will add 2 billion barrels of new oil and gas production over the next four years with free cash flow from its upstream operations totalling 22 billion euros. Since taking over as CEO in 2014, oil veteran Descalzi has streamlined the company, sharpening its focus on finding oil and gas. “We will be making the final investment decision on five key projects this year,” added Chief Financial Officer Massimo Monduzzi. The discovery of two world-class gas fields, in Mozambique and Egypt, added 115 trillion cubic feet of resources to its portfolio, opening up opportunities in liquefied natural gas (LNG). It is working with Exxon on LNG development at its giant mamba field in Mozambique, and said the group aimed to increase LNG sales to 12 million tonnes per year by 2021 and 14 MTPA by 2025. Eni, which currently generates around 80 percent of its business from upstream activities, also said it was looking to develop its chemicals, refining and retail divisions. “We have completed the transformation of mid-downstream businesses and now we are ready for their expansion and growth in value,” Descalzi said. Some investors have said Eni needs to bolster its midstream and downstream businesses as a hedge against oil price swings. At 1430 GMT, Eni shares were up 1.7 percent at 14.06 euros, outpacing a 1 percent rise in Europe’s oil and gas sector . $1 = 0.8114 euros

The MSCI All-Country World stock index, which tracks 47 countries, gained 0.11 percent after three sessions of losses, but was set for a weekly fall of about 0.6 percent. Market participants have been anxious this week over turmoil in the U.S. government and the spectre of a global trade war, after U.S. President Donald Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, viewed as a free trade proponent, then sought to impose $60 billion of tariffs on Chinese imports. Headlines on Thursday reinforced those concerns, with the Washington Post reporting Trump was committed to removing H.R. McMaster as national security advisor, and the New York Times saying that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed documents related to Trump’s businesses. Simmering tensions between Russia and Britain, and fears about creeping far-right influence in Italy’s government, contributed to investor worries. European shares found some support in dealmaking activity, with exchange operator NEX Group jumping nearly 33 percent after a takeover offer from U.S.-based peer CME Group . The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.47 percent. U.S. stocks opened higher on the back of technology and financial stocks, with JPMorgan and Bank of America each up more than 0.85 percent and Adobe Systems rising more than 3 percent after the Photoshop maker topped analysts’ profit and revenue estimates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 74.46 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,948.12, the S&P 500 gained 10.14 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,757.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.39 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,501.13. Wall Street was nonetheless on track for losses on the week, with the benchmark S&P down more than 1.5 percent in the week through Thursday amid trade war fears, riding a four-session losing streak. “The key here is whether the main battle ground of the trade war will reach IT digital products,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holding. In currency markets, reports of the possible removal of McMaster weighed on the dollar, sending it to a more than one-week low against the safe-haven Japanese yen. The yen strengthened 0.24 percent versus the greenback to 106.11 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3893, down 0.31 percent on the day.

2018-03-16,"March 16 (Reuters) - SunPower Corp on Friday said it was strongly considering expanding its solar panel manufacturing in the United States as it grapples with the Trump administration’s tariffs on solar imports. The news came as the company filed a request to exempt some of its foreign-made panels from the new 30 percent tariffs. In the filing, SunPower argued that its highly efficient, premium-priced  solar panels cannot be compared with the more conventional models that dominate the market. In an interview, Chief Executive Tom Werner said it was not seeking an exemption for its less efficient and expensive “P-series” panels and would likely set up a new U.S. manufacturing plant for that product. An exclusion of its other products from the tariffs “just makes it far easier to make that investment,” Werner said.

2018-03-16,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - German utility E.ON (EONGn.DE) is emerging as an investor favourite following a major asset swap deal with rival RWE (RWEG.DE) this week, with its eye-popping share of regulated profits outshining RWE’s riskier bet on renewables. Following the deal, announced on Sunday, shares in both companies soared, as did those in RWE’s networks and renewables business Innogy (IGY.DE), which will be broken up as part of the deal and whose assets will split among E.ON and RWE. Investors have had almost a week to digest a barrage of additional details and presentations on the multifaceted transaction, with some concluding that E.ON got the better end of the deal because most of its profits are now guaranteed. “E.ON is the winner,” said Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW, which usually represents roughly 1 percent of voting rights at the annual general meetings of E.ON and RWE. “I don’t see a real advantage for RWE in the new set-up.” Under the deal, E.ON will swallow Innogy’s networks as well as its retail energy operations, becoming the European leader  in both areas and raising its share of regulated profits to 80 percent, comparable in size only to Britain’s National Grid (NG.L). For its part, RWE will become Europe’s second-largest wind power player after Denmark’s Orsted (ORSTED.CO) by taking on Innogy’s and E.ON’s renewable businesses, exposing it to a fast-growing but highly competitive renewables market. “If you want low risk with structural upside you’re well advised to buy E.ON,” said Andreas Schneller, head of EIC Funds at wealth manager Pury Pictet Turrettini & Cie, who oversees a 70 million Swiss Francs ($74 million) utility fund 2629827.S. “We think RWE is massively undervalued and therefore very attractive. However, it is the riskier bet,” he added. RWE’s sceptical municipal shareholders have supported the deal. Investment returns on gas and power grids are set by national regulators, allowing a reliable forecast of which way future profits will go. On the downside, growth can only be achieved through efficiency measures. Thomas Deser, fund manager at Union Investment, said E.ON’s future customer solutions retail energy business, Europe’s largest with about 50 million clients, also offered upside, and was less optimistic about competition in the clean energy space. A shift towards auctions and away from unlimited subsidies has squeezed Europe’s renewables sector and forced players along the supply chain to cut costs and make low-ball offers to secure a piece of the dwindling state support schemes. “Following the changes in the market regimes, current renewable projects have become less attractive in a lot of places, also due to competition from Big Oil, which means it is not a great long-term growth option in terms of margins,” Deser said. The lack of major synergies on the RWE side, seen at just 50 million euros so far, has also raised questions in light of the 600-800 million euros seen at E.ON, according to Martijn Olthof, senior portfolio manager at APG Asset Management, one of Innogy’s minority shareholders. He also said that investors keen on renewable exposure, which also include Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, could like him have a problem with adding RWE to their  portfolio due to its fleet of coal-fired power plants. “That carbon footprint makes it pretty difficult for us to invest.” ($1 = 0.9498 Swiss francs) ($1 = 0.8111 euros) Additional reporting by Tom Pfeiffer in London; Editing by Keith Weir",https://uk.reuters.com/article/innogy-ma-eon-investment/investors-give-e-on-edge-after-big-german-power-deal-idUKL8N1QY1GJ,16 Mar 2018,"German utility

2018-03-16,"SOFIA, March 16 (Reuters) - Ten companies have expressed an interest to bid in a 60 million euros ($74 million) tender to supply pipes for a 185-km (115 miles) gas pipeline between Greece and Bulgaria (IGB), the Bulgarian energy ministry said on Friday. ICGB, a joint venture for the 240 million euros pipeline, will select up to five companies to file offers for the tender in April and hopes to pick a winner by the end of June, ICGB executive director Teodora Georgieva said. Companies from Turkey, India, Russia, Greece, Germany and Bulgaria, including Welspun Corp. and Salzgitter , have filed requests to participate. “The project is key for the diversification of energy supplies and will allow access to the South Gas Corridor through which our country and southeastern Europe will get Caspian natural gas,” Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said. ICGB plans to open a tender for construction of the pipeline next month and have the gas link ready in 2020, when Bulgaria should start receiving 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Shah Deniz 2 gas field in Azerbaijan. At present, Bulgaria meets over 95 percent of its gas needs with shipments from Russia’s Gazprom.

2018-03-16,"OSLO, March 16 (Reuters) - A planned nuclear reactor in western Finland, owned by a Finnish-Russian consortium, will meet its 2024 commissioning target despite delays in licensing, and will not be affected by sanctions on Russia, supplier Rosatom said. The start date of the 1.2 gigawatt (GW) Hanhikivi 1 reactor has been in question since September, when owner Fennovoima said the construction licence it needed from the authorities would take a year longer to get due to delays. The Fennovoima consortium, of which about a third is owned by a Rosatom unit, had also expressed concerns in its annual report that economic sanctions on Russia could affect its banks’ ability to guarantee the project’s funding. “We strongly believe that Hanhikivi 1 can be commissioned in 2024 as planned. And we’re ready to deal with unpredictable circumstances, should they arise, and will adapt as necessary,” a Rosatom spokesman told Reuters in an email. He said Rosatom was working on providing the delayed documentation to Finnish regulator STUK during 2018 in order to get the required construction permit to build the reactor. “EU sanctions against Russia won’t affect the timeframe of the Hanhikivi 1 project. None of the people involved in the project are on the sanctions list,” the spokesman added. Hanhikivi 1, estimated to cost between 6.5 billion and 7 billion euros ($8.0-$8.6 billion), is set to start producing electricity commercially in 2024, five years after another long-delayed Finnish reactor, Olkiluoto 3, comes online. The costs of Olkiluoto 3 (OL3), a reactor that was initially planned to begin production in 2009, have spiralled from 3.2 billion euros to 5.5 billion euros, owner TVO said last week, and there was a risk of that rising even further. In contrast to OL3, supplied by Areva and Siemens , Fennovoima’s reactor was unlikely to exceed the budget, Rosatom said. “We have a vested interest, as investor and supplier, to make sure that the Hanhikivi 1 project is achieved within the set budget,” the spokesman said. Fennovoima is 66 percent owned by Voimaosakeyhtio SF, which includes more than 50 Finnish regional utilities and other companies. Rosatom’s RAOS Voima Oy unit holds the remaining 34 percent. In October, Rosatom had to delay another European project to build two reactors in Hungary worth 12.5 billion euros, facing regulatory hurdles from the European Union. $1 = 0.8144 euros

2018-03-16,"MADRID (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is using his main election rival Henri Falcon as an “instrument” to divide the country’s opposition ahead of a May 20 vote, the head of the Organisation of American States (OAS) said on Friday. Falcon, an ex-state governor and former ally of Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez, defied an opposition boycott of the presidential election to run despite conditions critics say are rigged to ensure the ruling socialists retain control. “We all knew that Henri Falcon would be an instrument of the Venezuelan government to divide the opposition - and his candidacy ends up proving it,” Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the 34-member OAS, told an event in Madrid. “Henri Falcon’s candidacy benefits ‘chavismo’ (the ruling movement). We asked the Venezuelan opposition to sort the wheat from the chaff and Henri Falcon is the chaff that has separated alone,” he added in comments to Reuters at the Casa de America cultural centre. Almagro reiterated his calls for harsher sanctions against Venezuela’s “dictatorship”. He said last month sanctions should be targeted against Venezuela’s all-important oil sector to intensify financial pressure on Maduro’s government, which has presided over five years of crippling recession. Venezuela’s main opposition coalition has rebuked Falcon for legitimising an election they deem a farce, as Maduro’s most popular rivals are barred from standing and the election board favours the government. Maduro denies the system is undemocratic and calls the OAS a pawn of U.S. policy. Falcon broke with the socialists in 2010 and is now promising a “national unity” government. While most analysts give him little chance, some recent polls actually put him ahead of Maduro in voter preferences. Falcon has said the opposition’s boycott is ineffective and will only give Maduro an uncontested win, arguing that 80 percent of Venezuelans wanted change.

2018-03-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s new transport minister said on Friday he was no “buddy” of car industry bosses, but a friend of production line workers and drivers who opposes bans for diesel vehicles and forcing manufacturers to refit cars.  Andreas Scheuer, sworn in as minister this week, also told Bild newspaper that he - like Chancellor Angela Merkel - opposed the introduction of a system of badges to identify more polluting diesels. He said they were the first step towards the driving bans he wanted to avoid. “I don’t see myself as a buddy of automobile bosses but rather as the mate of those working on the production lines and as someone who represents the interests of diesel vehicle owners,” Scheuer said. Some officials have proposed a system of “blue badges” that would allow cities with particularly bad air quality to selectively ban dirtier diesel cars from their streets. But Scheuer said he, like his predecessor Alexander Dobrindt, who was often accused of being too closely tied to the country’s car industry, opposed any move in that direction. “Whether it’s blue badges, light blue badges,” he said, “badges are the wrong method. I reject their introduction like my predecessor Alexander Dobrindt did. They are the first step towards driving bans.” But he insisted he would be tough with carmakers, promising “new, very, very serious talks” with carmakers on diesel pollution. Asked whether car companies would be forced generally to retrofit diesel cars, he said he expected the companies to cooperate but added: “Forcing is not the way I do politics.” Merkel last week said she opposed blanket nationwide schemes to restrict diesels, adding a badge scheme would let off the hook cities that should instead focus on finding locally appropriate ways of improving air quality, for instance by retrofitting public transport vehicles.

2018-03-16,"MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil trader Trafigura will regain its position as the largest buyer of seaborne crude from Russia’s Rosneft, trading sources told Reuters on Friday, expanding their partnership as Rosneft reduces its dealings with Vitol and Glencore. Three sources told Reuters that Trafigura would increase its dominance in Rosneft’s Urals oil trading from April when Rosneft’s 5-year pre-finance deal with Vitol and Glencore expires. “Trafigura will be the lucky one,” a trader in the Russian crude oil market said. Rosneft, Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol all declined to comment. Trafigura was the biggest lifter of Rosneft crude for a couple of years from 2014, when the companies established a close partnership amid Western sanctions on Moscow. Rosneft’s boss Igor Sechin is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and the West imposed sanctions on the Kremlin to retaliate against Russia’s annexation of Crimea. But Trafigura lost a large portion of volumes at the start of this year when Rosneft transferred volumes it was previously getting in the Pacific to its new shareholder, China’s CEFC.  From April, Trafigura will be able to recoup the volumes lost in the Pacific by getting more Urals crude on the Baltic. It will see volumes rising to 10 cargoes in April from Russian Baltic ports from five in previous months, according to traders. The development became possible because March was the last month of Rosneft’s supplies to Vitol and Glencore under a pre-finance deal signed in 2013, shortly before Western sanctions against Moscow were imposed. From April onwards, Rosneft will have some 700,000 tonnes, or seven cargoes, a month of Urals volumes available for sale and most of it will go to Trafigura, the sources said. The development means Vitol, once the biggest buyer of Rosneft’s oil, will disappear from the list of regular buyers of Rosneft’s crude as it doesn’t have new pre-finance deals.  Glencore will remain a large buyer as it secured a long-term supply deal last year when it became a shareholder in Rosneft. Sharp increases in Urals supplies from Rosneft could make Trafigura the biggest market player in the Baltic Urals market from next month, Reuters data showed.

2018-03-16,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2FFcbQp By John Kemp LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - If the oil market has felt unusually quiet in recent weeks and months, that probably reflects the almost complete lack of sharp daily price movements. While prices have soared by more than 40 percent since the middle of 2017, day-to-day volatility has fallen to its lowest level since 2014, with a relatively smooth and orderly upward adjustment in prices. Short-term volatility has been trending downwards since early 2016 and in January fell to its lowest since August 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2FFcbQp). The 20-day standard deviation of daily price moves expressed at an annualised rate — one common measure of volatility — dropped to only 13 percent in January from 80 percent almost two year earlier. Volatility in early and mid-January was in the bottom fifth percentile for any 20-day period since the start of 1990. The relatively sharp drop in oil prices at the start of February has since pushed volatility slightly higher, at least temporarily, but even that decline was relatively smooth. Volatility is still only in the 28th percentile of the post-1990 distribution and is set to decline again if the market’s more recent calm is sustained. There have been no significantly large daily price movements in Brent, up or down, since June 2017, which was the last time there was a daily move exceeding 2 standard deviations. The last really abnormal price move, exceeding 3 standard deviations and nearing 4, was all the way back in November 2016, when OPEC announced that it had reached agreement on cutting production. French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot noted the average level of volatility in commodity prices, as well as other assets, is itself volatile (“The Variation of Certain Speculative Prices”, Mandelbrot, 1963). Commodity markets alternate between “mild” and “wild” states, characterised by lower and higher levels of volatility respectively (“The (Mis)Behaviour of Markets”, Mandelbrot, 2004). Since OPEC and non-OPEC countries announced their declaration of cooperation in late 2016, the oil market has been in a mild state, and the absence of volatility has been especially pronounced in the past nine months. Strong growth in global oil consumption has been accompanied by large upward revisions in forecast oil production. Global oil inventories have shrunk sharply, but there is broad optimism that future production will grow fast enough to meet demand. Record buying of futures and options linked to petroleum by hedge funds and other money managers has been matched by strong interest in short-selling and hedging from producers. The result is that market liquidity has been very high, with the accumulation of relatively large futures and options positions and heavy turnover inducing only modest price changes. The critical question for traders and investors is whether this relatively suppressed level of volatility will continue. And if so, for how long? The shift from mild to wild usually occurs abruptly and without warning. There isn’t usually a gradual transition from one state to the other. Several risk factors could cause an upsurge in volatility in the next few months, including the unwinding of concentrated hedge fund positions, uncertainty surrounding future growth of U.S. shale production and macroeconomic risks to oil consumption. Volatility could also come from within the market itself, in the form of flash crashes that arise from the positioning of market participants and do not need any external, fundamental trigger. Periods of low volatility tend to breed complacency and excessive risk-taking among traders, which sows the seeds of their own demise. While various risk factors can be identified in the current market, periods of low volatility can persist for a surprisingly long time. The previous period of low volatility extended for more than two years, from mid-2012 to early 2015. The current mild phase has already lasted for almost 15 months, since the start of 2017, but it will not last forever.

2018-03-16,"DUBAI, March 16 (Reuters) - Construction work has begun on a joint venture to build a shipyard on Saudi Arabia’s eastern coast, oil rig builder Lamprell Plc said in a statement on Friday. The joint venture, International Maritime Industries (IMI), started operations after reaching agreement for a loan from the state-backed Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF), the statement said. The SIDF agreed in principle last year to provide 3.75 billion riyals ($1 billion) in financing for the project. IMI is a partnership between United Arab Emirates-based Lamprell, state oil giant Saudi Aramco, National Shipping Co of Saudi Arabia (Bahri) and South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. An Aramco executive will be chief executive of the project, which Aramco has previously said will cost more than 20 billion riyals ($5.3 billion). Lamprell’s anticipated total equity contribution over the construction period is up to $140 million, the statement said. The nearly 12 million square-metre facility is planned to have an annual capacity to manufacture four offshore rigs and over 40 vessels, including three Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), and service over 260 maritime products. $1 = 3.7501 riyals

2018-03-16,"(Adds US stock index futures, updates prices) * Stocks waver after three days of losses * World stocks set for weekly loss despite record inflows * Mueller investigation adds to U.S. political worries * White House shake-up reports weigh on dollar * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Danilo Masoni MILAN, March 16 (Reuters) - World stocks wavered and the dollar eased on Friday as turmoil in the Trump administration kept markets watchful at the end of a week scarred by concerns that U.S. tariffs could provoke a trade war. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks 47 countries, was flat after three straight sessions of losses and was set for a weekly fall of around 0.6 percent. European shares found some support in dealmaking activity although the STOXX 600 was on track for a 0.3 percent weekly loss. That followed losses in Asia and in the U.S. overnight, while stock index futures pointed to a flat open for Wall Street ahead of the release of some macroeconomic data. S&P 500 futures  were up 0.05 percent. The New York Times reported that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had issued a subpoena for documents, including some concerning Russia, related to President Donald Trump’s businesses. “Trump isn’t giving markets much respite,” said Rabobank analyst Bas van Geffen in a note. “While still vague at best, the subpoena does bring the investigation yet another step closer to the president. Markets certainly didn’t like the added uncertainty.” Although world equities were set for a weekly loss, huge inflows helped limit the decline. According to figures from flows tracker EPFR cited by BAML, a record $43.3 billion was driven into equities this week. “Markets have been buoyed by strong inflows, but I think the under current in terms of news on the trade front is quite poor and I don’t think it has played out yet,” said Gautam Batra, head of investments at Mediolanum Asset Management. The Washington Post reported Trump has decided to remove H.R. McMaster as his national security advisor. This follows the departures of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and top economic adviser Gary Cohn, adding to concerns about the implications for U.S. policy. The developments, together with a report earlier this week that Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, cemented investors’ worries that the administration is increasingly leaning towards protectionism. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has said that Trump would get options in the coming weeks to address China’s “theft and forced transfer” of American intellectual property as part of an investigation. “The key here is whether the main battle ground of the trade war will reach IT digital products,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holding. The U.S. administration is negotiating to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement and last week announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, which have weighed on shares in some European steelmakers and industrial companies. Trump has offered exemptions from the tariffs to NAFTA members Canada and Mexico. A phone call between U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom to resolve the tariff dispute failed to bring results as they agreed to meet next week, a source said. Fears that the tariffs could disrupt synchronised global growth dwarfed recent strong economic data, including a fall in U.S. jobless claims. In currency markets, reports of the possible removal of U.S. security adviser McMaster weighed on the dollar, sending it to its lowest level against the yen since early March. The euro traded up 0.14 percent at $1.232 , having slipped 0.5 percent the previous day. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.17 percent at 89.986, easing after two days following remarks from incoming White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow who said he would like the dollar to be stronger. Weakness in the dollar helped copper prices recover from early falls, as a weaker dollar makes metals cheaper for holders of other currencies. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.57 percent at $6,960 a tonne. Oil prices edged up but were set to fall this week on concerns among investors about rising supply from the United States and elsewhere threatening to undermine efforts by OPEC and other producers to tighten the market. Brent futures rose 0.17 percent at $65.23 per barrel. Southern European government bonds outperformed their higher-rated peers as another ECB policymaker warned that inflation in the euro zone is still proving elusive, a potential hurdle to the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Other euro zone bond yields also dipped. Germany’s 10-year bond touched a fresh five-week low of 0.57 percent. U.S. Treasuries yields inched up to 2.829 percent after having hit a near two-week low of 2.797 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield eased after hitting a 9 1/2-year high of 2.295 percent as investors prepared for a widely expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve next week.

2018-03-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Greece’s Energean Oil & Gas (ENOG.L) listed on the London Stock Exchange on Friday, raising $460 million to develop two Israeli offshore gas fields in the latest milestone for the rapidly expanding eastern Mediterranean energy sector. The firm offered 72.6 million new shares at 4.55 pounds ($6.35) apiece in the first flotation of an oil and gas producer on London’s main market since Zenith Energy in January 2017, according to London Stock Exchange data. Energean shares were trading flat at 1213 GMT. The company will receive around 330 million pounds ($460 million) from the listing, which gave Energean a market capitalisation of around $968 million, the company said in a statement. The funds, together with a credit facility signed earlier this month, will go towards the $1.6 billion development of its Israeli offshore gas fields Karish and Tanin, which have potential reserves of up to 2.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 32.8 million barrels of light oil and condensate. “East Med has had a lot of activity. Investors saw an opportunity to participate in the only independent E&P (exploration and production company) in the East Mediterranean, which is dominated by the majors,” Energean Chief Executive Officer Mathios Rigas told Reuters in an interview. Companies including BP (BP.L), Italy’s Eni’s (ENI.MI) and France’s Total have increasingly turned their focus to the eastern Mediterranean gas basin in recent years following a string of large discoveries off the coasts of Egypt, Israel and Cyprus. Few international companies have however entered Israel due to political tensions with Arab countries.  Following the start-up of huge gas fields in Egypt and Israel, the eastern Mediterranean is on the verge of becoming a new hub for exporting gas to Europe and Asia. Israel, Cyprus, Italy and Greece are planning to construct a pipeline linking the basin to southern Europe, which relies heavily on gas imports. “This is for us a very important pipeline that, when developed, would open a huge markets for us and others,” Rigas said. The Karish floating production platform could be linked to other fields and process more gas that would be used for exports, he added. Egypt also hopes to increase exports of liquefied natural gas by the end of the decade.  DE-RISKED With the financing and all required permits in place as well as gas sale agreements in place, Energean is expected to give the green light for the development of the fields by the end of the month, Rigas said. “This is a totally de-risked project,” he said. It expects first gas from Karish, which means shark in Hebrew, in 2021. The Tanin field will be developed following Karish. Tanin means crocodile in Hebrew. Energean said earlier this month it had signed a $1.275 billion credit facility with four banks.  Energean, which has signed gas supply agreements for about 4.1 billion cubic metres of gas a year, has 50 million barrels of oil and 6 billion cubic feet of gas in more accessible reserves, mainly in Greek offshore fields. It produced 2,800 barrels per day of oil at its Greek fields in 2017. The listing was coordinated by Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Stifel Nicolaus and RBC Capital Markets.  The company will also list on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in the coming weeks, Rigas said.

2018-03-16,"SOFIA, March 16 (Reuters) - China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) has expressed an interest in investing in Bulgaria’s 2,000 megawatt nuclear power project Belene, Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said on Friday. The Balkan country should come up with plans by the end of June on whether to proceed with or scrap plans to restart the project estimated to cost at least 10 billion euros ($12.32 billion). Sofia cancelled the project in 2012 after failing to find foreign investors and bowing to U.S. and European Union pressure to limit the country’s energy dependence on Russia, contracted to build two 1,000 megawatt reactors at the Danube River. But the government renewed the search for investors to build the plant after an arbitration court ruled in 2016 that Bulgaria had to pay more than 600 million euros in compensation to Russia for the cancellation. “China’s state nuclear company CNNC has sent a letter, declaring its interest in the Belene nuclear project,” Petkova told parliament, adding that the letter was sent to state energy company NEK last month. Critics of the project, first launched in 1981, argue that the investment does not justify the benefits and that the project has been a source of corrupt practices for decades. Petkova pledged to come up with proposals on how to proceed with the project by the end of June. She said Bulgaria had already spent 3 billion levs on the project. Last month Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov suggested Belene be built as a pan-Balkan project to boost energy security and connectivity and urged its neighbours in the region to consider the option.

2018-03-16,"LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola’s economic growth prospects are on the rise as higher oil prices and sounder policies under President Joao Lourenco bring greater stability to Africa’s second biggest crude exporter, the International Monetary Fund said on Friday. Angola’s economy is expected to expand by 2.25 percent this year from 1 percent in 2017 and growth should reach 5 percent in the medium-term, Ricardo Velloso, IMF division chief for Africa, told reporters in Luanda. Since coming to power in September, Lourenco has vowed to revive sub-Saharan Africa’s third largest economy, attract investment and combat the endemic corruption that plagued the 38 year rule of his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Velloso said Lourenco’s government had already supported the economy by devaluing the kwanza currency, promising to reduce debt and restructuring state oil company Sonangol. He also said higher oil prices had helped. “The Angolan economy is experiencing a mild recovery. The new administration is rightly focusing on restoring macroeconomic stability and improving governance,” Velloso said. “Over the medium term, the outlook is for continued gradual recovery in economic activity but there are risks, including a decline in oil prices and slippages in implementation of the structural reforms to promote economic diversification.” The IMF does not think a bailout is necessary despite Angola’s heavy debt burden and high inflation, saying Lourenco’s reform plans and a buoyant global debt market should help stabilizes public finances, Velloso said. The IMF supports the Angolan government’s policy of extending maturities on debt rather than restructuring, he said. “With the higher oil price and decent access to external financing for frontier and emerging markets there isn’t a need for IMF financing for Angola,” Velloso said in response to a question about a possible bailout. “Obviously if we receive a request we will analyze it with care like with any member country of the IMF.” Inflation was expected to reach 24.75 percent year-on-year by the end of the year compared to 22.72 percent in January, the IMF predicts.

2018-03-16,"* World stocks waver after three days of losses * European shares livened up by dealmaking, set for weekly loss * Mueller investigation adds to U.S. political worries * White House shake-up reports weigh on dollar * Weaker dollar lifts copper prices, oil edges up * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Danilo Masoni MILAN, March 16 (Reuters) - World stocks wavered and the dollar eased on Friday as turmoil in the U.S. administration kept markets watchful at the end of a week scarred by concerns that U.S. tariffs could provoke a trade war. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks 47 countries, was flat after three straight sessions of losses and was set for a weekly fall of around 0.6 percent. European shares found some support in dealmaking activity although the STOXX 600 was on track for a 0.2 percent weekly loss. That followed losses in Asia and Wall Street overnight. The New York Times reported that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had issued a subpoena for documents, including some concerning Russia, related to President Donald Trump’s businesses. “Trump isn’t giving markets much respite,” said Rabobank analyst Bas van Geffen in a note. “While still vague at best, the subpoena does bring the investigation yet another step closer to the president. Markets certainly didn’t like the added uncertainty.” The Washington Post reported Trump has decided to remove H.R. McMaster as his national security advisor. This follows the departures of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and top economic adviser Gary Cohn, adding to concerns about the implications for U.S. policy. The developments, together with a report earlier this week that Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, cemented investors’ worries that the administration is increasingly leaning towards protectionism. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has said that Trump would get options in the coming weeks to address China’s “theft and forced transfer” of American intellectual property as part of an investigation. “The key here is whether the main battle ground of the trade war will reach IT digital products,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holding. The U.S. administration is negotiating to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement and last week announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, which have weighed on shares in some European steelmakers and industrial companies. Trump has offered exemptions from the tariffs to NAFTA members Canada and Mexico. A phone call between U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom to resolve the tariff dispute failed to bring results as they agreed to meet next week, a source said. Fears that the tariffs could disrupt synchronised global growth dwarfed recent strong economic data, including a fall in U.S. jobless claims. In currency markets, reports of the possible removal of U.S. security adviser McMaster weighed on the dollar, sending it to its lowest level against the yen since early March. The euro traded up 0.22 percent at $1.2330, having slipped 0.5 percent the previous day. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.25 percent at 89.912, easing after two days following remarks from incoming White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow who said he would like the dollar to be stronger. Weakness in the dollar helped copper prices recover from early falls, as a weaker dollar makes metals cheaper for holders of other currencies. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.52 percent at $6,956 a tonne. Oil prices edged up but were set to fall this week on concerns among investors about rising supply from the United States and elsewhere threatening to undermine efforts by OPEC and other producers to tighten the market. Brent futures rose 0.20 percent at $65.25 per barrel. Southern European government bonds outperformed their higher-rated peers as another ECB policymaker warned that inflation in the euro zone is still proving elusive, a potential hurdle to the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Other euro zone bond yields also dipped. Germany’s 10-year bond touched a fresh five-week low of 0.57 percent. U.S. Treasuries yields dipped to 2.815 percent after having hit a near two-week low of 2.797 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield steadied after hitting a 9 1/2-year high of 2.295 percent as investors prepared for a widely expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve next week.

2018-03-16,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Amnesty International on Friday accused international oil majors Shell (RDSa.L) and Eni (ENI.MI) of negligence when addressing spills in Nigeria. Describing their actions as “serious negligence”, Amnesty said the companies were “taking weeks to respond to reports of spills and publishing misleading information about the cause and severity of spills, which may result in communities not receiving compensation”. A Shell spokesman said Amnesty’s allegations “are false, without merit and fail to recognise the complex environment in which the company operates”. An ENI spokeswoman said the rights group’s statements “are not correct and, in some cases, not acceptable,” adding it had provided a detailed response to Amnesty’s allegations. Shell and Eni have for decades been two of the most active oil majors operating in the Niger Delta region.  Nigeria’s crude-producing heartland is an ecological disaster zone, scarred by decades of spills that have tainted the water and killed swathes of trees and other plants. Yet clean-ups, and the associated compensation, are highly contentious, with some local communities even blocking teams’ access to spill sites, allowing the damage to worsen, in the hope of extracting a bigger pay-out.  Under Nigerian law, companies must visit sites within 24 hours of reporting a spill. Amnesty said that in one case Italy’s Eni took more than a year to respond to a spill in Bayelsa state.  While oil companies frequently attribute spills to sabotage and theft, locals say they are often due to other issues such as corrosion. Shell has reported 1,010 spills since 2011, and Eni 820 since 2014, according to Amnesty, which said among those 1,830 reports it found 89 “about which there are reasonable doubts surrounding the cause provided by the oil companies”. In 2015, the Bodo community and a British law firm negotiated a 55 million pound pollution settlement with Shell. The Natural Resource Governance Institute, a non-profit group that advises countries on how to manage oil, gas and mineral resources, acknowledged there were sometimes difficulties on both sides. “There’s no good guy here, everybody’s kind of bad. I’m sure the companies don’t do all that they can to get to these places. But then they also have genuine grievances and genuine difficulties dealing with these communities,” said Aaron Sayne, from the institute. “When spills become an opportunity to make money, your clean-up becomes really tough.” Reporting by Paul Carsten; Additional reporting by Libby George in London; Editing by Alexis Akwagyiram, Alison Williams and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-nigeria/update-1-amnesty-says-shell-eni-negligent-on-nigeria-oil-spills-idUKL8N1QY204,16 Mar 2018,"* Niger Delta scarred by decades of spills

2018-03-16,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Australia reject protectionism, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his Singapore counterpart said on Friday, amid fears about a possible trade war sparked by U.S. plans to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. “You don’t grow stronger by closing the door to other markets. Protectionism is a dead end. It is not a ladder to get you out of the low growth trap, it is a shovel to dig it much deeper,” Turnbull told a special meeting of ASEAN in Sydney. “We must face the world, not turn from it. Embrace free trade, not retreat from it,” Turnbull said on day one of the three-day summit. The anti-protectionism comments come as market sentiment sours with signs of a looming trade war between the United States, China and Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and possibly up to $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, targeting technology and telecommunications sectors. “I know the global mood may be heading in the opposite direction but within ASEAN we are working to deepen and deepen interdependence to work together to open up markets,” Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said. Australia is hosting the ASEAN meeting, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, as it seeks to deepen political and trade ties in the face of China’s rising influence. Trade is a central topic of the meeting, though human rights and Chinese assertiveness are set to dominate talks between Australia and ASEAN countries. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she would raise human rights concerns with leaders in Myanmar, which has been criticized for its crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, and Cambodia, which has dissolved the main opposition party and jailed government critics. Asked whether the ASEAN meeting was a direct counter to China’s growing interest in the region, Bishop said Australia believed the bloc brought it “peace, stability and security”. “We don’t see it as having a role to balance the powers in the Indo-Pacific but rather be at the heart of the engagement collaboration with other countries,” she told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.  China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route which is believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas, and has been building artificial islands on reefs, some with ports and air strips. Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, all of which are members of ASEAN, and Taiwan also have claims in the sea. Lee acknowledged China’s rise had stoked divisions within ASEAN. “There is a shift in the global strategic balance, Chinese influence is growing with its economy and strength, and its interest in the region and beyond,” he said. “There is a range of different perspectives and responses to this shift in the balance among different ASEAN countries.”     Indonesian Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu on Friday said he had lobbied other ASEAN defense ministers to carry out maritime patrols in the South China Sea among efforts to improve regional security. Although several ASEAN countries already conduct joint exercises, other China-aligned member nations oppose such operations, making a consensus at the summit difficult. The inclusion of Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen in the meeting has drawn criticism, and large protests are planned against both. Crimes verging on genocide were being committed against the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, and those crimes bore “the fingerprints of the Myanmar government and of the international community”, the United Nations special adviser on the prevention of genocide said on Tuesday. Nearly 700,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after militant attacks on Aug. 25 sparked a crackdown led by security forces in western Rakhine state that the United Nations and United States have said constitute ethnic cleansing. “It is in our interest to engage all ASEAN members including Aung San Suu Kyi at this summit because it gives us the best chance of influencing outcomes and making our concerns known, so these are matters that we would be discussing with the Myanmar delegation,” Bishop said. The United Nations, Western nations and rights groups have decried a crackdown by Hun Sen against his critics ahead of a July general election. Hun Sen has warned potential protesters against burning effigies of him in Sydney, saying: “I will follow you all the way to your doorstep and beat you right there ... I can use violence against you.” Despite the threat, hundreds of protesters on Friday rallied through Sydney, demanding the release of political prisoners. Asked about Hun Sen’s threat, Bishop said Australia was “certainly going to raise our concerns with the Cambodian delegation”.

U.S. shares hit a session low soon after the New York Times reported that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had issued a subpoena for documents related to U.S. President Donald Trump’s businesses. The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported that President Donald Trump has decided to remove H.R. McMaster as his national security advisor. The news came just days after following the recent departure of two key officials, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and top economic advisor Gary Cohn, from the Trump administration. The developments, together with the report earlier this week that Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, cemented investor concerns that the administration is increasingly leaning towards protectionism. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has said that Trump would in coming weeks get options to address China’s “theft and forced transfer” of American intellectual property as part of the investigation under Section 301. “The key here is whether the main battle ground of the trade war will reach IT digital products. In this sector, there is division of labour in the supply chain, with each country having specialised products,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holding. “Investors have been thinking the U.S. would not take such steps as that would harm itself. But the fall in high-tech shares yesterday may suggest that investors have begun to take such risks into account,” he added. Fears that the tariffs could disrupt synchronised global growth dwarfed recent strong economic data, including a fall in U.S. jobless claims. Any disruptions to the information sector will cost investors particularly dearly given the sector has been the main engine of the global share rally during the past decade. “It seems as if for Trump, only ‘America First’ policies are left to boost his popularity and to get re-elected,” said Hiroko Iwaki, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities. “It is hard to expect political uncertainties to disappear soon. That will underpin bonds,” she added. U.S. Treasuries yield stood little changed at 2.822 percent in Asia after having hit a near two-week low of 2.797 percent on Thursday. In contrast, short-term bond yields rose as investors braced for a widely expected rate hike by the Federal Reserve next week, with the two-year yield hitting a 9 1/2-year high of 2.295 percent. In Europe, the German Bund yield hit a six-week low of 0.566 percent. Political uncertainties are mounting in Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is under pressure for suspicions of a cover-up in a controversial land sale. In the currency market, rising risk aversion pushed the dollar lower against the safe haven yen to 105.94 yen down 0.4 percent. The euro was little changed at $1.2303, having slipped 0.5 percent the previous day. Subdued risk sentiment kept the dollar supported against riskier currencies, such as commodity-linked currencies and emerging market currencies. The Canadian dollar, which has been hit also by worries Trump may pull out from NAFTA, hit a nine-month low of C$1.3072 to the dollar. The Australian dollar dropped to as low as $0.7771, its lowest level in 10 days. “The Australian dollar had been resilient during this month’s tensions, suggesting that the very bullish global growth narrative is yet to be really shaken,” said Westpac senior currency analyst Sean Callow. “But should the U.S.-driven trade tensions deepen in the months ahead, the Australian dollar is likely to be one of the currencies hardest hit, given Australia’s current account deficits and its heavy reliance on China for commodity exports.” Oil prices were little changed after ending choppy Thursday trade higher as the International Energy Agency said global oil demand is expected to pick up this year, but warned supply is growing at a faster pace.

2018-03-16,"KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - R esearchers backed by multi-million dollar grants from NASA are heading to Southeast Asia’s Mekong River region to find ways to improve dams so they are less harmful to people and the environment. Researchers from Michigan State University (MSU) will spend three years analyzing sites in the lower Mekong River basin in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. The project will be funded by two grants from the United States space agency, NASA, totaling $3 million, and the researchers hope their findings will improve dams around the world. “The most egregious affects of dam building are displacement and relocation,” said Daniel Kramer, a professor of fisheries and wildlife at MSU. “But the research that we’re doing is also suggesting that there are a lot of less obvious things that the effects of dams bring on local people and ecosystems,” Kramer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. There are concerns, for example, about damage to farming and fisheries due to dam projects along the lower Mekong, which is the world’s largest freshwater fishery and home to 60 million people. The environmental impact of dams may drastically change the economies and social structures of communities, Kramer added. Dam building is experiencing a resurgence around the world - with many projects backed by Chinese funding - as more countries look for affordable way to generate energy for their growing populations. Most Mekong countries, especially China, have been planning and building hydropower dams since the late 1980s but an uptick in dam projects began about 15 years ago. The Mekong River’s mainstream now has about 11 dams and more than 100 on its tributaries, said Jiaguo Qi, professor of geography at MSU. The MSU researchers will analyze how dams impact the flow of rivers, local agriculture, fisheries, irrigations systems and wetland ecosystems, said Qi. As well as analyzing satellite imagery, researchers will develop models to simulate historical water flows and project how those flows may change as a result of dam construction and shrinking glaciers in the Himalayan headwaters. Interviews will also be conducted with local residents to find out how communities that surround or are downstream from dams cope with the loss of wetlands and fisheries, and what the economic benefits are. The research team will regularly produce papers and hold workshops throughout the three-year period, with the final report available to the general public. It is hoped that the research will be used to make existing dams and those still in the planning stage, to become more sustainable, Qi added. While some preliminary research has already begun, the field work for the project will begin in May, he added.

2018-03-16,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Indonesia has lobbied Southeast Asian countries to carry out maritime patrols in the disputed South China Sea, claimed in most part by China, to improve security, Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said on Friday. Indonesia says it’s a non-claimant state in the South China Sea dispute but has clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands and expanded its military presence there, and also renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone, asserting its own maritime claim. Austalian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Defence Minister Marise Payne held talks with their Indonesian counterparts Retno Marsudi and Ryacudu in Sydney, ahead of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit. Australia is hosting the meeting, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, as it seeks to tighten political and trade ties in the region amid China’s rising influence. “For the South China Sea, I went around to friends - ASEAN defense ministers - so that each country that faces the South China Sea patrols up to 200 nautical miles, around 230 kilometres,” Ryacudu told reporters at a joint press conference. Indonesia is focusing on three areas, notably the Sulu Sea, the Malacca Strait and the seas around the coast of Thailand, Ryacudu said, referring to existing cooperation with Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines. “If we look at the (borders) from Vietnam down to Indonesia and to the Philippines, we can see we have secured almost half of the South China Sea (in areas) we are already patrolling.” China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route and which is believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas, and has been building artificial islands on reefs, some with ports and air strips, developments that have irked ASEAN members. China has also been rapidly increasingly its military deployment in the South China Sea and its air force said last month that Chinese Su-35 fighter jets took part in a combat patrol over the disputed waterway. Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, all of which are members of ASEAN, and Taiwan also have claims in the sea. China’s foreign minister said last week that China’s resolve to protect peace and stability in the South China Sea was unshakeable, and that outside forces were attempting to muddy the waters. China has been angered in the past by freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea by the United States which it sees as provocative. Australia - which says it takes no sides on South China Sea disputes but has supported U.S.-led freedom of navigation activities - has previously said it had no plans to take part in joint patrols. Officially, the ASEAN summit will focus on fostering closer economic ties among the members of ASEAN and Australia, and countering the threat of Islamist militants returning to the region from the Middle East. Australian Foreign Minister Bishop also said Australia would “very seriously” consider any formal invitation to join the grouping, a move advocated by Indonesian President Joko Widodo.

2018-03-16,"(Corrects non-OPEC supply to 59.9 mln bpd from 97.9 mln bpd in paragraph 9) By Amanda Cooper LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Global oil demand is expected to pick up this year but supply is growing at a faster pace, leading to a rise in inventories in the first quarter of 2018, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday. The IEA raised its forecast for oil demand this year to 99.3 million barrels per day (bpd) from 97.8 million bpd in 2017. Commercial oil inventories in industrialised OECD nations rose in January for the first time in seven months to 2.871 billion barrels, 53 million barrels above their five-year average, the Paris-based IEA said. The January increase of 18 million barrels over the December inventory level was roughly half the size of rises normally seen at this time of year, according to the agency, which advises Western governments on energy policy. But it said Venezuela, where an economic crisis has cut oil production by 50 percent in two years to lows not seen in more than a decade, could still trigger a renewed drawdown in stocks. “With supply from Venezuela clearly vulnerable to an accelerated decline, without any compensatory change from other producers, it is possible that the Latin American country could be the final element that tips the market decisively into deficit,” the IEA said. In a bid to drain inventories, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other producers have been implementing a deal to cut output by about 1.8 million bpd from January 2017 until the end of 2018. Assuming no change in OPEC output for the rest of the year, the IEA said it expected a small increase in OECD inventories in the first quarter of 2018 with declines after that. The agency said it expected supply from non-OPEC nations to grow by 1.8 million bpd in 2018 to 59.9 million bpd, led by the United States, where crude output was forecast to rise by 1.3 million bpd during 2018 to more than 11 million bpd by the end of the year. OPEC crude output fell in February to 32.1 million bpd, led by Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates. The IEA raised its estimate for demand for OPEC oil to 32.4 million bpd for 2018 from last month’s forecast of 32.3 million bpd. The agency said the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump decision to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium, which has prompted threats of retaliation from major trading partners, posed a risk to global economic growth forecasts. “A slowdown would have strong consequences, particularly for fuel used in the maritime sector and in the trucking industry,” the IEA said. It said growth in world trade had been strong, accelerating from 2.5 percent in 2016 to 4.7 percent in 2017, citing this as the likely reason behind a sturdy 1.8 percent rise in 2017 in global gasoil demand.

2018-03-16,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Mexico’s economy minister on Thursday urged officials to push for a speedy renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), saying his country and Canada must be ready to go it alone if the United States pulls out. Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said if no deal to rework NAFTA could be struck by April 30, then the new political complexion of the region would cast doubt on how incoming lawmakers would view it in Mexico and the United States. “The whole nature of the agreement would change,” Guajardo said at the World Economic Forum on Latin America in Sao Paulo. “You either get it done by the end of April or then it doesn’t matter: you can go until the end of the year.” Guajardo had previously identified a window for negotiation extending through July, though his comments come a few days after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer floated the idea of reaching a deal “in principle” in the next few weeks.  The regular session of Congress in Mexico ends on April 30, and the country will elect a new president in July who takes office at the start of December. The United States will hold mid-term congressional elections in November. Mexico’s government is eager to broker a deal before a change of presidency, and Guajardo has also said his team would be ready to keep talking until the end of November. Speaking with Reuters on the sidelines of the event, Guajardo said he thought it was probable that the negotiations would drag on beyond April. Nonetheless, he said it could be possible to complete the technical work in a month. “If there’s political will and flexibility to reach an agreement, I think it’s technically not impossible,” he said in an interview.  Guajardo has stressed that Mexico wants to keep NAFTA tri-partite, but reiterated that both Mexico and Canada needed to be ready for the possibility of a U.S. departure. “You have to be ready to live with a NAFTA without the U.S.” Guajardo said. “NAFTA at risk of ending? No. NAFTA will continue between Canada and Mexico because at the end of the day, what is important is you send a message that you believe in free trade. The U.S. is the one that will decide to be in or out.” A vast majority of Mexicans remained in favor of free trade, and U.S. President Donald Trump was coming under increasing pressure from political supporters in farming states to renew the trade deal, the Mexican minister said. If NAFTA was not reworked soon, terms of negotiation could be shifted by political developments, such Democrats winning control of the U.S. Senate, Guajardo said. He noted that Democrats claimed victory this week in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania in a district Trump had won in 2016. The vote tally officially remains too close to call.  Speaking at a fundraiser in the state of Missouri on Wednesday, Trump reiterated that he thought it best to kill NAFTA and strike a new deal. “Let’s start all over again ... because the best deal is to terminate it and then make a new deal,” Trump said, according to a transcript published by the Washington Post. “But I don’t know that we can make a deal because Mexico is so spoiled with this horrible deal that they’ve lived with.” Nonetheless, Trump’s comments appear to contradict statements made by his newly installed director of the White House National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow.  On Wednesday, Kudlow said he thought NAFTA needs to be reupholstered in many ways, but ditching it would have bad consequences.

2018-03-16,"* Shell says allegations without merit, ENI declines comment * Niger Delta scarred by decades of spills * NGO says “no good guy here, everybody’s kind of bad” By Paul Carsten ABUJA, March 16 (Reuters) - Amnesty International on Friday accused international oil majors Shell and Eni of negligence when addressing spills in Nigeria. Describing their actions as “serious negligence”, Amnesty said the companies were “taking weeks to respond to reports of spills and publishing misleading information about the cause and severity of spills, which may result in communities not receiving compensation”. A Shell spokesman said Amnesty’s allegations “are false, without merit and fail to recognise the complex environment in which the company operates”. ENI declined immediate comment. Shell and Eni have for decades been two of the most active oil majors operating in the Niger Delta region. Nigeria’s crude-producing heartland is an ecological disaster zone, scarred by decades of spills that have killed trees and other plants. Yet clean-ups, and the associated compensation, are highly contentious, with some local communities even blocking teams’ access to spill sites, allowing the damage to worsen, in the hope of extracting a bigger pay-out. Under Nigerian law, companies must visit sites within 24 hours of reporting a spill. Amnesty said that in one case Italian Eni took more than a year to respond to a spill in Bayelsa state. While oil companies frequently attribute spills to sabotage and theft, locals say they are often due to other issues such as corrosion. Shell has reported 1,010 spills since 2011, and Eni 820 since 2014, according to Amnesty, which said among those 1,830 reports it found 89 “about which there are reasonable doubts surrounding the cause provided by the oil companies”. In 2015, the Bodo community and a British law firm negotiated a 55 million pound pollution settlement with Shell in 2015. The Natural Resource Governance Institute, a non-profit group that advises countries on how to manage oil, gas and mineral resources, acknowledged there were sometimes difficulties on both sides. “There’s no good guy here, everybody’s kind of bad. I’m sure the companies don’t do all that they can to get to these places. But then they also have genuine grievances and genuine difficulties dealing with these communities,” said Aaron Sayne, from the institute. “When spills become an opportunity to make money, your clean-up becomes really tough.” (Reporting by Paul Carsten Additional reporting by Libby George in London Editing by Alexis Akwagyiram and Alison Williams)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-nigeria/amnesty-says-shell-eni-negligent-on-nigeria-oil-spills-idUKL8N1QX7D4,16 Mar 2018,"Amnesty International on Friday
