2018-10-16,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Sue-Lin Wong and David Stanway GUANGZHOU, China, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Chinese exporters are mostly confident they can weather a trade war with the United States, but worry about collateral damage it might cause throughout the global economy, according to a Reuters poll of participants at China’s largest trade fair. Representatives from 91 firms involved in sectors ranging from industrial machinery to home appliances, motorcycles and new energy vehicles were surveyed during the Canton Import and Export Fair on Oct 15-16. Just over 60 percent said they were worried about the trade war in the first poll carried out by Reuters since the United States imposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods late last month, escalating the tariff war between the world’s two largest economies. “We wanted to expand this year into the United States, but the trade war has really thrown a spanner in the works,” said Heidi Tan, sales director at Motoma Power which makes batteries for mobile phones, including iPhones. Phone batteries have been hit by U.S. tariffs, and Tan says customers are already looking to buy from other countries. “It is only be a matter of time before factories in Southeast Asia will be able to make the same batteries,” she said. Still, firms surveyed remained broadly optimistic about foreign markets despite mounting challenges, with only 28 percent expecting orders to decline this year, and just 21 percent expecting declines in 2019. When the twice-yearly fair, which draws thousands of companies, was last held in April, a Reuters poll found 65 percent of respondents were concerned about escalating trade tensions, and only 26 percent had anticipated a full-blown trade war. In the latest survey, more than 60 percent expected the trade war to last at least another year, though some said it depends on how long President Donald Trump remains in the White House. “The question isn’t how long the trade war will last,” said Charles Zhu of Taizhou Jieba Cleaning Products. “The question is how long will Trump be in power for.” Fifty-five percent of respondents said the government should “proactively engage in discussions” to try to end the trade war. Just three respondents thought China should retaliate by restricting competition. “One massive advantage China has is our ability to work hard and endure hardship, we thrive under competition,” said Michael Zhuo of Yuyao Ghost Audio, adding around two thirds of his customers are in the United States. “I’m not sure whether the U.S. has factored this into their thinking.” Just under half of the firms surveyed had no business in the United States. KNOCK-ON EFFECT Many exporters in sectors like solar power and machinery said their shipments to the United States were negligible, partly as a result of previous punitive tariffs that forced them to look at markets elsewhere. But some exporters still expressed worries over how the trade war was undermining confidence globally. “The trade war first of all hurts the Chinese economy, where we have customers, and it could also affect the economies of the countries we do business with,” said Todd Cao, vice-president of Jiangsu Spanl Co. Ltd, which exports building materials. Partly as a result of the trade conflict, economists polled by Reuters earlier this month predicted that China’s third-quarter growth be its weakest since the global financial crisis. And for many exporters surveyed, the rising costs of doing business in China, including growing costs of raw materials and high staff turnover, were more worrying than the Sino-U.S. trade war. Respondents also listed problems like the crackdown on peer-to-peer lending and tightening environmental regulations. Some exporters said customers in emerging market economies were suffering from a squeeze on dollars that made it harder for them to buy their products. “Orders from Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, Iran, Syria and Libya are all down,” said Tory Mak, a sales manager at Guangzhou HD Electronics, blaming weakening economic conditions in these countries and knock-on effects from the trade war. Some firms not directly hurt by the new tariff regime were suffering the effects of other U.S. policy shifts, including the imposition of sanctions on Iran. Firms in the textiles, electric equipment and solar sectors all said that their business was suffering because they were no longer allowed to export to the Middle Eastern country. “We’ve not been hit by the tariffs but by the sanctions, which have cut our trade (with Iran) to zero,” said one sales manager who did not want to be named.

2018-10-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up in cautious trade on Tuesday as expectations of higher U.S. shale output and inventories vied with worries that crude supply from the Middle East could be disrupted by looming U.S. sanctions on Iran and growing tensions with top exporter Saudi Arabia. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of ordering the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and said the prince was jeopardizing relations with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump said the Saudi crown prince intends to expand an investigation into the disappearance of Khashoggi and that the prince did not know what happened in the Turkish consulate where Khashoggi apparently disappeared. “The focus within the oil trade during the next couple of weeks is likely to be on Iran and Saudi Arabia,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “We don’t expect the Kingdom to be as accommodative to the White House requests for stronger production,” he said, adding that the Saudis could cut as much as 500,000 barrels per day of production “as a warning shot should the U.S. opt to impose any type of sanction in response to the Khashoggi developments.”  Trump has urged the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise output to help cover a shortfall due to new U.S. sanctions on Iran. The market has been supported by reports that Iranian crude exports may be falling faster than expected ahead the Nov. 4 deadline on sanctions.     Brent crude rose 63 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $81.41 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended the session up 14 cents at $71.92 a barrel. Last week, oil prices slumped as global stock markets fell, but a recovery in financial markets, boosted by earnings growth helped provide support to oil prices on Tuesday, traders said. [.N] Prices extended gains in post-settlement trade after data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed a surprise decline in U.S. crude inventories. Stockpiles fell 2.1 million barrels last week, versus forecasts for a 2.2 million-barrel build.  [API/S] Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI rose by 1.5 million barrels, the API said, the fourth straight week of increases, if confirmed by official data due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. [EIA/S]  Weak U.S. gasoline margins and growing U.S. shale output could also cap gains in crude prices, market participants said. “The weakening crude spreads almost globally in the face of Iran sanctions is likely generating some concern on how strong market really is and if it’s ready to rally more,” said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP in Durham, North Carolina.     Front-month Brent crude futures traded at the lowest premium in over a month to futures for delivery one year from now. Meanwhile, front-month U.S. crude futures traded near the smallest premium to the 12th month in about 10 months.  “We think that one of the major factors that is leading to a scaling back of long positions is a reappraisal of short-term fundamentals by investors,” Standard Chartered analysts said in a note. Any supply deficit in the fourth quarter was unlikely to be large enough to do more than support prices, they said.

Despite the rally in stocks, U.S. Treasury yields were little changed. European shares pulled up from Monday’s 22-month lows , partly on expectations that the reporting season will deliver double-digit earnings growth. A rebound in Italian assets helped battered equities find firmer ground. On Wall Street, tech shares led the way a day after a decline in Apple weighed on the Nasdaq, while the healthcare sector rose after earnings reports from Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group. “A couple of inputs that caused a sell-off in the last two weeks, such as rising interest rates, higher oil prices and the dollar, have calmed down to rational levels,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. “The market may be able to positively respond to that as we work our way through the earnings season.” Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee, said Tuesday’s gains were the result of sharp selling over the past weeks. “The degree of the move is a function of the moves we have seen already this month more than anything else,” he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 547.87 points, or 2.17 percent, to 25,798.42, the S&P 500 gained 59.13 points, or 2.15 percent, to 2,809.92 and the Nasdaq Composite added 214.75 points, or 2.89 percent, to 7,645.49.

Crude futures rose in choppy trading as expectations of higher U.S. shale output and inventories were more than offset by worries over looming U.S. sanctions on Iran and growing tensions with top oil producer Saudi Arabia. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of ordering the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and said the prince was jeopardizing relations with the United States.

2018-10-16,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela is seeking to open bank accounts in Asia and Europe to carry out hard currency transactions, Economy Vice President Tareck El Aissami said on Tuesday, as the OPEC nation seeks to overcome U.S. sanctions that have hurt its foreign commerce. Hyperinflation-stricken Venezuela is in its fifth year of recession, prompting a surge in emigration that has overwhelmed its South American neighbors. President Nicolas Maduro frequently blames a U.S. “economic war” for Venezuela’s chronic shortages of food, medicine and other basic goods. Critics attribute the crisis to Maduro’s policies, including a complex web of currency controls and heavy state intervention in the economy. “The President has instructed the finance minister to begin a new correspondence scheme in Europe and Asia for public banks,” El Aissami said.  He added that the government will sell 2 billion euros  ($2.32 billion) on its Dicom foreign exchange platform starting in November or December, without describing the time frame.  Official statistics show the government has sold just $75 million through Dicom auctions this year.     Cash-strapped Venezuela’s reserves are at a 20-year low at $8.825 billion, two-thirds of which are held in gold bars.  The euros would come from oil revenues, El Aissami said, without providing a detailed breakdown.  In August, Maduro devalued the bolivar currency by 96 percent, hiked taxes and raised the minimum wage. But the moves have not dented inflation, which the International Monetary Fund forecasts at 1.4 million percent this year and 10 million percent next year.

2018-10-16,"(Adds details, background, quote) Oct 16 (Reuters) - Congo signed a joint deal on Tuesday to develop a $14 billion hydroelectric project with one consortium led by China Three Gorges Corporation and a second Spanish-led one. The Inga 3 project is part of a $50-$80 billion programme to expand hydroelectric dams along the Congo River, but it has repeatedly been delayed by red tape and disagreements between Democratic Republic of Congo and its partners. After initially competing for the deal, the Chinese investor group and the other including Spain’s ACS (Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA) were asked to submit a joint bid, which they did in June. The next stage requires the investors to carry out detailed studies for the project, taking into account social and environmental considerations, the state agency responsible for the project said in a statement. The 11,000-megawatt Inga 3 is projected to provide power for South Africa as well as mines and other consumers in Congo. But campaign group International Rivers has said it would ultimately deliver little or no electricity to consumers inside Congo because of transmission losses and because production would not meet its target.

2018-10-16,"GROUNDBIRCH, British Columbia (Reuters) - At a massive natural gas field in northern British Columbia, Royal Dutch Shell Plc is using new technologies and processes to cut emissions to address public and environmental group concerns that Canada’s nascent liquefied natural gas export industry could be a climate time bomb. The Groundbirch project, perched above Canada’s richest shale gas deposit some 1,110 kilometers (684 miles) northeast of Vancouver, includes four gas plants and 500 wells dotted over an area the size of New York City. Shell has already slashed project emissions by moving its newest gas plant to hydro-electric power and replacing diesel with natural gas in drilling, and is now tackling methane with new electric components and a fuel cell trial. There is a considerable body of research showing natural gas is far cleaner than coal, but only so long as methane emissions are contained. Methane is many times more potent than carbon dioxide, though the industry produces far less of it. Groundbirch will eventually send gas hundreds of miles west to the Shell-led LNG Canada export terminal approved this month, where it will be cooled for exporting. LNG Canada is being touted as the world’s cleanest major LNG plant. LNG demand is booming, as countries like China swap out coal plants for gas in the battle against choking pollution. But environmental groups say exports will boost carbon emissions in Canada, both through gas extraction and the liquefaction process. They warn that this could derail British Columbia’s pledge to cut greenhouse gases by 40 percent by 2030 and test Canada’s vow to cut emissions nationwide by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.  “There’s no way to produce energy using gas without emissions,” said Jens Wieting, a campaigner with Sierra Club BC. “Considering methane leakage, it’s very difficult to make any statement that gas is any better than coal.” Methane, the main component in natural gas, is released into the atmosphere mostly from the venting of unburned gas and through leaks in gas infrastructure like wells or pipelines.  Estimates of the carbon impact of LNG Canada from wellhead to port vary; the British Columbia government pegs it at 3.45 million tonnes (Mt) per year, while environmental groups say it could be as high as 12 Mt. The province expects to cut emissions to about 40 Mt by 2030 and 13 Mt by 2050 from 61.6 Mt in 2015. Gas from several Canadian producers will eventually feed LNG Canada, with roughly 40 percent coming from Shell’s Groundbirch project.  Shell last month announced a plan to limit methane emissions at its assets around the world and is implementing a global methane monitoring program. Last year it set a goal of halving its global carbon emissions by 2050. In Canada, Groundbirch’s methane intensity, a measure of methane emitted compared to total volume of product produced, is 0.1 percent, already half the new 0.2 percent by 2025 target set by the Anglo-Dutch company. At one of Groundbirch’s newest well pads, two hulking trailers hold thermal electric generators that power the batteries that run the pad’s equipment. “They are efficient, but they do produce combustion emissions. So what we’re looking at is finding new technology to replace that,” said Chang Liu, a facilities engineer-in-training at Groundbirch. The company is testing whether methanol fuel cells, which have no carbon emissions, could be used in the next generation of well pads, eliminating vented methane. For now, the latest generation of well pads use electric valve actuators, cutting methane emissions. Such actions are a “fantastic” first step, said Duncan Kenyon of the Pembina Institute, an energy policy think-tank, but he said not all Canadian producers are following through on pledges to reduce emissions.  “What we need is regulations that lock some of these volunteer commitments in place,” he said.

2018-10-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - At least 10 Iranian security personnel including Revolutionary Guards were kidnapped on the border with Pakistan on Tuesday, Iran’s state media reported, and a separatist group said it had seized them as revenge for the oppression of Sunni Muslims.  The Revolutionary Guards, Iran’s top security force, said in a statement carried on state television that some of its members had been abducted by a militant group at a border post in the city of Mirjaveh in Sistan-Baluchestan province. Iranian officials held talks with the Pakistani ambassador in Tehran and called on Islamabad to “use all possible means” to free them.  The Guards did not say how many were kidnapped, but state news agency IRNA quoted an unnamed official as saying 14 people had been kidnapped around 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. The Guards said they believed the Iranian forces had been deceived by “insiders”, but did not elaborate. Fars news agency said there were reports Iranian forces had been poisoned by food before being captured and taken to Pakistan. Ebrahim Azizi, spokesman for Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni militant group, said the group had seized more than 10 people. “This morning Jaish al-Adl forces attacked a border post in Mirjaveh, and captured all their weapons,” Azizi said in an audio message sent to Reuters. The group also claimed responsibility on its Twitter account. Azizi said the attack was retaliation for what he called the Iranian state’s oppression of Sunnis in Sistan-Baluchestan, a mainly Sunni province with a long history of separatist unrest. Iran’s Shi’ite Muslim authorities say militant groups operate from safe havens in Pakistan. Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Fars new agency the Pakistani ambassador had attended a meeting in the ministry. Iran asked Islamabad to “use all possible means, without any delay” to free those abducted. The Revolutionary Guards said in a statement: “We expect Pakistan to confront these terrorist groups that are supported by some regional states, and immediately release the kidnapped Iranian forces.”  Pakistan’s foreign ministry said in a statement: “Both militaries, under a joint mechanism established since last year, are working to ascertain the whereabouts of Iranian guards.” In previous cases of cross-border clashes, Iran threatened to hit militant bases in Pakistan unless Islamabad took action.  But this time Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour, the head of the Guards’ ground forces, said Iran was ready to conduct “joint military operations with Pakistan” against the militant groups to release the kidnapped personnel. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia of funding separatist groups on its territory. Riyadh has denied any involvement in Iranian internal affairs. In September, the Revolutionary Guards killed four Sunni militants at a border crossing with Pakistan, including the second-in-command of Jaish al-Adl. Jaish al-Adl kidnapped five Iranian border guards in 2014,  releasing four of them two months later after mediation by local Sunni clerics.

2018-10-16,"(Updates throughout) BERLIN/BRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Belgium and Germany agreed on Tuesday to cooperate on ensuring secure power supplies to Belgium this winter amid a shutdown of most of the nuclear-reliant country’s reactors. Belgium has reached out to neighbouring countries for commitments of energy imports to avoid a power shortage from six of the seven nuclear reactors in Belgium being offline from the end of October through mid-November. France has promised 1 gigawatts of power capacity and Luxembourg 200 megawatts. Belgian Environment and Energy Minister Marie-Christine Marghem signed a memorandum of understanding with German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier in Berlin. “The agreement signed today between the two countries stipulates that a minimum of 20 percent of the high-voltage lines in Germany needs to be free to help facilitate the imports coming principally from Germany and the Netherlands in case of necessity,” a statement from the Belgian ministry said. A large part of renewable electricity produced in northern Germany passes through Belgian interconnectors on its way to southern Germany. The transit, known as loop flows, limits the capacity for electricity imports to Belgium. Altmeier added that Germany could deliver power to Belgium via the Netherlands. There are no direct power transmission lines from Germany to Belgium yet, but there are between Germany and the Netherlands and the Netherlands and Belgium. In a separate statement from both ministries, they said they would both “do their utmost” and apply agreed measures to address Belgium’s short-term power generation concerns. “Both sides will take additional steps to foster mutual understanding and will intensify their efforts to solve the challenges in the upcoming winter,” the statement added. Further to that, the two countries will work on possible medium and long-term solutions to increase security of supply, including through the Belgium-Germany interconnector ALLEGrO to avoid system and grid security issues in the region. The link, when it is completed by 2020, will be the first interconnector between Belgium and Germany. Reporting by Markus Wacket in BERLIN, Daphne Psaledakis in

2018-10-16,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German power and gas network companies TenneT, Thyssengas and Gasunie Deutschland said they plan to build a 100 megawatt (MW) plant to turn renewable energy into gas for industrial use in the Ruhr region. The plant in Lower Saxony would be the biggest power-to-gas plant (ptg) in Germany and would be connected to the grid in phases from 2022, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. They did not give the estimated investment. As Germany has set a target to nearly double the share of wind and solar power to 65 percent of electricity generation by 2030, grid operators are looking to develop ptg plants and other technologies. Ptg entails running wind or solar power through water to split it into oxygen and hydrogen, which can then be used as a transport fuel or fed into electricity grids. “The partners aim to create comprehensive links between the energy, transport and industrial sectors,” the three companies said.  “The green power that is turned into gas will be transported to the industrial Ruhr region, but also supply hydrogen filling stations for mobility, and can be stored in underground caverns for industrial usage,” they said. German power transmission network Amprion and market-leading gas grid Open Grid Europe (OGE) said in the summer that they were also looking to build ptg plants with capacities of 50 to 100 MW. Utility Uniper has already embarked, on a small scale, on the next step in ptg technology.  This involves turning hydrogen into methane gas that is identical in its qualities to natural gas mined from fossil fuel deposits.

European shares rallied, pulling up from Monday’s 22-month lows, partly on expectations that the reporting season will deliver double-digit earnings growth. A rebound in Italian assets helped battered equities find firmer ground as well. Japan led Asian shares higher with the Nikkei index up 1.25 percent after a decline of nearly 2 percent on Monday. On Wall Street, tech shares led the way a day after a decline in Apple dragged the Nasdaq lower, while the healthcare sector also rose after earnings reports from Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group. “A couple of inputs that caused a sell-off in the last two weeks, such as rising interest rates, higher oil prices and the dollar, have calmed down to rational levels and the market may be able to positively respond to that as we work our way through the earnings season,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 244.55 points, or 0.97 percent, to 25,495.1, the S&P 500 gained 24.85 points, or 0.90 percent, to 2,775.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 74.71 points, or 1.01 percent, to 7,505.46. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.30 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.91 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.09 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.61 percent higher. Crude futures fell after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected to rise by 98,000 barrels per day in November to a record of 7.71 million. U.S. crude fell 0.39 percent to $71.50 per barrel and Brent was last at $80.46, down 0.4 percent on the day. Sterling rose against the dollar after data showed basic wages of workers in Britain rose at their fastest pace in nearly a decade. The British currency was last trading at $1.3213, up 0.48 percent on the day. Meanwhile, a survey showed German investor morale darkened more than expected in October. The euro rose 0.02 percent to $1.1579, the Japanese yen weakened 0.38 percent versus the greenback at 112.22 per dollar. The dollar index fell 0.05 percent. Investors waited to see Washington’s view on China on the U.S. Treasury’s semiannual currency report due this week, after media reports last week that it has not labeled Beijing a currency manipulator. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 3.1671 percent, from 3.163 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond last fell 2/32 in price to yield 3.3442 percent, from 3.341 percent late on Monday. “Following the extraordinary volatility in both stocks and bonds, we are seeing a bit of a calming here as traders are looking for new ranges,” said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York. Investors scaled back bearish bets on longer-dated U.S. government debt this week, suggesting less selling pressure on Treasuries, according to a survey released by J.P. Morgan Securities on Tuesday.

2018-10-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Russian government is no longer capping oil output increases by local producers, one of the country’s top energy companies Gazprom Neft said on Tuesday, signalling that Moscow’s supply-restraint pact with OPEC has effectively expired for now. Deputy chief executive Vadim Yakovlev told a briefing in London that the company’s production was back to record levels observed in 2016 before Russia clinched a deal with OPEC to reduce output from the start of 2017. “The instructions we are getting from the government is that we can restore the levels before restrictions were enrolled,” Yakovlev said.     “We haven’t been restrained by the government from increasing above 2016 levels,” Yakovlev said adding the company was able to add more barrels next year to satisfy growing demand.    “There are signs the oil market is overheating,” he said. OPEC and its allies including Russia agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day from the start of 2017 with Moscow pledging to cut some 300,000 bpd. As oil prices hit $80 per barrel in recent months and with global oil inventories shrinking fast, Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to ease restrictions although they never said what exact levels they would target. Russian oil production reached 11.36 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, a new post-Soviet high. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia could add another 300,000 bpd to its output next year. Yakovlev said Gazprom Neft was ready to lift production by a further 20,000 to 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year and add another 50,000 bpd next year. “The (oil) market is well supplied. But there are big uncertainties regarding the end of the year with regards to Iran and Venezuela. We may have an opportunity to grow further,” he said.

2018-10-16,"BEIJING, Oct 16 (Reuters) - China’s top energy group CNPC agreed on Monday with Norwegian company Equinor to cooperate on oil and gas exploration, renewables and carbon capture technology, company executives said on Tuesday. China and Norway agreed to resume full diplomatic relations in 2016 following a row over the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarding its Peace Prize to jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010. Liu died last year while still in Chinese custody. In August of last year, the two countries resumed talks on the free trade agreement. Under the memorandum of understanding (MOU), companies will explore opportunities in tapping unconventional gas resources in China and also partner at global oil and gas projects. “Domestically in China (the cooperations) mainly onshore unconventional resource or tight gas. Internationally more likely on conventional oil and gas production,” said Al Cook, executive vice president of strategy, on the sidelines of a Norway-China energy seminar. “Companies like CNPC have a tremendous opportunity linking global gas supply with domestic gas demand,” said Cook. He didn’t give further details. China, which overtook South Korea last year as the world’s second-largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), will likely contribute more than half of the world’s incremental LNG trade this year, said Li Yao, founder of consultancy SIA Energy. Zhang Xiangning, a deputy director with CNPC’s Foreign Cooperation Administration Department, said Euqinor could apply its tight gas technology to Chinese oil and gas fields like Changqing in north China’s Ordos basin, where CNPC aims to further boost reserves. Changqing is China’s top gas field which makes up nearly a quarter of the nation’s total natural gas output. “We hope Equinor and CNPC could deepen our exchanges in tight gas as well as carbon capture utilization and storage technologies,” Zhang told the same seminar.

2018-10-16,"OSLO (Reuters) - Outokumpu’s Tornio facility in Finland, one of Europe’s biggest steel plants, has suffered four radiation contamination incidents since July, the country’s nuclear watchdog STUK said on Tuesday. In the latest incident, a batch of scrap metal at the plant was found on Oct. 12 to contain americium, a radioactive element that can be dangerous and potentially deadly if inhaled or swallowed by employees. Workers were forced to wear oxygen masks but were not exposed to radiation, STUK said.  The concentration strength was about 1-2 gigabecquerels, it said, adding that the events’ recurrence qualifies as an International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) radiation incident. “Outokumpu takes this matter seriously and does its utmost to prevent radioactive material ending up in production,” the company said. “Radioactive material is strictly prohibited and cannot be accepted at the plant.” All four recent incidents involved americium, according to STUK.  “It seems there is a bigger portion of scrap metal around the world that contains americium,” STUK director Tommi Toivonen said. “It is really difficult to find, unlike other radioactive elements.” The firm said it has addressed the issue with its suppliers, but declined to name them when asked by Reuters. STUK said in the Oct 12 incident the contaminated materials were shipped from the Netherlands and the Baltics, but were likely to have originated outside Europe. Outokumpu said output was unaffected and products were not contaminated. The origin of the imported scrap metal is not tracked, and the presence of radioactivity could be accidental or a deliberate way to get rid of contaminated materials, STUK said. “It is a serious incident, there is a risk for employee safety,” Toivonen said. “They cleared it out, but now they have hundreds of tons of radioactive waste to get rid of.”  The company said its contracts with suppliers of scrap metal clearly prohibit radioactive material, but said it can in some cases be very hard to detect.

2018-10-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is unlikely to employ its so-called “oil weapon” in the diplomatic crisis over the disappearance of a journalist after visiting the country’s consulate in Istanbul. Experience from the last time Saudi Arabia tried to use oil sales as a diplomatic instrument in 1973/74 shows such action does not work and the kingdom itself would be the biggest victim. Despite some of the impassioned rhetoric in Saudi media, self-interest makes it improbable the government will retaliate by reducing oil sales or trying to drive up prices. That has not stopped some veiled threats to weaponise oil production and prices, but they should be interpreted as an urgent plea for support and understanding rather than a serious threat. “If U.S. sanctions are imposed on Saudi Arabia, we will be facing an economic disaster that would rock the entire world,” according to one heated editorial (“U.S. sanctions would mean Washington is stabbing itself”, Al Arabiya, Oct. 14). “Riyadh is the capital of (global) oil and touching this would affect oil production before any other vital commodity,” the editorial warned. If the price of oil reaching $80 a barrel angered U.S. President Donald Trump, “no one should rule out the price jumping to $100, or $200, or even double that figure”, the author said bluntly. The government’s official response has been more circumspect but it nonetheless warned that it would respond to any action with even greater retaliation and pointed to the kingdom’s “influential and vital role in the global economy”. In October 1973, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil producers announced that they would start cutting production by 5 percent per month until Israeli forces evacuated from occupied Arab territories. In addition, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab producers announced an embargo on oil sales to the United States and a number of other countries (“OPEC: 25 years of prices and politics”, Skeet, 1988). Global oil supplies had already become tight even before the decisions to cut production and embargo the United States, mostly as a result of low real prices during the 1950 and 1960s. Spare production capacity in the United States, which had been as much as 4 million barrels per day in 1968, had been used up by March 1972. (Graphic: reut.rs/2yGbLTC) In this context, the production cuts and embargo made an already tight market worse, sent oil prices surging, and produced a huge, short-term revenue windfall for Saudi Arabia and other oil producers. But the policy was a failure in its own terms, was reversed a few months later, and caused immense long-term damage to Saudi Arabia and OPEC that took decades to reverse. At the most basic level, the policy failed to achieve its stated objective of changing U.S. support for Israel or forcing Israel to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories. More seriously for Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers, the surge in prices, which rose again after the Iranian revolution in 1979, resulted in permanent demand destruction and encouragement of alternative suppliers. Rising prices helped spur the development of new supplies in Alaska, the North Sea, the Soviet Union and China, which came onstream and flooded the oil market in the 1980s. Rising prices also encouraged a wholesale switch away from the use of crude oil and heavy fuel oil in residential and commercial heating boilers as well as in power generation. Homes and offices in the United States and many other advanced economies switched from heavy fuel oil to cheaper and more reliable heating using natural gas or electricity generated from coal or nuclear. Crude oil and fuel oil were replaced by a new generation of coal-fired power plants in the United States in the late 1970s and the 1980s (ironically the same coal plants that are now being closed and replaced by natural gas). The oil shock also provided the impetus to develop a new generation of nuclear power plants in the United States, France, Japan, Britain and other countries to reduce the reliance on imported crude. Cheap oil had been on the way to becoming the dominant fuel for power generation in the 1950s and 1960s, putting the coal industry under pressure. By the late 1980s, however, expensive and unreliable oil had been largely pushed out of the power sector by cheaper and more secure coal, gas and nuclear, a permanent loss of markets from which it has never recovered. Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Japan also enacted new fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles to reduce reliance on imports for the transport sector, taking another enduring bite out of demand. In the long term, the oil embargo created the conditions for the oil price slump that hit Saudi Arabia and other producers in the 1980s and 1990s, and from which they did not recover until the 2000s. The oil weapon does not work, which is why Saudi Arabia is unlikely to employ it in the dispute over the disappearance of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In the short term, Saudi Arabia might gain more revenue from a rise in prices than it lost from a reduction in sales. But rising prices would hit the global economy and consumption hard and threaten a renewed oil market slump within a year. The weapon cannot be wielded in a targeted way against specific consuming countries because the oil market is global and fully integrated. Restricting supplies to punish some countries pushes up oil prices for all consumers. Wielding the oil weapon to pressure the United States would impose bigger costs on China and India, which are the largest and fastest-growing oil importers and crucial markets for the future. Saudi Arabia has spent decades marketing itself as a reliable oil supplier, especially to customers in Asia, and any attempt to employ the oil weapon would destroy that carefully crafted reputation. Saudi Arabia’s refining customers would instead turn to Iran, Russia and the United States for additional supplies and likely reconsider their long-term dependence on the kingdom. If Saudi Arabia nonetheless attempted to weaponise oil production and sales, the resulting surge in prices would prompt another round of conservation measures cutting long-term demand for its main product. Sharp rises in oil prices would put a renewed focus on vehicle fuel economy standards as well as accelerating the deployment of electric vehicles. Rising prices and concerns about unreliable supplies would speed the diffusion of electric vehicles and push oil out of the transport market just as it was pushed out of heating and power generation in the 1980s. Saudi Arabia has spent years urging oil-consuming countries to remember it needs “security of demand” just as much as they need “security of supply”. But weaponising oil production would break that understanding and provoke a backlash from consuming countries with a concerted effort to reduce their oil imports. Finally, Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the United States for security (including the provision of advanced weapons systems, training, intelligence and thousands of U.S. personnel and aircraft stationed in and around the Gulf). There is no way to wield the oil weapon which would not shake the foundations of the U.S.-Saudi alliance on which the kingdom’s defence depends, leaving it vulnerable to regional rivals, including Iran. For all these reasons, the oil weapon is essentially useless, an unreliable blunderbuss more likely to blow up the user than its intended target, which is why Saudi Arabia is unlikely to deploy it.

2018-10-16,"GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Chinese exporters are mostly confident they can weather a trade war with the United States, but worry about collateral damage it might cause throughout the global economy, according to a Reuters poll of participants at China’s largest trade fair. Representatives from 91 firms involved in sectors ranging from industrial machinery to home appliances, motorcycles and new energy vehicles were surveyed during the Canton Import and Export Fair on Oct 15-16. Just over 60 percent said they were worried about the trade war in the first poll carried out by Reuters since the United States imposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods late last month, escalating the tariff war between the world’s two largest economies. “We wanted to expand this year into the United States, but the trade war has really thrown a spanner in the works,” said Heidi Tan, sales director at Motoma Power which makes batteries for mobile phones, including iPhones. Phone batteries have been hit by U.S. tariffs, and Tan says customers are already looking to buy from other countries. “It is only be a matter of time before factories in Southeast Asia will be able to make the same batteries,” she said. Still, firms surveyed remained broadly optimistic about foreign markets despite mounting challenges, with only 28 percent expecting orders to decline this year, and just 21 percent expecting declines in 2019. When the twice-yearly fair, which draws thousands of companies, was last held in April, a Reuters poll found 65 percent of respondents were concerned about escalating trade tensions, and only 26 percent had anticipated a full-blown trade war.  In the latest survey, more than 60 percent expected the trade war to last at least another year, though some said it depends on how long President Donald Trump remains in the White House. “The question isn’t how long the trade war will last,” said Charles Zhu of Taizhou Jieba Cleaning Products. “The question is how long will Trump be in power for.”     Fifty-five percent of respondents said the government should “proactively engage in discussions” to try to end the trade war. Just three respondents thought China should retaliate by restricting competition. “One massive advantage China has is our ability to work hard and endure hardship, we thrive under competition,” said Michael Zhuo of Yuyao Ghost Audio, adding around two thirds of his customers are in the United States. “I’m not sure whether the U.S. has factored this into their thinking.”  Just under half of the firms surveyed had no business in the United States. KNOCK-ON EFFECT Many exporters in sectors like solar power and machinery said their shipments to the United States were negligible, partly as a result of previous punitive tariffs that forced them to look at markets elsewhere. But some exporters still expressed worries over how the  trade war was undermining confidence globally. “The trade war first of all hurts the Chinese economy, where we have customers, and it could also affect the economies of the countries we do business with,” said Todd Cao, vice-president of Jiangsu Spanl Co. Ltd, which exports building materials. Partly as a result of the trade conflict, economists polled by Reuters earlier this month predicted that China’s third-quarter growth be its weakest since the global financial crisis.   And for many exporters surveyed, the rising costs of doing business in China, including growing costs of raw materials and high staff turnover, were more worrying than the Sino-U.S. trade war. Respondents also listed problems like the crackdown on peer-to-peer lending and tightening environmental regulations.  Some exporters said customers in emerging market economies were suffering from a squeeze on dollars that made it harder for them to buy their products. “Orders from Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, Iran, Syria and Libya are all down,” said Tory Mak, a sales manager at Guangzhou HD Electronics, blaming weakening economic conditions in these countries and knock-on effects from the trade war. Some firms not directly hurt by the new tariff regime were suffering the effects of other U.S. policy shifts, including the imposition of sanctions on Iran.  Firms in the textiles, electric equipment and solar sectors all said that their business was suffering because they were no longer allowed to export to the Middle Eastern country. “We’ve not been hit by the tariffs but by the sanctions, which have cut our trade (with Iran) to zero,” said one sales manager who did not want to be named.

2018-10-16,"* Iberdrola to be 100 pct wind power firm in UK * Drax to close its coal plants by 2025 * Deal to be completed by year end * Drax shares up 4 pct (Updates throughout with detail, comment) By Susanna Twidale and Karina Dsouza Oct 16 (Reuters) - British power producer Drax has agreed to buy a group of Scottish gas, hydro and pumped storage power plants from Spain’s Iberdrola for 702 million pounds ($922 million) as it strives to end coal-based production before a 2025 government deadline. The plants run by Iberdrola’s Scottish Power arm include the massive Cruachan pumped storage hydro facility, built inside a mountain near Loch Lomond, as well as a biomass-from-waste facility, which have helped Scotland creep closer to generating all of its power from renewable sources. The sale, included in Iberdrola’s 2018-2022 strategy to rotate assets worth 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion), leaves the Spanish group with only wind power generators in Britain. Drax CEO Will Gardiner said the deal was a part of his company’s strategy to exit coal and provide flexible electricity generation to back-up Britain’s growing renewable capacity. “We see an energy system in 2050 when 85 percent of the electricity comes from wind and solar but there will need to be another 15 percent which we see coming from gas and biomass,” he told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. Drax, which generates about 6 percent of Britain’s electricity, has converted four of its former coal-fired plants to biomass wood pellets, often made from compressed sawdust. Gardiner said longer term plans to replace the remaining two coal units with gas plants and up to 200 megawatts of battery storage, would be unchanged by the acquisitions. Drax hopes to end all coal production ahead of the UK government’s target of 2025 as it seeks to reduce fossil fuel emissions. “We are really committed to moving beyond coal ... but at the same time we do have to react to what the market is saying,” Gardiner said. Earlier in October, Britain’s National Grid said coal-fired power generation was likely to rise over the winter as high gas prices made coal power plants more profitable. Scottish Power has already closed all of its coal plants, and following the sale will generate 100 percent of its electricity from wind power. “This is a pivotal shift for Scottish Power as we realise a long-term ambition. We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy,” Scottish Power chief executive Keith Anderson said in a statement. Drax hopes to complete the deal by the end of the year, subject to shareholder approval. Drax said it had secured bridge funding of 725 million pounds to finance the deal, and expects no impact on its previous guidance for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). Drax expects the acquired facilities to contribute 90-100 million pounds to the company’s EBITDA in 2019. Shares in UK-listed Drax were up around 4 percent,, while shares in Spain-listed Iberdrola were little changed. ($1 = 0.7607 pounds) $1 = 0.8636 euros

European shares rallied 0.8 percent, pulling away from Monday’s 22-month lows. That followed gains in some Asian markets, led by Japan’s blue-chip Nikkei index, which closed 1.25 percent higher after a decline of nearly 2 percent the previous day. The positive tone looked poised to extend into the U.S. session, with stock futures trading higher . Gains in Italy’s bond and stock markets after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria defended the country’s expansionary budget helped lift sentiment. Calm in Italy — a major source of turbulence in world markets in recent weeks — helped explain the recovery in risk appetite on Tuesday, said Marchel Alexandrovich, European financial economist at Jefferies in London. Stock market sentiment in Europe also got a boost from expectations that earnings season will deliver double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter. About 6 percent of companies in the STOXX 600 index are due to report results this week, with the earnings season passing its mid-point during the first week of November. Overall, third-quarter earnings for the index are expected to have risen 14 percent, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data, while euro zone earnings are seen up 12 percent. That compares with the 21.6 percent growth seen for U.S. companies. “If you look at what’s happening here and now, it is an improvement from what was happening a week ago,” Alexandrovich said. “How long the stability lasts is anyone’s guess.” Calmer equity markets took the shine off safe-haven assets. Japan’s yen was down a quarter of a percent against the dollar, the Swiss franc edged away from almost two-week highs against the greenback and gold dipped from Monday’s 2 1/2-month high as tension between the West and Saudi Arabia triggered a fresh exit out of risk assets. Signs that Saudi Arabia is preparing to acknowledge the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a botched interrogation helped smooth edgy markets. But given a rout in stock markets last week — fuelled in part by concerns about higher U.S. interest rates, rising Treasury yields and world trade tensions — some caution prevailed. On Wall Street, the Dow has lost 4.5 percent this month, as long-term Treasury yields soared to their highest level since 2011. Higher yields make equities less attractive. Chinese stocks closed lower on Tuesday after data showed factory-gate inflation had cooled for a third straight month in September amid weaker domestic demand, reflecting more pressure on the world’s second-biggest economy. “Looking forward, a couple of key points that may drive where markets go is the direction of U.S. Treasury yields and U.S. earnings season,” said Investec economist Ryan Djajasaputra. Meanwhile, German investor morale darkened more than expected in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, as concerns about an escalating Sino-U.S. trade dispute and Britain crashing out of the EU without a divorce deal clouded the outlook for Europe’s largest economy. Italian government bond yields fell as much as 15 basis points across the curve, narrowing the spread over German peers , after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria defended the country’s deficit-hiking budget. “The most important reason (for the drop in yields) is that Tria is continuing to stick to the government and defending the budget,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk. “This is taken positively by the market.” In currency markets, the dollar gained 0.25 percent to 112.03 yen after slipping to a one-month low of 111.625 overnight. Switzerland’s currency weakened to 0.9878 francs per dollar after advancing 0.5 percent the previous day. The euro was steady at $1.15840, while sterling gained 0.5 percent against the dollar and the euro after British labour data beat expectations. There was some focus was on the U.S. Treasury’s semiannual currency report due this week, with investors waiting to see Washington’s view on China after media reports last week that it has not labelled Beijing a currency manipulator. Oil prices fell on evidence of higher U.S. oil production and increasing U.S. crude inventories, but reports of a fall in Iranian oil exports helped limit losses.O/R] Brent crude futures were down 0.8 percent to $80.17 a barrel.

2018-10-16,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Tuesday granted the southern province of Hainan free trade zone (FTZ) status, vowing to significantly ease restrictions on foreign investment on the island in sector from agriculture to medical services. Known for its sandy beaches and resort-lined coast, Hainan is the headquarters of China’s aviation-to-financial services conglomerate HNA.  President Xi Jinping first said in April China would set up a free-trade pilot zone and build an international free trade port in Hainan. Spanning 35,400 square kilometres, the Hainan FTZ would be much bigger than China’s eleven existing FTZs, which are only 120 square kilometres each, Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen told a news conference.  Its size “reflects China’s determination and confidence to further open up to the outside world”, Wang said, adding about 40 percent of the measures introduced would be unique to Hainan. The Hainan FTZ would seek to increase “openness” in sectors including seed production, tourism, medical care, aviation, and new energy vehicle manufacturing, aiming to “significantly relax the access to foreign capitals”, according to a notice released by the state cabinet on the government’s official website. The cabinet did not mention gambling or casinos in its notice. The government aims to make “significant progress” in the development of the plan by 2020, despite challenges facing the region such a shortage in talent, said Hainan vice governor Shen Danyang.

2018-10-16,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Lithium Werks BV, a startup founded by Dutch entrepreneur Kees Koolen, said on Tuesday it had signed a 1.6 billion euro ($1.85 billion) deal to build a new storage battery plant in China. Koolen told Reuters the agreement included project financing of 15-30 percent by Chinese or regional financing sources, 50 percent from development banks, and the remainder by Lithium Werks and its equity investors. The factory will be able to produce batteries with 500 GWh storage capacity per year by 2030. “There’s a big appetite from investors for such projects and such companies, so we have a lot of people interested to make sure we have enough equity,” Koolen said in a telephone interview. “This is just the first project we’re going to do.” The agreement is one of several commercial deals announced as Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met on Tuesday in the Hague. Koolen has invested 41 million euros into Lithium Werks and currently holds a 50 percent stake, though he expects that to be diluted as it grows. The company’s focus is on lithium iron phosphate batteries which are the size of shipping containers. They are quick to charge and suitable for a variety of uses, including solar or wind farms, or in the shipping industry. Koolen predicted the battery storage market would eventually be far larger than the market for electric cars.     He said that European governments were also interested in supporting his company, which has received investments from the University of Twente in the Netherlands and Dutch development agency Oost NL. But other potential projects are moving more slowly due to red tape, Koolen said. The factory is to be built on a 60 hectare site in the Yangtze River Delta in cooperation with China’s Zhejiang Jiashan Economic and Technological Development Zone Industry Corporation. Koolen, a partner at investor EQT Partners and an adviser to Uber International, held key positions at Booking.com in the early days of its transformation into the world’s largest hotel booking site.

2018-10-16,"BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swiss chemicals group Clariant (CLN.S) elected four representatives of its Saudi anchor shareholder to its board on Tuesday as its new chief executive acknowledged rising tensions over a missing Saudi journalist could hurt its business. The vote came as Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) pulled out of an investment summit in the Middle Eastern kingdom, the latest western company to shun Saudi Arabia amidst the mystery surrounding the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Clariant, which has state-controlled Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE as its largest shareholder, said the uncertainties surrounding Saudi Arabia could hit it and rivals who operate in region. “If there is a major trade disruption involving Saudi Arabia, Clariant will be affected and many others, I may say even possibly more than Clariant, will be affected,” Ernesto Occhiello told reporters. “If there is no trade disruption the competitive scenario will remain untouched. We will see,” said Occhiello, who was head of specialities at SABIC before taking charge at Clariant on Tuesday.  “I wouldn’t consider the fact that Saudi Arabia is going through a lively few days in the media as having an impact on the ability of Clariant to compete with other parties.” Saudi Arabia’s riyal rebounded against the dollar after CNN reported Riyadh was preparing to acknowledge Khashoggi died in a botched interrogation. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist critical of Riyadh’s policies, disappeared on October 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that. Europe’s largest economies — Britain, France and Germany — said on Sunday they were treating the case with “the utmost seriousness”, while U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened “severe punishment” if it turns out Khashoggi was killed. Clariant and 24.99 percent shareholder SABIC - which is 70 percent owned by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund - are merging their high-performance materials businesses, a move that will include the sale of some plastics and coatings activities. Occhiello is replacing Hariolf Kottmann, who was elected chairman at Tuesday’s extraordinary general meeting. “SABIC has changed its corporate governance significantly in the last 10 years, bringing in international experience to the board,” Kottmann said. Clariant shareholders raised no objections to SABIC’s presence on the board, with just one saying he was concerned about expanding the board to 12 directors from 10. Kottmann reiterated that SABIC could increase its stake, but had no plans to launch a full takeover of Clariant.  Kottmann said he expected to raise 1.5 billion (1.2 billion pounds) to 1.6 billion Swiss francs from selling parts of its plastics and coatings business, with money likely going to SABIC as compensation for creating the materials joint venture. Clariant has not started negotiations to sell off businesses. Selling the medical packaging business could be accomplished easily, he said, although divesting the pigments business could take at least one-and-a-half years. Clariant shares gained 0.5 percent by midday, while SABIC rose 2.9 percent.

2018-10-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - A rise in oil prices to four-year highs is heaping pressure on big emerging-market crude consumers such as Turkey, India, Indonesia and South Africa that are already grappling with current account deficits, weak currencies and rising inflation. Emerging markets worldwide have been buffeted in recent months by the strong dollar, climbing U.S. interest rates and slowing growth momentum with Turkey and Argentina descending into full-blown currency crises. Meanwhile Brent crude prices have risen above $80 per barrel, thanks largely to coordinated production cuts by some of the world’s biggest oil exporters, as well as impending U.S. sanctions on crude exporter Iran that could wipe yet more supply off the market. Some analysts now think benchmark prices could return to $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014. But for a number of importers such as India, Turkey or Indonesia - who all have seen their currencies tumble to record lows this year - oil is already more expensive now at $85 a barrel than it was back in 2008 when the price hit a record $147 a barrel. (Graphic: reut.rs/2OeE9Hb) Rising oil prices spell trouble for emerging markets, said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist Northern Trust, an asset management firm with $1.1 trillion under management. “Look at the largest market cap countries ... every one of them is an oil importer,” said McDonald. “High oil prices are bad for them, unless it is tied to growth being really good - today what is driving oil prices higher is not a pick-up in growth, it is a slowdown in supply, and that’s a bad scenario.” Trouble is especially on the cards for those economies hit by the triple-whammy of a sharp currency drop, heavy reliance on dollar-denominated energy imports and external funding flows. (Graphic: reut.rs/2yGdxnW) While China, India, Thailand, Turkey, South Africa and Indonesia top the list of biggest emerging market oil importers, Thailand enjoys a solid current account surplus and China only edged into a rare deficit in the first half of the year. However, Turkey, Argentina, India and Indonesia find themselves high up on the list of countries featuring large current account deficits as a percentage of their GDP, according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund for 2018. For many countries, the pressure is two-fold: rising crude imports with rising prices. China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey and South Africa imported 18 percent more crude oil in July 2018, the last month for which complete data is available, than they did in January 2017.   The average cost of their oil imports in their respective currencies, however, has risen by an average of nearly 60 percent in that time.    Analysts are also closely watching how another oil shock might affect country’s import cover and the adequacy of central banks’ foreign currency reserves. As oil prices rise, that ratio will come under even more scrutiny. Consumer spending power across many of these countries is also bound to suffer as - unlike in 2008 - many consumers do not have the same cushion of fuel subsidies and central banks have to ramp up rates to tackle inflation pressures and steady their currencies. (Graphic: reut.rs/2CJUtJX) Meanwhile, the hit taken by emerging market economies is likely to be severe enough to slow down oil demand growth this year and next. All three major oil market forecasters - the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Information Administration and OPEC - cut their estimates for oil demand growth this year and next in the past days. All three cited the financial pain visited upon emerging markets as the key catalyst.

2018-10-16,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmakers only have a 50 percent chance of surviving as leading players in the auto industry unless they transform their businesses to meet new regulations and adapt supply chains, Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) chief executive said on Tuesday. Car manufacturers have complained about new regulations, including bans on older diesel vehicles in German cities and broader EU measures to cut car emissions, saying they will hurt Europe’s car industry and cost jobs. “If you look at the former bastions of the auto industry like Detroit, Oxford-Cowley or Turin, you understand what happens to cities when once-powerful corporations and leading industries falter,” CEO Herbert Diess told an auto suppliers’ conference in Wolfsburg, VW’s manufacturing base. Germany’s auto industry association VDA has said a ban on combustion engine-powered vehicles in 2030 would threaten more than 600,000 German industrial jobs, of which 436,000 are at car companies and their suppliers.  Tougher rules could push some carmakers out of business due to the pace of reforms required to shift production to electric cars and to tackle new geopolitical threats, said Diess. “From today’s point of view the chances are perhaps 50-50 that the German auto industry will still belong among the global elite in 10 years’ time,” he said, referring to leading players Volkswagen Group, BMW (BMWG.DE) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE). European Union lawmakers have agreed to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030, a higher level than Germany had sought, after a U.N. report called for dramatic steps to slow global warming. Germany’s BMW, Audi and Mercedes brands command around a 90 percent market share in the premium auto segment, but a push to cut emissions hurts high horsepower vehicles and therefore German brands in particular. Volkswagen is already struggling to overcome its emissions cheating scandal. Its premium unit Audi was fined 800 million euros ($926 million) on Tuesday for emissions violations.    “We are all used to the fact that we have flourishing industrial metropolises around the central manufacturing plants of German carmakers and their suppliers, places where people like to live and work, but that’s not guaranteed for eternity,” Diess said.  To cut average fleet emissions of carbon dioxide in Europe by 30 percent by 2030, Volkswagen needs to raise its share of fully electric vehicles to 30 percent of new car sales, or to half in the event of a 40 percent cut, Diess said. The push to cut vehicle carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming, is costly and would ultimately lead to a rise in CO2 pollution in Germany given the country’s dependence on generating electricity from brown coal, he said.   The shift from combustion engines to electric cars would also cost 14,000 jobs at VW by 2020, Diess said, requiring an overhaul of the carmaker’s in-house components business. “It is clear to us all that the structural shift will lead to fewer auto industry jobs in Germany. The question is, how quickly do we need to implement this structural change?,” he said. Jobs will disappear because it takes less time to build an electric car than a conventional one and because jobs will shift overseas to makers of batteries.  A combustion engine-powered car has 1,400 components in its motor, exhaust system and transmission. An electric car’s battery and motor has only 200 components, according to analysts at ING.  In Europe there are about 126 plants making combustion engines, employing 112,000 people. The largest engine plant in Europe is Volkswagen’s factory in Kassel.  So far German carmakers have sourced battery cells from Asian suppliers like LG Chem and Samsung SDI, which are currently supplying Audi and BMW. VW is overhauling its in-house components division, which eats up the lion’s share of the 170 billion euros ($197 billion) spent on procurement, develops and builds car parts at 56 sites across the globe, and employs about 80,000 people. “From Jan. 1 onward, Volkswagen components will act as an economically independent entity,” Diess said. Each of the 56 plants would be free to evaluate partnerships and even to build components for other carmakers, Diess said.

2018-10-16,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s Volvo (VOLVb.ST) warned on Tuesday that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions as an emissions control component it uses was degrading more quickly than expected, sending its shares lower. The company, which makes trucks, construction equipment and buses, said the largest volume of potentially affected engines had been sold in North America and Europe, its two largest markets, and that costs to fix the problem “could be material”. The issue could become an added headache for Volvo, which has been working hard to protect profitability after a surge in demand in Europe and North America caused supply chain bottlenecks, inflating costs for raw materials and labour. Several countries have in recent years set ambitious goals to cut carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, bringing carmakers and truckmakers under greater scrutiny. The car industry was rocked by the 2015 “dieselgate” emissions scandal after Germany’s Volkswagen was forced to pay hefty fines after admitting to systematic emissions cheating. Volkswagen, which has pegged the financial toll at over $18 billion, is still dealing with the fallout of the scandal.  There was no indication on Tuesday that Volvo had cheated or hidden any emissions related information from authorities. Volvo said all products equipped with the component met emissions limits at delivery and that its probe so far indicated that the degradation was not affecting all vehicles and engines in the same way and to the same extent. The company had begun speaking to relevant authorities in Europe and North America, where emission regulations are strictest, a spokesman said. An European Commission spokeswoman said the body would contact the Swedish authorities to gather more information, while Reuters was not immediately able to reach North American authorities outside of regular business hours.  The problem was with a catalyst converter sourced from an external provider, Volvo investor relations director Anders Christensson said, declining to name the provider or say whether Volvo would terminate the relationship. “In certain applications when the engine is not running hot enough you get condensation water in there and that causes this problem. You get a warning signal in the dashboard saying you’re running above nitrogen oxide levels,” he explained. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Mats Liss said the question was whether the whole catalyst needed to be replaced or just one component, estimating the total cost for Volvo would be at least “a couple of thousands (of crowns) per truck instantly”. The Volvo spokesman said there were no plans yet to recall any vehicles and had not been asked by authorities to do so.     Volvo sold 143,373 trucks in Europe and North America last year and reported operating income of 30.3 billion Swedish crowns. The company’s shares were down 5.3 percent at 134 pence on 0917 GMT, making it easily the biggest lower on Stockholm’s bluechip index .PL.OMXS30 on Tuesday.  It is due to report third-quarter results on Friday. Analysts also speculated that an external supplier could mean that the problem was widespread and hit German truck rivals Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE). Volkswagen and Daimler did not immediately return calls seeking comments.

2018-10-16,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo on Tuesday urged oil producing companies to increase capacities and invest more to meet future demand as spare oil capacity shrinks worldwide.   Oil prices have rallied this year on expectations that U.S. sanctions on Iran will strain supplies by lowering shipments from OPEC’s third-largest oil producer. Brent crude LCOc1 breached four year highs to reach $86.74 a barrel earlier this month, the highest since 2014. “Countries that are holding spare capacity are now  shrinking because there has been less investment in exploration,” Barkindo said on the sidelines of the IHS CERA conference. The global oil sector needs about $11 trillion in investment to meet future oil needs in the period up to 2040, Barkindo said, adding that import-dependent countries such as India were concerned about future oil supply. Crude oil demand is expected to increase by 14.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 2017 to 111.7 million bpd in 2040, OPEC said in its September report. Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, is the only oil producer with significant spare capacity on hand to supply the market if needed, and the kingdom plans to invest $20 billion in the next few years to possibly expand its spare oil production capacity. Barkindo said the oil markets were currently adequately  supplied and balanced, but cautioned against a potential imbalance in 2019 due to higher supply. “We will continue to ensure that the balance that we have attained after four years will be sustained going forward,” he said. Members of OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in a supply-reduction agreement are on course to reach 100 percent compliance, Barkindo said, calling it a “work in progress.” OPEC and allied producers - not including the United States - agreed in June to return to 100 percent compliance with output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction in Venezuela and elsewhere pushed adherence above 160 percent. India is expected to account for about 40 percent of the overall increase in global demand for the period ending 2040, Barkindo said. Demand for oil in the world’s third-largest oil importer is expected to rise by 5.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2040. “India is projected to see the largest additional oil demand (3.7 percent per annum) and the fastest growth in the period to 2040,” said Barkindo in his speech to the conference. Indian officials have flagged worries about the outlook for crude supply though oil producers have downplayed a potential shortfall. India, which imports more than 80 percent of its oil needs, shipped in 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in 2017.  India has sought easier payment terms from oil suppliers to combat higher crude prices. Retail fuel prices in India recently touched record levels due to high oil prices and a weakening rupee, leading to protests across the country.

Stock market sentiment in Europe also got a boost from expectations that earnings season will deliver double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter. “If you look at what’s happening here and now, it is an improvement from what was happening a week ago,” Alexandrovich said. “How long the stability lasts is anyone’s guess.” Calmer equity markets took the shine off safe-haven assets. Japan’s yen was down a third of a percent against the dollar, the Swiss franc edged away from almost two-week highs against the greenback and gold dropped from Monday’s 2 1/2-month high as tension between the West and Saudi Arabia triggered a fresh exit out of risk assets. The disappearance in Turkey earlier this month of a Saudi journalist critical of Riyadh has provoked an international outcry against the oil-rich kingdom. Saudi Arabia is preparing to acknowledge the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a botched interrogation, CNN and the New York Times said on Monday. That backdrop, together with nagging concerns about the economic outlook, global trade tensions and higher U.S. interest rates, meant a degree of caution prevailed. The blue-chip Dow has lost 4.5 percent this month, as long-term Treasury yields soared to their highest level since 2011. Higher yields make equities less attractive. Chinese stocks closed lower on Tuesday after data showed factory-gate inflation had cooled for a third straight month in September amid weaker domestic demand, reflecting more pressure on the world’s second-biggest economy. “The focus of the markets has turned to the Middle East due to the Saudi incident. And with U.S. stocks still struggling, other equity markets will have a difficult time bouncing convincingly,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. Italian government bond yields fell as much as 12 basis points across the curve, narrowing the spread over German peers , after Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria defended the country’s deficit-hiking budget. “The most important reason (for the drop in yields) is that Tria is continuing to stick to the government and defending the budget,” said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk. “This is taken positively by the market.” In currency markets, the dollar gained 0.35 percent to 112.15 yen after slipping to a one-month low of 111.625 overnight. Switzerland’s currency weakened to 0.9878 francs per dollar after advancing 0.5 percent the previous day. The euro was a shade higher at $1.15930. Sterling gained 0.26 percent to $1.3179, having bounced from Monday’s one-week low of $1.3080 amid a stalemate over the post-Brexit status of Britain’s land border with Ireland. There was some focus was on the U.S. Treasury’s semiannual currency report due later in the day, with investors waiting to see Washington’s view on China after media reports last week that it has not labelled Beijing a currency manipulator . Oil prices dipped amid expectations of an increase in U.S. crude inventories, but signs of Iranian oil exports fell this month kept losses in check. Brent crude futures fell 0.9 percent to $80.07 a barrel.

2018-10-16,"TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Japanese energy explorer Inpex Corp is this week set to load the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo from its long-delayed Ichthys project in northwestern Australia, sources familiar with the matter said. The shipment would be an important milestone for Inpex, the operator of Japan’s biggest overseas investment and the first major project where it is the lead operator. The $40 billion project has seen multiple delays and significant cost overruns. An Inpex spokesman in Tokyo said that production had been going smoothly and that shipments of LNG and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were set to begin, but he declined to comment on commercial matters including the schedule for shipments. The LNG vessel Pacific Breeze was located close to the Ichthys LNG Terminal near Darwin with a departure date of Oct. 17, according to Refinitiv data. After the first shipment, three LNG cargoes are scheduled to load next month, according to one of the sources. It was not clear where the cargo was heading, but some sources said in May that the commissioning LNG cargo from Ichthys would be exported to Inpex’s Naoetsu LNG receiving terminal in Japan. In a statement last year announcing the ship’s name, Inpex said Pacific Breeze would supply 1.75 million tonnes of LNG annually from Ichthys to Taiwan’s CPC Corp. The move comes about two weeks after the first condensate shipment from Ichthys’ floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility. Ichthys has seen multiple delays and cost overruns of billions of dollars due to technical difficulties. It was originally slated to start in 2016. At full operation, Ichthys is expected to produce 8.9 million tonnes of LNG a year, along with about 1.7 million tonnes of LPG and about 100,000 barrels per day of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil. The company expects to take two to three years to reach full production. Inpex in August said Ichthys would help add net profit of 10 billion yen ($89 million) in the second-half of 2018/19, down from a May outlook of 24 billion yen, due to the delays. Inpex holds 62.245 percent of Ichthys, France’s Total 30 percent, with the rest spread amongst CPC and Japanese utilities Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Kansai Electric, JERA Corp and Toho Gas.

2018-10-16,"(Corrects day in first paragraph to Tuesday) By Nidhi Verma and Promit Mukherjee NEW DELHI, Oct 16 (Reuters) - India’s oil demand is expected to rise by 5.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2040, accounting for about 40 percent of the overall increase in global demand during the period, OPEC’s secretary general said on Tuesday. “India is projected to see the largest additional oil demand (3.7 percent per annum) and the fastest growth in the period to 2040,” said Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo, secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. He added that the global oil sector needed $11 trillion in investment to meet future demand by 2040. Global oil demand is expected to increase by 14.5 million bpd from 2017 to 111.7 million bpd in 2040, OPEC said in its latest report, issued in September. Retail fuel prices in India, the world’s third biggest oil consumer and importer, recently touched record levels due to high oil prices and a weakening rupee, leading to protests across the country. Barkindo said consumers including India have expressed concerns on the outlook for supply. “Our view is that the market is currently adequately supplied and well balanced. For 2019, there is the potential for an imbalance, due to larger growth in supply,” he said. Barkindo’s views echoed those of Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive of French oil and gas group Total, who said on Tuesday that he expected demand for crude to be lower and supply to be higher in 2019.

2018-10-16,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese oil refiner Idemitsu Kosan (5019.T) on Tuesday finalised a deal to buy out Showa Shell Sekiyu (5002.T) through a share swap in a deal worth about $5.6 billion. Shares in the two companies, which had run up strongly ahead of the integration, initially fell sharply on details of the deal before closing down around 3 percent in a firmer overall market.  The new firm will target annual savings of around 60 billion yen ($535 million) in 2021/22 from the integration, up by 10 billion yen from a previous projection, the two companies said. “The latest announcement spurred feelings that the stock has run out of new material,” said a source at a Japanese brokerage. The refiners announced in July they had finally reached a deal to merge, in April next year, after Idemitsu’s founding family dropped its long-standing opposition to the plan. Idemitsu, Japan’s No.2 oil refiner by sales, has long been keen to merge its operations with fourth-ranked Showa Shell in response to shrinking gasoline demand in the country. The combined firm would account for about 30 percent of Japan’s domestic gasoline sales, second only to JXTG Holdings (5020.T), which controls about half the market. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the companies said 0.41 Idemitsu shares would be exchanged for each Showa Shell share. Idemitsu will be the surviving entity with Showa Shell shares to be delisted March 27. Based on the ratio and Idemitsu’s closing price on Monday, Showa Shell is valued at 2,431.3 yen per share, a slight discount to its 2,441 yen close on Monday. That puts the deal value at about 630 billion yen ($5.6 billion) for the nearly 69 percent of Showa Shell that Idemitsu does not already own. Idemitsu shares fell as much as 9 percent before ending down 3.2 percent, while Showa Shell shares fell as much as 8 percent before closing down 2.6 percent. Idemtisu President Shunichi Kito, who will serve as president of the combined firm, ruled out combining the group’s seven refineries in Japan with total crude refining capacity of 1.088 million barrels per day (bpd) as all were competitive with room for exports. The new firm has a higher ratio of residue cracking capability at its refineries than rivals, he said. The group could raise the capacity of heavy oil processing units at Idemitsu’s 190,000-bpd Chiba refinery in response to the International Maritime Organization’s move to ban use of high sulfur fuel, he added.

The United States plans to impose new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector on Nov. 4 to try to stop the country’s involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and bring Tehran to the negotiating table over its ballistic missile programme. The Trump administration is actively considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports of Iranian oil, a U.S. government official said earlier this month. “The waiver should happen pretty fast, hopefully this month,” M. Venkatesh, managing director at MRPL told reporters on the sidelines of the IHS CERA conference. India is hopeful of waivers as it has made progress on qualifying for exceptions called SRE waivers, or significant reduction exemptions, he said. “It is not easy to replace Iranian barrels,” Venkatesh added. MRPL would look at buying Iraqi oil to replace Iranian oil, he said, adding that the company has already made some payments in rupees to Iran for oil. MRPL, which has an annual deal to buy 4.5 million tonnes of Iranian oil, has so far taken about 60-70 percent of its contracted volumes, Venkatesh said. It also has an option to buy an additional 1 million tonnes. “It is important for India to get some barrels of crude from Iran otherwise if Saudi and major producers are not able to jack up their production, it will impact prices,” he said. Indian refiners imported around 10 million barrels of Iranian oil in October, and its November shipments are expected to be lower. India, Iran’s top client after China, has close diplomatic ties with Iran, where it is building a strategic port called Chabahar that is expected to be operational by 2019.

2018-10-16,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - At his first meeting with foreign oil majors, Mexico’s leftist president-elect pushed the companies to prove themselves by quickly pumping oil from recent finds, sources say, but gave no sign of offering up new fields to reverse dwindling output. President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador repeated a promise to respect more than 100 existing contracts awarded following a sweeping five-year-old energy overhaul as long as a review by his team finds no corruption. And he added: companies must show results, three executives who attended the meeting said. For U.S. independent Talos Energy, which is developing a high-profile, big offshore discovery announced last year along with partners Premier Oil and Sierra Oil & Gas, Lopez Obrador’s message was clear: quickly bring new streams of production online. “We know we have to exceed expectations and we’re trying to make sure we do that,” said Talos Energy CEO Tim Duncan, one of the executives who attended the session. At the Sept. 27 meeting, the president-elect also criticized the 2013 constitutional reform for failing to stop an extended output slide. Operators such as Talos and Italy’s Eni, which also announced a major offshore find last year, are on Lopez Obrador’s watch list to pump oil quickly, said Carlos Pascual, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico who now helps run consultancy IHS Markit’s global energy business. “The focus on increased barrels is going to create greater pressure for some companies,” he said. The oil and gas blocks awarded in bidding rounds over the past three years to companies including Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron will result in $160 billion in new investment, the outgoing government estimates.  Lopez Obrador’s pick to be the new oil minister, Rocio Nahle, did not respond to a request for comment about Lopez Obrador’s presentation. At the meeting, Lopez Obrador also explained he intends to put some 20 idle drilling rigs belonging to a few Mexican service firms to work for state giant Pemex, according to three executives who attended the meeting. The executives, who asked not to be named to avoid any ill-will from the incoming government, said they were surprised at the decision to talk up the service contracts for Pemex instead of encouraging much bigger investments the oil companies are capable of making. A former senior executive with Pemex said the plan could add at most 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Mexico’s 1.8 million bpd production in a year, far short of the 40 percent increase to 2.6 million bpd he is targeting during his six year term.   Lopez Obrador is a long-time critic of the energy reform that brought major oil companies to Mexico for the first time in more than 70 years, and has warned he will not offer up more areas for auction. Oil companies still hope he will soften that position in order to meet his ambitious production goals.  The veteran leftist politician adopted a diplomatic tone at the industry session, said the company executives, and his team even pledged to ease regulatory delays companies face. “Reality could force pragmatism,” said an oil executive who attended the meeting, arguing it is highly unlikely Mexico could meet Lopez Obrador’s lofty output goal with government spending alone. As an indicator, firms are closely watching whether oil auctions set for February by Mexico’s independent oil regulator will be canceled or postponed after Lopez Obrador takes office in December. If that happens, along with the pledge to focus production plans on squeezing more out of Pemex fields with local rigs, outside investment could cool for years in Mexico’s oil patch, home to under-explored shale plays and the country’s potentially lucrative deepwater Gulf of Mexico, according to the executives and sector analysts.   The head of the oil regulator, Juan Carlos Zepeda, has said Pemex would need to dedicate $20 billion each year to exploration and production activities to hit Lopez Obrador’s output goal, about double this year’s budget. Advisor Rocio Nahle, Lopez Obrador’s pick to be energy minister, said last month Pemex will be allocated about $4 billion for “exploration and drilling” in 2019, without going into detail. The nearly two hour meeting between Lopez Obrador and oil company executives ended with a promise to maintain “continuous dialogue” going forward However, there was no question-and-answer period, and following the set speeches, Lopez Obrador and his senior energy aides quickly departed.

2018-10-16,"DHAKA, Oct 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Bangladesh’s electricity generation from renewable sources has passed the 5 percent mark with the opening of a major new solar plant - boosting hopes the country might meet its goal of getting 10 percent of power from renewables by 2020, experts say. The new 28 megawatt solar power plant in Cox’s Bazar District is the largest yet opened in the country, following the earlier construction of a 3 MW plant. The solar plants come on top of the widespread use of solar home systems in the low-lying country, considered one of those most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Currently about 5.2 million small-scale solar home systems provide electricity to almost 12 percent of Bangladesh’s 160 million people, Dipal C. Barua, president of the Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He called the new plant “good news” for the country, saying the accelerating construction of solar power facilities “will build confidence among future investors”. The new 116-acre solar park will supply enough electricity to meet about 80 percent of power demand in the Teknaf sub-district where it is located, said Mahmudul Hasan, chief financial officer for Joules Power Ltd. That area has about 300,000 power users, though little in the way of industrial or large commercial users, he said. Nuher Latif Khan, managing director of Technaf Solartech Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of Joules Power that owns the plant, said the plant had begun operations ahead of schedule. In Bangladesh, “the future of solar power is very fantastic,” he said, noting that company “definitely” planned to invest more in renewable energy, including potentially wind power. Khan said the solar park can produce up to 28 MW of solar electricity at peak capacity and has contracted to provide 20 MW to the government grid. Barua said several other large solar plants are in the pipeline in Bangladesh, after receiving government approval, with a few at advanced stages of construction. MORE COST - THEN LESS While solar plants need a large amount of initial investment to set up, he said, they have very small operational costs afterward, unlike plants that need ongoing sources of coal or other fossil fuels. The government has supported the construction of rooftop solar plants on factories and other commercial buildings, he said, with some facilities on large plants expected to generate a megawatt or more each. With such solar plants, thousands of factories in Bangladesh should be able to meet their own electricity needs, and contribute surplus power to the national grid. “I think one day we will see every building has a rooftop solar power system,” Barua said. However, finding available land to set up ground-level solar plants is a major challenge in densely populated Bangladesh, he admitted. Sheikh Reaz Ahmed, director of the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA), said the country’s 2008 renewable energy policy calls for generating 10 percent of electricity from renewables by 2020. With the country expected to generate 20,000 MW of electricity in total by the date, renewables would have to reach 2,000 MW to hit that target, he said. So far Bangladesh generates just over 530 MW from renewables, nearly half of that from hydropower plants, he said. But the country is set to put online another 600 MW of renewable power in 2019 alone, he said, with another 1,100 MW rolled out in 2020 and 2021. Altogether, plants now in the pipeline should bring the country’s renewable energy generating capacity to 2,235 MW by 2021, Ahmed said. Not all the construction is progressing smoothly, however, with some plants tied up in problems with land acquisition and other issues, he said. Meanwhile, energy generation from fossil fuels also is rising to meet soaring demand for energy in Bangladesh, he said. Last year, Bangladesh’s cabinet committee on public procurement approved a proposal to construct 10 new oil-fired power plants, capable of generating 1,800 MW of electricity. In January, construction also began on a 1,200 MW coal-fired power plant in Cox’s Bazar, funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. That means boosting Bangladesh's percentage of renewable energy above 10 percent won't be easy, because ""each year total power generation from traditional sources will go up” too, Ahmed noted.

2018-10-16,"* Iran exports avg 1.33 mln bpd of crude in first two weeks of Oct * Trump sends Pompeo to Saudi Arabia over missing Saudi journalist * U.S. crude inventory likely to increase - Reuters poll SEOUL, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday on signs of falling Iran oil exports ahead of U.S. sanctions against Tehran in November, while geopolitical tensions remain over a missing Saudi journalist. International benchmark Brent crude for December delivery rose 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $80.87 per barrel by 0032 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery was up 5 cents at $71.83 a barrel. Iran has exported 1.33 million barrels per day (bpd) to a few countries including India and China in the first two weeks of October, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. That was down from at least 2.5 million bpd in April before U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a multi-lateral nuclear deal with Iran in May. As looming Iran sanctions raise supply concerns, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday the kingdom is committed to meeting India’s rising oil demand and is the “shock absorber” for supply disruptions in the oil market. Saudi Arabia, however, has faced political pressure over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct.2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened “severe punishment” for the kingdom if the journalist is found to have been killed. Trump dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Salman. Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit the death of the Saudi journalist according to CNN and the New York Times reports on Monday. “For now, concerns around the disappearance of a Saudi Arabian national appear to be limited to the political sphere,” a Huston-based consultancy Stratas Advisors said in a note. But WTI prices could fall in the back half of the week, weighed by an increase in U.S. crude inventories, the note said. U.S. crude stockpiles were forecast to have risen for the fourth straight week by about 1.1 million barrels in the week ended Oct.12, according to a Reuters poll ahead of reports from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA). The API’s data is due for publication at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Tuesday, and the EIA report is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday.

The disappearance earlier this month of a Saudi journalist critical of Riyadh has provoked an international outcry against the oil-rich kingdom. U.S. President Donald Trump has sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia over the case, potentially straining the relationship between the strategic allies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.25 percent, crawling away from a 19-month trough touched on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei bounced 0.3 percent following a decline of nearly 2 percent the previous day. “The focus of the markets has turned to the Middle East due to the Saudi incident. And with U.S. stocks still struggling, other equity markets will have a difficult time bouncing convincingly,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The United States has been the epicentre of the recent market tumult, with Wall Street shares being hit by higher Treasury yields. U.S. shares will have to find their feet first.” Saudi Arabia’s riyal currency retreated overnight to 3.7525 to the dollar - its weakest in two years. Wall Street shares were dragged down overnight by a retreat in technology shares amid lingering worries over high U.S. yields. The Dow has lost 4.5 percent this month, pulled away from record peaks, as long-term Treasury yields soared to their highest level since 2011. Higher yields are seen eroding the allure of equities. Perceived safe havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc have found supported following the hit taken by riskier assets. The dollar traded little changed at 111.83 yen, not far from a one-month low of 111.625 brushed overnight. Against the dollar, the Swiss currency stood at 0.9868 franc after advancing 0.5 percent the previous day.

2018-10-16,"(Reuters) - California’s largest public utility cut off electric power to about 60,000 customers to prevent wildfires such as those that erupted in the state’s wine country last fall, as high winds threatened to topple trees and power lines this week. With gusty winds and low humidity in the forecast this week, Pacific Gas & Electric warned customers on Sunday that their power would be cut. The company initially said the blackout would last until at least Monday evening, and some schools canceled classes in the six affected northern California counties. But by Monday afternoon, the company said it expected to restore power to 70 percent of affected customers by midnight. “This is the first time that we have proactively turned off the power due to fire threat conditions,” said Melissa Subbotin, spokeswoman for the utility, which is owned by PG&E Corp.     The power outage, which started on Sunday, came just days after California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection found that last year’s Cascade Fire in Yuba County, which burned nearly 10,000 acres and killed four people, was started by “sagging power lines coming into contact during heavy winds.” One of the lines was owned by PG&E. With PG&E facing billion of dollars in potential payouts from lawsuits, California lawmakers in September passed a bill that could help the utility avoid potentially crippling liabilities. Two smaller California utilities, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison (SCE_pe.A) also announced power cuts to some communities because the seasonal Santa Ana winds blowing off the deserts of southeastern California presented an extreme danger. PG&E’s move prompted many customers to complain on Twitter that the outage was spoiling food, disabling traffic lights and keeping them from doing their jobs.  Due to the disruption to customers, the power cutoff was a “last resort” measure as part of a program that includes a team monitoring weather and other conditions in several high-risk counties, especially during wildfire season, typically late summer and fall, Subbotin said.  “We take into consideration climate change here as the new normal,” she added. “That has unfortunately increased the risk of wildfires.”  Customers were warned of the cutoff by telephone, text message and email, Subbotin said.  The Konocti Unified School District in Lower Lake, California, which includes 3,500 students, was one of four Lake County districts that closed, Superintendent Donna Becnel said. “I always hate to cancel school,” Becnel said by telephone.  “But with the number of power outages and not knowing how long it was going to last, there was no way to have classes without heat, lights and the ability to provide food for students.”     Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Richard Chang and Diane Craft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/california-wildfire/update-1-california-utility-puts-users-in-the-dark-to-dampen-wildfire-threat-idUKL2N1WV1S2,16 Oct 2018,"California's largest public utility cut

2018-10-16,"(Repeats Monday’s column with no changes to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OtbNcn By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have continued to take profits on their bullish positions in crude oil as the late summer rally has faded and fears about oil consumption and the state of the economy have replaced concerns over sanctions on Iran. Fund managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 36 million barrels in the week to Oct. 9 after trimming it by 19 million barrels the week before. Liquidation was concentrated in Brent (-6 million barrels) and WTI (-37 million), while fund managers left positions unchanged in U.S. heating oil and added them in U.S. gasoline (+2 million) and European gasoil (+6 million). Net positions in Brent and WTI have been cut by a total of 71 million barrels over the last two weeks after being raised by 177 million during the five previous weeks (tmsnrt.rs/2OtbNcn). The earlier bullishness was driven mostly by concerns about a possible shortage of crude oil once U.S. sanctions on Iran go into effect from early November. But in recent weeks Saudi Arabia, Russia and some other oil producers have pledged to boost their oil output to make up for any shortfall and stop prices spiralling higher. More importantly, and possibly in response to the surge in oil prices, the U.S. government has indicated it may show some flexibility to allow refiners to continue purchasing some Iranian oil. Portfolio managers remain relatively bullish on Brent, with net length of 476 million barrels, reflecting lingering concerns about the impact of sanctions on the availability of seaborne crude as well as the strength in global consumption. But net long positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI have been cut to just 296 million barrels, the lowest level for almost a year, reflecting the plentiful supply of inland crude in the United States. Overall, hedge fund managers remained bullish, with almost 10 bullish long positions for every 1 short bearish position across the six major contracts. However, the ratio is down from more than 12:1 a fortnight earlier. Potential sanctions waivers as well as concern about consumption and the health of the global economy have tempered the earlier bullishness about prices and encouraged funds to adopt a more cautious stance.
