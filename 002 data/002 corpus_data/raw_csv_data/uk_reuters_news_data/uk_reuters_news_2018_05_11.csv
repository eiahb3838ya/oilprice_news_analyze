2018-05-11,"(Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA is preparing to shut a Caribbean refinery that is running out of crude amid threats by ConocoPhillips (COP.N) to seize cargoes sent to resupply the facility, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation. Conoco of the United States last week began legal actions in the Caribbean to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) over the 2007 nationalisation of its projects in Venezuela. The moves have disrupted fuel deliveries throughout the Caribbean, much of which depends on PDVSA. The PDVSA-operated 335,000 barrel-per-day Isla refinery in Curacao, which has not received new shipments from PDVSA since last week, plans to exhaust existing inventories in the coming days, the two sources said. PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.      PDVSA is seeking ways to sidestep legal orders to hand over assets. The Venezuelan firm has transferred custody over the fuel produced at the refinery to the Curacao government, the owner of the facility, the sources said. In another legal move to avoid oil being seized, PDVSA transferred ownership of crude to be refined at Isla to its U.S. unit, Citgo Petroleum, one of the sources added. “The seizure in Curacao was enforced on Thursday, so the inventories’ custody was transferred. The refinery will eventually stop (operations),” the source said. PDVSA has told customers they must send their own ships to pick up oil cargoes in Venezuelan waters, rather than wait for it to deliver. That keeps PDVSA’s ships out of Conoco’s grasp. PDVSA, which was already struggling to export its oil amid falling output and a lack of maintenance, is looking for a place in Venezuelan waters to start transferring oil from small to larger tankers, which is typically done for large cargoes bound for Asian destinations. The country’s oil ports increasingly are snarled with vessels waiting to load for exports.  Conoco said on Friday that it had been in touch with local officials across the Caribbean “to address issues that may arise as a result of enforcement actions.”  Curacao fuel distributor, Curoil, told Reuters on Friday the company has “diversified” its fuel supply, so it does not foresee any issues at the moment. The island’s Prime Minister Eugene Rhuggenaath earlier this week said Curacao would import fuel if the refinery is paralysed. In Bonaire, another of the islands affected by Conoco’s actions, there is enough fuel to continue generating electricity for at least two weeks, said Caspar Itz, a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.  PDVSA last year shipped from the terminals it owns and rents in Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius 24 percent of its total exports, or about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd). Facilities in Curacao are crucial for loading big vessels bound for China and India, while most of its fuel oil exports are sent from Bonaire. For May, PDVSA had planned to ship from Curacao 1.45 million barrels (47,000 bpd) of fuels to Haiti, Cuba, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Belize and other smaller Caribbean islands, according to the state-run firm’s internal trade documents.   PDVSA also planned to deliver this month over 2.3 million barrels of crude and fuel oil to Citgo and Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) from Curacao and Bonaire, the documents showed.   In its first official comments since Conoco’s actions started, Venezuela on Thursday suggested it was ready to pay the U.S. oil company. Conoco said it was looking forward to PDVSA’s proposals but added that absent any agreement or payment it would continue its enforcement actions. Additional reporting and writing by Gary McWilliams.

2018-05-11,"LISBON (Reuters) - China’s state-owned utility China Three Gorges on Friday launched a bid to take control of Portugal’s biggest company EDP, offering a premium of just below 5 percent on the power firm’s closing stock price.  The total value of the proposed deal is 9.07 billion euros  ($10.83 billion), excluding a 23 percent stake already owned by CTG [CYTGP.UL], the Chinese firm and largest EDP (EDP.LS) shareholder said in a statement issued late on Friday in Lisbon. Reports that EDP may be an acquisition target of European foreign companies have been circulating for over a year, during which CTG continued to raise its stake, culminating in the 3.26 euros ($3.89) a share offer. CTG said in its preliminary offer announcement that it seeks to reach at least a 50 percent voting stake plus one share in the company. It also offered 7.33 euros a share for EDP’s wind power unit, EDP Renovaveis (EDPR.LS), below its closing price of 7.84 euros.  EDP had no immediate comment. The online edition of the Expresso newspaper said earlier that EDP was likely to consider the offer hostile. If the deal succeeds, it would be the latest in a series of acquisitions by Chinese companies in Portugal. They have been actively buying assets, from infrastructure to insurance and banking, since Portugal’s 2010-13 debt crisis. EDP is an integrated generator, supplier and distributor of electricity, the largest company by assets in Portugal with businesses in Brazil (ENBR3.SA), Spain, and the United States. CTG said it was “fully committed to preserving EDP’s Portuguese identity and autonomy as well as its current Portuguese public listing”. Prime Minister Antonio Costa told reporters earlier that the Portuguese government had no objections to the bid. “The government has nothing against it, no reservations,” Costa said, adding though that the government does not have to be consulted. “The Chinese have been good investors, be it in REN, EDP or in other sectors ... The important thing is that shareholders can ponder on the project. Let the market work.” The proposed offer may test the European Union’s readiness to give control of major infrastructure firms in member states to China, however. It could also run into problems with U.S. authorities since EDP Renovaveis (EDP Renewables) is a major player in its wind energy market. Another Chinese state company, CNIC, holds a nearly 5 percent stake in EDP, while other leading shareholders include   U.S. financial services company Capital Group, with 12 percent, and U.S. private equity firm Blackrock. EDP’s market capitalization was nearly 11.4 billion euros as of Friday. It has a net debt of 13.8 billion euros. The company serves almost 10 million power market clients and 1.6 million natural gas customers and runs over 330,000 kilometers (205,000 miles) of power transmission lines.

2018-05-11,"BRAZZAVILLE (Reuters) - A court in Congo Republic sentenced ex-army chief and opposition presidential candidate Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko to 20 years in prison on Friday on charges of violating state security and illegal possession of weapons.  Mokoko, a power broker in the former French colony’s 1990s civil war, finished third to long-serving President Denis Sassou Nguesso in a March 2016 election that was criticised by opposition parties and foreign powers for irregularities. He was arrested in June 2016. Prosecutors accused of Mokoko and several co-defendants of amassing arms as far back as 2005 in the aim of overthrowing Sassou Nguesso’s government. The co-accused received the same prison sentence. They now have three days to appeal the verdict. Mokoko declined to speak in his own defence during the trial, which opened on Monday, claiming that having been awarded the honour of Commander of the Congolese Order of Merit he benefited from immunity from prosecution.  The state prosecutor called Mokoko’s silence an admission of guilt. “Justice wasn’t rendered,” defence lawyer Philippe Esseau said following the verdict. “We consider that Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko cannot be prosecuted due to his immunity. His detention in prison is arbitrary. This decision has no value.”    Mokoko’s supporters said his prosecution was an attempt by Sassou Nguesso, who has ruled the oil-rich central African nation for all but five of the past 38 years, to use the courts to stifle dissent. The president held a referendum in 2015 that changed the constitution, allowing him to seek a third term in office, leading to protests in which at least 18 people were killed by security forces.

2018-05-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar eased on Friday while an index of global stock performance gained and was poised for its best week since early March, as moderate inflation eased worries about a faster pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and boosted risk appetite. The dollar fell for a third day against a basket of major currencies as traders booked recent gains, which were tied to widening interest rate gaps in favour of the United States and signs of slower growth elsewhere in the world. Gold posted its first weekly gain in four weeks after soft U.S. inflation data on Thursday suggested the Federal Reserve would show caution as it tightens monetary policy by raising rates.  Oil prices slipped but remained near 3-1/2 year highs as the prospect of new U.S. sanctions against Iran might reduce Middle East supply at a time when global crude production is just keeping pace with rising demand. U.S. stocks gained as healthcare shares rallied even after President Donald Trump blasted drugmakers and healthcare “middlemen” for making prescription drugs unaffordable for Americans. Trump also said the pharmaceutical industry makes an “absolute fortune” at the expense of taxpayers. The S&P healthcare index .SPXHC rose 1.47 percent as it became clear the Trump administration had avoided taking aggressive and direct measures to cut drug prices. The market is responding to exceptionally strong earnings growth and benign inflation, said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York. The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, a barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500 that often is referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has fallen to levels last seen before the February market correction, he said. “Not only has the market returned handsomely, but risk has also taken a breather,” Grohowski said. MSCI’s gauge of stock markets across the globe .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.42 percent to advance 2.1 percent for the week, its best weekly gain since early March. European shares edged higher. The pan-regional STOXX 600  index of companies in 17 countries closed up 0.11 percent for a seventh straight week of gains, the longest string of weekly advances since March 2015. Shares in Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) (DMGOa.L) rose 1.3 percent, having jumped as much as 9.4 percent, after U.S.  private equity firm Silver Lake Management Co agreed to buy ZPG ZPG.L, the owner of British property websites Zoopla and PrimeLocation, for $3 billion. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 91.64 points, or 0.37 percent, to 24,831.17. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 4.65 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,727.72 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.09 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,402.88. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 2.4 percent, the Dow gained 2.3 percent and Nasdaq added 2.7 percent. U.S. plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran, which pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, have buoyed crude prices. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 66 cents to settle at $70.70 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 settled down 45 cents at $77.12. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.11 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.23 percent to $1.194. The Japanese yen JPY= firmed 0.06 percent versus the greenback at 109.32 per dollar. Central bankers around the world have turned more cautious as inflation and world trade concerns cloud the global economy.      On Thursday, the Bank of England held rates steady and New Zealand’s Reserve Bank said the official cash rate will remain at 1.75 percent for “some time.” That leaves the Fed as the only major central bank committed to rate increases, but Thursday’s moderate inflation reading cast doubt over the pace of any hikes.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR were  little changed in price to yield 2.9695 percent. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 for June delivery settled down $1.60 at $1,320.70 per ounce.

2018-05-11,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration will scale back the use of biofuels waivers for small refineries and count ethanol exports toward federal biofuels usage quotas as part of a broad overhaul of the nation’s renewable fuel policy, a source briefed on the plans said on Friday. The changes are aimed at easing tensions between the oil and corn industries, rivals that have been clashing for months over the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard - a law that requires refiners to add increasing amounts of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline and diesel. While the RFS has helped farmers by creating a 15 billion gallon a year market for corn-based ethanol, oil refiners have increasingly complained that complying with the law costs them a fortune and threatens the very blue-collar jobs President Donald Trump has promised to protect. After hosting several meetings between representatives of the corn and refining industries, the administration is in the “last stages” of formally proposing changes to the biofuels law intended to appease both sides, the source said on Friday. A White House announcement is imminent, the source said, but did not have a timetable. The changes would be subject to the federal rule-making process, added the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The biofuels changes include cutting back on the number of waivers that the Environmental Protection Agency can provide to small refiners to free them from the regulation, and to ensure that any waived obligations are redistributed to other refiners. The EPA is required by the RFS to provide such waivers to refineries of less than 75,000 barrels per day in capacity that can prove that complying with the RFS would cause them “disproportionate economic hardship”, but the agency has broad discretion over assessing the applications. In recent months, the EPA has granted more than two dozen such waivers in an effort to help the refining industry cope with the RFS - about triple the typical level under past administrations - angering the corn lobby, which argued the exemptions are reducing overall demand for ethanol. Reuters has reported that the recent EPA waivers have gone to refineries belonging to companies like the large and highly-profitable Andeavor ANDV.N and to CVR Energy (CVI.N), owned by billionaire Trump ally Carl Icahn. The source did not say by how much the waiver program would be reduced, but said that the administration was committed to ensuring that any waivers provided do not have the effect of reducing the amount of biofuels blended in a given year - something that would be accomplished by redistributing waived blending obligations to other refineries. Republican Senator Tom Barraso, who represents Wyoming, home to several smaller refineries, said he would “oppose any agreement that would make it more difficult for small refineries to obtain hardship relief in the future.” Another change will be to allow exports of biofuels like ethanol to count toward the annual biofuels volume mandates under the RFS - which could ease the burden on domestic refiners by reducing the amounts they would have to blend domestically.  Biofuels groups have strongly opposed the idea, saying it could spark trade tensions and goes against the RFS’ intent to increase domestic use of biofuels. Counting exports toward the annual volumes mandates would be achieved by allowing such shipments to qualify for tradable government-issued biofuels credits that must be turned in to EPA each year to prove compliance with the RFS. The Trump administration’s tweaks to the RFS would also include temporarily lifting restrictions on selling a certain kind of higher-ethanol blend gasoline in the summer, called E15, according to the source.  Trump has already publicly stated his support for such a move, which has been long sought by the corn lobby because it would theoretically expand the market for biofuels. Sales of E15 are currently banned in the summer over worries that it could increase smog - but the biofuels industry, and numerous scientific studies, show that E15 is little different from the currently approved blends in that regard.  The White House and EPA did not immediately respond to request for comment about the proposed changes to the RFS.

2018-05-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices fell in a see-saw session on Friday, retreating after early gains as it looked likely that U.S. allies would push to maintain a deal with Iran, which could keep that country’s crude exports on global markets. In another sign global supplies could rise further, data in the afternoon showed U.S. crude producers added 10 rigs in the latest week.  Crude prices remained just below multi-year highs, with Brent on track for a weekly 2.8 percent gain and U.S. crude a 1.2 percent weekly rise. “It’s the same witches brew of bullish stuff: Iran, Venezuela, the lack of alacrity by Saudi Arabia to bring more oil onto the market,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.  Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 35 cents at $77.12 a barrel, just below the $78-level hit on Thursday, its highest since November 2014. The benchmark contract remained lower in post-settlement trade.  U.S. light crude CLc1 was down 66 cents at $70.70, off a 3-1/2 year high of $71.89 it hit on Thursday.  The United States plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran, which pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, after President Donald Trump this week abandoned a 2015 deal that limited Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Many analysts expect oil prices to rise as Iran’s exports fall. Still, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday reiterated her support for the Iran nuclear deal and agreed with Trump that talks were needed to established how U.S. sanctions would affect companies operating in Iran.   U.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note it expects Iranian crude oil exports to start falling in the next few months. However, there were signs that other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will raise output to counter the Iran disruption. Jefferies said OPEC has the capacity “to replace the Iranian losses” but added: “Even if physical supply is held constant ... the market will still be faced with a precariously low level of spare capacity.” Outside OPEC, U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA reached another record high last week, hitting 10.7 million bpd which is up 27 percent since mid-2016. U.S. output is creeping closer to that of top producer Russia, which pumps about 11 million bpd. U.S. drillers added rigs for the sixth straight week, bringing the total rig count to 844, highest since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said.

2018-05-11,"PAHOA, Hawaii, May 11 (Reuters) - More than a week after the eruption of the Kilauea volcano, Hawaii residents felt tremors and earthquakes on Friday as molten rock flowed underground towards a rural area where more lava was expected to burst to the surface and threaten homes. Fifteen large cracks or fissures have so far opened on the eastern flank of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, destroying dozens of houses and forcing thousands from their homes on Hawaii’s Big Island. Fissure activity has paused but new lava outbreaks were expected in or around the hard-hit Leilani Estates area in the southeast Puna District, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Hilo, the Hawaii Volcano Observatory and local authorities said. Steaming ground cracks from volcanic activity, the first signs a fissure may open, closed roads in areas to the northeast and southwest of Leilani Estates, where scientists believe the next lava vents may appear. “I’ve been feeling earthquakes. Lots and lots of tremors,” said Cindy Conda, whose house lies just east of Leilani Estates where 27 homes have been torched by lava in the last eight days. Conda said that at a meeting Thursday night, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientist Steve Brantley told residents that lava that has lain dormant in the area since a 1955 eruption was being forced to the surface by Kilauea’s activity. “He said ‘That lava’s underneath your house,’” said Conda. “Really it’s worrying, we’ve been doing a lot of praying. There is not much else you can do.” The first steam-driven explosive eruptions on Kilauea in nearly a century may soon begin, dusting downwind communities with ash that is an eye and respiratory irritant, observatory scientists said. The national park around the summit was closed to visitors on Thursday, given the risk that the eruptions could launch refrigerator-sized “ballistic blocks” over half a mile and hurl pebble-sized projectiles for miles. Residents of Kona on the west coast of the island have complained of volcanic smog, or vog, from the large amounts of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants spewing from Kilauea. Hawaii’s governor warned that mass evacuations may be required in the lower Puna district as more fissures open. Kilauea’s eruption began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed in a cloud of ash, triggering a plunge in the lava lake inside the larger summit crater.

2018-05-11,"LISBON (Reuters) - Trading in the shares of utility company EDP-Energias de Portugal (EDP.LS) was suspended on Friday, as media reported that a Chinese group was set to make a takeover bid for the firm. A spokeswoman for Portugal’s market regulator CMVM said the shares were suspended pending an announcement about the company but would not provide more details or comment on media reports. The online edition of the Expresso newspaper said earlier that a Chinese consortium that includes EDP’s largest shareholder, China Three Gorges (CTG), was preparing a takeover bid for Portugal’s leading  company by assets. The Financial Times later quoted its sources as saying CTG was set to launch an all-cash offer for EDP. Expresso said the Portuguese government was unlikely to create obstacles to the potential takeover, but EDP would probably consider the offer hostile.  EDP had no immediate comment. The company has a stock market capitalization of around 11.4 billion euros ($13.6 billion). China Three Gorges holds a 23 percent stake and Chinese state company CNIC holds nearly 5 percent, meaning that the Chinese state owns just over 28 percent in EDP. A compulsory takeover offer is required if the stake exceeds 33 percent. The suspension of EDP shares, which also encompassed EDP’s wind power unit EDPR (EDPR.LS), was announced after the market close on Friday. EDP shares had closed 0.7 percent higher at 3.11 euros. Reports and rumors about EDP being an acquisition target of foreign companies have been circulating for months.  Last month, following a news report that French utility Engie (ENGIE.PA) was examining a possible bid, EDP denied the existence of any contact with Engie. There were reports last year that Spain’s Gas Natural GAS.MC was seeking a merger with EDP, but the company denied there were any talks at the time. China Three Gorges has continued to raise its stake in EDP since reports of Gas Natural’s interest. ($1 = 0.8368 euros) Reporting By Sergio Goncalves and Andrei Khalip.

2018-05-11,"(Adds quotes and details launching) By Gopal Sharma KATHMANDU, May 11 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday visited Nepal to launch building work with his counterpart K.P.Sharma Oli on the country’s biggest hydroelectric project, as New Delhi seeks to rebuild trust in the Himalayan republic, where China has made deep inroads. At a ceremony in Kathmandu, Modi and Oli pushed a button that opened the curtain on a plaque at the site of the 900 MW hydro-power project, formally marking the start of construction work there. The project, which is expected to cost $1.04 billion and is being built by state-run Indian firm Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) Limited, will be the single biggest foreign investment project in cash-strapped Nepal. India has an open border with Nepal and tens of thousands of Nepalis work in India. The two countries share close religious and cultural bonds. But India has been slow to implement projects despite ambitious plans, and it has also often been a target of Nepali politicians critical of what they see as meddling by their much bigger neighbour. China, on the other hand, is pouring aid and investment into Nepali hospitals, roads and hydroelectric plants. “As Nepal enters a new era of consolidating the gains of a democracy and achieving economic growth, India remains a steadfast partner,” Modi said on Twitter before his visit. Project officials say they are in the final stages of agreement with the State Bank of India for investment of about 36 billion rupees ($535 million) for the Arun 3 project, with the rest coming from SJVN. The project is moving forwards just as a Chinese proposal to build a 750 MW power plant in west Nepal has run into a roadblock. China’s Three Gorges International Corp is haggling for better terms, Nepali officials said. “The power plant will provide employment, economic and business opportunities to Nepal,” Modi told reporters. Last year Nepal cancelled the award of a 1,200 MW power project called Budhi Gandaki to a Chinese company. Ahead of Modi’s visit, Nepal’s Energy Minister Barsha Man Pun on Tuesday announced that the government would invite global bids for building the Budhi Gandaki project. Modi is visiting for the first time since protests for a greater say in government by ethnic Madhesis, in Nepal’s lowland south, led to the closure of the border for months in 2015 and 2016. The blockade choked off Nepal’s imports of fuel, medicine and construction material just as it was struggling to recover from the worst earthquake on record in which 9,000 people were killed. Many in Nepal saw India’s hand in the protests although India denied that. Guna Raj Luintel, editor of the Nagarik daily, said there was lingering anger towards India over the blockade. “Modi is under pressure to bring the Nepal ties back to normal and win the confidence of the Nepali people,” Luintel told Reuters. After arriving in Nepal, Modi offered prayers at a Hindu temple in the border town of Janakpur, which was a hub of the Madhesi protests in which more than 50 people were killed. He pledged 1 billion rupees for the development of Janakpur. “Nepal is ahead of all in our (policy of) neighbourhood first,” Modi said.

2018-05-11,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Dollar falls, poised to end flat for the week * Oil down but near multi-year highs on Iran concerns By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar eased on Friday while an index of world stock markets gained and was poised for its best week since early March, as moderate inflation eased worries over a faster pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and boosted risk appetite. The dollar fell for a third day against a basket of major currencies as traders booked recent gains tied to widening interest rate gaps in favor of the United States and signs of slower growth elsewhere in the world. Gold was set for its first weekly gain in four weeks after soft U.S. inflation data on Thursday suggested the Federal Reserve would show caution as it boosts interest rates. Oil prices slipped but remained near 3-1/2 year highs as the prospect of new U.S. sanctions against Iran tightened the outlook for Middle East supply at a time when global crude production is just keeping pace with rising demand. U.S. stocks gained as healthcare stocks led a rally ahead of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump on drug pricing. They were also propelled by results, with corporate earnings growth for the first quarter estimated at 26 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research. The advance was a delayed reaction to exceptionally strong earnings growth and benign inflation, said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York. The Cboe Volatility Index, a barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500 that often is referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has fallen to levels seen before the February market correction, Grohowski said. “Not only has the market returned handsomely, but risk has also taken a breather,” he said. MSCI’s gauge of stock markets across the globe gained 0.36 percent. European shares edged higher, with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index of companies in 17 countries, rising 0.11 percent for a seventh straight week of gains and the largest string of weekly advances since March 2015. Shares in Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) rose 1.3 percent, having jumped as much as 9.4 percent, after U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake Management Co agreed to buy ZPG , the owner of British property websites Zoopla and PrimeLocation, for $3 billion. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.36 points, or 0.1 percent, to 24,764.89. The S&P 500 lost 0.84 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,722.23 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 7,388.54. U.S. plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran, which pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, has buoyed crude prices. U.S. crude fell 37 cents to $70.99 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.30, down 17 cents on the day. The dollar index fell 0.23 percent, with the euro up 0.38 percent to $1.1958. The Japanese yen firmed 0.16 percent versus the greenback at 109.24 per dollar. Central bankers around the world appear to have become more cautious as concerns over inflation and international trade cloud the global economy. On Thursday, the Bank of England held rates against recent expectations and New Zealand’s Reserve Bank said the official cash rate will remain at 1.75 percent for “some time to come.” This leaves the Fed as the only major central bank committed to rate hikes, but Thursday’s moderate inflation reading cast doubt over the pace of these hikes.

2018-05-11,"SOLAI, Kenya (Reuters) - A dam on a Kenyan commercial farm that burst this week, killing at least 45 people, was built illegally, the water resource regulator said on Friday, as police opened an initial investigation into the disaster. The minister in charge of water also ordered other dams on the property to be drained immediately. The earthen dam on the farm, which grew roses for export to Europe, burst on Wednesday night after heavy rains, sending a wall of water roaring down a hillside and obliterating everything in its path. Another 40 people are reported missing.  The disaster is likely to put a spotlight on the regulation of Kenya’s cut-flower industry, which has grown dramatically in the last two decades to become one of its biggest foreign exchange earners and a major source of jobs. One in three of all roses sold in Europe comes from Kenya and more than 100,000 people work in flower farms, many of which lie in the fertile Rift Valley. Elizabeth Luvonga, a spokeswoman for the Water Resources Management Authority, which oversees private dams, said other reservoirs on Patel’s Farm in Solai, 190 km (120 miles) northwest of Nairobi, also lacked the necessary documents and were illegal. Water and Sanitation Minister Simon Chelugui said the burst dam and others on the property did not meet regulations, and that the Water Resources Authority had been pursuing the owner to make them compliant. He ordered all the others to be drained as a precaution. Chelugui added that a team would inspect dams countrywide. Vinoj Jayakumar, general manager of the 3,500-acre farm, blamed the collapse on torrential rain and denied that the dam had been defective or lacked the necessary approvals. “How can they say it is illegal?” he told Reuters. “It was not built today or yesterday. It was built 20 years back.” Amid domestic reports that the dam had not passed government engineering checks, the chief prosecutor ordered police to open an immediate investigation and report back within a fortnight. Sacks of rice arrived on lorries on Friday to provide for hundreds of families whose livelihoods had been swept away. In the village health center, distraught doctor Veronica Achoka recounted the suffering of the community. “Yesterday was rescue and evacuation all day. The water swept people 10 km downhill. Many bodies were found that far away. There’s so much property destruction,” she said. At the hospital in the nearby town of Bahati, dozens were being treated for injuries ranging from fractures to internal bleeding, she said. Further away in the provincial town of Nakuru, Isaac Mwaniki had to identify his wife at the mortuary. “I think the water’s force and soil is what got her,” he said. Rescuers managed to save his daughter after the water subsided. “She had hung onto a tree and was tired but, thank God, she is okay,” Mwaniki said. After a severe drought last year, two months of heavy rain have affected nearly a million people in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda. Bridges have been swept away and roads turned into rivers of mud. More than 150 people have been killed and 300,000 displaced in Kenya, where the damage runs into millions of dollars. “We all breathed a sigh of relief when the rainy season started strong in early March,” said Lane Bunkers of Catholic Relief Services. “But now - two months later - we are seeing the consequences of the drought-ravaged land’s inability to absorb all the rain.” Reporting by Duncan Miriri, Humphrey Malalo, Jackson Njehia and Maggie Fick; Writing by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Ed Cropley and Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kenya-floods/update-3-burst-dam-at-kenyan-rose-farm-lacked-permits-police-investigate-idUKL8N1SI26B,11 May 2018,"* Rescue workers sift through river of mud

2018-05-11,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The chief of inspections at the U.N. nuclear watchdog has resigned suddenly, the agency said on Friday without giving a reason. The departure of Tero Varjoranta comes at a sensitive time, three days after the United States announced it was quitting world powers’ nuclear accord with Iran, raising questions as to whether Tehran will continue to comply with it. Varjoranta, a Finn, had been a deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency and head of its Department of Safeguards, which verifies countries’ compliance with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, since October 2013. He will be replaced in an acting capacity by the head of the department’s Iran team, the Vienna-based IAEA said. “Mr Tero Varjoranta has resigned effective 11 May 2018,” an IAEA spokesman said. “The director general has appointed Mr Massimo Aparo, acting director, Office for Verification in Iran, as acting deputy director general and head of the Department of Safeguards, effective immediately.” The accord signed by Iran and major powers in 2015 imposed strict limits on Iran’s atomic activities to help ensure they are not put to developing nuclear bombs in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions against Tehran.  The IAEA is policing those restrictions and said on Wednesday, the day after Trump’s announcement, that Iran was still implementing its commitments under the deal. The U.N. watchdog has also repeatedly defended the landmark agreement, saying it is a gain for nuclear verification.  “The agency’s safeguards activities will continue to be carried out in a highly professional manner,” the spokesman said. Asked why Varjoranta had resigned, he said: “The agency cannot comment on personnel matters, which are confidential.” IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano plans to appoint a permanent replacement as soon as possible, he added.

2018-05-11,"(Adds details from new interview, retops with NAFTA) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Friday proposed changes to automotive rules by the U.S. government may prompt the Italian-American automaker to shift exports of the company’s Mexican-made vehicles. Marchionne told Reuters that changes planned for automotive rules under the North American Free Trade Agreement by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump were “directionally” correct but “we’re not done.” The revised agreement would not threaten the automaker’s Mexican production, he said. “I think we have to redirect the Mexican production to a global market,” Marchionne said. “I think there are things we can do but it’s part of a longer-term plan.” Ahead of an industry meeting with Trump and 10 major automakers, Marchionne said he supported White House efforts to revise vehicle fuel-efficiency rules to account for a shift in buying habits towards larger vehicles, and hoped for an “agreed way forward.” EPA chief Scott Pruitt has said standards on model year 2022 to 2025 vehicles should be revised, reversing a decision on tighter standards by the Obama administration in January 2017. But environmental and health advocates say emissions standards should remain stricter, citing the risks to health, the environment and climate from looser emissions regulations. Seventeen U.S. states have mounted a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to revise emission and fuel-efficiency rules. Marchionne was “fully supportive” of Trump’s efforts “to try to get this reexamined in view of the changing circumstances,” he said in one of two brief interviews. He said he still hoped the administration could reach a deal with California to maintain nationwide emissions standards. Trump is “probably the most consummate deal maker I’ve seen in a long, long time,” said Marchionne, while characterizing the Obama administration’s effort to “short-circuit” a review of whether standards through 2025 were appropriate as “improper.” He said the industry would continue to improve vehicle efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how the rules change. “We shouldn’t become, sort of, poster children of a cause here,” Marchionne said.

2018-05-11,"PALANGA, Lithuania, May 11 (Reuters) - Germany has proposed setting up some sort of consortium to ensure that Ukraine retains its role as a transit country for Russian gas once the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is operational. German foreign minister Heiko Maas made the proposal, without giving details, during a meeting on Friday with his counterparts from Baltic countries, which oppose the pipeline. Germany has backed Nord Stream 2, which will run from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea, but Chancellor Angela Merkel said last month that the project cannot go ahead without clarity on Ukraine’s role as a transit route for gas. “We are making intensive efforts to allow the transit of gas through Ukraine in the future,” Maas said after meeting the foreign ministers of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in Lithuania. “We are considering setting up a consortium to ensure that that is the case,” he said, but did not elaborate. An initiative of Russia’s Gazprom and five European companies, the new pipeline on the Baltic seabed would double Russia’s export capacity to Germany. Baltic states fear the pipeline could increase reliance on Russian gas and undermine Ukraine’s role as a gas transit route, which provides valuable revenues to the country that saw its Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia. “It is very important that no such project would give any (gas) supplier greater leverage over European Union policies,” Estonia’s Foreign Affairs Minister Sven Mikser, said. Maas’s comments will do little to assuage public concerns in the three Baltic countries, once ruled by their giant eastern neighbour but now part of the European Union and NATO. “We consider this project very much out of line with the EU’s energy policy and quite detrimental to Ukraine,” said Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Linkevicius. “We believe it is not a purely economical project, it has a political dimension.” Poland also opposes the pipeline, which would cost Kiev valuable transit income and could make it easier for Russia to cut supplies to in-between countries without inconveniencing Germany, its biggest customer. This week, Poland’s anti-monopoly office launched proceedings against the developers of Nord Stream 2, saying the project raised competition concerns. Maas ruled out any increase in his country’s military involvement in the Baltic region, where Germany leads a deployment of about 1,000 NATO troops, one of four such battle groups designed to deter Russia from meddling in the region. “For the time being, it will not be possible for us to enhance troop numbers here,” he said.

The United States plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran after abandoning a deal reached in late 2015 that limited Tehran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for the removal of U.S. and European sanctions. Pertamina said in March that it had won the tender to operate Iran’s Mansouri field with 80 percent participating interest. On Friday Alam said that Pertamina would not be able to continue with the contract if there were sanctions from the United States or any other country, adding that sanctions could also create financing problems because the company might seek loans from U.S. banks. “Our position is to put it on hold because of the sanctions threat,” Alam said, adding that a final decision will be made on Saturday. He also said the company is reviewing its plan to import oil and gas from Iran.

2018-05-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers are barrelling into the energy sector by making broad bets on anything connected with oil, finally convinced that gains in crude prices - on track for their fourth consecutive quarterly gain, the longest such stretch for more than 10 years - are more than a mirage.  Ever since oil prices slid in late 2014 after rallying above $115 a barrel, U.S. mutual fund managers have largely stayed underweight the sector, convinced that advances in fracking technology would allow U.S. production to ramp up at any moment and keep a lid on prices.  Yet with oil futures hitting 3-1/2-year highs on Thursday, up approximately 75 percent from this time last year after top exporter Saudi Arabia and No.1 producer Russia led efforts since 2017 to cap output, some U.S. fund managers are convinced that high oil prices are finally here to stay.  Fund managers from Westwood, Hotchkiss and Wiley, and Hodges Capital are among those who say they are making broad bets on anything oil. They say that oil prices will not dip back down quickly because global demand is rising at a time when energy companies are showing less inclination to take on debt to fuel production and have tightened operations. “Oil companies are so much more efficient then they were even a year ago and much more disciplined. I think that you can finally say that this is the real deal,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital.  At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday raises geopolitical risks, giving oil another leg higher, fund managers said.  U.S. crude CLc1 hit $71.89 per barrel on Thursday, its highest since November 2014. A Reuters poll at the end of April forecast that oil would average $63.23 in 2018. [nL8N1S465A] Bradshaw expects crude oil prices to stay at roughly between $65 and $70 for the remainder of the year, boosting the earnings of companies such as Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O). Still, Bradshaw does not see them spiking high enough to significantly cut into consumer spending or the broader economy, although they may crimp the spending power for the most price-sensitive customers, he said, which could eat into the revenues of value chains like Dollar General Corp (DG.N). The dramatic comeback in oil prices, which have jumped nearly 17 percent for the year to date, has helped the S&P 500 Energy sector .SPNY jump 5.4 percent over the same time. The broad S&P 500 .SPX as a whole, by comparison, is up less than 1 percent since the start of the year.  That, in turn, is prodding fund managers back into the sector they had largely shunned.  Nine months ago, global funds were underweight energy stocks by 12 percent on average, the largest collective underweight since 2016, according to a September report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  In April, by comparison, equity allocations to commodities and energy stocks hit eight-year highs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted.  “We’ve already had some of the catch-up trade, but we still have a long way to go,” said Bill Costello, a senior portfolio manager at Dallas-based Westwood, who has been adding to his positions in energy companies such as Callon Petroleum Co (CPE.N) and SRC Energy Inc (SRCI.A) While energy stocks have rallied, shares are still trading at levels that suggest that oil will remain between $55 and $58 a barrel for the remainder of the year, Costello said.  “If people believed in $70 a barrel plus for the next 18 months, they would be foolish to be underweight now,” Costello said, adding that he expects more money to flow into the sector as fund managers sell utilities and telecom stocks that are getting hurt by rising interest rates.  The stretched valuations of the S&P 500, which is about 7 percent below the record high it hit in January, should provide another support for energy stocks, said Stan Majcher of the Hotchkis & Wiley Mid Cap Value Fund.  “We look at it and say the overall market is close to expensive and this is one area which is under-owned and viewed in the last few years as a risky place,” he said.  Signs of declining production by OPEC countries such as Venezuela and bottlenecks that could slow production in the Permian Basin in the U.S. could push oil prices well above $70 by the end of the year, leaving fund managers flatfooted, Majcher said.  “We think that the biggest risk is not preparing for higher oil prices,” he said.

2018-05-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Petrofac Ltd has hired investment banks Barclays and HSBC to help with the sale of its oil fields in Mexico, as it prepares to scale back its oil and gas production operations, several banking sources said. Petrofac (PFC.L), which designs, builds, operates and maintains oil and gas facilities, expanded into oil and gas production projects during the oil price boom earlier this decade. The strategy didn’t last and last year the company warned that the integrated energy services (IES) division would have lower than expected profits, hit by weaker oil prices, lower capital investment by clients in Mexico, and a delayed entry into the Greater Stella Area in the North Sea. The company is now looking to refocus on core activities such as onshore engineering and construction.  Petrofac, Barclays (BARC.L) and HSBC declined to comment.  Petrofac, the subject of a Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigation in Britain in connection with a probe into Monaco-based Unaoil on suspected bribery, might also consider selling its Greater Stella assets in the UK North Sea, the sources said.  One of the sources said that Ithaca Energy, a company owned by Israeli Delek Group, would consider making an offer for these assets, because it already holds a 54.66 working interesting in the Greater Stella Area.  Ithaca Energy was not available to comment. Its parent company, Israel-based Delek Group (DLEKG.TA) did not reply to a request for comment.  In early 2012, Petrofac became the first foreign company for more than 70 years to operate state oil fields in Mexico, when it was awarded two integrated services contracts by Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), Mexico’s National Oil Company. Petrofac’s net debt was about $600 million (442.3 million pounds) at the end of 2017, below the $850 million it forecast. It reported a net loss of $29 million for the year. Oilfield service companies had been hurt by weak demand as recent subdued oil prices forced explorers and producers to cut capital expenditure and defer or cancel contracts. Alongside oil producers, companies that drill wells, haul water and provide other services to energy exploration firms had been hit by a slump in oil prices, with benchmark Brent tumbling to about $27 a barrel in 2016 from more than $100 in 2014. It is now trading at $77. In recent months, oil firms have returned to profits due to higher oil prices and the benefits of deep cost cuts they made during the downturn. But their suppliers are still feeling the squeeze and trying to cope with low profitability. This has led to a wave of consolidation in the sector,  with the merger of France’s Technip (TNHPF.PK) and U.S. rival FMC Technologies and the acquisition of Baker Hughes by GE’s (BHGE.N) oil and gas equipment and services operations.

2018-05-11,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Military transport planes from the United Arab Emirates landed on the sleepy Yemeni island of Socotra last week, unloading tanks and troops as part of the Gulf Arab state’s drive to extend its influence over a strategic waterway flanked by war zones. The UAE, with a population of less than 10 million but the Arab world’s second-largest economy thanks to oil, is deploying its soldiers and cash to create a web of bases and armed allies in Yemen and Somalia as a bulwark against Islamist extremists and Iranian influence, according to diplomats as well as Yemeni and Somali officials. But backing groups at loggerheads with their national governments threatens to bog down the UAE in the seemingly endless conflicts of two of the world’s poorest countries.  Lying between the Arabian Peninsula and Horn of Africa, Socotra island, best known for its otherworldly plant life, appeared far from the war until the UAE troops arrived, in a landing reported by Yemeni officials and media. The Yemeni government accused the UAE of seizing the island’s ports and airport. A government source told Reuters that the UAE move was a power-play for “commercial and security interests” and accused the UAE of trying to colonise Yemen. “They won’t get that from Yemen,” the source said. “Yes, Yemenis are poor but they fight for their sovereignty,”  The UAE foreign ministry, in a statement on Socotra, said it backed Yemen’s legitimate government and sought “to establish peace and stability and to support developmental projects for the island’s residents”.  The UAE has built up local army units in Yemen, increasing its influence along the Red Sea coast, but also opening up a rift with the country’s exiled government. Across the Bab al-Mandeb strait, through which much of the world’s oil flows, the UAE also has a foothold in northern Somalia, where Emirati firms have set up commercial ports and its troops conduct military and training missions. Abu Dhabi, political capital of the seven-emirate federation, is moving assertively against the threat it sees from Islamist groups such as al Qaeda, while promoting itself as  a stable, open and largely tolerant Muslim country. It has allied itself with Saudi Arabia in the war against the Houthi group in Yemen, and with three Arab powers in a boycott of Qatar, accusing it of backing terrorism.  The UAE has hired senior foreign military officers to modernize its army, including Australia’s former top special forces general, Mike Hindmarsh, who reports to Abu Dhabi’s powerful Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Hindmarsh oversees the Presidential Guard, the unit tasked with directing the UAE’s campaign in Yemen.   “They are taking the fight to the enemy around the region,” said a Western diplomat. A Gulf source spelled out the UAE approach, saying it was protecting its interests in the region and promoting development to deter recruitment by Islamist groups. “The UAE is helping to develop economically viable zones that create jobs and improve standards of living while also providing humanitarian and financial aid.” “There is a comprehensive Emirati approach to fostering long-term stability in the region,” the source said. A monument of leaning pillars in Abu Dhabi shows the cost of this engagement: inscribed with soldiers’ names, the memorial pays tribute to the UAE’s “martyrs”. The vast majority - more than 100 - fell in the three-year-old war the UAE is fighting in Yemen alongside Saudi Arabia against the Iranian-aligned Houthis. Saudi Arabia’s main ally in the conflict, Yemen’s heavily Islamist government, is struggling against the Houthis, who control the north of the country and the capital, Sanaa. The UAE, which has made the only visible gains by the coalition along the southwestern coast, has adopted a different strategy and cultivated its own friends in the war. Across a string of small bases from the volcanic island of Perim at the mouth of the Red Sea to the dunes of Rumah near the Omani border, the UAE pays salaries and trains troops. At the beginning of the Yemen war, the UAE prised from Iran’s orbit a struggling secessionist movement which hopes to revive the former state of South Yemen. The socialist movement’s leaders left Yemen after the north and south were unified in 1994, and wound up in Hezbollah’s south Beirut stronghold, from where they ran a low-level insurgency in Yemen, diplomatic and southern political sources said. Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials and Hezbollah schooled the southern commanders in guerrilla tactics in hopes of destabilising Saudi Arabia’s southern flank, the sources said. But when the Houthis advanced into southern Yemen in 2015, promises of assistance from the UAE convinced the southern leadership to move to Abu Dhabi from where they could carry on the fight for their Yemeni homeland. “They want to fight Iranian militias trying to seize our lands, and we do too. This is enough for the alliance to make sense for now,” one southern official told Reuters. This alliance helped the UAE to seize the southern port of Aden in 2015. The UAE trained southern Yemeni forces who captured the other main port, Mukalla, from al Qaeda.  Mukalla airport, closed to commercial flights, now hosts Emirati helicopters, a training centre, detention facility and also a small contingent of U.S. special forces helping to fight al Qaeda in nearby mountains. Iran’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any involvement with the southern Yemeni secessionists. Hezbollah also declined to comment.   SOMALIA TUG-OF-WAR Raids by Somali pirates on trade routes along the Horn of Africa helped draw the UAE, home to the Middle East’s busiest port, into the tangled politics of Somalia, which has grappled for over a decade with al Qaeda-linked Shabaab militants. The UAE is deepening ties with the semi-autonomous regions of Somaliland and Puntland after state-owned Emirati firms DP World and P&O Ports signed deals there in 2016 and 2017. UAE troops quickly followed, and have begun building a military base in Berbera, Somaliland, the region’s President Muse Bihi Abdi told Reuters while on a visit to Abu Dhabi. “It will be the guarantee for our security, for our development in any case of terrorism ... They have the resources and knowledge better than us. We are a nation after a war, rebuilding,” he said. The relationship - which includes investing hundreds of millions of dollars in Somaliland for projects such as a highway to Ethiopia and new airport - has angered the central government in Somalia, and the UAE has ended its military training mission in Mogadishu. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told Reuters that support for the regions was not intended to split Somalia and his country had no quarrel with the central government. “Our policy of recognising a one-Somalia stands ... But at the same time we are able to support the people of Somaliland through humanitarian, developmental [projects].”  The president of Puntland, Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, told Reuters in Dubai that UAE personnel were training local forces to combat piracy as well as Islamist groups in Yemen or Somalia. He denied that the UAE sought a long-term colonial presence. “They are not occupying as a military force in Somalia,” he said. “It’s impossible. We are fierce fighters, we will never allow that to happen.” (This version of the story corrects place name in paragraph 22 to Rumah).

2018-05-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - European oil companies are not ruling out reducing Iranian oil imports after the threat of new U.S. sanctions, with some expecting banking issues to hinder trade, but there was no rush to immediately cut volumes. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States was exiting an international nuclear deal with Iran and would impose new sanctions that seek to reduce oil exports from OPEC’s third-largest producer. But as of Friday, companies in Europe said they were still taking Iranian oil. Iran pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil and exports about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to Europe, according to tanker-tracking data.  “At this moment, our trading activity is business as usual,” said Marta Llorente, a spokeswoman for Spanish oil company Cepsa, one of Iran’s customers in Europe. “We strictly conform with European Union and international laws and regulations, and scrupulously respect any trade restriction that could occur from any potential international sanctions or embargo.” Another European buyer, Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), said it is buying 2 million barrels a month of Iranian crude as part of a contract running to year-end, adding any new sanctions would take six months to kick in. The U.S. sanctions have a 180-day period during which buyers should “wind down” oil purchases, meaning any loss of supply will not be immediately felt - and companies don’t have to rush to find alternatives. But Greece’s biggest oil refiner Hellenic (HEPr.AT), which was the first European company to agree to buy crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) after sanctions on Iran were lifted in January 2016, rang a cautious note:     “We are closely monitoring developments following (the) U.S. administration decision ... and will assess our position and commercial arrangements accordingly,” Hellenic said. “In any case we will make sure that we comply with the applicable international regulatory framework and, given our crude supply flexibility and diversification, we do not expect any significant effect on our operations.” The bulk of Iran’s crude exports, about 1.8 million bpd, go to Asia. A decline in volumes due to the sanctions will add to upward pressure on oil prices, which have gained this year because of an OPEC-led supply cutting deal and strong global demand. Crude has topped $78 a barrel LCOc1, the highest since 2014, following Trump’s sanctions announcement.    Market participants said there were still many unanswered questions about how the United States might impact European companies.  “We’re doing nothing,” said the head of trading at another  European refiner. “It’s wait and see. If we’re forced to reduce, we will. Iranian is not the only crude.” Sources at global trading companies predicted an imminent drop in Iranian exports due to banking issues, such as availability of trade finance. A source at a trading company buying Iranian oil said it hoped to keep buying at least during the six-month “wind down” period before new sanctions take effect, but expected banking issues to put a stop to trade.  “It looks like you can still go on for six months,” the source, who declined to be identified, said. “The key is banks. If banks stop us, we might stop.” A senior trader with another company said he expected banking to pose a major problem to Iranian oil trade and a third said even if waivers are granted, volumes would still decline. “Waivers seem a sensible course of action,” the third source said, referring to potential exemptions from the latest U.S. sanctions. “But you need to reduce your volume take over the grace period of 180 days to be favourably treated in the waiver discussion. You can’t just stay at current levels until then and get a waiver.”     Additional reporting by Angeliki Koutantou, Bate Felix and Shadia Nasralla, writing and additional reporting by Alex Lawler; editing by Jane Merriman and Louise Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-oil/update-1-irans-oil-customers-in-europe-might-reduce-imports-flag-financing-issue-idUKL8N1SI3W7,11 May 2018,"* Sources at other companies see banking as likely snag

The incident occurred in February at a facility handling special nuclear materials, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said. It said it will prosecute over the incident under the Health and Safety at Work Act. “For legal reasons we are unable to comment further on the details of the case which is now the subject of active court proceedings,” the ONR said in a statement.

Sellafield was once the site of the world’s first major nuclear plant. In 1957 it saw Britain’s worst ever nuclear accident when a fire led to a radioactive leak. Another radioactive leak in 2005 prompted a fine of 500,000 pounds ($678,000) for its operator. The plant is currently going through a massive decommissioning program, which includes dismantling infrastructure and decontaminating nuclear waste.

2018-05-11,"SINGAPORE, May 11 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s trip to Singapore for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump poses logistical challenges that are likely to include using Soviet-era aircraft to carry him and his limousine, as well as dozens of security and other support staff. The choice of Singapore as the site of the first-ever meeting of a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader was as much because it was within reasonable flight time and distance from Pyongyang as because of the island state’s political neutrality, a South Korean presidential official told reporters. Since becoming North Korea’s leader in 2011, Kim has only taken one known overseas trip by air – and that was earlier this week to Dalian in China to hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He flew in his personal Ilyushin-62M jet accompanied by a cargo plane that people with knowledge of North Korean affairs say is believed to have carried his limousine. “It looks very much like the trip to Dalian was a dry run,” said Andray Abrahamian, a research fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS and formerly with Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group that trains North Koreans in business skills. At 4,700 km from Pyongyang’s Sunan airport, Singapore is easily in the range of the Il-62M aircraft. The Soviet-era narrow-body jet with four engines was first introduced in the 1970s and has a maximum range of 10,000 km. But the Ilyushin-76 cargo plane cannot fly more than 3,000 km without refuelling if carrying a full load. It will therefore have to stop off at a friendly location like Vietnam’s capital on the way to Singapore or fly with a reduced load. The Il-76, originally designed for moving heavy machinery to remote parts of the Soviet Union, is big enough to fit a school bus or two shipping containers inside it, according to passenger and cargo flight operator Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions. But the cargo plane has had some safety issues. In the latest incident last month, a crash killed 257 people on board after takeoff from an Algiers air base. Unlike his father Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011 and who travelled by armoured train on his rare trips abroad because he feared being shot down, according to a North Korean defector familiar with his security details, the younger leader is not known to be averse to flying. But air travel of this distance does pose a significantly greater challenge in transporting communication and security equipment and personnel needed to back up a summit meeting. Lee Yun-keok, a defector who had worked for the North’s government and now heads the North Korea Strategic Information Service Center in Seoul, said the trip will involve dozens of security personnel and equipment including possibly a personal toilet for the leader. It will also mean burning a large quantity of jet fuel, a refined oil product sharply limited by U.N. sanctions targeting North Korea’ imports. Kim’s two planes will need around 50 metric tons of jet fuel per aircraft for the flight from Pyongyang to Singapore. China, the main source of fuel for the North, exported just 3 tons of jet fuel in March and made no official exports the two previous months, according to Chinese customs data. But the North’s planes can pick up extra fuel when they fly to China and Russia for commercial operations, and international security experts believe the North may have been stockpiling the fuel which it has also used for its missile programme. “The United States had preferred Geneva,” the South Korean presidential official told reporters, requesting anonymity to discuss the arrangements for the summit meeting. “But Singapore was selected as it was the most realistically viable destination Kim Jong Un could probably travel when considering the travel time and flight distance.” The two sides initially considered meeting in the Panmunjom truce village straddling the Korean military border, the scene of the third inter-Korea summit attended by Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month, the official said. The official said the South did not know the reason why Panmunjom was dropped. There was no confirmation on the specific location for the meeting between Kim and Trump although there are a number of sites in Singapore that can guarantee security protection, including hotels that have experience hosting high-security events, Singapore media and a Singapore government official said. The meeting is scheduled for one day on June 12, but if either or both of the leaders decide to stay overnight, there is only one hotel room in all of the city that meets “security protocol” for the U.S. president, according to a source with knowledge of previous U.S. presidential visits. That is the 348-square meter Shangri-la Suite in the Valley Wing of the hotel of the same name, at a current rate of S$10,000 ($7,500) a night for June 12.

2018-05-11,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * World stocks up 0.3 percent on the day * Dollar index falls to 1-week low * Oil prices ease from multi-year highs * South European government debt in demand By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Shares rose worldwide on Friday, getting a boost from soft U.S. inflation numbers that helped soothe worries of faster Fed monetary tightening and pushed the dollar to its lowest for a week. The MSCI All Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up nearly 0.4 percent and was set for its strongest week since March 9. The dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies, erasing this week’s gains in the wake of inflation data released on Thursday. Oil prices steadied near 3-1/2-year highs as the prospect of new U.S. sanctions on Iran tightened the outlook for Middle East supply at a time when global crude production is only just keeping pace with rising demand. The inflation numbers followed employment data last week that pointed to sluggish wage growth. While the rally in stocks seemed to point to investor relief, analysts were split over whether the slowdown in inflation could lower the chances of the Fed increasing the number of rate hikes it has suggested will take place this year. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ President James Bullard will make a speech on Friday, as will European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. ADS Securities head of research Konstantinos Anthis said the case for two or three further U.S. rate hikes might be decided after the summer. Fed funds futures show a 93-percent chance of one next month. “The data from the U.S. for the past few months has been supportive so if this trend is to continue there’s plenty of time for the Fed to witness stronger performance again and grow more aggressive,” Anthis said. The inflation data also flattened the U.S. Treasury yield curve further, with the gap between 5-year and 30-year bonds at its narrowest since 2007. Investors also bought southern European government bonds, taking advantage of a rise in yields on the back of Italian political concerns. Italian, Spanish and Portuguese 10-year borrowing costs fell 2-3 basis points (bps), outpacing better-rated peers at the end of a week in which the increasing likelihood of an anti-establishment coalition taking power in Italy had hurt the euro zone’s lower-rated debt. Italian 10-year yields were set for their biggest weekly rise since February. European stocks, meanwhile, were set to seal their longest winning streak for more than three years as M&A activity stole the spotlight from the tail-end of a robust earnings season. The pan-European STOXX 600 was flat, but set for its seventh straight week of gains - its longest winning streak since March 2015. Germany’s DAX was down 0.3 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent. Wall Street was futures indicated a positive start to the session. Asian markets were cheered by a further easing in tensions on the Korean Peninsula, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12 for talks on Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan . rose 0.7 percent to near three-week highs while Japan’s Nikkei climbed 1.2 percent. With the situation around North Korea off the boil for now, political concerns are focused elsewhere as the United States and China continue skirmishing over trade and as tensions rise in the Middle East. “Trump still needs President Xi (Jinping) and China’s support in dealing with North Korea and this will be his priority in the short term,” JPMorgan economists wrote in a note to clients. “Once the meeting is finished, trade may return to the fore.” U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Washington for a second round of trade talks next week, after apparently making little progress in discussions in Beijing this month. In currency markets, the pound traded at $1.3573, rising half a percent above a four-month low of $1.3457 touched on Thursday after the Bank of England held interest rates. In commodities markets, spot gold rose 0.3 percent to $1,324.66 an ounce. U.S. crude futures were up 0.2 percent at $71.46 a barrel. Brent crude futures fell 0.1 percent to $77.41 a barrel.

2018-05-11,"* Four investors in discussion for up to $2.7 bln refinery * Sri Lanka needs to upgade from 50-year-old, 50,000 bpd refinery * China, India also in discussion on other refinery proposals By Shihar Aneez COLOMBO, May 11 (Reuters) - Chinese, Middle East and Russian companies are in “preliminary discussions” to build an up to $2.7 billion, 100,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery for Sri Lanka’s state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), the head of the fuel retailer said on Friday. Sri Lanka has a single, nearly-fifty-year-old 50,000 bpd oil refinery in Colombo suburb Sapugaskanda, built originally to refine Iranian light crude. However, when toughened sanctions were imposed on Tehran in 2012 to curb its nuclear ambitions, CPC was forced to look for other light crudes. CPC Chairman Dammika Ranatunga said the state-owned fuel retailer is looking for a partner to build a state-of-the-art 100,000 bpd refinery on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. “It is going to cost anything between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion,” Ranatunga told Reuters in an interview. A Chinese firm, two Middle Eastern companies, and a Russian company have all expressed interest to invest in the new refinery. Ranatunga declined to name the potential investors, but said the discussions are in a “preliminary stage”. Ranatunga said a 100,000 bpd refinery could knock $500 million a year off of Sri Lanka’s import bill for refined fuels. The country spent $3.43 billion on fuel imports in 2017. Investors would have the option of building a refinery with a capacity greater than 100,00 bpd and exporting any excess refined fuels, he said. Sri Lanka had earlier planned to upgrade its sole refinery, which accounts for 30 percent of the country’s fuel requirement, and double its capacity to boost output and reduce the cost of importing refined fuels. “Upgrading the refinery may not be the solution. It is important for us to refine all types of crude ... That is the way we can get crude at a competitive price,” Ranatunga. Russia’s energy ministry said in March its officials have discussed an oil refinery project in Sri Lanka. Two Chinese companies have jointly bid for a separate 100,000 bpd refinery with an annual output of around 5 million tonnes a year, or 100,000 bpd, in the southern town of Hambantota, near an important shipping route, where China controls a sea port and plans an industrial zone. Sri Lanka is still in discussion on the Hambantota refinery, although the government has blocked a proposal by the Chinese companies bidding on the refinery there to sell fuel locally. Sri Lanka has also discussed another 100,000 bpd refinery in partnership with Indian Oil Corp, but there has been on progress on that plan.

2018-05-11,"LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - The dollar’s rise hit emerging market funds hard in the past week, with equities and bonds suffering outflows of $3.7 billion, the largest since December 2016, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday. The bank’s data, which tracks fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, showed some buying interest return to global equities, where funds took in $3.6 billion after shedding money the previous week. U.S. equity vehicles received $4.8 billion. But that was partly offset by the $1.6 billion outflow from emerging equities, the most since August 2017, as the dollar’s rise to four-month highs and expectations of more increases to U.S. interest rates caused money to leave the developing world. Emerging stocks have fallen almost 10 percent since the end of January, while sovereign dollar bonds’ average yield premium over Treasuries has risen by 70 basis points. . “EM cracks,” BAML analysts wrote. “Three percent U.S. Treasury yields, $70 per barrel oil and a rising U.S. dollar (equates to) tighter global financial conditions and deleveraging in high beta, high leverage, low liquidity assets.” Emerging bonds, a favoured trade before the dollar started rising in mid-April, shed $2.1 billion for their third straight week of losses - the longest negative streak since December 2016. European stocks registered outflows of $2 billion for their ninth straight week of losses while Japanese stocks shed $400 million. However, BAML described the week as a “tentative risk-on”, noting overall inflows to equities alongside $1.2 billion of outflows from bond funds. World shares on Friday were on track to end with a weekly gain of nearly 2 percent after two weeks in the red. The technology sector, meanwhile, continued to bask in the after-glow of strong first-quarter earnings for global giants such as Amazon, Facebook, Taiwan Semiconductor and Alibaba. Tech stocks took in $1.3 billion in the past week, the highest proportional share of equity inflows, the data showed.

2018-05-11,"WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet 10 major automakers at the White House on Friday to discuss the fate of landmark fuel efficiency standards and a looming confrontation with California and other major states. A draft proposal circulated by the U.S. Transportation Department would freeze requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, but the administration is not expected to formally unveil the proposal until later this month or in June. Major automakers reiterated this week they do not support freezing requirements but say they want new flexibilities and rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and the shift in U.S. consumer preferences to bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. Automakers also want the White House and California to reach agreement on maintaining national standards, fearing a prolonged legal battle could leave them facing two different sets of rules and extended uncertainty. Trump plans to tell automakers he is willing to support a freeze and challenge California but wants the industry to back the effort, a senior administration official said. He also wants to know if they want him to fight on their behalf, the official said. The chief executives of General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, along with senior U.S. executives from Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG , Hyundai Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co , Honda Motor Co, BMW AG and Daimler AG will meet Trump, along with the chief executives of two auto trade groups. Trump went to Michigan, a state that helped him win the presidency, in March 2017 and suggested he would soften the fuel rules. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he told autoworkers there. California and 16 other states covering about 40 percent of the U.S. population filed suit last week to block the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken the requirements. A White House official said Trump would hear from the automakers about the impact of the administration’s forthcoming revisions to Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules and automakers’ efforts to negotiate a national program with California. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt and White House aide Chris Liddell are among the administration officials scheduled to attend the session, which is expected to last an hour. Mitch Bainwol, who heads the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, told a U.S. House committee on Tuesday the industry supports “standards that increase year over year that also are consistent with marketplace realities.” Bainwol said the industry remains hopeful that there will be a “negotiation” between the White House, California and the auto industry. Automakers may also use the Trump meeting to raise proposed controversial changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement, officials said. Trump is likely to also raise an idea - first reported in early April - about requiring imported automobiles to meet stricter environmental standards, the administration official said. Automakers plan to argue that Trump should view California as a flawed trade deal and he should help them get a better deal, two auto officials said. The industry also notes it faces rising fuel efficiency standards around the globe and is spending billions of dollars to introduce new battery electric vehicles in the coming years. The Transportation Department proposal also asserts that a 1975 federal law preempts states from imposing emissions rules, even though California has received numerous waivers under the Clean Air Act to set emissions rules. Democrats and environmental advocates plan to aggressively challenge the Trump administration’s plans to weaken the vehicle rules touted by the previous Obama administration as one of its biggest climate actions. The Trump administration plans to argue the weaker rules will lead to cheaper vehicles, boost sales and employment and improve safety by prodding faster turnover of older vehicles. The Obama rules adopted in 2012 sought to double average fleet-wide vehicle fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025, but included an evaluation due by April 2018 to determine if the rules were appropriate. Unlike many other Trump meetings with business leaders, Friday’s meeting will be closed to the media.

2018-05-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Npower will raise domestic fuel costs for one million British customers, saying its standard variable dual fuel price for gas and electricity would increase 5.3 percent from mid-June. Friday’s price rise announcement comes despite intense political scrutiny of energy bills and follows hikes by Centrica-owned (CNA.L) British Gas, Iberdrola-owned (IBE.MC) Scottish Power and EDF Energy, part of France’s EDF (EDF.PA). Innogy-owned (IGY.DE) Npower’s price rise means customers on its dual fuel tariff who pay by direct debit will have an average energy bill of around 1,230 pounds a year.  The rise is made up of an average rise of 4.4 percent on gas and 6.2 percent on electricity, Npower said in a statement.  “The price change largely stems from increases in policy and wholesale energy costs, which are widely acknowledged to have continued to rise since Npower implemented its last price change in March 2017,” it added. British gas prices TRGBNBPWKD have become more volatile and experienced a huge spike during a sudden freeze in late February, in part due to the closure of a large storage site which acted as buffer during cold months. Baseload power prices TRGBBD1 are broadly higher this month than a year ago too. But the wholesale price constitutes less then half of retail prices. Other charges, some policy-driven to encourage a switch to renewable fuels, make up the rest.     Britain’s dominant energy companies, which also include E.ON (EONGn.DE) and SSE Plc (SSE.L), face price caps on the standard variable tariffs which the government plans to implement in time for winter, as well as fierce competition from smaller rivals. The government has said British energy prices are a “rip-off” after it emerged household bills have doubled over the last decade, despite a series of market liberalisation reforms.

2018-05-11,"PARIS (Reuters) - France pledged on Friday to push back against the threat of U.S. sanctions against French companies doing business with Iran, in the wake of Washington’s withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Tehran. The French government is seeking waivers and longer transition periods from the United States for companies such as Renault and Total, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said, while pressing for European Union measures to improve the bloc’s “economic sovereignty” in the longer term. “It’s time that European countries opened their eyes,” Le Maire said on Europe 1 radio. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal risks exposing European countries that have since invested in Iran to renewed U.S. sanctions after “wind-down” periods of three to six months expire. Europe needs new “financial instruments allowing it to be independent from the United States”, Le Maire said. Germany plans to offer legal advice to help its firms continue to do business in Iran, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier also said on Friday. France and Germany are among EU countries that had drawn up euro-denominated Iran export finance programmes to resist U.S. sanctions. But the severity of Washington’s stance has raised doubts about their viability. Le Maire said he had asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for temporary or permanent exemptions for French companies, citing carmaker PSA, drug giant Sanofi and food group Danone among those affected - in addition to Renault and oil major Total. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also toughened the government’s tone in an interview with Le Parisien. “We’re telling the Americans that it’s their business what sanctions they impose, but we consider the extraterritoriality of these measures unacceptable,” Le Drian said. “Europeans should not have to pay for U.S. withdrawal from an agreement.” Reporting by Laurence Frost; Additional reporting by Julie Carriat; Editing by Richard Lough",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-france/france-vows-pushback-against-u-s-sanctions-on-iran-idUKL8N1SI23Q,11 May 2018,"France pledged on Friday to push

2018-05-11,"* CNPC has put thorough contingency plans in place * CNPC has acquired some expertise operating offshore * Banking unit Kunlun could be funding, clearing vehicle By Chen Aizhu BEIJING, May 11 (Reuters) - China’s state-owned energy major CNPC is ready to take over Total’s stake in the giant Iranian South Pars gas project if the French company leaves amid newly announced U.S. sanctions, industry sources said. The United States this week said it would impose new sanctions against major oil and gas producer Iran after abandoning an agreement reached in late 2015 that limited Tehran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief. While the new sanctions are unilateral, many companies, including Japan’s Inpex, already appear to be bowing to Washington’s pressure and abandoning projects in Iran. If Total walks away from the South Pars field, which has the world’s biggest natural gas reserves ever found in one place, CNPC is prepared to step in, the sources said. It was not clear whether CNPC had received top government approval to do so. But such a move could further strain the tense trade relationship between Beijing and Washington. Reuters reported in December that a $1 billion deal signed last July gave the Chinese firm the option to take over Total’s stake if it left Iran. Since then, the Beijing-backed giant has conducted significant due diligence and planning, several high-level industry sources told Reuters. “The possibility of Total’s pullout is quite high now, and in that scenario CNPC will be ready to take it over fully,” said a senior state oil official with knowledge of the contract. An executive with direct knowledge of the project added that planning began “the day the investment was approved.” “CNPC foresaw a high probability of a reimposition of (U.S.) sanctions,” the executive said. All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media. Under the terms of the agreement to develop phase 11 of South Pars, CNPC could take over Total’s 50.1 percent stake and become operator of the project. CNPC already holds a 30 percent stake in the field, while Iranian national oil company subsidiary PetroPars holds the remaining 19.9 percent. So far, the Chinese oil giant, which already operates two oil fields in Iran, has spent about $20 million on planning to develop the field, the sources said. Despite CNPC’s preparations, the two sources said they were not aware of any meetings between Total and CNPC after Trump’s move. CNPC and Total declined to comment. A source close to Total said the French company was analysing the impact of new sanctions and whether it could get a waiver that would allow it to keep its stake. An experienced onshore oil and gas producer, CNPC is relatively green in offshore drilling. Most of its experience lies in its subsidiary China Petroleum Offshore Engineering Company (CPOE), which has worked in shallow waters off north China. The South Pars gas reservoirs are buried beneath the seafloor, 70 metres underwater. The project will have a production capacity of 2 billion cubic feet per day, or 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including condensate, Total has said. At current market prices, the whole reserves of the field, which Iran shares with Qatar, would be worth around $2.9 trillion. The field is set to start supplying the Iranian domestic market in 2021. CNPC is prepared to use its banking unit Bank of Kunlun Ltd as a funding and clearing vehicle if it takes over operation of South Pars, the second senior state oil official said. The bank was used to settle tens of billions of dollars worth of oil imports during the UN sanctions against Tehran between 2012 and 2015, the official added. Most of the bank’s settlements during that time were in euros and Chinese renminbi. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Kunlun in 2012 for conducting business with Iran. If CNPC goes ahead, it would also likely have to develop crucial equipment, such as large-powered compressors needed for developing gas deposits on this scale, on its own. Leading manufacturers like U.S. firm GE and Germany’s Siemens could be barred from supplying to Iran under U.S. sanctions. Additional reporting by Bate Felix in Paris and Ron Bousso in

2018-05-11,"May 11 (Reuters) - Some of Britain’s biggest energy companies have announced price increases this year, citing higher wholesale prices and the cost of government policies to support renewable energy generation. More are expected to follow suit and the moves come after similar rises last year. Britain’s dominant energy companies have been under scrutiny by the government, which is putting a price cap on standard variable tariffs to combat what it has called “rip off” energy prices. Below are tariff changes so far this year (in alphabetical order): Npower, owned by Germany’s Innogy, will raise its variable dual fuel bill by 5.3 percent as of June 17, impacting about 1 million customers. The rise represents a 64 pound increase on annual bills and a direct debit customer on the tariff will typically pay 1230 pounds ($1,664) a year. The hike is made up of average rises of 4.4 percent on gas and 6.2 percent on electricity. Centrica-owned British Gas is increasing its standard variable tariff for electricity and gas by an average of 5.5 percent from May 29. The move will add 60 pounds ($85) to annual bills for 4.1 million customers on the tariff, raising them to an average of 1,161 pounds, the company said. EDF Energy, a unit of French utility EDF, said it will increase the cost of its standard dual fuel energy bills by 1.4 percent (or 16 pounds) to 1,158 pounds a year from June 7. Iberdrola-owned Scottish Power said it will raise standard variable domestic gas and electricity prices from June 1 by an average 5.5 percent, or 63 pounds on a typical annual dual fuel bill. The move will affect around a third of homes supplied by Scottish Power (around 960,000).

2018-05-11,"KATHMANDU, May 11 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Friday initiate work on Nepal’s biggest hydroelectric project, being built by an Indian company, as he seeks to regain ground in the Himalayan republic where China has made deep inroads. India has an open border with Nepal and tens of thousands of Nepalis work in India. The neigbours share close religious and cultural bonds. But India has been slow to implement projects despite ambitious plans, and it has also often been a target of Nepali politicians critical of what they see as meddling by their overweening, much bigger neighbour. China, on the other hand, is pouring aid and investment into hospitals, roads and hydroelectric plants. Modi, who began a visit to Nepal on Friday, will, with his counterpart K.P.Sharma Oli, lay a foundation of the 900 MW hydro-power project through remote control from Kathmandu. “As Nepal enters a new era of consolidating the gains of a democracy and achieving economic growth, India remains a steadfast partner,” Modi said on Twitter before seeing out on his visit. The hydro project, which is expected to cost $1.04 billion and is being built by state-run Indian firm Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) Limited, will be the single biggest foreign investment project in cash-strapped Nepal. Project officials say they are in final stages of agreement with the State Bank of India for investment of about 36 billion Indian rupees ($535 million), with the rest coming from equity investment by SJVN. The project is moving forwards just as a Chinese proposal to build a 750 MW power plant in west Nepal has run into a roadblock. China’s Three Gorges International Corp is haggling for better terms, Nepali officials said. Modi is visiting for the first time since protests for a greater say in government by ethnic Madhesis, in Nepal’s lowland south, led to the closure of the border for months in 2015 and 2016. The blockade chocked off Nepal’s imports of fuel, medicine and construction material just as it was struggling to recover from the worst earthquake on record in which 9,000 people were killed. Many in Nepal saw India’s hand in the protests although India denied that. Guna Raj Luintel, editor of the Nagarik daily, said there was lingering anger towards India over the blockade. “Modi is under pressure to bring the Nepal ties back to normal and win the confidence of the Nepali people,” Luintel told Reuters. After arriving in Nepal, Modi offered prayers at a Hindu temple in the border town of Janakpur, which was a hub of the Madhesi protests in which more than 50 people were killed.

2018-05-11,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Bombers and fighter jets from China’s air force conducted encirclement drills around Taiwan on Friday, the latest round of increasingly frequent military manoeuvres near the self-ruled island that Taipei has denounced as intimidation. China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, and its hostility towards the island has grown since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. In the past year, Beijing has stepped up such military exercises, designed to send a message to Taiwan that it will thwart what it sees as any moves towards independence, even as Tsai has pledged to maintain the status quo and keep the peace. The People’s Liberation Army Air Force said in a statement on its official microblog that H-6K bombers and surveillance aircraft flew in opposite directions around Taiwan, displaying “a new upgrade in combat capabilities”.  It said it was the first time Su-35 fighter jets had flown with the bombers through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines. China is in the midst of an ambitious programme to modernise its armed forces, developing stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and advanced missiles as it strives to acquire a world-class military by the middle of the century. That goal, coupled with an increasingly assertive stance in the disputed South China Sea waterway and around Taiwan, has rattled nerves around the region and in Washington. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S.-made weaponry, but has been pushing for Washington to sell it more advanced equipment, including new fighter jets, to help it better deter its giant neighbour. Military experts say the balance of power between Taiwan and China has now shifted decisively in favour of China, which could probably overwhelm the island unless U.S. forces came quickly to its aid.

2018-05-11,"NAIROBI, May 11 (Reuters) - Kenya’s chief prosecutor on Friday ordered police to investigate a dam-burst on a commercial farm in the Rift Valley that killed dozens of people as a wall of water tore down a hillside, obliterating everything in its path. At least 44 people were killed when the reservoir, used to store water for the farming of roses for export to Europe, burst its banks on Wednesday night after heavy rains. Another 40 people have been reported missing. The public prosecutor’s office said on Twitter the police chief had been ordered “to carry out thorough investigations to establish cause and culpability if any” behind the disaster and file a report within two weeks. The Daily Nation newspaper quoted government officials as saying the dam and others on the 3,500-acre Solai farm, 190 km (120 miles) northwest of Nairobi, had not been cleared by government engineers. Villagers had complained when the dams were built, accusing the farm-owner of depriving them of access to river water, the paper reported. Vinoj Kumar, general manager of the farm, blamed the disaster on heavy rainfall in a forest above the dam. He declined to comment on the Daily Nation allegations, saying he was too busy to talk. Kenya’s cut-flower sector, in the fertile Rift Valley, has grown dramatically in the last decade to become one of the biggest foreign exchange earners in East Africa’s largest economy and a major source of employment. After a severe drought last year, East Africa has been hit by two months of heavy rain that has affected nearly a million people in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda. Bridges have been swept away and roads turned into rivers of mud. More than 150 people have been killed and 300,000 displaced in Kenya, where roads, bridges and crops have been swept away, causing millions of dollars of damage. “We all breathed a sigh of relief when the rainy season started strong in early March,” said Lane Bunkers of Catholic Relief Services in Kenya. “But now - two months later - we are seeing the consequences of the drought-ravaged land’s inability to absorb all the rain due to its degraded state.” (Reporting by Duncan Miriri, Humphrey Malalo and Maggie Fick; Editing by Ed Cropley and Janet Lawrence)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kenya-floods/kenyas-top-prosecutor-orders-dam-disaster-investigation-idUKL8N1SI1GO,11 May 2018,"Kenya's chief prosecutor on

2018-05-11,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Some North Korean traders are offering cheap coal to Chinese buyers who are stockpiling it at ports inside the isolated country, hoping recent diplomatic moves lead to an easing of sanctions barring purchases of North Korean coal, three Chinese traders told Reuters.  Official data shows China has not imported any coal from North Korea since October last year, after the United Nations banned Pyongyang from exporting coal in September.  In 2016, China, Pyongyang’s main trading partner, bought 22.5 million tonnes of coal from North Korea worth almost $2 billion. [COAL/CN] But the Chinese traders said offers of coal had surged after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a surprise visit to Beijing in March, and ahead of a planned meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.  “The day Kim Jong Un visited Beijing, I was approached by a North Korean trader asking if I wanted inventory at Nampo port,” one coal trader based in northern China told Reuters, referring to North Korea’s main west coast port.  The North Korean trader had a couple thousand tonnes of anthracite coal which he was willing to sell at around $30-$40 per tonne, the trader said, less than a quarter of the price of similar Chinese coal. The two other Chinese traders confirmed that price range. All three requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.  Prices were even lower during the Lunar New Year period in February, hovering at less than $15 per tonne, said another of the traders, who is based in northeastern China. The Chinese traders Reuters spoke to said they had not personally purchased North Korean coal, but all said they were aware of stockpiling in the hope of sanctions being eased. “Over the past few weeks, more and more people have been stockpiling coal,” one trader told Reuters.  North Korean coal producers and coal trading houses are allowed to decide prices and volumes for export, even though they are owned by the state and don’t operate in a fully liberalised market, one trader said. The North Korean trading houses also pay hefty export taxes, a major source of income for the regime.  If UN sanctions were lifted, the coal could be sold on to steel mills in China. Anthracite produced in China’s Shanxi province currently sells at around 1,020-1,100 yuan ($160-$172) per tonne, data provided by China Sublime Information Group shows.  “The price is exceptionally good but I decided not to buy because I am worried the cargo will be seized back by the North Korean government,” one trader said.  Buyers had to pay in full up-front, instead of the 20 to 30 percent deposit required before sanctions were imposed, he said.  Chinese traders who accepted the terms were required by the North Korean sellers to send money to accounts in banks held by Dandong-based Chinese agents who were in contact with North Korean firms, the trader added. He said he could not track if and how the money left China, and Reuters was unable to verify any transfers between the two countries.      Catherine Dill, a senior research associate at the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies said any completed deals were likely to violate UN sanctions, which cover a wide range of North Korean exports and are aimed at cutting off up to 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings. Although the coal is still in North Korea, the phrasing of the UN resolution - that North Korea cannot “supply, sell or transfer” its coal to other countries - suggests the intent of the resolution is to prohibit any transaction that would financially benefit North Korea, Dill said.  Independent U.N. experts monitoring the implementation of sanctions believe North Korea earned nearly $200 million in 2017 from banned commodity exports including coal. The United Nations and China’s Commerce Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Calls to the North Korean embassy in Beijing went unanswered. The United States has repeatedly said it will not relax sanctions on North Korea until it denuclearises. The White House said Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had “agreed on the importance of continued implementation of sanctions on North Korea until it permanently dismantles its nuclear and missile programmes” during a phone conversation this week.      The three sources said they expect North Korean coal prices to rise significantly if the UN ban is lifted.  Traders were expecting Chinese customs to allow in new cargoes from North Korea as early as this month, said Zhang Min, a senior coal analyst with China Sublime Information Group. The Chinese trader based in northeastern China said he was heading to North Korea this week to meet his contacts.  “The situation with North Korea is improving so I want to touch base with my business partners as soon as possible.” ($1 = 6.3673 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Sue-Lin Wong and Beijing newsroom.

2018-05-11,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Jiangsu province is considering shutting small coke plants along the Yangtze River and near Lake Tai, as the eastern province steps up its campaign against pollution, an official at the provincial government familiar with the matter said. The move is part of a broader anti-pollution proposal being considered by the provincial government, said the official, who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. Jiangsu province is China’s second-largest steel producing region and its output of coke, used to smelt iron ore in blast furnaces, accounts for 5 percent of the country’s total on average.  Local officials in the eastern province have become more aggressive in tackling pollution, with a flurry of chemical plant and steel mill closures in recent weeks. Coke futures prices jumped more than 3 percent on Friday to 2,068 yuan ($325.99) per tonne as investors bet that the proposal will reduce coke supplies, two traders said.  The latest proposal is likely to increase costs for steel mills. Bringing in coke from elsewhere could also add to pressure on the country’s rail system after China cracked down on diesel trucks carrying bulk commodities in many regions. It is not known when the authorities will make a final decision, the official said. The Jiangsu state planner did not respond to a request for comment.

2018-05-11,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Residents on the Big Island of Hawaii were alerted on Thursday to rising levels of toxic gas from lava-oozing fissures, and geologists warned that new areas east of the erupting Kilauea volcano may be at risk of molten rock bursting from the ground. Hawaii County authorities sent a text message to 	residents of the southeast corner of the island warning them of a wind change that would bring rising levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities.      “It’s just horrible. You can’t breathe in there,” said evacuated resident Robynn Stagg, 58, who drove through the thick, orange sulfur dioxide haze earlier this week in a failed attempt to check on her home.   Hawaii’s governor has warned that mass evacuations may be required as more fissures open in the ground and spew lava and gas into semi-rural residential areas on the east flank of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes. During an evening meeting with community members, an official with the United States Geological Survey’s Hawaii Volcano Observatory said that while no new fissures have opened during the last 24 hours, there has been “quite a bit” of ground cracking over the last day and that they were releasing steam.   “Because the lava intrusion is still active and earthquakes are still occurring, we still think there’s a decent chance of new eruptive activity at the surface,” Steven Brantley said.  Authorities on Thursday completed the removal of highly flammable chemicals from a nearby geothermal power plant that was in the path of creeping lava. The latest upheaval at Kilauea began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed suddenly in a cloud of ash, triggering a similar plunge in the molten lake inside the larger crater at the volcano’s summit. What followed was a flurry of earthquakes as huge volumes of magma — the term for lava beneath the surface — drained back through deep-underground passages that carried the molten rock far downslope. The lava then forced its way back to the surface through large cracks, or fissures, that opened at ground level in a residential area miles (km) away. (GRAPHIC: Scorched earth - tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS) Geologists said Kilauea may be entering a new phase of explosive eruptions not seen in nearly a century that could hurl “ballistic blocks” weighing up to 12 tons for half a mile (800 meters), and rain pebble-sized fragments for another mile or two (1.8 to 3.2 km).  However, the immediate vicinity around the summit, an area controlled by the National Park Service, was to be closed to visitors indefinitely, starting on Thursday night. Such blasts would likely also eject plumes of volcanic ash that could be carried farther downwind into neighboring communities, creating a nuisance and potential respiratory irritant, but not a life-threatening hazard, officials said. The Leilani Estates community remains in greatest danger, with 15 volcanic fissures so far having destroyed 36 structures, most of them homes, and forcing the evacuation of about 2,000 residents. But as the eruption progresses, “other areas of the lower East Rift Zone may also be at risk,” the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said in a bulletin. “There is the potential for additional outbreaks,” Christina Neal, the chief scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory at Kilauea told a news briefing. “There are other communities, other residential neighborhoods that could, depending on the evolution of activity, be in harm’s way.”   Hawaii Governor David Ige has requested federal disaster assistance as he said a mass evacuation of the lower Puna District, where Leilani Estates is located, would be beyond current county and state capabilities. Hawaii police said they arrested Alexandru Stingu-Dragomir, 29, on suspicion he burgled four houses in Leilani Estates after the mayor declared an emergency the area on last week.   Local meteorologists said the change in prevailing winds could send Kilauea’s volcanic smog, or vog, northwest to Maui and other islands in Hawaii. Surfers bobbing in the ocean off Kona on the west side of the Big Island complained of the smog that could be seen in a haze over the coast. “Does that hat protect against vog?” one surfer was heard quipping to another about the floppy sun hat he was wearing. In Pahoa, the nearest village to Kilauea, some schools remained closed after the area was hit by a 6.9 magnitude earthquake on Friday, the biggest since 1975. The closures have added to a sense of disarray and ramped up stress levels, said gallery owner Amedeo Markoff, 49. “It’s like our version of a snow day — a lava day,” joked Markoff.

Markets were also cheered by a further easing in tensions on the Korean Peninsula, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12 for talks on its nuclear weapons programme. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent to near three-week highs with broad-based gains across all sectors. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 1.2 percent. But spreadbetters indicated the upbeat mood was unlikely to last, with FTSE futures down a bit and E-Minis for the S&P500 a touch softer. Most emerging Asian currencies were buoyant as the dollar eased after Thursday’s slower-than-expected April consumer price gain. The soft figures followed payrolls numbers last week which pointed to sluggish wage growth. The two data sets meant “inflation may be rising but not so rapidly that the Fed would have to take aggressive actions to keep the economy from overheating,” said James McGlew, analyst at Perth-based stock broker Argonaut. A recent shakeout in global markets, partly stoked by Sino-U.S. trade tensions, has also eased, while money managers expect the relatively low global rates that have fuelled a ‘Goldilocks’ boom in stock markets will remain in place for some time. “While inflation is continuing to trend up, it’s only happening slowly. So Goldilocks continues,” Shane Oliver, chief investment manager at AMP, said in a note. Indeed, a key measure of expected market swings, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has fallen very close to levels last seen in early January when stock markets were buoyant. While North Korea has come off the boil for now, geopolitical concerns still remain as the U.S. and China continue skirmishing over trade and tensions rise in the Middle East. “Trump still needs President Xi (Jinping) and China’s support in dealing with North Korea and this will be his priority in the short term,” economists at JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients. “Once the meeting is finished, trade may return to the fore.” The United States and China have locked horns over import tariffs after Trump announced hefty duties on Chinese goods, provoking a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. “It is notable that in line with this view, the U.S. has extended hearings over China tariffs, drawing out the process,” they added. U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Washington for a second round of trade talks next week, after apparently making little progress in discussions in Beijing earlier this month. Currency markets were largely muted during Asian trading. The dollar index was up 0.2 percent after falling the most since late March on Thursday. Investors trimmed their expectations for four Fed rate hikes after inflation data showed U.S. price pressures remained weak. The Fed has already raised rates once this year and is widely expected to go two more times in 2018. The British pound inched above a four-month low of $1.3457 touched on Thursday after the BoE held key borrowing costs. It was last at $1.3505. The recent slowing in price growth in major economies has boosted expectations that most central banks except the Fed will continue their massive bond-buying programmes to keep policy stimulatory. The euro was a tad lower at $1.1893. The Japanese yen gained mildly to be last at 109.29 per dollar. Malaysian markets were closed Friday but its newly appointed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad emerged with key election pledges including repealing an unpopular goods and services tax and restoring a petrol subsidy. Ratings agency Moody’s said some campaign promises would be “credit negative” for Malaysia. Such concerns pushed up the cost of insuring against a Malaysia default, with the country’s 5-year credit default swap price at its highest since early June 2017 at 95.090 basis points. In commodities markets, spot gold slipped 0.1 percent to $1,319.33 an ounce. Oil prices eased but stayed near multi-year peaks amid supply concerns after Trump withdrew from an Iranian nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions. U.S. crude futures were last down 10 cents at $71.26 a barrel. Brent crude futures fell 18 cents to $77.29 a barrel, after hitting $78 earlier in the day, their highest since November 2014.

2018-05-11,"OSLO (Reuters) - Europe has sent just over half the plastic waste it used to ship to China to other parts of Asia since Beijing’s environmental crackdown closed the world’s biggest recycling market in January. The knotty problem is what to do with the rest. Some of the surplus is piled up in places from building sites to ports, officials say, waiting for new markets to open up. Recycling closer to home is held back by the fact that the plastic is often dirty and unsorted, the same reasons China turned it away. Countries led by Malaysia and Vietnam and India imported far more of Europe’s plastic waste in early 2018 than before, European Union data show, but unless they or others take more, the only options will be to either bury or burn it. In an overcrowded continent where landfills are much more restricted than elsewhere, burning is the obvious option to help generate electricity or heat from hundreds of thousands of tonnes of surplus waste. But more radical ideas, such as putting oil derived plastic back underground to “mine” back when recycling becomes more sophisticated, are being aired as Europe tries to work out what to do. European waste policies “need to become much more nuanced, because some landfill might actually be quite good,” professor Ian Boyd, chief scientific adviser for the British government’s department of environment, food and rural affairs, told Reuters. “I’m putting out a challenge to the current system,” he said, referring to the fact that waste policies in Europe either ban or limit landfill but do little to restrict what has been dubbed “skyfill” - the release of pollutants into the air. WASTE-TO-POWER Europe has favoured the construction of power plants that burn waste for electricity or heat because land is scarce and landfills produce toxins and greenhouse gases such as methane as organic waste - from food to nappies - rots. Waste-to-power plants produce greenhouse gas emissions too, but in most of Europe they are exempt from carbon taxes that stand at about 14 euros a tonne in an industrial market. Boyd said buried plastic could become a valuable resource only if the penalties for emitting greenhouse gases, both in making plastics and burning them, were far higher than today. Globally, plastics accounted for 390 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in 2012, ranging from production to incineration and equivalent to the emissions by a nation such as Turkey, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a think-tank that specialises in recycling. The plastics industry takes issue with such assessments, saying they ignore the vast contribution of plastic in reducing other emissions by for example preserving food and reducing the weight of transport. The Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP), a group of some 400 plants using 90 million tonnes of municipal waste to provide heat and electricity for millions of people, said burying and then mining back plastic was a fantasy. “Digging waste into landfills and then waiting until a magic technology pops up in the future is not a responsible option,” CEWEP managing director Ellen Stengler said, adding that the idea was a minority view she heard “here and there” in Europe. Just cleaning plastic waste before burial would be hugely expensive, plastic would degrade underground and there would be risks such as fire, she said. The latest major U.N. assessment of climate change, in 2014, also floated the idea that cities might sort and bury waste such as metals, paper and plastics to create “a material reservoir that can be mined” sometime in future. Plastic pollution is surging and could, according to UN Environment, exceed the weight of fish in the oceans by 2050. China, which used to process half the world’s exports of plastic waste, has insisted on higher standards of cleanliness and sorting to prevent waste that cannot be recycled being burnt, which, in its case, often means in open pits. For Europe, the restrictions have so far acted as an effective ban, according to official data reviewed by Reuters which showed exports to China crashing by 96 percent in the first two months of the year. For graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2I9C4Zh Nations led by Malaysia, Vietnam, Turkey, India and Indonesia took on around 60 percent of the waste, but the surplus means Europe’s market for low-grade waste has collapsed. A tonne of plastic waste for export, with up to 20 percent impurities such as paper labels, could be sold for between 25 and 40 pounds a tonne in April 2017, according to British recycling group letsrecycle.com. Last month, by contrast, you had to pay between 40 and 60 pounds to get someone to take it away. Despite this, Patawari Borad of the Bureau of International Recycling in Brussels said recycling within Europe had not increased dramatically. “One can only guess that this unsorted material is going for either energy or incineration.” Waste-to-energy body CEWEP said it saw no sign extra plastic was being burnt. Incinerators would notice a higher share of plastics, Stengler said, because, tonne for tonne, they produce a lot of energy. Proponents of the idea of burying plastic include Keith Freegard, a director of Axion Polymers in England, one of Europe’s leading recyclers of waste from cars and electronics. “All those tonnes of carbon-rich waste material that were going into the landfill are now being released into the sky. Why are we allowing this free access to ‘skyfill’?” said Freegard, who is vice chair of the British Plastic Federation’s Recycling Group. “We should separate and store plastic in a well-controlled landfill as a future mine,” he told Reuters. To produce a megawatt hour of electricity, he said a waste-to-energy plant would need to burn 345 kg of plastic, emitting 880 kg of carbon dioxide. By contrast, a gas-fired power plant would generate the same amount of energy by burning 132 kg of natural gas, emitting just 360 kg of carbon dioxide. Stengler and nations that favour waste-to-energy plants say such accounting is misleading and that waste-to-energy helps replace fossil fuels, a key goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit heat waves, floods, droughts and rising seas. Swedish government estimates, for instance, show that three tonnes of municipal waste contain as much energy as a tonne of oil. World production of plastics has increased about twentyfold since the 1960s and is expected to double again over the next 20 years, according to the European Commission. Erik Solheim, head of U.N. Environment in Nairobi, said the global focus for plastic policies should be to cut use, especially products such as microplastics used in some cosmetics or drinking straws that he said were unnecessary. “The best of all is to avoid the plastics we don’t need,” he said. Burying waste and mining it sounds “a difficult option”. Of 27.1 million tonnes of plastic waste collected in Europe in 2016, 41.6 percent went to energy generation, 31.1 percent to recycling including in China, and 27.3 percent to landfills, according to Plastics Europe. It was the first time that recycling rates exceeded landfills, it said. By contrast in the more spacious United States, 75 percent of 33 million tonnes of collected plastics was landfilled in 2014, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Fifteen percent was burnt and 9.5 percent recycled, it said. And worldwide, a report by U.N. scientists in 2014 estimated that only about 20 percent of municipal solid waste is recycled, about 13.5 percent used to generate energy and the rest dumped.

2018-05-11,"* U.S. this week announced re-introduction of Iran sanctions * Iran oil exports expected to drop amid new sanctions * Other producers may step up output to meet shortfall By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices on Friday held multi-year highs reached the previous session as looming U.S. sanctions against major oil producer and OPEC-member Iran threatened to tip an already tight market into undersupply. The United States plans to re-introduce sanctions against Iran, which produces around 4 percent of global oil supplies, after abandoning an agreement reached in late 2015 that limited Tehran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for removing U.S.-Europe sanctions. The sanctions come amid an oil market that has been tightening due to strong demand, especially in Asia, and as top exporter Saudi Arabia and top producer Russia have led efforts since 2017 to withhold oil supplies to prop up prices. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $77.47 per barrel at 0057 GMT, unchanged from their last close. Brent hit $78 a barrel, its highest since November 2014, the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $71.42 a barrel, also not far off Thursday’s November 2014 high of $71.89 per barrel. Many analysts expect oil prices to rise to $80-$100 per barrel later this year, once U.S. sanctions start to bite and Iran’s exports start sinking. There are, however, signs that other suppliers from within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will step up output in order to counter the Iran disruption. “The market is now focused on OPEC and other producers’ ability to react to this potential supply disruption,” ANZ bank said on Friday. “Investors are increasingly viewing Kuwait and Iraq as the producers with the best ability to raise output quickly in response to any fall in Iranian exports,” it added. Outside OPEC, soaring U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA may also help fill Iran’s supply gap, hitting another record last week by climbing to 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd). That’s up 27 percent since mid-2016 and means U.S. output is creeping ever closer to that of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd.

2018-05-11,"HOJANCHA, Costa Rica, May 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - F armers everywhere know water means life, and a lack of it can spell ruin. In Hojancha, a canton that lies about 130 kilometres (80 miles) west of the Costa Rican capital San Jose, cattle farmer Manuel Rojas understands that as well as anyone. Normally by this time of year, he said, his small herd of 30 cattle would be desperate for water. Not any longer. “Now they have it there easily,” he said, pointing to a full drinking trough. What changed? Last month Rojas installed a rainwater harvest system that, as the name suggests, captures rainwater and stores it in an evaporation-proof, 1,000-cubic-metre tank. It is one of the country’s first such systems. Its inverted pyramid structure stores 1 million litres of water, enough to last four months if used carefully. “We hope that this system can help us maintain production throughout the whole year, and not only when it rains,” he said. Hojancha lies in Guanacaste province, a region on the Pacific coast that is particularly prone to drought, especially during the intense summer months. This area has few rivers, said Oscar Vasquez, the provincial director at the ministry of agriculture, who was at Rojas’ farm for a ceremony marking the system’s installation. “I do not see another way (than this). Water comes only from the sky,” he said. Despite the need for it, though, capturing rain is in its infancy in Costa Rica, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in part because people do not know about the technology. But there are other reasons, Vasquez said: it is costly to set up, and there is not enough clarity about the law covering rainwater harvesting. Both factors lower the economic incentives for farmers to invest. A system like the one Rojas installed costs about $12,000, a sum that, in practice, is unaffordable for farmers like him. It consists of a network of gutters that captures rain from the roof of his barn and directs it to the tank. From there a pump distributes it to the troughs, an irrigation system for grazing, and another that cleans the barn housing the cattle. Rojas’s system was financed through the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation, with the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) helping to design and install it. FAO programme assistant Diego Fallas said it is hard for farmers to get financing for green solutions like rainwater harvesting as the existence of such systems is largely unknown. “Access to green financing is important, for example. These are actions that adapt producers to climate change, and green financing should make this type of technology more accessible to producers,” Fallas said. The FAO wants to encourage more farmers in the drought-prone Guanacaste region to consider rainwater harvesting, said Octavio Ramirez, FAO country head, during the ceremony at Rojas’ farm. Doing so would help farmers deal with the effects of climate change, said Fallas, by creating a water reserve to supply their farm’s needs during drought. The FAO focuses on Guanacaste because it lies in Central America’s “Dry Corridor”, one of the regions whose agriculture the agency regards as being more vulnerable to rising temperatures. The area is also exposed to extreme events such as El Nino, said hydrologist Alejandra Rojas (who is not related to Manuel Rojas) from the University of Costa Rica. The last El Nino, which hit Costa Rica’s typically dry northern and central regions in 2015, caused losses of more than 28 billion Costa Rican colon ($50 million) to agriculture and livestock, government figures show. So while rainwater harvesting will help farmers deal with the effects of climate change and lower the stress on aquifers, it will take much more than that to minimise the effects of extreme weather events, she said. “What happens a lot of the time is that the system goes into a hydrological drought. In other words, there is a decrease in all water sources - both rain and reservoirs - as well as aquifers,” Rojas said. Dealing successfully with those types of situations needs more, including setting up water-saving habits and using drip irrigation. And although nature is beyond the government’s control, fixing regulations around rainwater harvesting is not. Both the ministry’s Vasquez and Fallas from the FAO said a lack of clear rules is holding back the spread of rainwater harvesting. Regulations about water use have long been complex in Costa Rica. Farmers, for instance, must get permits if they want to use rainwater once it has landed on the country’s soil. And until last year, they also needed a permit to capture rainwater from their own roofs. That changed after an executive order was issued allowing farmers to store up to 1,000 cubic metres of rainwater without permission, said Fallas. “Water that has not touched national soil can still be used without any permits,” Fallas explained. That remains true for now. However, as the executive order expires next year, it is unclear what will happen then. The complications do not end there: regulations around water storage are also complex, Fallas said, as they involve strict construction rules that can take two years to complete - a lengthy, costly process that many farmers cannot afford. Patricia Quiros, general manager of the government’s National Service of Groundwater Irrigation and Drainage (SENARA), said local authorities could help by including rules on rainwater harvesting in their regulations on land use. They could do the same by devising local regulations on building storage systems, she said, cutting both the amount of red tape and the time farmers need to spend on securing water. The FAO’s Fallas said time is of the essence. ""We must take the issues on the table and start working together because the ones suffering right now are the producers. The agriculture and livestock sector is being harmed,"" he said. (Reporting by Sebastian Rodriguez, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Zoe Tabary.

2018-05-11,"(Repeats from MAY 10, no changes to text) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2rxY4mS By John Kemp LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - The United States and Saudi Arabia seem to have an understanding to keep the oil market well supplied and avoid a significant price rise after the U.S. re-imposition of sanctions on Iran. But exactly what this involves is not clear to the market, and may not even be clear to the two governments themselves, sowing uncertainty in the weeks ahead. “We have had various conversations with various parties about different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset [the impact of sanctions]” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters on May 8. “My expectation is not that oil prices go higher. To a certain extent some of this was already in the market, on oil prices,” Mnuchin added. He declined to name the countries or companies involved but since Saudi Arabia holds most of the world’s spare production capacity it is likely to have been included. In retrospect, the U.S. president’s April 20 tweet blaming OPEC for high oil prices can be seen as part of the negotiating. The basic bargain appears to be that the United States will impose tough sanctions that curb Iran’s oil exports and in return Saudi Arabia will avoid a damaging and politically controversial spike in prices. Saudi Arabia appeared to confirm the existence of an understanding by committing to maintain “the stability of oil markets” and more specifically to “mitigate the impact of any potential supply shortages”. The kingdom committed to “work with major producers within and outside OPEC as well as major consumers” to limit the impact from possible supply disruptions. The comments were made in an unusual statement issued by the kingdom’s ministry of energy and carried by the official news agency shortly after the sanctions were announced. They were subsequently confirmed by the energy minister in a statement on Twitter and in briefings with news organisations. While the existence of an understanding seems fairly well confirmed, its content remains a mystery. Neither Saudi Arabia nor the United States have indicated a specific price level that would trigger a production increase, and the kingdom has declined to give a specific commitment to replace any fall in Iranian oil exports now or in the future. Instead, Saudi sources have briefed the media to say the kingdom would not act alone to increase production and intends to consult with other OPEC and non-OPEC members. OPEC sources have indicated the organisation has up to 180 days, until the end of the sanctions phase-in period, before needing to decide whether to increase output elsewhere to compensate for Iran. The safest thing for OPEC may be to leave output unchanged in the near term and monitor the situation (“OPEC in no hurry to decide if extra oil needed to offset Iran”, Reuters, May 10). In the past, Saudi Arabia has usually been slow to raise production in response to rising prices, preferring the extra revenue to using spare capacity to put a lid on prices. But in a market like oil, traders will respond to the prospect of supply curbs in future by driving up the price now. So if Saudi Arabia and its allies stall, the market will reach its own judgement about the impact on the supply-demand balance. The United States and Saudi Arabia may have reached a detailed agreement on how to handle the prospective reduction of Iranian oil exports and its impact on oil prices. But it is also possible that they have reached nothing more than a vague high-level political consensus or “gentleman’s agreement” and plan to improvise. If so, that leaves plenty of room for misunderstandings and uncertainty. The recent rise in crude oil prices will very likely push average U.S. gasoline prices above the psychologically important threshold of $3 per gallon next week, for the first time since 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2rxY4mS). And if prices continue to escalate, they could become a political issue in the United States ahead of congressional elections in November. Neither the Trump administration nor Saudi Arabia will want to be blamed for driving oil prices significantly higher. The U.S. president has already said that oil prices are “artificially very high” and this “will not be accepted”, while Saudi Arabia has been trying to push prices higher, and resisting calls for it to ease production curbs. Saudi officials have said that the market can absorb higher prices, though they do not want them to rise too much. But there is a lot of uncertainty about how much is “too much”. In the end, Saudi Arabia and the United States may have differing views about what would constitute an unacceptable spike in prices in response to sanctions. Whatever they may want, benchmark Brent futures prices have risen by almost $4 per barrel or 5 percent over the last week, and more than $6 or 9 percent higher over the last month, and are still trending higher.

2018-05-11,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - An expansion of oil drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico would interfere with U.S. military testing unless the Pentagon and another agency develop rules to govern the work, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a report this week. The Defense Department concluded in a report it sent on Wednesday to U.S. lawmakers that drilling east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico, a demarcation more than 200 miles (320 km) west of Florida, would harm military testing operations without the rules.  “Military flexibility in the region would be lost and test and training activities would be severely affected,” without mutually agreed restrictions between the Pentagon and the Interior Department on the drilling, said the report, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.  Industry groups interpreted the report with optimism.  The report confirmed that “collaboration between the Department of Defense and Interior will enable the successful coexistence of continued military training and expanded American oil production,” said Erik Milito, a director of upstream operations at the American Petroleum Institute.  Randall Luthi, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, said the report showed, “There is a lot of ocean out there and while there will be devils in the details, the overall message from the Pentagon should be interpreted as cooperation and coordination.”    Interest in drilling offshore in the United States is high as the Trump administration pursues a policy of maximizing oil, gas and coal output for domestic and foreign use. In January, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the administration would not allow drilling off Florida after the state’s governor protested that opening it up would harm tourism.  But drilling far off Florida is still in play. The Departments of Defense and Interior have been holding meetings on drilling in the region that are likely to go on for months. A Defense Department spokeswoman did not immediately comment on whether those meetings were hammering out an agreement on drilling. In the most recent Gulf of Mexico auction, held in March, many bids were made on acreage in the formation closest to the Military Mission Line known as DeSoto Canyon.     BP Plc (BP.L) bid on the most contiguous leases of any participant anywhere in the Gulf, staking its claim on about 171 square miles (443 sq km) in DeSoto Canyon, about 100 miles (160 km) off the Louisiana coast.
