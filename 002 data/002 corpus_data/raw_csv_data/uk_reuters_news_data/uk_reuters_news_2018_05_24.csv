2018-05-24,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - An auction of oil by the Brazilian government from coveted offshore pre-salt fields has only attracted the interest of one bidder, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The auction, scheduled for May 30, is the first time the government will sell its share of oil in the pre-salt, where billions of barrels of crude are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor. Shell confirmed in a statement that it has registered to bid in the auction. The oil will come from three pre-salt areas, including the Mero area, which is located in the Libra field of the Santos basin. The rest will come from the Sapinhoa field in the Campos basin and the Lula field in the Santos basin.  Brazilian rules dictate that companies vying for stakes in the prolific pre-salt must bid by promising a share of oil production to the government. But rules laying out how the government must sell its share took many months to approve.

2018-05-24,"(Recasts first paragraph, adds details on size of auction) By Scott DiSavino NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. nuclear power generators are sticking with plans to shut several reactors after none of them won the right to supply capacity in an auction by the country’s largest power grid despite higher winning prices, energy companies and analysts said on Thursday. Major nuclear power providers, including Exelon Corp and FirstEnergy Solutions, bid in an annual auction held this month by grid operator PJM Interconnection to make sure there is enough resources available for upcoming years. This year’s auction, which was awarded on Wednesday, came to $9.3 billion for the June 2021-May 2022 delivery year, said PJM, which controls the grid in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states. Last year’s auction fetched $7 billion. In recent years, natural gas has become the nation’s dominant provider of power generation, with nuclear and coal slipping because of elevated costs for those fuels. Nuclear and coal operators have said they want to see additional subsidies and market rule changes to allow them to keep operating as they provide what is known as base-load generation - power available around the clock. This auction involves bids for capacity; PJM awards the capacity to the generators that can offer the lowest cost. This auction produced a price of $140 per megawatt-day for much of the PJM footprint, compared with  $76.53 last year. That figure was still too low for some of Exelon and FirstEnergy’s plants. Those operators are looking to Washington and individual states for relief to keep operating. Exelon, the biggest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants, said after the auction that it still planned to shut its 805-megawatt Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania in October 2019 and the 615-MW Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey this October. Oyster Creek did not participate in the auction. FirstEnergy Solutions, a bankrupt unit of FirstEnergy Corp, said the auction had no impact on its operations. The company said in March it planned to retire the 1,240-MW Perry and 894-MW Davis-Besse nuclear plants in Ohio and 1,808-MW Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania in 2020 and 2021. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. While the auction was tough on nuclear reactors, it was a boon to energy companies that burn gas and coal to generate power like NRG Energy Inc and Vistra Energy Corp , which both saw their shares rise by nearly 4 percent on Thursday. Exelon and FirstEnergy both said they will continue to work with federal and state officials and PJM on broader market reforms that could keep some reactors from shutting. “Now, more than ever, we need federal, regional and state policymakers to urgently take action to preserve the benefits that our nation’s largest and most resilient source of emissions-free energy provides to our customers,” Kathleen Barrón, Exelon’s senior vice president of government and regulatory affairs and public policy, said in a statement. Nuclear operators have complained that the way energy prices are set in PJM does not compensate them for their contribution to grid resiliency and their ability to produce large amounts of carbon free energy. Some states provide subsidies, including New York and Illinois, and this week, New Jersey passed a bill that will compensate nuclear operators providing power to the state. Resiliency became an issue after U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September 2017 asked federal energy regulators to adopt rules to protect so-called fuel secure coal and nuclear plants from early retirement. “We remain skeptical that long-term federal or state subsidies are likely, but we’re more optimistic about reforms put forward by PJM,” said Katie Bays, an energy analyst at Height Securities in Washington. PJM is testing the resiliency of its grid and is also developing a plan that could change the way the market compensates generators for the energy they produce, which could increase revenues for both coal and nuclear plants. Of the 99 nuclear reactors operating in the United States, capable of generating about 99,300 MW, 33 are in PJM. Those units are capable of producing almost 34,000 MW.

2018-05-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares sank worldwide on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump cancelled a planned June meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, while tariff fears hit auto stocks and safety buying ramped up. Trump, in a letter to North Korea released by the White House, called off the June 12 summit, citing “tremendous anger and open hostility” in a recent statement by Pyongyang. The cancellation came even after North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site.  As investors digested the latest development in the tumultuous U.S.-North Korea relationship, stocks sank, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1 percent, before cutting losses by the close of American markets.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 75.05 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,811.76, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 5.53 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,727.76 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 1.53 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,424.43. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.19 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.63 percent. Meanwhile, some investors took Trump’s message with a grain of salt. “The cancellation generated a knee-jerk risk-off response,” John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in New York. “The longer-term impact should be modest.” Markets had plenty more to digest, including minutes from the latest Fed and European Central Bank meetings, but in Asian and European trading, it was U.S. plans to investigate auto imports that caused the biggest moves. “We are at the mercy of the (Trump) administration, not just on North Korea but on trade with the auto tariffs being announced,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co in New York.  Trump on Wednesday ordered a national security probe into car and truck imports that could lead to new tariffs. China saying it would defend its interests, while the move drew strong criticism abroad and at home where U.S. business groups and members of his own Republican Party warned of damage to the industry and raised the prospect of a global trade war that would harm American interests. Japan's Nikkei .N225 ended down 1.1 percent after Nissan, Mazda and Toyota all fell [.T].  In Europe, German carmakers Daimler (DAIGn.DE), BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) dropped 1.7 to 2.8 percent. Germany's benchmark DAX index .GDAXI fell 0.9 percent and Europe's autos sector .SXAP was the worst-performing, losing 1.8 percent. In the currency markets, Turkey’s lira remained the big mover. It weakened beyond 4.79 against the dollar, surrendering most of the gains made a day earlier after the Turkish central bank raised its key interest rate by 300 basis points to prop up the plunging currency. Investors appeared to bet another hike would be needed to relieve the selloff. As the latest U.S.-North Korea concerns boosted investor appetite for low-risk debt, gold prices XAU= were propelled above $1,300 per ounce. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies .DXY and hit a two-week low against the Japanese yen JPY= on the news. U.S. Treasuries rallied in reaction to Trump’s letter, with benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields US10YT=RR falling to a session low of 2.97 percent.  Treasuries also gained on political strife surrounding Italy’s new eurosceptic, anti-austerity coalition.  Italy’s partners in the euro lined up in Brussels to urge the new government in Rome to stick to EU budget rules or risk following Greece into financial calamity that would hurt the whole of Europe.

Eletropaulo said in a securities filing that a court had changed the rules for the auction, cancelling plans for Enel SpA and Neoenergia SA to make bids on Thursday. According to a person with knowledge of the matter, the order was requested by Neoenergia, controlled by Spain’s Iberdrola SA, as the company claimed the rules allowing for a third party to enter the bidding process without disclosing its price were unfair. The rules suspended by the court requested final bids to be presented by Neoenergia and Enel late on Thursday. Then on June 4, third parties would have been allowed to make competing bids, in which case the two companies could make new offers. Neoenergia argued the rules were unfair as current bidders would have to disclose their strategy beforehand, but not a potential third party, according to the source. The court determined that all contenders will now present their bids together on an auction in the stock exchange on June 4.

2018-05-24,"SAO PAULO, May 24 (Reuters) - A surprise decision by Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA to cut diesel prices in response to truckers’ protests is worrying some potential buyers of Petrobras’ refineries, three people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Petrobras’ planned sale of a 60 percent stake in four refineries, announced on April 19, is part of a wider effort to unload assets to reduce debt. The refineries will be sold in two regional blocks: one in the northeast and another in the southern region of the country, with two refineries each. Petrobras has said it will retain around 75 percent of its domestic refining capacity after the privatization of the four units. Petrobras is hoping to get non-binding proposals in early July, two people with knowledge of the sale process said, asking for anonymity because negotiations are private. Among the groups Petrobras has invited to bid are buyout firms Patria Investimentos Ltda, which has an investment agreement with Blackstone Group LP, and First Reserve Management LP. Other potential buyers are Brazilian firms Ultrapar Participações SA and Cosan SA Industria e Comercio , the sources said. The groups are expected to receive the initial invitations to participate in the process next Monday. But rising pressure on Petrobras to cut fuel prices, sparked by the truckers’ protest this week, has worried some potential acquirers. Petrobras late on Wednesday said it would slash diesel prices by 10 percent for 15 days to ease pressure while the government tries to reach a permanent deal with truckers to ease price pressure more permanently.  The decision triggered a 15 percent plunge in Petrobras shares on Thursday. Two potential investors told Reuters they worry that changes in Petrobras’ pricing policy would strongly affect private competitors, as the state-controlled company plans to keep most of its refining capacity, especially in southeastern Brazil, the country’s wealthiest region. Potential pricing changes to appease the government could create unfair competition, the sources added. Cosan, Pátria, First Reserve did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter. Ultrapar declined to comment. In a conference call with investors on Thursday, Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente, who has insisted that the diesel price cut does not change the company’s overall pricing policy, also said it would not jeopardize the refinery sale plan. But the sources said investors were likely to demand more guarantees related to pricing policies in the refineries sale process as a result.

2018-05-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about $1 on Thursday, with expectations building that reduced supplies from Venezuela and Iran could prompt OPEC to wind down output cuts in place since the start of 2017. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $1.01 to settle at $78.79 a barrel, a 1.27 percent loss. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.13 to settle at $70.71 a barrel, a 1.57 percent loss. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may decide in June to lift output to make up for reduced supply from crisis-hit Venezuela and Iran, which was stung by the U.S. decision to withdraw from the nuclear arms control deal, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said production cuts could be eased “softly” if OPEC and non-OPEC countries see the oil market balancing in June, the Interfax news agency reported. [nL5N1SV35N] Russia and Saudi Arabia have a common position on the future of the oil output cut deal, Novak told Interfax news agency, though he said the deal would stay in place for now. Russia’s Lukoil (LKOH.MM) said the deal should remain in place but needs to be altered. “We still believe that a production increase will still be forthcoming that will become official at next month’s OPEC meeting,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “In the meantime, even the slightest suggestion of such a decision, especially from the Saudis, could force a 1-2 percent price selloff as seen this morning.” Venezuela’s output has fallen to about 1.4 million barrels per day, according to OPEC secondary sources, as its economic crisis grows and state-run PDVSA struggles to pay debts and fund operations. Supply concerns have pushed crude to multi-year highs, with Brent last week breaking above $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014. OPEC and some other major oil producers, scheduled to meet in Vienna next month, previously agreed to curb combined output by about 1.8 million bpd to boost prices and clear a supply glut. Global inventories have been broadly falling, even as U.S. crude production has risen. The United States in February produced 10.3 million bpd, a record.  Oil futures also fell as market participants took profits ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend. “It just feels like reducing exposure in front of a long weekend,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at ICAP-TA in Jersey City, New Jersey. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump called off a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over that nation’s nuclear aims. The news should have pressured oil prices, but the comments weakened the U.S. dollar, which supported crude, Commerzbank strategist Carsten Fritsch said. A weaker dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities less expensive for holders of other currencies.

2018-05-24,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s newly re-elected President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday pledged to release some jailed opposition activists, boost the OPEC member’s tanking oil production and open dialogue with business leaders.  He gave little in the way of specifics and some of the promises were repetitions of previous vows that have not come to pass. Maduro won a Sunday election that critics at home and abroad condemned as a farce cementing his autocracy, at a time when the oil-rich nation is suffering from increasingly dire food shortages, health crises, and mass emigration. Opposition politicians have said it is unlikely that he will make significant changes to the crumbling state-led economic model inherited from his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.  Presenting his credentials at the pro-government Constituent Assembly on Thursday, Maduro said those opposition activists jailed during massive anti-government protests but who have not committed “serious crimes” should be released. “I want these people to be freed to give national reconciliation a chance,” Maduro said in a speech, wearing a sash in the yellow, blue and red colours of the Venezuelan flag. He did not give further details as to which prisoners might be freed. Opposition leaders have generally questioned Maduro’s previous announcements that prisoners would be released, noting some of the country’s best-known political figures - including former mayor Leopoldo Lopez - are still in jail or under house arrest. Earlier on Thursday, a prominent human rights group, Penal Forum, said 15 senior military officials were jailed around the time of the vote, adding to scores of other arrested in what critics call a purge of the armed forces. Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader, also promised to increase Venezuela’s oil production, currently at over 30 year lows, by 1 million barrels-per-day this year, but gave no details.  He instructed Major General Manuel Quevedo, the president of state oil company PDVSA, to reach out to OPEC, allies China and Russia, and Arab nations for help if needed. Maduro said opponents were wrong to blame him for the country’s economic crisis. He dismissed criticism of his re-election as a U.S.-led plan to sabotage him, highlighting recent U.S. sanctions he said would cause “great difficulties.” Maduro’s opponents say he is a reckless autocrat who has no real plan to revive Venezuela’s shambolic economy, raising the risks of more malnutrition and a full-blown refugee crisis.  “No matter what they try now, this revolutionary boat has already sunk because the people have abandoned them. After so much hunger and misery, only a change of model can free us from this tragedy,” tweeted opposition lawmaker Marialbert Barrios.

2018-05-24,"(Recasts, adds detail, quotes) By Denis Pinchuk and Michel Rose ST PETERSBURG, Russia, May 24 (Reuters) - French energy major Total will buy a 10 percent stake in a Russian Arctic gas project under a deal struck during Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Russia, and showing the Kremlin’s ability to find foreign partners despite Western sanctions. Total will buy the minority stake in the Novatek -led Arctic LNG-2 project, which would produce liquefied natural gas, Leonid Mikhelson, the head of Novatek, said on Thursday. The deal was signed in St Petersburg, where French President Emmanuel Macron arrived to take part in an economic forum, seen as Russia’s shop window for attracting foreign investment, and held three hours of talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The agreement solidifies Total’s footprint in Russia, the world’s second-largest natural gas producer after the United States. Novatek, Total and their Chinese partners already started producing gas on the Arctic Yamal peninsula last year. LNG production itself in Russia is not sanctioned, however Russian companies’ ability to raise financing is constrained by the punitive measures introduced for Moscow’s role in Ukrainian conflict and alleged meddling in the U.S. elections in 2016. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne, asked by reporters whether Arctic LNG can be “sanction bullet proof” on the sidelines of Macron’s meeting with Putin, said: “nothing is sanction bullet proof”. “The best way to be sanction bullet proof is to have no sanction,” he said. Novatek was also in talks with Saudi Arabia about a possible participation in the project, which would produce up to 20 million tonnes of the frozen gas in 2022-2023. Mikhelson valued the project at $25.5 billion, saying that the deal with Total, which owns almost 20 percent of Novatek, could be completed in the first quarter of 2019. The final investment decision on Arctic LNG-2 is expected in the second half of 2019. Italy’s Saipem plans to take part in a tender for building a platform base for the project. Total has an option to increase its stake in Arctic LNG-2 by a further 5 percent, Mikhelson said, while Novatek plans to keep its stake at no less than 60 percent in the project. Russia plans to double its share of the global LNG market from about 4 percent now by 2020. Qatar is the biggest LNG exporter, with a 30 percent market share.

2018-05-24,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran continues to comply with the terms of its nuclear deal with world powers despite the U.S. withdrawal, but could be faster and more proactive in allowing snap inspections, the U.N. atomic watchdog policing the accord said on Thursday. In its first such report since U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s pullout on May 8, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran remained within limits on the level to which it can enrich uranium, its stock of enriched uranium and other items.  But the IAEA seemed to rebuke Iran for dragging its feet on so-called “complementary access” inspections under the agency’s Additional Protocol, which Iran is implementing under the deal. Such inspections are often carried out at short notice. “The Agency ... has conducted complementary accesses under the Additional Protocol to all the sites and locations in Iran which it needed to visit,” the IAEA said in a confidential report that was sent to member states and obtained by Reuters. “Timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access would facilitate implementation of the Additional Protocol and enhance confidence,” it said. The report came with France, Britain and Germany scrambling to salvage the deal’s core bargain of sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on Tehran’s atomic activities. Trump is reimposing U.S. sanctions against Tehran, threatening to scupper the deal and prompt Iranian retaliation. The IAEA has repeatedly defended the deal, saying it created “the world’s most robust verification regime”.  Speaking at a news conference with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg, French President Emmanuel Macron said the report went in the “right direction and was comforting”.  Diplomats who follow the agency said an inspection last month went down to the wire, but a senior diplomat also familiar with the IAEA’s work said on Thursday the report was not taking Iran to task. “There was no problem. It’s just an encouragement. The IAEA wants to make sure that there won’t be any problem,” he said, adding that there had been no change in Iranian behaviour either over the first quarter of 2018 or since Trump’s announcement.  Trump sees various “flaws” in the deal, including that many of its restrictions lapse over time and that it does not address Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its role in regional conflicts like the wars in Syria and Yemen. Some Western companies such as French oil giant Total have already said they may have to quit Iran because of the U.S. move. Senior officials from the other countries that signed the deal - France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran - are meeting in Vienna on Friday to discuss next steps. At a meeting with the European Union’s foreign policy chief in Brussels last week, the French, British and German foreign ministers pledged to preserve the deal by trying to keep Iran’s oil and investment flowing, but acknowledged they would struggle to provide the guarantees Tehran seeks. Iran’s supreme leader set out a series of conditions on Wednesday for Iran to stay in the deal, including that European banks should safeguard trade with the Islamic Republic.

2018-05-24,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official said he is not satisfied with Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) efforts to improve accountability after its diesel emissions fraud, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Thursday. “The VW story is not over yet, not for VW and not for the EPA,” the business daily quoted Christopher Grundler, director of the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality as saying. Soon after the emissions scandal broke in September 2015, the German automaker pledged to reform its closed-off corporate culture, seen by experts as a factor that facilitated the cheating, and become a more transparent business. But some senior managers including previous chief executive Matthias Mueller have said the task of learning from past mistakes and introducing change was proving harder than expected as some managers were resisting the transformation. “What matters to the EPA is compliance where the spirit of laws is respected rather than just the text of the law. I absolutely want to hear from VW what their efforts to this end look like and how they make sure that such a thing (like the emissions scandal) will never happen again,” Grundler said. Handelsblatt also quoted Larry Thompson, the U.S. monitor appointed under the 2017 plea agreement to oversee VW for three years, as saying that he is “not at all satisfied” with the progress of culture change. VW on Thursday said Thompson’s findings had uncovered “a need for action” to establish integrity and compliance rules across the multi-brand group as it struggles to overcome the “Dieselgate” scandal. Earlier this week, VW’s head of integrity and legal affairs, Hiltrud Werner, used a speech in Washington to voice her frustration that some staff were resisting the drive for openness and leadership. She gave an example of commonly received pushback: “Well, that diesel scandal was kicked off in technical engineering, so that has nothing to do with us. We have always produced high-quality products; it has nothing to do with us. We didn’t do anything wrong.”         “Everybody needs to understand why it should affect the entire company,” Werner said. Reporting by Andreas Cremer.

Trump, in a letter to North Korea released by the White House, called off the June 12 summit, citing “tremendous anger and open hostility” in a recent statement by the East Asian country. The cancellation came even after North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site. As investors digested the latest development in the tumultuous U.S.-North Korea relationship, stocks sank, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling one percent, before cutting losses in afternoon trading. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 72.77 points, or 0.29 percent, to 24,814.04, the S&P 500 lost 4.87 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,728.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.01 points, or 0.01 percent, to 7,426.96. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.17 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.63 percent. As the latest U.S.-North Korea concerns boosted investor appetite for low-risk debt, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to a session low of 2.97 percent. Gold prices were propelled above $1,300 per ounce on apparently rising tensions between Trump and Kim. Spot gold added 0.9 percent to $1,304.44 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.12 percent to $1,304.00 an ounce. Meanwhile, some investors interpreted Trump’s message with caution. “The market is expressing its disappointment, but this is a short-term tantrum,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. Markets had plenty more to digest, including minutes from the latest Fed and ECB meetings, but in Asian and European trading, it was U.S. plans to investigate auto imports that caused the biggest moves. “What we are seeing is a little more broad. We are at the mercy of the (Trump) administration, not just on North Korea but on trade with the auto tariffs being announced,” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co in New York. Trump on Wednesday ordered a national security probe into car and truck imports that could lead to new tariffs, with China calling the move an “abuse” of the clauses and saying it would defend its interests. Japan’s Nikkei ended down 1.1 percent after Nissan, Mazda and Toyota all fell. In Europe, German carmakers Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen dropped 1.7 to 2.8 percent. Germany’s benchmark DAX index fell 0.9 percent and Europe’s autos sector was the worst-performing, losing 1.8 percent. In the currency markets, Turkey’s lira remained the big mover. It weakened to beyond 4.79 against the dollar, surrendering most of the gains it made a day earlier after the Turkish central bank jacked up its key interest rate by 300 basis points to prop up the plunging currency. Investors appeared to bet another hike would be needed to relieve the selloff. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and hit a two-week low against the Japanese yen, after the U.S.-North Korea meeting was nixed. Oil prices recorded their largest one-day drop in two weeks amid expectations OPEC could wind down an output deal that has been in place since the start of 2017 due to concerns about supplies from Venezuela and Iran. U.S. crude fell 1.04 percent to $71.09 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.17, down 0.79 percent. Additional reporting by Marc Jones, April Joyner, Sruthi

2018-05-24,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on several Iranian and Turkish companies and a number of aircraft in a move targeting four Iranian airlines. The companies targeted were linked to Mahan Air and Meraj Air, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement. It also said it was targeting a number of their aircraft, as well as aircraft from Caspian Airlines and Pouya Air. The United States said the airlines had ferried weapons, fighters and money to proxies in Syria and Lebanon. Washington also threatened sanctions against those granting landing rights and providing services to the aircraft. “The deceptive practices these airlines employ to illegally obtain services and U.S. goods is yet another example of the duplicitous ways in which the Iranian regime has operated,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. The airlines were not immediately available for comment. Washington also targeted three individuals, one from Turkey and two from Iran, who it said were linked to the airlines and aviation firms. The sanctions were the latest in the United States’ efforts to economically strangle Iran with the hopes of blocking the country’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Earlier this month, the United States withdrew from a 2015 nuclear accord that had lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear programme, dismaying U.S. allies who want to preserve it.  The United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency has said that Iran is compliant with the deal, but U.S. President Donald Trump said the entire accord is flawed because restrictions lapse over time and it does not address Iran’s ballistic missile programme or Tehran’s role in regional conflicts. On Tuesday, the United States imposed sanctions on five Iranians it said had provided Yemen’s Houthi movement with weaponry and expertise to launch missiles at cities and oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. Iran’s supreme leader has laid out a number of conditions for Tehran to stay in the deal, and senior officials from the countries still in it — China, France, Germany, Iran, Russia and the United Kingdom — are meeting in Vienna on Friday to discuss the next steps.

2018-05-24,"BOGOTA, May 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A landslide at Colombia’s biggest dam that forced the evacuation of about 26,000 people highlights the risks to communities who have lived the area for generations, according to campaigners who have protested for years over the massive project. The $4 billion Ituango hydroelectric dam in northwestern Colombia has been dogged by protests since construction started in 2010 but was due to start generating power this year as part of a global push into clean renewable energy projects. But campaigners fear the Ituango dam will wreak havoc on the environment and destroy fishing and farming communities and they have been campaigning to stop the dam’s construction. However Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), the public utility company that owns the dam with the government’s local development agency IDEA, says the project will not harm the environment and will create jobs and needed infrastructure. The long-running battle resurfaced this month when people living along the river had to leave their homes for makeshift shelters after rain triggered a landslide that blocked a tunnel used to divert water from the river downstream from the project. As the rains continued, EPM said it was working to plan for a “worst-case scenario” of the dam breaking under pressure. “We are working jointly with all institutions on the worst-case scenario, which is the breaking of the dam, which would provoke a huge flood in down-river municipalities,” said Jorge Londono De La Cuesta, head of EPM. EPM has blamed recent landslides on “unpredictable geological conditions”, but environmentalists said they have become more frequent since construction work started, blaming the felling of trees to clear space, and fear more landslides. “Lately, the river has been full of trunks and trees, and the organic plant material and sediment blocked the tunnel,” said Isabel Zuleta, spokeswoman for Rios Vivos, a local group that has campaigned against the dam. “Today’s emergency isn’t a surprise for us,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Authorities said they are still investigating the cause of the latest crisis, which has exposed the bitter divisions over a project that was aiming to start operating in December and provide about 17 percent of Colombia’s electricity by 2021. EPM, owned by the Medellin city government, was this month put on a negative rating watch by Fitch due to likely delays in the project and concerns over possible cost overruns. Activists have voiced concerns about the environmental impact the dam could have on the surrounding area for years. Zuleta said she has received death threats over her work and this month two Rios Vivos activists were gunned down and killed although it remains unclear who is responsible. “There’s no doubt the threats and killings are related to their opposition to the dam,” said human rights lawyer Luis Carlos Montenegro from the Jose Alvear Restrepo Lawyers Collective. EPM declined to comment on the violence and what is being done to protect activists but has highlighted the project is expected to create 6,000 direct and 24,000 indirect jobs and has led to new drainage systems, health clinics, roads and schools. “This plan has as its principles respect for people, their roots, their ancestry, their traditions and a responsibility to protect natural resources,” EPM said in written comments. The office of Colombia’s attorney general said last week it was investigating “possible environmental damage” in the area as well as the way contracts for the work had been awarded. Up to 800 families have been evicted from their homes to make way for the dam since 2010, according to Rios Vivos and the U.S.-based Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL). The company declined to comment on the evictions. Carla Garcia, a program director at CIEL, which supports Rios Vivos, said the dam’s reservoir would flood 11,120 acres, threatening the livelihoods of many of the 180,000 people who depend on the river for fishing, artisanal mining, and farming. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is putting up finance for the project, said EPM was compensating families directly impacted by the dam, although it did not give figures. Montenegro said some families had got some compensation. ""But this doesn't account for the loss of their culture, the loss of the river and their way of living,"" he said.

2018-05-24,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) clinched a deal with EU antitrust regulators on Thursday to reform its pricing structure and allow rivals a foothold in eastern Europe, avoiding fines in a case that has dragged on for seven years. Europe’s competition enforcer said Gazprom’s concessions allay concerns of market abuse, ending the EU’s longest running antitrust saga that began with dawn raids at 20 offices in 10 countries in 2011. The EU’s decision to accept Gazprom’s offer has allowed it to escape fines of as much as 10 percent of its global turnover - an outcome that has angered Poland and eastern EU countries which have sought a tougher line from Brussels. The outlines of the settlement were mapped out more than a year ago, and finalised earlier this year, as Reuters previously reported. But it was delayed by critical feedback from several of the eight member states in the east at the centre of the case, all countries formerly dominated by Moscow. Many are angered by the move to smooth business ties with Gazprom, run by Alexei Miller, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin - contrasting it with hefty fines against multinationals such as U.S. tech giant Google (GOOGL.O). “It’s a pity,” Lithuania’s Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said of the decision not to fine Gazprom. “But still it’s a step forward,” he told reporters in Vilnius. Europe’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the decision “provides a tailor-made rulebook for Gazprom’s future conduct”. “This case is not about the flag of the company – it is about achieving the outcome that best serves European consumers and businesses,” she stressed.  Gazprom has denied the charges which concerned the three Baltic states, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Deputy Chief Executive Alexander Medvedev said Gazprom was “satisfied”, calling the decision “the most reasonable outcome for the well-functioning of the entire European gas market.” Under the deal, Gazprom will allow clients to ask for lower prices when these diverge from benchmarks such as Western European gas market hubs, scrapping its old system of linking them to oil prices. They may seek price reviews every two years and go to arbitration if a no deal is agreed within 120 days. The Russian gas export monopoly will remove contractual constraints, which prevent clients from reselling its gas. In markets isolated by a lack of pipeline infrastructure, Gazprom will give customers the right to change gas delivery points. Swaps will apply for contracts of at least 18 months at fixed delivery fees, including for relatively small amounts of gas and at short notice of just over four months. “In the countries we are talking about Gazprom is still a dominant player,” Vestager said. In Bulgaria, which is nearly wholly dependent on Gazprom supplies, the transmission network operator will gain greater control over gas flows. Moscow also offered not to seek damages from the Balkan nation over the cancellation of the planned South Stream pipeline under the Black Sea. Many of Gazprom’s concessions are in line with changes in its marketing strategy away from long-term, oil-linked contracts, to which the EU objected, as a sea change in the gas market has eroded its dominance. Europe faces slower growth; it has greater access to alternative energy sources, such as liquefied natural gas and coal; renewables are on the rise; and the EU is moving to make the market more liquid with new regulation and infrastructure. Furthermore, U.S. and EU sanctions over Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis have curtailed Gazprom’s investment plans. “The market has turned into the buyer’s market,” one senior Gazprom source told Reuters. Failure to live up to its promises could still earn Gazprom a fine over the next eight years. By the time the deal expires, Vestager predicted changes in Europe’s gas market will have broken Gazprom’s hold on the market.  “In eight years time we will have another gas market,” she said.

Commenting on an invitation from the bloc to relaunch trilateral gas talks, Naftogaz chief Andriy Kobolev voiced doubts over Russia’s willingness to engage in serious talks. He said Russia’s energy minister has agreed to the talks but not Gazprom. “For the success of the talks, it is important to have Gazprom in the room,” Kobolev told Reuters in Brussels. “I am struggling to understand what outcome we are trying to achieve because ... from what I know they are not ready to give any commitment.” Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow was ready for talks with Ukraine on continued gas transits after their contract expires in 2019, following talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week. Russia’s Gazprom and five European companies, with German backing, plan to build the North Stream 2 gas pipeline on the Baltic seabed to connect Russia directly with Germany. The pipeline bypassing eastern Europe would allow Gazprom to reduce gas flows through Ukraine, costing it valuable transit revenue. Kobolev added that the EU’s decision to settle its antitrust case with Gazprom on Thursday would not bring any positive market changes, saying the commitments were too vague. “It seems Gazprom is getting away with everything,” he said.

2018-05-24,"LONDON, May 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An art installation made of 15,000 plastic bottles went on show at London Zoo on Thursday to highlight the devastating impact of litter on the oceans, as public pressure to tackle the problem grows in Britain. Between five and 14 tonnes of plastic are estimated to enter the world’s oceans every year, causing irreparable damage to marine wildlife and ecosystems. The work by artist Nick Wood represents the 15,000 water bottles bought every minute in Britain, which has committed 61 million pounds ($81.62 million) to develop new ways of tackling plastic waste. “In the middle of the ocean we are finding huge amounts of plastic,” said Fiona Llewellyn, Marine Project Manager at the Zoological Society of London. “In London, the average adult uses 175 single-use plastic water bottles every single year,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. British leaders launched a crackdown on plastic waste after David Attenborough highlighted the devastating impact on marine life last year in his hugely popular Blue Planet II series. The government has already implemented a mandatory charge for every single-use plastic bag and pledged to ban the sale of plastic straws and other single-use products. However, environmental groups said more action was needed. “We’ve heard a lot from the government about their intentions, but rather than more consultations we need hard law to force action on the scale the public wants to see,” said Paul Keenlyside, a Greenpeace spokesman. “The success of the plastic bag charge shows that a smart and well-aimed government intervention can change behaviour and greatly reduce plastic waste.” Plastic recycling around the world is “failing to reach its full potential,” the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned on Thursday. It called for the introduction of higher taxes on the manufacture and use of new plastics and more mechanisms to make consumers pay for single-use plastic bags, cutlery or straws.

2018-05-24,"ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday restrictions on oil production could be eased “softly” if OPEC and non-OPEC countries see the oil market balancing in June, the Interfax news agency reported. Novak said OPEC and non-OPEC countries currently plan to keep in place their deal to cut global oil output, the news agency reported. Separately, Novak said he planned to meet Khalid al-Falih, the energy minister of OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia, later in the day. Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Thursday, with expectations building that OPEC could wind down the output deal in place since the start of 2017, due to supply concerns out of Venezuela and Iran. Novak, speaking in St Petersburg at an economic forum, said he also would meet with Russian oil companies to discuss the oil output deal between OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Novak said the meeting with Russian oil companies could take place either next week or the week after. Russia and Saudi Arabia have a common position on the future of the output-cutting deal, Novak said, while Russia’s Lukoil (LKOH.MM) said the deal should remain in place but needs to be altered. “We have a common position,” Novak said at the forum, which Falih is also expected to attend. The Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large oil producers, notably Russia, have agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of the year. Some oil market participants have expressed concerns about potential oil shortages amid a production decline in Venezuela and after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to pull the United States out of a nuclear deal with Iran. Saudi Arabia has indicated that it could raise its oil output to offset any potential supply deficit. Vagit Alekperov, head of Russia’s No.2 oil company Lukoil, which produces over 1.7 million bpd, said it was time to raise oil production as prices had hit $80 per barrel, a level not seen since late 2014. OPEC and non-OPEC countries will meet in June in Vienna to discuss their cooperation and the future of the deal. “I hope that minister Novak will gather us before the meeting ... the oil price at $80 is already high,” Alekperov said.

2018-05-24,"LONDON, May 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Canadian scientists have collaborated with Hong Kong climate campaigners to create meat-free dumplings in the hope of persuading the world’s biggest carnivores to stop pigging out. China eats more meat than any other nation - twice the amount consumed by Americans alone - and a campaigning Hong Kong business is launching a more sustainable, plant-based diet that it says has less impact on global warming. But all of the taste. “Just to tell people what not to do is not going to solve the problem. You’ve got to give them alternatives,” David Yeung, founder of Green Monday, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Climate change, water scarcity, food insecurity, these are mega, giant problems. The easiest way to help the planet is to reduce meat consumption,” the business founder said. Green Monday was founded in 2012 as a social enterprise -  a business with a mission to benefit society as well as turn a profit. It will launch Omnipork at its six Green Common foodstores, all in Hong Kong, at the beginning of June. It is the latest alt-meat product aimed at carnivores open to ethical alternatives with less environmental fallout. Scientists attribute nearly 15 percent of global greenhouse gases to meat production. The industry is the largest driver of global environmental change due to feed production, land use and methane emissions, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO). China consumes a lot more meat than any other country. People ate about 74 million tonnes of pork, beef and poultry in 2017, about twice as much as the United States, according to U.S. government estimates. Omnipork is the first food product from Green Monday, which campaigns for people to ditch meat at least once a week. Made of shiitake mushroom, rice and pea protein, the new food will initially only be available in prepared dishes such as dumplings and a traditional Asian dish of dan dan noodles. As well as running grocery stores, the social enterprise has an online directory of restaurants with vegetarian menus and has invested in Beyond Meat, a California-based firm that produces a burger made from plants. Yeung said it took Canadian food scientists about 18 months to achieve the right texture, moistness and taste that means the product is “almost indistinguishable” from real pork. Nearly three quarters of consumers globally are limiting or avoiding meat altogether, according to GlobalData, a data analysis company that surveyed nearly 27,000 people in 36 countries, including China. ""The shift toward plant-based foods is being driven by millennials, who are most likely to consider the food source, animal welfare issues, and environmental impacts,"" Fiona Dyer, a consumer analyst at GlobalData, said in a statement.

2018-05-24,"MILAN/MADRID, May 24 (Reuters) - A bitter feud over a Brazilian power grid operator has taken a global rivalry to new levels as Europe’s top two utilities ready $1.5 billion-plus bids for Eletropaulo. Brazil’s biggest power distributor became one of the world’s most prized power assets last month when Italy’s Enel and Spain’s Iberdrola locked horns in a country both see as key to expansion, virtually doubling its value overnight. Although Enel outdid Iberdrola in an early skirmish with a 32.2 reais per share bid for Eletropaulo, best offers are due on Thursday in a complex bidding process, with sources close to the auction saying there could be room to raise the bar. Shares in Eletropaulo, which has a market value of 5.8 billion reais ($1.6 billion), stood at 35.4 reais on Thursday, indicating the market expected higher offers. “We are ready to keep on participating in the process, but for strategic reasons I can’t tell you to which point,” the chairman of Iberdrola’s Brazil unit Neoenergia Mario Jose Ruiz-Table said last week. Earlier this month Neoenergia agreed debt issuance of 5.5 billion reais ($1.51 billion) and got consent from its main shareholders to make new offers for Eletropaulo. Meanwhile Enel, which generates more than 25 percent of its earnings in South America, is said to have financial firepower of up to 15 billion euros for acquisitions. But the price tag has left some investors concerned the utilities could be overpaying, despite obvious synergies with their other businesses in Latin America’s most populous country. Brazil’s power company Energisa SA dropped out of the race in May while sources said CPFL, the Brazilian power group owned by China State Grid Corp, gave up to focus on other assets, deeming the price too rich. “The aggressive bidding surprised me. Given their rivalry in Spain, it looks to me like this might have become a question of principle,” Roberto Lottici, fund manager at Ifigest and an Enel shareholder, said. The Chilean minority shareholders of Enel’s Americas unit have said they oppose the takeover and are not happy with the idea of Enel Americas financing the potential deal. Enel, which controls Spanish utility Endesa, is competing with Iberdrola in Spain and Latin America and recently another front opened in Italy. The face-off in Brazil has frayed tempers further, leading Iberdrola to write to the European Commission in April alleging state-controlled Enel was taking investment decisions it would not be able to do were it not government-backed. Brazil is a strategic market for Iberdrola. It helped drive a 24 percent rise in core profits in the first quarter and will absorb a fifth of a 32 billion euro investment plan to 2020. Buying Eletropaulo would boost its client base in the country to more than 20 million with 625,000 km of grid. For Enel, a deal would nearly double its Brazilian client base to 17 million. Europe’s biggest utility, which last year bought Brazilian power distributor Celg-D for $647 million, said in April it was keen to grow in the country. Last week a source told Reuters that Enel would look at any assets of Portugal’s EDP, which is the subject of a bid by China Three Gorges, after a breakup of the utility, which has generation and distribution in Brazil. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a recent report that despite high multiples, an Eletropaulo deal could be 1 percent accretive for Enel by 2021 but 2.4 percent for Iberdrola due to the geographical proximity of assets. Brazil is the third biggest electricity producer in the Americas with strong growth potential and energy consumption is set to grow 60 percent by 2040, the latest BP Energy Outlook report says. After years of under-investment and government interference, Brazil has taken steps to improve regulation and investor returns to attract utilities to help upgrade its infrastructure. A source with knowledge of the matter said the average duration of a blackout on the Celg-D grid was 1,861 minutes compared to 43 minutes in Italy. “That’s a lot of revenue that can be recouped just by streamlining the grid,” the source said. Thursday is the last day for offers from Enel and Iberdrola ahead of registration on June 4. Unless, that is, a new investor appears in which case everybody will be allowed to raise bids at a June 4 auction.

2018-05-24,"* Dubai closes down, ending two-day rally * Jabal Omar pulls Saudi down * Abu Dhabi, Qatar close higher but volumes remain weak By Katie Paul DUBAI, May 24 (Reuters) - Qatari stocks led regional gains on Thursday after the government announced it was moving ahead with a draft law to allow full foreign ownership of companies. Qatar’s index rose 0.6 percent, despite lingering questions about how the plan differed from a similar draft law proposed in 2016. Non-Qatari investors would still be limited to 49 percent stakes in listed companies. Gains were led by Qatar Islamic Bank, which rose 2.1 percent. The announcement came days after the United Arab Emirates cabinet decided to open certain sectors to 100 percent foreign investment, while also granting residency visas of up to 10 years to investors and some professionals. Dubai’s stock index edged up 0.3 percent, with property developers like Emaar Malls and Damac Properties among the biggest winners. Property stocks surged early this week after the foreign investment announcement, but then lost momentum because of a lack of details about the plan and uncertainty over whether it will make much difference to demand for local real estate. Dubai amusement park operator DXB Entertainments also pulled the market higher as it continued a rebound from record lows in heavy trade, closing up 3.4 percent at 0.42 dirhams. DXB has been on a downtrend for almost two years because of losses suffered by the company and worse-than-expected attendance numbers, but has gained 16.5 percent over the last four days. The median target price of seven analysts covering the stock is 0.73 dirham, according to Thomson Reuters data. In Abu Dhabi, the index climbed 0.3 percent as energy investment firm TAQA jumped 4.9 percent; it is up 133 percent year-to-date on the back of strong oil prices. The Saudi index closed roughly flat after profit-taking in some banks. National Commercial Bank lost 0.4 percent, while SABB lost 2.8 percent. Appliance maker and distributor Shaker added 2.6 percent in early trade, but ultimately slid back to close down 2.6 percent. It had begun to surge on Wednesday after a subsidiary signed a memorandum of understanding with Signify , formerly known as Philips Lighting, to conduct efficiency studies and retrofitting across Saudi Arabia. In Oman, the index edged up 0.2 percent as Al Izz Islamic Bank surged 3.9 percent. Al Izz said Oman Arab Bank, a much bigger company which is a subsidiary of Oman International Development and Investment Co (OMINVEST), had proposed a strategic collaboration that might lead to an eventual merger. OMINVEST closed flat. * The index was flat at 8,038 points. * The index rose 0.3 percent to 2,954 points. * The index rose 0.3 percent to 4,601 points. * The index rose 0.6 percent to 9,049 points. * The index was down 0.7 percent to 4,688 points. * The index was down 0.3 to 1,263 points. * The index was up 0.2 percent to 4,564 points. * The index was down 0.2 percent to 16,634 points. $1 = 3.6728 UAE dirham

2018-05-24,"VIENNA, May 24 (Reuters) - Iran has stayed within the main curbs on its nuclear activity imposed by its deal with major powers despite the U.S. pullout from the pact, but could be quicker to provide extra access to inspectors, the U.N. atomic watchdog indicated on Thursday. In its first such report since President Donald Trump announced Washington’s withdrawal on May 8, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had complied with limits on the level to which it can enrich uranium, its stock of enriched uranium and other items. It did, however, rebuke Iran for dragging its feet over so-called “complementary access” inspections under the IAEA’s Additional Protocol, which Iran is implementing under the deal. “The Agency ... has conducted complementary accesses under the Additional Protocol to all the sites and locations in Iran which it needed to visit,” the IAEA said in a confidential report that was sent to member states and seen by Reuters. “Timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access would facilitate implementation of the Additional Protocol and enhance confidence,” it said. The report came with France, Britain and Germany scrambling to salvage the deal’s core bargain of sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on nuclear fuel production. Trump is reimposing U.S. sanctions against Tehran, threatening to scupper the deal and prompt Iranian retaliation. Trump sees various “flaws” in the deal, including that many of its restrictions lapse over time and that it does not address Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its role in regional conflicts like the wars in Syria and Yemen. Some Western companies like French oil giant Total have already said they may have to quit Iran because of the U.S. move. Senior officials from the other countries that signed the deal - France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran - are meeting in Vienna on Friday to discuss next steps.

2018-05-24,"MOSCOW/VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian energy company OMV (OMVV.VI) is looking to buy some of Gazprom’s (GAZP.MM) Siberian assets outright after Norway voiced opposition to plans by the two firms to swap assets, sources told Reuters. In 2016 OMV agreed to swap 38.5 percent of its Norway assets for 24.98 percent of a section of Gazprom’s Urengoy gas field. But Norway is not happy with that plan because it would give the Russian company access to its continental shelf, the Norwegian energy minister told Reuters last week. The swap deal was meant to close by mid-2017 but still has not been finalised. OMV has said it now expects closure by year-end, saying talks are being complicated by corporate governance issues.  In recent talks, the two companies discussed several options, including cancelling the swap for an outright payment, one source familiar with the talks said.   “There are different options, including this one,” the source said about the possibility of payments by OMV. Another source, also familiar with the talks, said that OMV may buy Gazprom assets in Siberia instead of swapping for them. OMV and Gazprom declined to comment.   OMV Chief Executive Rainer Seele told the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday that talks with Gazprom were ongoing and that OMV remained confident that it could close the asset swap deal by the end of the year. With the non-cash deal, Austria’s largest energy group aimed to replenish its weakening reserves with access to low-cost oil and gas fields while the Russian gas giant hoped to benefit from diversifying its geographic footprint.    OMV is now in a stronger financial position than it was in 2016 and can easily afford to buy the assets, avoiding potential trouble with the Norwegian government.   OMV has announced plans to spend 10 billion euros on acquisitions and has so far spent 3 billion euros of that on oil concessions in the Middle East. CEO Seele told shareholders this week he was ready to buy additional assets in Russia.  Russia’s President Vladimir Putin will visit Vienna on June 5 to celebrate 50 years of Russian gas deliveries to OMV.

2018-05-24,"(Corrects Brent price in paragraph 2) * U.S. crude, gasoline inventories rise unexpectedly -EIA * Brent-WTI spread near widest in three years * OPEC set to meet next month to discuss policy By Amanda Cooper LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices recorded their largest one-day drop in two weeks on Thursday, with expectations building that OPEC will end an output deal that has been in place since the start of 2017 due to concerns about supplies from Venezuela and Iran. Benchmark Brent futures were down $1.08 at $78.72 a barrel by 1118 GMT, its largest one-day fall since May 8, while U.S. crude futures dropped 86 cents to $70.98 a barrel. “This discussion about possible OPEC supply increases after the June meeting has put a brake on the oil price for the time being, so $80 is a big hurdle to overcome,” Commerzbank strategist Carsten Fritsch said. “If prices get above there, that will further intensify and increase the likelihood that OPEC will do something .. It’s going to be very difficult to overcome this level on a sustainable basis before the OPEC meeting.” The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may decide in June to lift output to make up for reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela and in response to concerns from Washington about a rally in oil prices, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters. Venezuela’s output has fallen amid an economic crisis, while Iran’s supply is threatened by U.S. sanctions. These factors have helped push Brent and WTI to multi-year highs, with Brent breaking through an $80 threshold last week for the first time since November 2014. “The chat is still that OPEC will do something at its June meeting in reaction to the looming prospect of a fall in crude production and exports from both Iran and Venezuela as the year progresses,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. OPEC and some non-OPEC major oil producers, which are scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 22, previously agreed to curb their combined output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to boost oil prices and clear a supply glut. Global inventories have been broadly falling. But commercial U.S. crude inventories rose C-STK-T-EIA by 5.8 million barrels in the week to May 18, beating analyst expectations for a drop of 1.6 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. The premium of Brent crude over U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures neared $8 a barrel, close to its widest in three years. CL-LCO1=R Inventories of gasoline rose by 1.9 million barrels in the same week, just ahead of the Memorial Day holiday in the United States which typically marks the start of the summer driving season. Refinery runs fell 7,000 bpd to 16.63 million bpd, 3.8 percent below the same week last year, according to the EIA data.

2018-05-24,"* U.S. to promote nuclear as clean energy * Other countries reducing exposure to nuclear after Fukushima * Initiative seeks to combine nuclear with wind,solar * Graphic: Nuclear power plants in the world (Adds detail, Brouillette quote) COPENHAGEN, May 24 (Reuters) - The United States is leading an initiative with several other governments to promote nuclear power and encourage investment in new nuclear technologies. The initiative, launched on Thursday by U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette with international partners, aims to “highlight the value of nuclear energy as a clean reliable energy source”. The partners are Japan, Canada, Russia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Poland, Argentina and Romania. The U.S. nuclear industry is battling competition particularly from natural gas, while many national governments want to reduce their dependency on the energy source after the nuclear accident at Japan’s Fukushima plant in 2011. The group of nations aims to promote areas such as improved power system integration and the development of technologies like hybrid nuclear-renewable systems. “Nuclear-renewable systems could link emission-free nuclear power plants with variable renewables like solar or wind farms and could allow nuclear power to backstop intermittent generation,” Brouillette said during the launch at the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) in Copenhagen. CEM is a global forum of 24 countries and the European Union which together account for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Brouillette said the initiative would also focus on the development of small modular reactors (SMR), which use existing or new nuclear technology scaled down to a fraction of the size of larger plants and would be able to produce around a tenth of the electricity created by large-scale projects. Critics say SMR economies of scale will be limited because each reactor will need its own control and safety systems. They also point to the danger of spreading radioactive material more widely, increasing radiation and security risks. The administration of President Donald Trump also launched an alliance with Norway and Saudi Arabia to boost public and private partnerships on carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Earlier this month, Japan released a draft of an updated basic energy policy, leaving its ideal mix of power sources for 2030 in line with targets set three years ago, despite criticism that it placed too much emphasis on unpopular nuclear power.

Markets had plenty to digest including minutes from the latest Fed and ECB meetings, but in Asian and European trading it was U.S. plans to investigate auto imports that caused the biggest moves. Japan’s Nikkei ended down 1.1 percent after Nissan, Mazda and Toyota all fell. In Europe, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen lost between 2.8 to 3.2 percent. The broader market also gave up morning gains on reports Deutsche Bank planned to shed at least 7,000 staff  and as Wall Street futures went negative. “The carmakers are getting a bit of a bashing, which is not really surprising following Trump’s comments overnight,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. “Personally, I think he is playing to his voter base, but in the broader context of the trade story it is not positive.” The worry for economists is that the move could lead to tariffs similar to those imposed on steel and aluminium in March . Trump had also called for “a different structure” in any trade deal with China, fuelling uncertainty over the negotiations. Beijing had fired back, calling the car investigation an abuse of national security clauses . In the currency markets, Turkey’s lira remained the big mover. It weakened as much as 3 percent, surrendering most of the gains it made the previous evening after the country’s central bank jacked up its key interest rate by 300 basis points to prop up the plunging currency. Investors have sold the lira on concern about the central bank’s ability to tame double-digit inflation, particularly after President Tayyip Erdogan - a self-described “enemy of interest rates” - said he expected to assert more policy control after June 24 elections. The lira, which initially gained in early trade, weakened to as much as 4.7414 to the dollar from a close of 4.59. It hit a record low of 4.9290 on Wednesday before the central bank move. “There is one question,” said Aberdeen Standard Investment’s Viktor Szabo. “Is it enough or not? And I would think it’s not enough”. The dollar dipped after Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday indicated its policymakers weren’t looking to raise U.S. interest rates too fast, though another rise will be warranted “soon” if the economy stays on track. It helped the euro off its recent six-month low even though minutes from the European Central Bank’s meeting this month showed more concern about a economic slowdown. It was aided too after China signalled its confidence in the shared currency and as calm returned to Italian bond markets. Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday gave political novice Giuseppe Conte a mandate to lead the first government in Italy made up of anti-establishment parties that have vowed to shake up the European Union. “I’m preparing now to defend the interests of all Italians in all places, in Europe and internationally,” Conte told reporters after holding two hours of talks with Mattarella. Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell 5 basis points to 2.36 percent, pulling back from Wednesday’s 14-month highs. The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap was 7 bps tighter at 183 bps. That is still well below benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which have drifted back to 3 percent in recent days. It has been part of a broader flight to safety across financial markets. The dollar was down 0.3 percent against the yen to 109.92. “With Trump’s unpredictable behaviour leaving investors on edge, the Japanese yen has scope to appreciate further in the short term,” said Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at FXTM. In commodities markets, U.S. crude was down 1.2 percent at just under $71 a barrel. Oil prices fell on Wednesday after an unexpected rise in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories . Brent futures were 1.3 percent lower at $78.80 a barrel, continuing to move lower after rising above $80 last week for the first time since November 2014 The most-traded iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose for the first time in six sessions on Thursday, gaining 0.3 percent. Weak commodity prices continued to put pressure on Australian shares, which ended 0.2 percent lower, extending losses into a sixth consecutive session. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was 0.7 percent higher. Gold was slightly higher with spot gold trading at $1,296 per ounce. Additional Reporting by Andrew Galbraith in Shanghai, editing

2018-05-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Budget airline Wizz Air sees profit soaring again this year as bigger, more efficient A321 planes help it to keep costs down, putting it on course to outshine larger rival Ryanair which is more pessimistic about prospects.  Wizz, which mainly serves passengers in central and eastern Europe, said on Thursday that profit could climb as much as 24 percent in the 12 months to the end of next March, boosting its shares by 4.5 percent. By contrast Europe’s biggest low cost airline Ryanair said this week that its profits would fall for the first time in five years, hit by higher fuel and staffing costs and flat fares. Wizz Air is also expecting labour costs to rise this year, but said the growing proportion of Airbus A321 aircraft in its fleet gave it an advantage as the planes were more fuel efficient and carried more passengers. Overall it was guiding for costs excluding fuel to fall by 1 percent.  “That is a significantly different position from our competitors. You are seeing cost creep with all of them,” Wizz Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi told Reuters.  For the 12 months to March 31, Wizz reported net profit of 275 million euros (£241 million), a 22 percent jump on the year before.  “Overall, this is a very positive outlook,” Goodbody analysts said. All airlines are facing higher fuel costs because the price of crude oil has climbed to above $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014.  Wizz said it was confident it could pass on the rise to customers and even saw benefits from the impact of a high fuel price environment.  “That will put pressure on the weak performing airlines and almost all of central and eastern Europe’s incumbent national carriers perform very vulnerably with no profitability and no liquidity so we will see what happens to them,” Varadi told investors.  Wizz, like its larger low-cost rivals Ryanair and easyJet, aims to steal market share when the oil price rises and higher-cost carriers are forced to withdraw unprofitable capacity from the market.  Last year capacity left the market when UK airline Monarch collapsed, allowing Budapest-headquartered Wizz to expand in Britain when it bought slots that became available at London’s Luton airport.  When asked about Wizz’s interest in Norwegian, a budget carrier which has needed to raise funds to shore up its balance sheet and has rejected two approaches from IAG,  Varadi said his company would remain opportunistic. “We don’t know what’s going to happen to Norwegian but if that creates capacity opportunities for us one way or another then yes we would certainly consider it,” he said, highlighting Wizz’s Monarch deal as an example of what was possible.

Output, which fell to 146,000 bpd on Wednesday, will rise further on Friday to between 200,000 bpd and 220,000 bpd if the power supply remains stable, a company official said, asking not to be identified. That would still be below a recent average of up to 260,000 bpd. Libya’s Raguba oilfield, which is operated by Sirte Oil company and produces 5,000 barrels a day, also resumed pumping crude to the eastern port of Brega after a protest stopped flows on Wednesday, a port official said on Thursday. AGOCO and Sirte Oil are both subsidiaries of the state-run National Oil Corporation (NOC). AGOCO was forced to halt production at the Massala field on Wednesday after temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius, hitting power supplies, while the Sarir field had similar problems. Libya, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has not released its oil production figure for months. Industry sources had put it at 1 million bpd before the power cut hit AGOCO. At the Raguba oilfield, a Sirte official said youths demanding improved state services who had blocked production had ended their blockade after the company intervened. Protesters in the remote Marada region of eastern Libya, home to the Raguba and other oil assets, have frequently staged protests, demanding that authorities urgently deal with grievances over the absence of government, a shortage of healthcare and other services. “We convinced the youth that oil production was needed to execute development projects,” the official said after the meeting between Sirte, local officials and protesters in Brega. Libya has been in turmoil since the toppling of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Some youths had also protested about a lack of road links from Marada town to other communities and demanded jobs, officials have said, a common grievance in Libya. Armed groups have twice blown up the pipeline near Marada since December as security in the remote eastern area is volatile.

2018-05-24,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine has put Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, whose company Rusal (0486.HK) owns a large alumina plant in the country, and other prominent Russians on an expanded sanctions list, a document on the president’s website showed on Thursday. It was not clear what effect the blacklisting would have as many Russian companies have already sought to wind up their Ukraine-linked activities due to earlier sanctions. But restrictions on Deripaska could affect the operations of the Mykolaiv plant in southern Ukraine, which is the second-largest alumina asset of his aluminium business Rusal. The Mykolaiv plant did not respond to a request for comment. Kiev first implemented sanctions against hundreds of Russian companies and entities after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and over its support for a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine. Earlier in May it expanded these restrictions to mirror those of the United States, which blacklisted officials and businesspeople around President Vladimir Putin in April. This was one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity”. Ukraine’s updated list was published online on Thursday, confirming sanctions on Deripaska as well as on other Russian tycoons such as Viktor Vekselberg, owner of Renova holding group, and Alexei Miller, the CEO of Russia’s gas exporter Gazprom (GAZP.MM). The additions to the list also include the Ukraine operations of Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. It did not reply to a request for comment.  On May 15, Ukrainian state security agents searched RIA Novosti’s Kiev office and detained its director, accusing RIA of being used in an “information war” by Russia against Ukraine. Kiev says the Kremlin uses an array of tactics to undermine and destabilise Ukraine, spreading propaganda while supporting the eastern separatists with troops and sophisticated weaponry and launching cyber attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. Moscow denies the accusations.

2018-05-24,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Vistra Energy Corp and Dominion Energy Inc – which serve about 5.5 million electricity customers in more than a dozen U.S. states – both say they are done building combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plants. Instead, they are building large solar plants, which offer plentiful and inexpensive electricity. This bearish view of fossil-fuel energy, reflective of a growing acceptance by utilities of renewable power sources, poses a hurdle to John Flannery’s plan to turn around General Electric Co’s $35 billion-a-year power unit. GE’s chief executive spelled out the difficulty on Wednesday. Power profits will be flat this year after falling 53 percent in 2017, he said, and GE is planning that demand for heavy-duty natural gas power plants will be less than half what it forecast just over a year ago, and will stay at that level through 2020. New plant sales are “going to be tough,” Flannery said at an investor conference on Wednesday. “This is not going to be a quick fix, but there is, at the end of the day, long-life assets here with intrinsic economic value. We’re going to make the most of what we have there.” In the long run, Flannery and Russell Stokes, the head of GE Power, have said demand for electricity and natural gas power generators will grow about 2 percent a year - in line with global forecasts - as utilities make a gradual transition to renewable power. Following a strategy he laid out in November, Flannery is cutting 12,000 jobs and $2.5 billion in costs at the unit. On Wednesday, he said GE has tripled some sales incentives in the power division and is competing aggressively for new contracts to maintain plants and to get the call when utilities need parts or repairs during an unexpected outage, something of which GE had lost sight. But some analysts and investors are skeptical about the long-term prospects of a business devoted to natural gas and coal power plants that are falling out of favor with utilities. The competition from solar and wind, along with abundant low-priced gas produced by fracking, is curbing orders for new plants and forcing the closure of old ones. Some utilities are even filing for bankruptcy. “That means companies are going to have trouble selling new fossil-fuel plants,” said Mark Dyson, a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an organization that researches the power industry. Over 126 years, GE has weathered ups and downs in power market before, and has legions of sales and service people around the world. Last year it booked 26 orders for its newest gas turbines in Mexico, Bangladesh and elsewhere. It is investing in its separate, $10 billion-a-year renewables unit focused on wind and hydro, which saw revenue fall 6 percent last year. GE also sells battery storage, software and smart-grid technology to work with wind and solar systems. GE power equipment orders - an indicator of future sales - fell 41 percent in the first quarter, accelerating from a 17 percent drop last year, according to GE’s earnings reports. GE’s performance reflects the broader trend of utilities shifting to renewables from fossil fuels. Global sales of large natural gas power plants have fallen by half since 2013, according to McCoy Power Reports. Coal and gas-fired plants accounted for just 38 percent of new electricity capacity financed globally last year, down from 71 percent a decade ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Solar and wind now draw 53 percent of such investment, up from 22 percent, a Reuters analysis shows. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2I7QAxf Rivals Siemens AG and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are cautious about the scope for growth. “We see a structural change,” Lisa Davis, the chief executive officer of Siemens Corp, the U.S. unit, said in an interview. “There are fewer large units being sold globally than there were five years ago. I don’t see that changing dramatically going forward.” Siemens is cutting 6,100 power and gas jobs to adjust. Many utilities share the view that the shift is permanent because it is driven by economics rather than government policy and climate-change concerns. While conventional power plants will continue to be built, sales may never reach the levels seen just two years ago, industry experts said. With electricity prices trending downward, utilities are increasingly unwilling to risk capital on a new plant unless then can lock in a long-term price, executives said. “Building new large, combined-cycle gas plants is challenging without the stability of a long-term power contract,” said Timothy Menzie, chief executive officer of InterGen, an international power generation company. GE faces a further challenge: long-term erosion of the large base of plants it services. After acquiring the Alstom power business in 2015, GE has a base of customers that produces one-third of the world’s electricity. Long-term contracts to service those plants bring GE billions of dollars in annual revenue. But as utilities close older coal and gas-fired plants, the revenue growth from services is under pressure. Wind and solar can cost as little as $18 a megawatt hour, compared with $40 for a large gas plant, said Mikael Backman, North America regional director at Wartsila Energy Solutions, part of the Finnish company that makes quick-start natural gas-fired generators. Across much of the United States, some utilities now buy all the cheap renewable power they can on electricity markets and use quick-start gas engines to fill in when wind and sun falter. In California, regulators have put on hold a project that planned to buy one of GE’s large natural-gas turbines while Southern California Edison, which planned to buy the power, studies using wind and solar instead. The shift from fossil fuels stretches beyond states like California, which is aggressively switching to renewable power. In oil-rich Texas, wind and solar now provide 21 percent of the state’s electricity. Utilities there are shutting down the equivalent of about 20 average-sized coal plants this year, according a Reuters analysis of data from power system operator ERCOT. Out of 183 power-generation projects on the drawing boards, only four would run on fossil fuels, ERCOT said. The rest are wind and solar. ExGen Texas Power, an affiliate of Exelon Corp, filed for bankruptcy protection in November for five natural-gas plants, the second such bankruptcy in Texas last year attributed to low power prices. GE supplied parts and service to several of the plants, according to the bankruptcy filings. Reuters could not determine whether the contracts will remain in effect. In Virginia, Dominion Energy ended several maintenance contracts it had with GE this year when it mothballed a large gas-fired plant built by companies GE later acquired and idled seven other coal and natural gas units in the state. Dominion aims to build 4,720 megawatts of solar by 2033, the equivalent of about five large combined-cycle power plants. It is opening a new combined-cycle natural-gas plant in Virginia this year, built with GE and Mitsubishi equipment. It said it has no current plans to build more such plants. “Solar is very cheap,” spokesman Dan Genest said. “These units were just not cutting it.” Reporting By Alwyn Scott; editing by Joe White and Edward

2018-05-24,"* Current rules from 2015 are for 20 pct bio-content * Country pushing to boost palm oil consumption, cut fuel imports * New rules could more than double palm oil used for biodiesel (Adds govt estimate on 2019 FAME demand) By Bernadette Christina Munthe JAKARTA, May 24 (Reuters) - Indonesia will make it mandatory for biodiesel to have a bio-content of at least 25 percent from 2019, an energy ministry official said on Thursday, as the country pushes to boost local consumption of palm oil. New and Renewable Energy Director Rida Mulyana sent a text message saying the policy would start in 2019 in response to questions on the matter from Reuters. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of palm oil, the raw ingredient for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), which can be used to make biodiesel. Mulyana later said he estimates the B25 programme, for which guidelines are currently being discussed by the energy ministry, would bring Indonesia’s FAME consumption to between 5.5 million and 6 million kilolitres (kl) in 2019. That would be more than double the last year’s consumption of FAME. The government is pushing to increase domestic biodiesel usage to reduce oil imports and soak up excess palm oil supply. It is also considering expanding mandatory biodiesel use to include trains and the mining sector. Rules introduced in 2015 require a 20 percent bio-content in biodiesel for land transportation from January 2016 to January 2020, after which a 30 percent bio-content would be mandatory. Fadil Hasan, Executive Director of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI), said the B25 mandate would require the additional production of 750,000 kl of FAME annually. Last month, Mulyana said Indonesia was targeting consumption of between 3.28 million and 3.52 million kl of FAME this year, up from 2.57 million kl in 2017. Indonesian palm oil producers are facing increasing pressure in markets such as Europe due to concerns over environmental damage related to deforestation. In the United States, Indonesian biodiesel faces steep anti-subsidy measures, as well as anti-dumping duties.

Europe, in contrast, was set for a quiet start. Financial speadbetters expect Britain’s FTSE 100 to open 5 points lower, Germany’s DAX to lose 4 points and France’s CAC 40 to open flat. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was about 0.1 percent higher, but Japan’s Nikkei stock index fell 1.1 percent as auto shares slumped. South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.2 percent. A broad MSCI index of car and car parts companies fell 1.1 percent. Tokyo’s SE TOPIX transport equipment index lost 3 percent. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday that it would launch a national security investigation into car and truck imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a move that could lead to tariffs like those imposed on steel and aluminium in March. Adding to market jitters, Trump on Wednesday called for “a different structure” in any trade deal with China, fuelling uncertainty over the negotiations. On Thursday, China’s Commerce Ministry said it had not pledged to cut China’s trade surplus with the U.S. by “a certain figure”, and that it hoped the United States implemented measures promised during trade negotiations as soon as possible. It also said it “opposes the abuse of national security clauses,” referring to the U.S. Commerce Department’s probe into auto imports. China’s blue chip CSI 300 index was 0.7 percent lower. Prompting further uncertainty, Trump on Wednesday cast doubt on plans for an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying he would know next week whether the meeting would take place. “There’s a lot of noise around Donald Trump, China-U.S. trade, the auto imports now, and then the Korean summit, and all these things are just weighing on investors at the moment,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney. “I think we probably would have seen a decent day in Asian markets were it not for these ongoing geopolitical worries because the minutes from the Fed’s last meeting were relatively benign.” While the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s May 1-2 meeting indicated that policymakers expect another interest rate increase would be warranted “soon” if the U.S. economic outlook remains intact, they helped to ease market concerns that the Fed would accelerate the pace of interest rate increases. The two-year Treasury note yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5202 percent after touching 2.5970 on Wednesday. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 3.0008 percent after earlier falling to 2.9770 percent. Analysts said that market uncertainty was prompting a clear flight to safety across financial markets. The dollar was down 0.6 percent against the yen to 109.47 . “With Trump’s unpredictable behaviour leaving investors on edge, the Japanese yen has scope to appreciate further in the short term,” said Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at FXTM. “However, a strengthening dollar on the back of heightened U.S. rate hike expectations could limit the yen’s upside gains.” The euro was up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1707. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.1 percent lower at 93.874. Concerns over trade, talks and tariffs overshadowed strong economic indicators in two of the region’s major economies. Confidence among Japanese manufacturers saw its first rise in fourth months, and service-sector sentiment rose to a record high in the latest Reuters Tankan poll, underscoring expectations that the Japanese economy will return to growth in the second quarter. In South Korea, Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said the economy is on track for annual growth of 3 percent despite worrying factors such as high youth unemployment. The Bank of Korea held interest rates steady for a sixth straight month on Thursday, with inflation seen remaining below target and amid concerns a U.S.-China trade war would hurt regional economies. In commodities markets, U.S. crude was down 0.3 percent at $71.63 a barrel. Oil prices fell on Wednesday after an unexpected rise in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories. Brent futures were 0.4 percent lower at $79.50 a barrel, continuing to move lower after rising above $80 last week for the first time since November 2014 . The most-traded iron ore futures contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose for the first time in six sessions on Thursday, gaining 1 percent. Australian shares, which had come under pressure from weaker commodities prices, eked out gains after five consecutive sessions of losses, rising 0.1 percent.

2018-05-24,"(Adds Orsted statement, analyst) By Nichola Groom May 23 (Reuters) - Massachusetts on Wednesday selected a partnership between Avangrid Inc and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to develop what will be the largest U.S. offshore wind farm off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. Vineyard Wind’s 800 megawatt proposal was chosen by state utilities Unitil, National Grid and Eversource Energy. It is the largest ever procurement of offshore wind by a U.S. state, and represents up to 6 percent of the state’s total annual electricity load. The announcement came at the same time Massachusetts neighbor Rhode Island said it had awarded a 400 MW offshore wind procurement to Deepwater Wind, a project developer owned by D.E. Shaw Group. Massachusetts in 2016 passed a law requiring its utilities to procure 1,600 MW of offshore wind energy over the next decade as part of an effort to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. To move forward, the parties must negotiate a contract that requires approval by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Denmark’s Orsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, said its Bay State Project had not been selected for contract negotiations. “We submitted what we considered a very competitive, but value-creating bid. While we’re of course disappointed ... the U.S. remains a key market to us,” said Orsted’s head of wind power, Martin Neubert. Analysts at Bernstein said they believed a lower price and potentially an earlier installation time-line of 2021 had favored Avangrid, majority-owned by Spanish utility Iberdrola , over Orsted’s bid. The cost of generating electricity from offshore wind farms has dropped dramatically in recent years but is far more costly than power from wind facilities onshore. The U.S. currently has just one small offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. Power price details were not disclosed with the winning bids. Separately on Wednesday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that commits his state to procuring 3,500 MW of offshore wind. The Trump administration has voiced support for development of a domestic offshore wind industry, saying it is critical to the nation’s “all of the above” energy strategy.

2018-05-24,"HOUSTON/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Pipeline bottlenecks have vexed North American oil producers this year, but for companies making a little-known additive called drag-reducing agent (DRA), they have provided a veritable windfall. DRA is injected into pipelines to reduce the contact between the oil and the wall of the pipe, allowing more crude to flow through. It is a tiny but booming business, accounting for about $500 million in global sales - half of that in the United States - but is growing about 8 percent annually, said Brian Watt, senior vice president at specialty chemicals producer Innospec Inc (IOSP.O), based in Englewood, Colorado. Pipeline companies are increasing DRA usage because of bottlenecks in the key North American producing regions of Texas’s Permian Basin and Western Canada. Those crude grades have traded at greater-than-usual discounts to benchmark U.S. futures CLc1 this year because of inadequate pipeline space. Planned pipelines in the Permian will not largely start coming online until late this year, while new Canadian pipeline capacity faces scrutiny by politicians, activists and regulators.  “Anything that cost-effectively allows you to increase capacity or reduce the energy pumping those lines is going to look like a good investment,” Watt said. Adding DRA, which sells for $15 to $25 per U.S. gallon, allows pipeline operators to reduce pump pressure. “We’re using a lot more DRA in the system,” said Guy Jarvis, executive vice-president of liquids at Canada’s biggest pipeline company Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), because it can “provide a bit of a boost” to flow, as well as reduce power bills. TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) used DRA to maintain flows on its Keystone pipeline despite pressure restrictions after a leak late in November in South Dakota, industry sources told Reuters.  One month after the leak, throughput on Keystone was at 583,000 barrels per day, just 2 percent below nameplate capacity despite the 20 percent pressure restriction, according to previously unreported data from the National Energy Board, Canada’s energy regulator.  In the first quarter of 2018, average flow was above capacity even though restrictions were not lifted until May. TransCanada did not confirm the use of DRA in the Keystone line, citing commercial sensitivity. DRA has been around since the 1970s, but pipeline operators kept its use quiet, believing it gave them a competitive advantage. Even now, few companies disclose how much DRA they produce. “Because the demand picture is shifting pretty rapidly, matching up supply and demand is critical to maintaining a profitable business,” said Greg Jones, head of downstream products at General Electric unit Baker Hughes (BHGE.K), which is expanding output in Oklahoma by an undisclosed amount. “Everybody’s a bit cautious about not tipping their hand.”  Innospec said on Monday that it is building a new DRA production plant in Texas, while LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc, a Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) unit, doubled manufacturing capacity late last year.  Private equity has also noticed. Houston-based CSL Capital Management funded start-up Optum Energy Solutions’ new 60-acre (24-hectare) DRA plant in Oklahoma. “We saw an opportunity for steady and growing demand for DRAs for the next several years,” said CSL founding partner Charlie Leykum, noting it can help maintain volumes on aging pipelines where pressure has to be carefully managed. He declined to disclose the size of his firm’s investment. Recently, companies have started including DRA into pipeline designs to reduce capital costs by using smaller pipe, said Marina Kaplan, LiquidPower’s director of strategy, marketing and business development. Politically volatile regions also generate high demand as companies have to contend with damaged pipelines, Jones said. Older lines in Iran use DRA to increase or maintain output, said Patrick Bayat, chief executive of Tehran-based DRA producer Partow Ideh Pars Co, in an email. NuGenTech Chief Executive Donato Polignone said the Emeryville, California-based company sells DRA to Kuwait Oil Company. “I’ve seen insane demand for this for the last three years.” Reporting by Julie Gordon in Houston and Rod Nickel in Calgary, Alberta; Editing by Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-energy-pipelines/in-full-flow-pipeline-additive-sales-boom-amid-oil-bottlenecks-idUKL2N1PJ258,24 May 2018,"Pipeline

2018-05-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vistra Energy Corp (VST.N) and Dominion Energy Inc (D.N) – which serve about 5.5 million electricity customers in more than a dozen U.S. states – both say they are done building combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plants.  Instead, they are building large solar plants, which offer plentiful and inexpensive electricity. This bearish view of fossil-fuel energy, reflective of a growing acceptance by utilities of renewable power sources, poses a hurdle to John Flannery’s plan to turn around General Electric Co’s (GE.N) $35 billion-a-year power unit.  GE’s chief executive spelled out the difficulty on Wednesday. Power profits will be flat this year after falling 53 percent in 2017, he said, and GE is planning that demand for heavy-duty natural gas power plants will be less than half what it forecast just over a year ago, and will stay at that level through 2020.  New plant sales are “going to be tough,” Flannery said at an investor conference on Wednesday. “This is not going to be a quick fix, but there is, at the end of the day, long-life assets here with intrinsic economic value. We’re going to make the most of what we have there.” In the long run, Flannery and Russell Stokes, the head of GE Power, have said demand for electricity and natural gas power generators will grow about 2 percent a year - in line with global forecasts - as utilities make a gradual transition to renewable power. Following a strategy he laid out in November, Flannery is cutting 12,000 jobs and $2.5 billion in costs at the unit. On Wednesday, he said GE has tripled some sales incentives in the power division and is competing aggressively for new contracts to maintain plants and to get the call when utilities need parts or repairs during an unexpected outage, something of which GE had lost sight.  But some analysts and investors are skeptical about the long-term prospects of a business devoted to natural gas and coal power plants that are falling out of favor with utilities.  The competition from solar and wind, along with abundant low-priced gas produced by fracking, is curbing orders for new plants and forcing the closure of old ones. Some utilities are even filing for bankruptcy. “That means companies are going to have trouble selling new fossil-fuel plants,” said Mark Dyson, a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an organization that researches the power industry.  Over 126 years, GE has weathered ups and downs in power market before, and has legions of sales and service people around the world. Last year it booked 26 orders for its newest gas turbines in Mexico, Bangladesh and elsewhere. It is investing in its separate, $10 billion-a-year renewables unit focused on wind and hydro, which saw revenue fall 6 percent last year. GE also sells battery storage, software and smart-grid technology to work with wind and solar systems. GE power equipment orders - an indicator of future sales - fell 41 percent in the first quarter, accelerating from a 17 percent drop last year, according to GE’s earnings reports. GE’s performance reflects the broader trend of utilities shifting to renewables from fossil fuels. Global sales of large natural gas power plants have fallen by half since 2013, according to McCoy Power Reports. Coal and gas-fired plants accounted for just 38 percent of new electricity capacity financed globally last year, down from 71 percent a decade ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Solar and wind now draw 53 percent of such investment, up from 22 percent, a Reuters analysis shows.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2I7QAxf Rivals Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) are cautious about the scope for growth. “We see a structural change,” Lisa Davis, the chief executive officer of Siemens Corp, the U.S. unit, said in an interview. “There are fewer large units being sold globally than there were five years ago. I don’t see that changing dramatically going forward.”  Siemens is cutting 6,100 power and gas jobs to adjust. Many utilities share the view that the shift is permanent because it is driven by economics rather than government policy and climate-change concerns. While conventional power plants will continue to be built, sales may never reach the levels seen just two years ago, industry experts said. With electricity prices trending downward, utilities are increasingly unwilling to risk capital on a new plant unless then can lock in a long-term price, executives said.  “Building new large, combined-cycle gas plants is challenging without the stability of a long-term power contract,” said Timothy Menzie, chief executive officer of InterGen, an international power generation company.     GE faces a further challenge: long-term erosion of the large base of plants it services. After acquiring the Alstom power business in 2015, GE has a base of customers that produces one-third of the world’s electricity. Long-term contracts to service those plants bring GE billions of dollars in annual revenue.  But as utilities close older coal and gas-fired plants, the revenue growth from services is under pressure. Wind and solar can cost as little as $18 a megawatt hour, compared with $40 for a large gas plant, said Mikael Backman, North America regional director at Wartsila (WRT1V.HE) Energy Solutions, part of the Finnish company that makes quick-start natural gas-fired generators. Across much of the United States, some utilities now buy all the cheap renewable power they can on electricity markets and use quick-start gas engines to fill in when wind and sun falter.  In California, regulators have put on hold a project that planned to buy one of GE’s large natural-gas turbines while Southern California Edison, which planned to buy the power, studies using wind and solar instead. The shift from fossil fuels stretches beyond states like California, which is aggressively switching to renewable power. In oil-rich Texas, wind and solar now provide 21 percent of the state’s electricity. Utilities there are shutting down the equivalent of about 20 average-sized coal plants this year, according a Reuters analysis of data from power system operator ERCOT. Out of 183 power-generation projects on the drawing boards, only four would run on fossil fuels, ERCOT said. The rest are wind and solar.  ExGen Texas Power, an affiliate of Exelon Corp (EXC.N), filed for bankruptcy protection in November for five natural-gas plants, the second such bankruptcy in Texas last year attributed to low power prices. GE supplied parts and service to several of the plants, according to the bankruptcy filings. Reuters could not determine whether the contracts will remain in effect. In Virginia, Dominion Energy ended several maintenance contracts it had with GE this year when it mothballed a large gas-fired plant built by companies GE later acquired and idled seven other coal and natural gas units in the state. Dominion aims to build 4,720 megawatts of solar by 2033, the equivalent of about five large combined-cycle power plants. It is opening a new combined-cycle natural-gas plant in Virginia this year, built with GE and Mitsubishi equipment. It said it has no current plans to build more such plants. “Solar is very cheap,” spokesman Dan Genest said. “These units were just not cutting it.” Reporting By Alwyn Scott; editing by Joe White and Edward Tobin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ge-renewables/general-electrics-power-unit-fights-for-growth-as-wind-solar-gain-idUKL2N1SS01K,24 May 2018,"Vistra Energy Corp and

2018-05-24,"* U.S. probe into auto imports weighs on regional automakers * Nikkei off 1.1 pct, KOSPI 0.3 pct lower * Trump calls for ‘different structure’ on China-U.S. trade deal By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 24 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Thursday after the U.S. government launched a national security probe into auto imports that could lead to new tariffs, and President Donald Trump’s comments indicated fresh setbacks in U.S.-China trade talks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.1 percent higher, but Japan’s Nikkei stock index fell 1.2 percent as auto shares slumped. South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.3 percent. A broad MSCI index of automobile and auto components firms was down 0.9 percent. Tokyo’s SE TOPIX transportation equipment index was 2.6 percent lower. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday that it would launch a national security investigation into car and truck imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a move that could lead to tariffs like those imposed on steel and aluminium in March. Adding to market jitters, Trump on Wednesday called for “a different structure” in any trade deal with China, fuelling uncertainty over the negotiations. On Thursday, China’s Commerce Ministry said it had not pledged to cut China’s trade surplus with the U.S. by a certain figure, and that it hopes the U.S. implements measures promised during trade negotiations as soon as possible. China’s blue chip CSI 300 index was 0.1 percent lower. Prompting further uncertainty, Trump on Wednesday cast doubt on plans for an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying he would know next week whether the meeting would take place. “There’s a lot of noise around Donald Trump, China-U.S. trade, the auto imports now, and then the Korean summit, and all these things are just weighing on investors at the moment,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist & head of investment strategy, AMP Capital, Sydney. “I think we probably would have seen a decent day in Asian markets were it not for these ongoing geopolitical worries because the minutes from the Fed’s last meeting were relatively benign.” While the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s May 1-2 meeting indicated that policymakers expect another interest rate increase would be warranted “soon” if the U.S. economic outlook remains intact, they helped to ease market concerns that the Fed would accelerate the pace of interest rate increases. The two-year Treasury note yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5121 percent after touching 2.5970 on Wednesday. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell back below the 3-percent threshold to 2.9825 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 3.003 percent on Wednesday. Analysts said that market uncertainty was prompting a clear flight to safety across financial markets. The dollar was down 0.6 percent against the yen to 109.44 . “With Trump’s unpredictable behaviour leaving investors on edge, the Japanese yen has scope to appreciate further in the short term,” said Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at FXTM. “However, a strengthening dollar on the back of heightened U.S. rate hike expectations could limit the yen’s upside gains.” The euro was up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1709. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.2 percent lower at 93.839. Concerns over trade, talks and tariffs overpowered indications of strong economic performance in two of the region’s major economies. Confidence among Japanese manufacturers saw its first rise in fourth months, and service-sector sentiment rose to a record high in the latest Reuters Tankan poll, underscoring expectations that the Japanese economy will return to growth in the second quarter. In South Korea, Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said the economy is on track for annual growth of 3 percent despite concerning indicators such as high youth unemployment. The Bank of Korea held interest rates steady for a sixth straight month on Thursday, with inflation seen remaining below target and amid concerns a U.S.-China trade war would hurt regional economies. In commodities markets, U.S. crude was down 0.2 percent at $71.68 a barrel. Oil prices fell on Wednesday after an unexpected rise in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories. Brent futures were 0.3 percent lower at $79.53 a barrel, continuing to move lower after rising above $80 for the first time since November 2014 last week. The most-traded iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose for the first time in six sessions on Thursday, gaining 0.3 percent. Weak commodity prices continued to put pressure on Australian shares, which were 0.2 percent lower, extending losses into a sixth consecutive session. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was 0.7 percent higher. Gold was slightly higher. Spot gold was traded at $1,294.11 per ounce.

2018-05-24,"RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-led oil company Petrobras on Wednesday temporarily cut diesel prices by 10 percent in order to help the government and truck drivers resolve a protest crippling highways. The surprise decision, aimed at resolving a standoff threatening grains exports, industrial output and even fuel supply at airports and gas stations, will bring immediate relief for angry truckers but raise investor concerns about government interference at Petroleo Brasileiro SA. New York-listed shares of Petrobras fell as much as 7.5 percent in after-market trading, after closing 3.8 percent lower on Wednesday. Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente said the price cut, which will only remain in place for 15 days and cost the company about 350 million reais ($96 million), had not been demanded by the government. “The independence of Petrobras has not been damaged,” Parente said at a news conference explaining the decision. “It was an exceptional measure and does not represent a change to our pricing policy.” Near-daily price adjustments at Petrobras have let the company track global prices and turn a profit on fuel sales after losing money for years at the government’s insistence — part of a turnaround that lifted shares nearly 90 percent since the pricing policy started last July. While Petrobras’ price cut brings momentary relief to truckers, policymakers struggled to reach a more lasting accord during talks with the drivers’ representatives in Brasilia, who threatened to extend their protests into a fourth day.  A group representing the truckers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the price cut. Late on Wednesday, Brazil’s lower house of Congress approved the main text of a bill aimed at resolving the protest, with the measure now passing to the Senate. In addition to eliminating the CIDE tax on diesel, it cut the PIS/Cofins tax on the fuel to zero. Before the bill’s passage, congressman and rapporteur for the bill, Orlando Silva, said it would reduce the final cost of diesel by 14 percent.   Earlier in the day, the government and truckers groups met at the office of Eliseu Padilha, President Michel Temer’s chief of staff, but failed to reach an accord after the government did not present a plan to reduce diesel costs, a spokesman for ABCAM, which represents the protesters, told reporters after the meeting. Padilha, calling the meeting tense but fruitful, said there would be another meeting on Thursday. He said lost tax revenue would be offset with additional payroll taxes. It was the first such meeting between the government and truckers since they began partially blocking roads in several states on Monday to protest surging diesel prices. Temer had called for “a type of truce for two or three days at most for us to find a satisfactory solution for Brazilians and for the truckers.” However, ABCAM said the strike would continue. Brazil is a key global supplier of grains, meat, coffee and sugar, most of which reach ports by road.  Concerns that the protest could halt shipments of Brazil’s record soy crop have contributed to the steepest rally in soy futures in 10 months in Chicago trading, with prices up 4.5 percent in four consecutive days of increases. Oilseed trade group Abiove said some soybean crushers were suspending operations due to the protest. Sugarcane industry group Unica said certain mills had reduced harvesting work due to short fuel supplies. Meat processor Marfrig Global Foods SA said on Wednesday some of its plants are reducing or suspending output due to lack of deliveries during the protest. State airport operator Infraero suggested that passengers check with airlines on the status of their flights and warned carriers to check that there is enough jet fuel to refuel planes at airports before clearing flights. According to Petrobras, state and federal taxes make up 29 percent of the final price of diesel paid by consumers. The average retail price of diesel is now 3.595 reais per liter. Padilha said policymakers had already determined how to offset the elimination of the CIDE fuel tax, which represents about 1 percent of diesel costs. However, he said congressional leaders still had to find about 12.5 billion reais ($3.5 billion) in new revenue in order to halve for six months the PIS/Cofins tax, which makes up about 10 percent of diesel costs. He said the Finance Ministry would also discuss with states a possible reduction of the ICMS state tax burden on diesel.

2018-05-24,"SEOUL, May 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday, pulled down by expectations that OPEC members could step up production in the face of worries over supply from both Venezuela and Iran. International benchmark Brent futures were down 15 cents, or 0.19 percent, at $79.65 per barrel at 0103 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 10 cents, or 0.14 percent, at $71.74 a barrel. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may decide to increase oil output to make up reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela in response to concerns from Washington over a rally in oil prices, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters. Supply concerns in Iran and Venezuela following new U.S. sanctions had pushed both Brent and WTI to multi-year highs, with Brent breaking through a $80 threshold last week for the first time since November 2014. “The chat is still that OPEC will do something at its June meeting in reaction to the looming prospect of a fall in crude production and exports from both Iran and Venezuela as the year progresses,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. OPEC and some non-OPEC major oil producers are scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 22. The group previously agreed to curb their output by about 1.8 million barrels per day to boost oil prices and clear a supply glut. “Any signs that the group may be heading towards an early exit from the production cut agreement would weigh on prices,” ANZ bank said in a note. A surprise increase in U.S. weekly crude stockpiles also kept a lid on oil prices. Commercial U.S. crude inventories rose C-STK-T-EIA by 5.8 million barrels in the week to May 18, beating analyst expectations for a decrease of 1.6 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Libya, which is an OPEC member, cut its oil production by about 120,000 barrels per day as unusually hot weather prompted power problems, an official from the National Oil Corp said on Wednesday.

2018-05-24,"* Trump says ‘different structure’ needed in U.S.-China trade talks * U.S. Federal Reserve minutes reassure on rate rises * Oil prices flat after Wednesday falls on U.S. inventory build By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 24 (Reuters) - Asian shares moved lower on Thursday as investors fretted about new setbacks in U.S.-China trade talks, but negative sentiment was tempered by U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes suggesting it would not raise the tempo at which it increases interest rates. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 0.6 percent lower. A day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not pleased with trade talks between the United States and China, he called for “a different structure” in any trade deal. The move added to uncertainty over the negotiations and prompted a fall in stock markets. However, the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s May 1-2 meeting eased market concerns that it would raise interest rates more quickly than expected. The minutes, which were seen as dovish, helped to push U.S. stocks into positive territory on Wednesday. “(The) minutes read largely in line with latest Fedspeak. Consensus finds no major signs of accelerating inflation; wage improvements aren’t broad; drivers of the (workforce) participation rate are still a mystery and the flatter yield curve isn’t flashing red yet,” Citi analysts said in a note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.21 percent to 24,886.81, the S&P 500 gained 0.32 percent to 2,733.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 7,425.96. The two-year treasury note yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.5282 percent. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell back below the 3-percent threshold to 2.999 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 3.003 percent on Wednesday. Australian shares were 0.1 percent lower, extending losses into a sixth consecutive session on weak prices for iron ore and oil. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was 0.4 percent higher.

2018-05-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Commodities-related revenue at the 12 biggest investment banks in the first quarter jumped 48 percent year on year driven by the U.S. energy sector and commodity indices, consultancy Coalition said on Thursday. Revenue from commodity trading, selling derivatives to investors and other activities in the sector climbed to $1.2 billion (£898.4 million), the financial industry analytics firm said in a report. “Significantly higher U.S. power and gas results were driven by improved market conditions and some one-off transactions,” Coalition said. “Investor products benefited from increased institutional client appetite for commodity indices.” The rise in the first quarter comes after years of falling revenue in the sector for top banks, including a 42 percent fall last year to its lowest since at least 2006. Revenue in the commodities sector at the 50 biggest investment banks was $4.3 billion last year, the lowest in more than a decade and down from $15.9 billion in 2008 at the peak of the commodities cycle, according to Coalition. Banks’ commodity revenue has been on a steady downward path in recent years as they have exited or slimmed down their commodity businesses due to heightened government regulation and poor performance from the sector.    Many banks posted strong first-quarter results although typically they do not give figures for commodities. One of the top commodity banks, Morgan Stanley (MS.N), reported record first-quarter profit last month thanks to a surge in trading activity, much like other Wall Street banks, but executives warned results through the rest of the year may not be quite as strong.  Coalition tracks Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Barclays (BARC.L), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Citigroup (C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), HSBC (HSBA.L), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and UBS (UBSG.S).
