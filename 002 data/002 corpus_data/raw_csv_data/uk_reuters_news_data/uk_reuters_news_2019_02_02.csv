2019-02-02,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s phasing out of coal-fired power stations could be delayed beyond 2038 if the deadline creates problems for the security of electricity supply, a senior legislator in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party said. The phase-out, proposed last Saturday by a commission tasked with mapping out Germany’s transition to a more environmentally friendly low-carbon economy, drew criticism from some in industry who fear the impact of higher energy prices. But in remarks that appeared aimed at the right of a party not always comfortable with Merkel’s centrist approach, Ralph Brinkhaus, chair of the conservative benches in parliament, said it was crucial not to be “dogmatic” in pursuing a goal that was widely accepted. “Energy supply security must be guaranteed,” he told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. “If it is endangered, we should be free to do another round and address that, without abandoning the path we’ve chosen. There’s no reason to be dogmatic about this.” Brinkhaus, from the Christian Democrats’ (CDU) most pro-business wing, last year toppled a Merkel ally in the race for the influential parliamentary leader post, precipitating the sequence of events that led to Merkel resigning as party leader and announcing that this would be her last term as chancellor. That sparked a fight for the soul of the party, whose members have chafed at the centrist course that Merkel plotted over the 14 years of her chancellorship, during which time she has often seemed closer to leftists and Greens than some in her own party. While her ally Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer’s narrow victory in the race to succeed her as party leader was seen as a win for her centrist vision, Brinkhaus’s remarks are a reminder that the party’s right has not gone away as the CDU gears up for a series of tough European and regional elections. The coal commission unveiled its hard-won compromise after marathon talks early last Saturday, proposing to shut 12.7 GW of coal capacity by 2020 and promised 40 billion euros to help regions affected by the end of coal mining. Brinkhaus also called in the interview for a rethink on government spending. “Do we have too many regulations or even a nanny state?” he asked. An INSA poll for Bild newspaper on Saturday showed that the CDU is still by far the most popular party on 30 percent. But a disappointing election year could yet re-open the internal party war.

2019-02-02,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran displayed a new cruise missile with a range of 1,300 km (800 miles) on Saturday during celebrations marking the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, state television reported. Iran has expanded its missile programme, particularly its ballistic missiles, in defiance of opposition from the United States and expressions of concern by European countries. Tehran says the programme is purely defensive. Later on Saturday, a senior Revolutionary Guard commander suggested that pressure by European countries for talks on curbing Iran’s ballistic missiles development could prompt Tehran to expand it beyond current limits.  Speaking during the unveiling ceremony, Defence Minister Amir Hatami said: “This cruise missile needs a very short time for its preparedness and can fly at a low altitude.”  The surface-to-surface missile, named Hoveizeh, is from the Soumar family of cruise missiles, which Iran added to its arsenal in 2015, Hatami said.     Western experts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities, although there are concerns about its long-range ballistic missiles. Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Revolutionary Guard aerospace division, said Iran had overcome initial problems in producing jet engines for cruise missiles and could now manufacture a full range of the weapons. The Defence Ministry’s website carried an undated video purportedly showing the Hoveizeh being test-fired from a mobile launcher. It quoted Hatami as saying the missile had successfully hit targets at a distance of 1,200 km. Since agreeing to a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, Iran has expanded its missile programme despite warnings from the United States.    In January, it tried to launch a satellite into space which it said failed. The launch followed a U.S. warning to Iran against undertaking three planned rocket launches that Washington said would violate a United Nations Security Council resolution. The resolution, which enshrined Iran’s nuclear deal, called upon Tehran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran says its missile tests are not in violation of the resolution and denies its missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.  Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of the elite Revolutionary Guard, reiterated Iran’s rejection of any talks on its missile programme, in response to a demand raised by France and other European countries, the semi-official news agency Fars reported. France said last month it was ready to impose further sanctions on Iran if no progress was made in talks about the missiles, described by Tehran as defensive but seen in the West as a destabilising factor in a volatile region. Salami said Iran’s decision to limit the range and the number of its ballistic missiles was based on its current strategy, which could change based on circumstances. “If today the Europeans or others try to plot and pursue Iran’s missile disarmament, then we will be forced to resort to a strategic leap,” Fars cited Salami as saying, an apparent threat that Iran may seek to boost the range or the number of the missiles. Last week, Iran dismissed the pressure from France for talks, but said it had no plans to increase the range of the weapons. U.S. President Donald Trump quit the Iran nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions on Tehran that had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. Washington says although Iran has met the terms, the accord was too generous, failing to rein in Iran’s ballistic missile programme or curb what the United States says is interference in regional affairs.     Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of decades-long international sanctions and embargoes that have barred it from importing most weapons.

Nigerian go to the polls on Feb. 16 to elect a new president in an election where the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari and his deputy have been touring the country to woo voters for a second term in office.   A video on the Tiwtter account of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, showed him cheering to supporters after the incident. He posted: “We are safe and sound!” The cause of the accident was not immediately clear. Spokesman Laolu Akande said the vice president was continuing his engagements in Kogi state. “VP Osinbajo’s chopper crash lands in Kabba, but he and the entire crew safe,” the spokesman tweeted. Nigeria’s airlines are plagued by problems - delays, cancellations and fuel shortages that are almost expected from domestic passengers. However, safety records have been improving in recent years. Political party candidates have been campaigning across the country to market their plans on how they intend to lead one of Africa’s top economies over the next four years, with the key issues being corruption, security and the economy. Buhari is hoping his anti-corruption agenda can win him a second term while the main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar has said he would consider an amnesty for corruption suspects and privatise the state-owned oil company NNPC.

2019-02-02,"PRETORIA (Reuters) - South Africa’s radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) will nationalise all mines by 2023 if elected this year, the party said in its election manifesto launched on Saturday. The party is using an anti-corruption, jobs creation and state control of the economy platform to challenge the governing African National Congress (ANC) in the election expected in May. “The EFF government will nationalise all mines and mineral wealth in South Africa by the year 2023. It will allocate key shares in South Africa’s mineral and petroleum resources to the Sovereign Wealth Fund,” the party said in the manifesto, adding that a state mining company would be established. Since its formation in 2013, the EFF, which draws much of its support from the rural poor, has called for the nationalisation of mines, banks and other strategic sectors of the economy as well as expropriation of land without compensation. While parliament has opened the way to a change of the constitution to allow land to be expropriated without compensation, a final decision is not expected until after the election. “We cannot postpone the land question, we cannot postpone the jobs question, it must happen now,” EFF leader Julius Malema told supporters, many dressed in red and carrying placards, at the manifesto launch in Pretoria. Land is a hot-button issue in South Africa where racial inequality remains entrenched more than two decades after the end of apartheid when millions among the black majority were dispossessed of their land by a white minority.

2019-02-02,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Environmental group Greenpeace said on Saturday it had been forced to shut two of its regional offices in India and had asked many staff to leave due to a block on its bank account after accusations of illegal donations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nationalist government has tightened scrutiny of non-profit groups over the past four years. It says they often act against India’s interests and has revoked licenses for thousands of foreign-funded groups. Known for its campaigns against India’s coal-fired power plants, Greenpeace has been barred from receiving foreign donations since 2015. India’s financial crime investigating agency froze the group’s main bank account on Oct. 5. On Saturday, the group said 40 of its 60 India staff positions had been made redundant. Two of its regional offices — in the capital city of New Delhi and the eastern city of Patna — have been shut, it said in a statement. Greenpeace staff across New Delhi and Patna, as well as in southern city Bengaluru, were committed to work as volunteers, the group said. “The government can only freeze our accounts and shut our offices but Greenpeace is an idea that can never be extinguished,” it said.     Since Modi took office in 2014, India has cancelled the registrations of nearly 15,000 non-governmental groups under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. Critics say the government has been using the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non-profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of India’s rapid economic development or questioned its human rights record.

2019-02-02,"BUCHAREST, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Romanian-based Black Sea Oil & Gas received a construction permit from the country’s energy ministry on Friday for an offshore gas project, but it said new taxes could make it hard to go ahead with the development. The company, controlled by private equity firm Carlyle Group LP, discovered two wells holding an estimated 10 billion cubic metres of gas in 2008 some 120 kilometres offshore in the Black Sea. It hoped to start production by 2020, pending a final investment decision, becoming the first in a line of companies to tap the European Union state’s vast offshore resources. But Romania’s Social Democrat government approved a slew of taxes via emergency decree in December without an impact assessment or public debate, including a 2-percent tax on turnover for energy firms and a cap on gas prices. That came on top of other new laws for offshore drilling stipulating that Romanian companies would need to sell at least half their yearly gas output in the country. “The impact of these legislative changes on (our) investment plans are highly negative,” the firm’s chief executive, Mark Beacom, told Reuters. “Our ability to obtain a final investment decision is adversely impacted.” Unlike other countries in the region, Romania is largely independent in terms of its energy needs. It imports less than 10 percent of its gas needs from Russia, with the rest produced locally, mainly by state producer Romgaz and OMV Petrom, controlled by Austria’s OMV. “(The price cap) removes investor confidence that being a Romanian producer will not result in being economically disadvantaged versus investing in other countries,” Beacom added. The sales restrictions also made it difficult for the company to finance the offshore project, he said. The new taxes and price caps have received widespread criticism from businesses, but the government has said it has no plans to withdraw or amend the emergency decree. In October, after the offshore law was approved, Petrom postponed an investment decision on its Black Sea Neptun block, a joint venture with U.S. major ExxonMobil. Last year, the National Agency for Mineral Resources (ANRM) said the country could almost double its natural gas production to about 20 billion cubic metres a year by 2025, helped by new Black Sea offshore discoveries.

2019-02-02,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Once-in-a-century flooding in part of the eastern Australian state of Queensland looks set to worsen as the nation’s weather bureau on Saturday warned of more heavy rain in the area. Some residents have already been evacuated after days of monsoon rains lashed the region around the coastal city of Townsville in north Queensland, a spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology said.  Adam Blazak, a forecaster with the bureau, did not say how many people had been evacuated, but added that some areas had reached “major” flood levels. “Normally a monsoonal burst might last a few days, but this one’s been going on over a week now and is set to continue for a few more days as well,” he said. Between 150 mm and 200 mm of rain is expected across Townsville on Saturday - equal to about a month’s average rainfall. Local authorities issued a number of flood warnings on Saturday morning and told residents to avoid using roads and consider moving to higher ground if conditions worsen. North Queensland has significant zinc reserves as well as major deposits of silver, lead, copper and iron ore, with Townsville a major processing centre for the region’s base metals. In stark contrast, wildfires in the southern island state of Tasmania have burnt through close to 190,000 hectares of land, fire officials said. Chris Arnold, the chief officer of the Tasmania Fire Service, said on Saturday that nearly 600 personnel were working to contain the fires, some of which have been burning for weeks and have destroyed homes. Arnold told reporters that while the last few days have seen favourable conditions for battling the blazes, communities in part of the state were still under threat as expected hot and dry weather on Sunday could see bushfires escalate again.   Australia endured its hottest month on record in January, with sweltering conditions expected to persist through April. That scorching weather triggered power outages in some areas and sent electricity prices soaring.

2019-02-02,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - At least four Libyan soldiers were killed on Friday when forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar fought with a local armed group as they sought to expand south, military officials said, with the World Health Organization putting the overall death toll at 14. Libya has been in turmoil since the NATO-backed toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with parallel administrations and armed groups carving the nation into swathes of control.  Friday’s clashes were the first real resistance the Libyan National Army (LNA) faction faced since arriving in the south two weeks ago from its main eastern stronghold of Benghazi. An official at the WHO said the fighting had killed 14 and wounded 64, mostly from the LNA’s opponents. No more information was immediately available.     LNA officials said clashes began when soldiers left the main southern city of Sabha and arrived in the nearby town of Ghudduwah. It backed troops with air strikes on the “terrorists” and “Chadian mercenaries”, the officials said, using a pejorative for Chadian opposition groups active in south Libya.   As well as the four LNA fatalities, several of its soldiers were wounded, the officials said. A WHO official said on Twitter the organisation had delivered emergency supplies to a local hospital. The LNA spent the last two weeks securing Sabha, which     had been nominally under the control of the internationally-recognised government in Tripoli but was in practice run by local groups including tribes.  The LNA says its campaign is intended to combat Islamic militants and secure oil facilities in the south, which include El Sharara oilfield, Libya’s biggest. It has been closed since December when tribesmen and state guards seized it. The LNA, whose commander Haftar dominates eastern Libya, is allied to a parallel government in Benghazi that opposes the Tripoli administration.
