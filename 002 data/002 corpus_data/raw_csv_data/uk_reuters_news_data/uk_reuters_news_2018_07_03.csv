2018-07-03,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - State-run Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) (PETR4.SA) said on Tuesday it was suspending major asset sales after a Supreme Court justice ruled that Congress must approval any privatizations. Petrobras said it would suspend the sale of certain refineries, its gas pipeline company Transportadora Associada de Gas (TAG) and the Araucaria fertilizer factory. Justice Ricardo Lewandowski said last week that the Brazilian Congress must approve any sales of publicly held shares in companies or their subsidiaries, casting doubt on planned divestitures by Petrobras as well as state utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (ELET6.SA). The full court must still decide on the matter. Petrobras, the most indebted oil major, is working to sell $21 billion in assets over two years. The company sold $4.5 billion worth of assets last year and committed to selling an additional $3 billion this year.  Preferred shares of Petrobras edged up 0.17 percent to close at 17.50 reais, as the benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP gained 1.14 percent. The shares have gained 8.9 percent this year but gains were much higher before May, when an uproar over higher diesel fuel prices triggered a truckers’ protest that paralyzed Brazil’s economy and resulted in the departure of well-regarded former Chief Executive Pedro Parente. The sale process of gas pipeline company TAG is in its final stages. Petrobras is discussing contracts with France’s Engie SA (ENGIE.PA) and had been expected to submit the deal for rebids by the other two interested consortia, led by Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) and EIG Global Energy Partners LLC with United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co.  The deal would bring more than $7 billion to the oil company’s coffers. Efforts to sell the Petrobras refineries were just beginning and had drawn lukewarm investor interest due to potential changes in fuel pricing policies.

2018-07-03,"(Adds details of statement, comment by finance minister) CARACAS, July 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela will receive $250 million from the China Development Bank to boost oil production, the South American country’s Finance Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Further details on the terms of the deal were not immediately available. Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. The South American country previously accepted a $5 billion loan from China, which became Venezuela’s principal financier over the last decade but has recently cooled on Venezuela amid its economic meltdown and sharply declining oil production. “We have clinched an authorization for direct investment from the China Development Bank, to increase PDVSA’s production, of more than $250 million and we are already moving forward specific financing as part of the special $5 billion credit that the Chinese government has given to Venezuela for direct investment in production,” the statement quoted Finance Minister Simon Zerpa as saying. Venezuela’s oil production has sunk to a roughly 30-year low due to a mix of underinvestment, theft, a brain drain, and lack of equipment, helping push up global oil prices and piling misery on Venezuela’s recession-hit economy. Over a decade, China plowed more than $50 billion into Venezuela’s coffers through oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-Washington ally in Latin America. But the flow of cash halted nearly three years ago when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse.

2018-07-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices ended slightly higher on Tuesday after a volatile session in which the U.S. benchmark passed $75 a barrel for the first time in more than three years before turning negative and later recouping its losses. Oil rallied early in the session on supply concerns, then slid as traders booked profits ahead of the July Fourth holiday in the United States, and bet that global supply shortages would not persist as long as expected. Crude pared its losses late in the session, turning positive on market sentiment that supply disruptions would not resolve faster than previously expected.  U.S. light crude settled up 20 cents at $74.14 a barrel, rebounding from a session low of $72.73 a barrel. In early trade, the contract rose to $75.27, a 3-1/2-year high.  Brent crude was up 46 cents at $77.76 a barrel, after trading as low as $76.67 and as high as $78.85.  In post-settlement trade, prices extended gains after the American Petroleum Institute said crude stockpiles had fallen more than expected last week. Stockpile data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is expected on Thursday after a delay due to the July 4 holiday.  The early gains came after Iran appeared to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from the Middle East Gulf if Washington pressed ahead with sanctions. U.S. crude rose above $75 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Prices retreated as some thought talk of supply disruptions might be overblown, said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. He also said traders could be moving to liquidate bullish positions. Pressure to liquidate may have accelerated ahead of the U.S. holiday on Wednesday, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital in New York.  Traders said supply disruptions could be short-lived as OPEC and allied producers ramp up output.  The United Arab Emirates is ready to help alleviate possible oil shortages and OPEC will aim to adhere to the group’s “overall conformity levels,” said UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei, who holds the OPEC presidency for 2018. Traders also debated when production would restart at Syncrude Canada’s 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) oil sands facility near Fort McMurray, Alberta, hit by a power outage last month and likely to remain offline through July. A quicker restart could boost supplies at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude.  Oil’s early gains came after the website president.ir quoted Iranian President Hassan Rouhani as dismissing Washington’s attempt to stop Iran’s oil exports. While the comments were ambiguous, Iranian officials in the past have threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action. Asked whether he intended to make a threat, Rouhani declined to provide a clarification. “Just the threat ... would add uncertainty and warrant a certain risk premium,” Carsten Fritsch, senior commodities analyst at Commerzbank, told Reuters Global Oil Forum.

2018-07-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have demanded Glencore hand over documents about its business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Nigeria as part of a corruption probe, sending the mining company’s shares down more than 8 percent. Swiss-based Glencore said it received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice dated July 2 requesting documents and records on compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and money-laundering statutes. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the existence of an ongoing investigation. A representative of the U.S. State Department referred a request for comment to the Justice Department. Glencore said the documents requested from its U.S. division related to the commodity trader’s business in the three countries from 2007 to present. Glencore, which listed in London in 2011, said it was reviewing the subpoena.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime for companies to bribe overseas officials to win business.  Shares in Glencore, the world’s largest producer of cobalt with large operations in the DRC, at one point on Tuesday were down more than 13 percent, their largest one-day fall in more than two years. The stock closed down 8 percent at 321 pence. Analysts at Barclays and Credit Suisse viewed the initial share price drop as steeper than warranted.  “From our perspective, while it is clearly a risk factor, we stress that these types of requests are more common than perhaps the aggressive drop in the Glencore share price today suggests,” a note from Credit Suisse said.  Jefferies lowered its target price to 440 pence from 500 pence for Glencore but maintained a “buy” rating.  “While Glencore has not been found guilty of anything yet, money laundering fines from the U.S. can be significant,” analysts at Jefferies wrote. “Until this matter is resolved, investors are likely to assume Glencore will have to pay a large fine, and Glencore’s cost of capital will increase due to increased risk.”  The DRC accounts for about 25 percent of Glencore’s net present value, analysts say, while Venezuela and Nigeria’s contribution to the bottom line was negligible. PDVSA , Venezuela’s state-controlled oil producer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Some analysts believe the investigation could be a result of Glencore settling a mining row in the DRC with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, under U.S. sanctions since last year, by agreeing to pay royalties in euros. Investors are also monitoring developments in Britain where the Serious Fraud Office was reported to be preparing to open a formal investigation into Glencore’s activities in the DRC. On the Nigerian side, the United States has also been looking into the country’s former oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke, who was briefly arrested in London in October 2015, and her associates. She has denied to Reuters any wrongdoing and is yet to be charged by British authorities. The Justice Department issued a claim last year for assets that it alleged to be the proceeds of corruption belonging to Alison-Madueke and two of her associates. In its claim, the department said Glencore bought more than 7 million barrels of crude from one of the companies used as a vehicle for alleged corruption. It was not immediately clear whether the subpoena concerned that case. Glencore declined to comment on the Nigerian crude liftings. Glencore’s founder, Marc Rich, was indicted in 1983 for exploiting the U.S. embargo against Iran, tax evasion, fraud and racketeering. He fled to Switzerland, where he remained a fugitive pursued by the Justice Department until he was pardoned by then-President Bill Clinton in 2001.

2018-07-03,"(Adds comments from analysts, Ford and a politician) By Danya Hajjaji TORONTO, July 3 (Reuters) - The newly elected Ontario government announced on Tuesday it would end the province’s cap-and-trade program, a policy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, fulfilling one of Premier Doug Ford’s election promises. However, it leaves businesses that bought C$2.8 billion ($2.1 billion) worth of allowances in limbo. Ford’s Progressive Conservative government swept to power last month, ending 15 years of Liberal rule in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province and the country’s economic engine, with a promise to cut corporate and personal taxes. The government said it would immediately start an orderly wind-down of all programs funded out of cap-and-trade carbon tax revenues but agreed to honour certain contracts that have already been signed. “Cap-and-trade and carbon tax schemes are no more than government cash grabs that do nothing for the environment, while hitting people in the wallet in order to fund big government programs,” Ford said in a statement. The government says it aims to reduce gasoline prices by 10 cents per litre and lower energy bills, scrapping the plan that forced large companies to buy allowances for their carbon emissions. Citing the auditor general, the government said the program could cost Ontario consumers and businesses C$8 billion, with a minimal impact on the province’s carbon emissions. Michael Berends, managing director at Toronto-based cap-and-trade advisers ClearBlue Markets, said the pace of the government’s move leaves many unanswered questions. “All those entities that have purchased allowances, as they thought they were going to be required, are now wondering what’s the value of allowances and whether they will need them or not,” Berends said. Berends believes the Ontario government’s decision is also going to impact companies that are planning on using their allowances for their obligations towards Quebec and California before the Nov. 1 deadline. Earlier this year, the U.S. state of California and two Canadian provinces - Ontario and Quebec - kicked off a cross-border auction of greenhouse gas emission credits to buy and sell in the cap and trade market in an effort to fight global warming. Left-wing politicians criticized Ford’s move, citing environmental concerns. “Cancelling Ontario’s plan to price greenhouse gas pollution without announcing an alternative is reckless and irresponsible,” said Mike Schreiner, member of provincial parliament for Guelph, a city in southwestern Ontario. “Premier Ford is telling clean economy companies that Ontario is not open for business.” ($1 = 1.3133 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Danya Hajjaji Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, David Gregorio and Susan Thomas)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-politics-ontario/update-2-canadas-ontario-government-scraps-cap-and-trade-program-idUKL1N1TZ0UA,03 Jul 2018,"The newly elected Ontario

2018-07-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP and ConocoPhillips announced on Tuesday a swap deal that will see the British oil giant increase its stake in a major North Sea development while its U.S. peer will grow in Alaska. Houston, Texas-based Conoco said it would sell a 16.5 percent stake in the Clair field to BP, which will see its interest grow to 45.1 percent. Conoco will retain a 7.5 percent interest. Reuters reported in May that Conoco was looking to sell its North Sea fields as part of the company’s focus on its shale operations in its home market.  For BP, Clair is a major asset in the North Sea, where BP plans to increase production to 200,000 barrels per day by the end of the decade.  A second phase in the BP-operated field, known as Clair Ridge, is expected to start production later this year, with production capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. “Clair is a key advantaged oilfield for our North Sea business, a giant resource whose second phase is about to begin production and which holds great potential for future developments,” BP head of upstream Bernard Looney said in a statement.  At the same time, Conoco agreed to buy BP’s entire 39.2 percent stake from BP in the Greater Kuparuk oil field in Alaska and a 38 percent interest in the Kuparuk Transportation Co. The transactions are expected to be cash-neutral for BP and Conoco and are anticipated to close in 2018, BP said in a statement. “These transactions are significant for ConocoPhillips because they continue our strategy of coring up our legacy asset base in Alaska,” Conoco Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance said in a statement.

2018-07-03,"(Reuters) - Will Power may have filled a major gap in his motor racing resume with his win at this year’s Indianapolis 500 but the ambitious Australian is not about to take his foot off the gas pedal as he seeks the IndyCar championship. Power could go without a win the rest of the year and still call the campaign a resounding success given his triumph in the marquee race on the IndyCar calendar, but he shifted his focus after an emotional celebration at the Brickyard. “I quickly put my head down and focused forward on winning the championship. As happy as I am about the 500 I am still very focused on the job of each week,” Power told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “That’s one thing about the 500 is you have to move on very quickly, you have a championship to think about and more races immediately to compete in.” Power, who won the IndyCar Series championship in 2014, was leading the points championship at one point this year but has since slipped to fifth place 10 races into the 17-race season after tough outings in the last two events. The Team Penske driver, looking to become the first Indy 500 winner to go on and capture the points title since Dario Franchitti pulled off the feat in 2010, crashed out in Texas and then finished last with engine trouble at Road America. “From a championship perspective I am still right in the game. I just look at the potential that we’ve had over the first 10 races and we should be leading the championships simply if we just executed,” said Power, who has failed to finish four races in 2018. “It’s never a bad year if you win the Indy 500 but for me it’s about winning the championship definitely.” Power had already amassed an enviable IndyCar career but finally proved he belonged amongst the sport’s higher echelons of drivers when he became the first Australian to win the Indianapolis 500 in May. The 37-year-old Toowoomba native managed his fuel strategy perfectly at the Brickyard where he took the lead with four laps to go and then held off pole winner Ed Carpenter before steering his way into Victory Lane. Knowing he is in the tail-end of his career, Power said the best way to describe his feelings after winning the Indy 500 was relieved. “I was starting to ... count down the amount of times you get to win that race,” said Power, who won the Indy500 on his 11th attempt. “It’s just something that was absolutely at the very top of the list of what I needed to pinguewin to feel satisfied with my career and I’ve got it done.” Power, whose 34 IndyCar wins is tied with Al Unser Jr. for eighth on the all-time list, will be back in action at the Iowa Corn 300 on Sunday followed by the July 15 Honda Indy Toronto.

2018-07-03,"(Adds context, details on June-July exports) By Marianna Parraga July 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s crude shipments to India, its third largest export market, fell 21 percent in the first half of the year, according to internal documents from state-run PDVSA, adding to supply troubles for Indian refiners as they are increasingly pressed to diversify oil imports. Venezuela’s production decline to a 30-year low and export woes stemming from mismanagement, lack of investment and payment delays are affecting almost all of the OPEC-nation’s customers. But the impact on India is notable and comes as its refiners are now preparing for a “drastic reduction to zero” of oil imports from U.S.-sanctioned Iran. Last week, PDVSA officials met with executives from India’s Reliance Industries and Russia’s Rosneft, which owns a majority stake in India-based Nayara Energy , to discuss trade issues, the state-run company said. The talks focused on how to remedy export delays, according to a person familiar with the matter. Venezuela sent almost 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude to India in the first half of the year, a 21 percent drop versus the 355,500 bpd shipped in the same period of 2017, according to PDVSA trade documents. The decline is the second steepest after the United States, which has suffered a drop of about 30 percent in crude imports from Venezuela this year, the documents seen by Reuters show. If crude supplies from Iran and Venezuela, two of India’s top five oil suppliers, cannot be secured in coming months, some of the nation’s refiners would have to rely almost entirely on sourcing the heavy barrels they need from Iraq, according to analysts. “Indian refiners are very worried about supply from Iran, but also from Venezuela,” said Robert Campbell from consultancy Energy Aspects. Saudi Arabia is expected to boost supply to India in the short term, but those barrels would not match the quality of the missing Venezuelan crude, he added. “The lack of heavy barrels is not a problem only in the Atlantic Basin but in Asia as well,” he added. PDVSA and Nayara did not reply to requests for comment. India’s Reliance declined to comment. India is the world’s fourth largest refiner after the United States, China and Russia. While Chinese and Russian firms resell a large portion of the Venezuelan crude and fuel they receive to monetize oil-for-loan agreements, Indian refiners need the barrels they get through crude supply contracts with PDVSA. Venezuela’s crude output is declining faster than expected amid insufficient investment, attempts to seize its overseas assets over payment disputes and skilled workers leaving its oil industry due to low salaries and an extended corruption probe within PDVSA. The country’s oil production averaged 1.58 million bpd in the first five months of 2018, according to figures reported to OPEC, its lowest annual level since 1985. The fall, which is putting pressure on global supply and contributing to growing oil prices, has also taken a toll on exports. PDVSA last month requested customers not send tankers to its main port of Jose to alleviate congestion. But vessels have continued arriving mainly for Chinese, Indian and U.S. clients, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. The tanker bottleneck has worsened since May, when ConocoPhillips started legal actions to seize PDVSA’s assets to satisfy a $2-billion arbitration award, blocking the state-run firm from using its Caribbean terminals. In June, PDVSA shipped to India 268,300 bpd after servicing some vessels that had waited for up to a month to load. The Venezuelan firm plans to deliver some 240,000 bpd in July, according to Reuters and PDVSA data. The unstable crude supply from Venezuela to India in recent months has mainly benefited Iraq, India’s largest crude source, and United Arab Emirates, which in May replaced Venezuela as India’s fourth biggest crude supplier.

2018-07-03,"NEW YORK - World stocks edged lower Tuesday despite broad gains in Europe and rising oil prices as markets remained in the grip of trade turbulence. A July 6 deadline is looming for Washington to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods that Beijing has vowed to match with tariffs on U.S. products. President Donald Trump also threatened on Monday to “do something” if the United States was not better treated by the World Trade Organization. Prospects of a full-blown trade war and relentless yuan weakening - it has fallen 5 percent in the past two weeks and is near 11-month lows - reportedly forced China into intervention via state-run banks.    “It is by far the biggest (yuan loss) I can remember. Prudence suggests it has to be matched across Southeast Asia because of the competitive implications,” said Bank of New York Mellon strategist Neil Mellor. “It generates a degree of instability in the market simply by virtue of its scale.” Among equity markets, Hong Kong dived as much as 3.3 percent to nine-month lows, hit also by U.S. curbs on China Mobile. Shanghai’s bourse hit a two-year trough but closed higher as the yuan recovered.  The mood was more cheerful in Europe where a pan-European equity index rose 1 percent, the euro firmed and bond yields climbed after German Chancellor Angela Merkel struck a migration deal with her Bavarian conservative coalition partners. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.01 percent. In the United States, benchmark indices closed in the red after trading for much of the day in positive territory during a holiday-shortened session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 132.36 points, or 0.54 percent, to 24,174.82, the S&P 500 lost 13.49 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,713.22 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 65.01 points, or 0.86 percent, to 7,502.67. Shares of Facebook Inc fell 2.3 percent after the Washington Post reported a federal probe on a data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica had been broadened and would include more government agencies. That hit other technology shares as well.  “The big driver behind U.S. resilience is that tech has been strong,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at asset manager Psigma. “Expectations are pretty high for the earnings season, with talk of 20 percent earnings growth year-on-year.” Energy stocks have been boosted by Brent crude’s rise past $78 a barrel, McPherson noted. Europe’s tech and energy sectors rose 0.5 and 1 percent respectively. While U.S. growth and company earnings seem unassailable, tit-for-tat tariffs from China and Europe may ultimately prove detrimental for American businesses and jobs. U.S. bond yields rose slightly amid the easier mood but concern about the trade row has helped push the gap between two- and 10-year yields to the narrowest since 2007. “Basically (the flat curve) is saying the underlying growth in the U.S. economy may not be as strong as the high short-term interest rates might warrant,” McPherson said.   The dollar retreated 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies and the easing tensions in Germany helped the euro to gain 0.2 percent against the greenback. Friday’s monthly payrolls data should show labor markets remain tight, keeping the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy tightening on track. “Notwithstanding the trade war concerns, the broader picture is the U.S. central bank still remains the most hawkish central bank among its peers and that should support the dollar for now,” said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.

2018-07-03,"DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. consumers put a high value on fuel economy when buying a new vehicle, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, as automakers lobby the administration of President Donald Trump for relief from mileage requirements enacted by his predecessor.  In a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken May 31 to June 15, 41 percent of respondents said mileage was most important to them when buying a new vehicle, after cost and safety but before warranty, brand, design and high-tech features like navigation.  This is roughly the same set of priorities that U.S. adults set in a similar poll taken in July 2017.  Among respondents who identified as Trump voters, 34 percent said they wanted automakers to focus on improving fuel efficiency - a higher share than respondents who identified as Democrats or Hillary Clinton voters. The Trump administration has signaled it could act soon to freeze emissions standards from 2020 through 2026. The state of California and other states have said they will fight such an action, leaving automakers to confront two separate emissions standards within the U.S. market. Gasoline prices have risen about 30 percent since Trump took office, mainly due to a pact by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to curtail oil output to help reduce an oversupply of crude. They agreed last month to boost output. But Trump, who has accused OPEC of manipulating oil prices, wants group leader Saudi Arabia to pump even more crude. Gasoline prices, which could create a political headache for Trump ahead of November elections, are a visible cost of living indicator, especially during the summer vacation season. A record 47 million people in the U.S. are expected to travel more than 50 miles for the 4th of July holiday weekend.  The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.86 on July 3, the highest level for the July 4 period in four years, according to AAA, the motoring and travel group. But fuel economy is a challenging issue for automakers. Trade groups representing major automakers competing in the United States have asked the Trump administration for more leeway to meet Obama administration vehicle fuel economy targets, arguing the rules are costly and not in sync with consumer demand.  Those rules require automakers to slash the carbon emissions and roughly double the average fuel efficiency of their U.S. light vehicles by 2025 compared with 2011.  Automakers are also worried that state mandates to sell more electric and hybrid vehicles will hurt profits, because those vehicles are money-losers in a U.S. market that is shifting toward sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks. One reason is that 2018 sport utility vehicles on average are 24.7 percent more fuel efficient than SUVs of a decade ago, and are now close to the fuel economy levels of a 2008 sedan, according to an analysis by Cox Automotive, which tracks market data and purchase trends. A new 2018 SUV averages 23.7 miles per gallon. A new 2008 car averaged 24.8 miles per gallon.

2018-07-03,"OSLO, July 3 (Reuters) - Consolidation among smaller offshore oil rig companies would help to boost a recovery in the drilling market, the CEO of offshore rig firm Seadrill said on Tuesday, a day after it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Seadrill started trading new shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday and plans to list new shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange by end of July or beginning of August. Shares of Seadrill, controlled by Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen, opened at $25 a share, but slid to $18 a share by 1508 GMT. Once the world’s largest offshore driller by the market capitalisation, Seadrill had to seek protection from creditors last September after being hit by prolonged oil market downturn which started in 2014. Oil prices have partly recovered since hitting a low in January 2016, and demand for drilling rigs is up. Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz said consolidation of smaller players could help the drilling market’s recovery. “Anybody with the fleet of less than 10-15 rigs probably needs to be consolidated ... All who don’t have scale are candidates for consolidation,” he said. While there has been a lot of talk about the need to consolidate fragmented rig market, there have been only a few significant deals so far. Ensco acquired Atwood Oceanics, and Transocean bought Songa Offshore last year, while Borr Drilling took over Paragon Offshore this year. Danish shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk has been not yet found a buyer for its offshore drilling division, Maersk Drilling. “Whether it (consolidation) comes from us or from smaller competitors, it will be positive,” Dibowitz said. Seadrill itself was “comfortable” with the size and composition of its fleet, which includes 19 floating rigs and 16 jack-up rigs, he added. Dibowitz said the upturn in the market was becoming stronger with the numbers of tenders and opportunities increasing. He said the North Sea market had been “particularly attractive,” while demand for deep and ultradeep water drilling was up in Brazil, West Africa and U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The CEO said the company had continued to provide drilling rigs to oil and gas firm during the bankruptcy proceedings, but it had been a drag on business. “It would be absolutely easier for us to secure more work, because you don’t have that black mark or flag,” Dibowitz said in an interview. A Seadrill spokesman said eleven out of the company’s 19 floating rigs and nine out of 16 jack-ups were employed or about to start work. Dibowitz said the company would stick to its strategy to provide “any kind of asset in any market to any customer.. harsh, benign, shallow, deep.” (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis.

2018-07-03,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A drop in the number of new German wind power projects coming on  stream in 2019 and the early 2020s could make it harder to achieve economies of scale and hit investment, according to the country’s VDMA mechanical engineering group. That in turn could jeopardize Germany’s target of producing 65 percent of power from renewable sources by 2030, which is expected to require 20 gigawatts (GW) of total offshore wind capacity, four times the current number, VDMA said. Policymakers have recently shifted the industry away from fixed feed-in tariffs towards auctions for new building permits, hitting the profitability of wind power companies.  VDMA believes the transition may have been too drastic, leading to a slowdown in new projects already this year. “The build-out will have a serious dent in 2019 for onshore and a complete stalling of offshore projects in 2020 and 2021, while other European countries have a steady order pipeline,” said Matthias Zelinger, head of VDMA’s Power Systems unit, naming the Netherlands, Denmark and Britain as more supportive of their wind industries. “This could erode the competitiveness of Germany as a reference market for component manufacturers,” he said in an interview, adding competition was shaping up in China and the United States. The unit groups a few dozen companies involved in supplying power-generating industries, including leading names in wind Siemens Gamesa, Nordex and Senvion, MHI Vestas and General Electric. While two thirds of the unit’s turnover comes from exports, Zelinger said it was important - as for the car industry - for the technology to thrive near where the equipment is produced. Industry figures show 5.6 GW of capacity were added in the onshore German wind industry last year, while that figure could fall to 3-4 GW in 2018 and 2.8 GW in 2019.     Offshore wind construction in Germany’s North and Baltic Seas last year came in at 1.25 GW while, from this year, only 2.3 GW are under construction up to 2020. Permits after that are optional, and for more capacity to emerge policymakers must build grids and phase out old thermal plants, VDMA said. In the short term, Zelinger said the government should award 500-600 megawatts (MW) more onshore wind capacity in 2018/19 and add 1 GW to offshore auction volumes, and consider a price floor for carbon pollution rights.

2018-07-03,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s weapons sales to the Middle East doubled in 2017, a government report showed, as President Emmanuel Macron defied pressure from lawmakers and rights groups to curb arms flows to a region mired in conflict.      France is among the world’s leading arms exporters, its sales surging in recent years on the back of its first lucrative overseas contracts for Rafale fighter jets, notably to India and Qatar, as well as a multi-billion submarine deal with Australia. Paris has sought to increase its diplomatic weight in the Middle East through the sale of naval vessels, tanks, artillery and munitions to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The government’s annual report on weapons sales, due to be released on Wednesday, shows that France’s total arms sales halved to 7 billion euros in 2017, in line with previous years where no major contracts, such as for the Dassault-made Rafale, were recorded. However, about 60 percent of sales went to the Middle East, with arms exports to the region worth 3.92 billion euros compared to 1.94 billion euros a year earlier. Sales to Saudi Arabia fell slightly, while deals to the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar soared. France’s biggest defence firms, including Dassault and Thales, have major contracts with the Gulf. “It is not for France to conclude piecemeal transactions depending on market opportunities. The goal is to create a strong link with the importing states,” the report said.  “France’s arms exports meet the legitimate needs of states.”     France is now the third largest arms exporter in the world behind the United States and Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.   Unlike those of many allies, France’s export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances. They are approved by a committee headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign, defence and economy ministries. Details of licences are not public and once approved are rarely reviewed. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and some lawmakers have urged Macron to scale back support for Arab states that are part of a Saudi-led offensive in Yemen against fighters from the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that controls the capital.  The French government says its arms sales are governed by strict procedures that are in line with international treaties. Four NGOs, including the International Federation for Human Rights, on Monday accused the French state and several French companies of tacitly participating in an Egyptian government crackdown on opposition groups over the past five years. The report cited, among other things, the sale of “personal surveillance, mass interception, personal data collection and crowd control (...) technologies that have led to the arrest of tens of thousands of opponents or militants.” Additional repoting by Elizabeth Pineau; Editing by Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-egypt-arms/despite-criticism-at-home-french-arms-sales-double-in-the-middle-east-idUKL8N1TX0N6,03 Jul 2018,"France's weapons sales to the

2018-07-03,"BERN (Reuters) - President Hassan Rouhani appeared on Tuesday to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from neighboring countries if Washington presses ahead with its goal of forcing all countries to stop buying Iranian oil. The comments, published on Iran’s presidential website on Tuesday and partially repeated at a later news conference in Switzerland, could be open to interpretation. However, when asked whether he intended to make a threat, Rouhani declined to provide a clarification. Iranian officials in the past have threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action against Iran. “The Americans have claimed they want to completely stop Iran’s oil exports. They don’t understand the meaning of this statement, because it has no meaning for Iranian oil not to be exported, while the region’s oil is exported,” the website, president.ir, quoted him as saying. When asked at a news conference in Bern later on Tuesday whether those comments constituted a threat to interfere with the shipping of neighboring countries, Rouhani said: “Assuming that Iran could become the only oil producer unable to export its oil is a wrong assumption ... The United States will never be able to cut Iran’s oil revenues.” The United States pulled out of a multinational deal in May to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear program. Washington has since told countries they must halt all imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures, with no exemptions. Rouhani said the new U.S. pressure would never succeed. “It is incorrect and unwise to imagine that some day all producer countries will be able to export their surplus oil and Iran will not be able to export its oil,” he said. The Iranian president is in Europe to gather support ahead of a meeting later this week between Iran and the five global powers that are still party to the 2015 nuclear deal. “Iran will remain committed to the deal, as long as its interests are preserved,” Rouhani said. Tehran said its foreign minister would meet counterparts from U.S. allies Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China, in Vienna on Friday to discuss ways of maintaining the nuclear deal. The five other powers have all said they still support the deal despite the U.S. decision to withdraw. Iran has asked the European countries to come up with a new economic package to offset the U.S. sanctions and preserve the accord.  “At the meeting, which will be held at the request of Iran, foreign ministers of Iran and five world powers will discuss a proposed European package and measures to protect the agreement,” Iranian state news agency IRNA reported on Tuesday. The signatories to the deal, minus the United States, have been working on a ministerial meeting in Vienna for weeks and the date has slipped several times since preparations began. “For now, that’s the plan,” an EU source said. “The Iranians expect the others to say what we are going to do to keep the deal alive.” “We will have to see if it is going to be good enough for the Iranians,” the source added. The EU’s foreign service, the EEAS, was not immediately available for comment on the meeting.  Since President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw in May, calling the agreement deeply flawed, European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to maintain the nuclear curbs required in the deal. But so far it has proven difficult to offset the impact of continued U.S. sanctions, with European firms reluctant to risk far-reaching U.S. financial penalties to do business in Iran. Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, exports about 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. The White House said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman had promised Trump that he can raise oil production if needed, and that Riyadh has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity.

2018-07-03,"NEW YORK, July 3 - World stocks rose on Tuesday, supported by broad gains in Europe and rising oil prices, even though markets across Asia remained in the grip of trade turbulence. A July 6 deadline is looming for Washington to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods that Beijing has vowed to match with tariffs on U.S. products. President Donald Trump also threatened on Monday to “do something” if the United States was not better treated by the World Trade Organization. Prospects of a full-blown trade war and relentless yuan weakening - it has fallen 5 percent in the past two weeks and is near 11-month lows - reportedly forced China into intervention via state-run banks. “It is by far the biggest (yuan loss) I can remember. Prudence suggests it has to be matched across Southeast Asia because of the competitive implications,” said Bank of New York Mellon strategist Neil Mellor. “It generates a degree of instability in the market simply by virtue of its scale.” Among equity markets, Hong Kong dived as much as 3.3 percent to nine-month lows, hit also by U.S. curbs on China Mobile. Shanghai’s bourse hit a two-year trough but closed higher as the yuan recovered. The mood was more cheerful in Europe where a pan-European equity index rose 1 percent, the euro firmed and bond yields climbed after German Chancellor Angela Merkel struck a migration deal with her Bavarian conservative coalition partners. In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 88.76 points, or 0.37 percent, to 24,395.94, the S&P 500 gained 7.04 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,733.75 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.71 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,570.40. “The big driver behind U.S. resilience is that tech has been strong,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at asset manager Psigma. “Expectations are pretty high for the earnings season, with talk of 20 percent earnings growth year-on-year.” U.S. markets are set to close early for the Fourth of July holiday. Energy stocks have been boosted by Brent crude’s rise past $78 a barrel, McPherson noted. Europe’s tech and energy sectors rose 0.5 and 1 percent respectively . That helped MSCI’s world index to rise 0.25 percent, inching further off 2-1/2 month lows hit last week. While U.S. growth and company earnings seem unassailable, tit-for-tat tariffs from China and Europe may ultimately prove detrimental for American businesses and jobs. U.S. bond yields rose slightly amid the easier mood but concern about the trade row has helped push the gap between two- and 10-year yields to the narrowest since 2007. “Basically (the flat curve) is saying the underlying growth in the U.S. economy may not be as strong as the high short-term interest rates might warrant,” McPherson said. The dollar retreated 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies and the easing tensions in Germany helped the euro to gain 0.2 percent against the greenback. Friday’s monthly payrolls data should show labor markets remain tight, keeping the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy tightening on track. “Notwithstanding the trade war concerns, the broader picture is the U.S. central bank still remains the most hawkish central bank among its peers and that should support the dollar for now,” said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.

2018-07-03,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2tS9i6S By John Kemp LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - U.S. traffic volumes are levelling off in a sign the previous stimulus from cheap gasoline prices is fading as pump prices rise. The volume of traffic on U.S. roads was down by almost 0.6 percent in April compared with the same month a year earlier, after seasonal adjustments, according to statistics released on Monday. Traffic volumes declined year-on-year for the first time since the first quarter of 2014, according to the Federal Highway Administration (“Traffic volume trends”, FHWA, July 2018). Volumes in any one month can be distorted by the timing of public holidays, the distribution of working days and weekends, and unusual weather patterns. But the rate of growth in traffic volumes has been slowing consistently since early 2016, coinciding with the rise in gasoline prices, after accelerating during 2014/15, coinciding with the previous oil price slump. Traffic volume growth has been correlated with the rise and fall in retail gasoline prices over at least the past 25 years, among other factors (tmsnrt.rs/2tS9i6S). Cheap gasoline provided a significant stimulus to driving during the latter part of 2014 and throughout 2015 but the impact has faded as average pump prices have climbed back towards $3 per gallon. The slowdown in traffic volume growth is consistent with separate data showing a levelling off in the quantity of gasoline consumed in 2017/18 after rapid growth in 2015/16. The quantity of gasoline supplied to domestic consumers during the first four months of 2018 rose by just 4 million barrels or 0.4 percent compared with the same month a year earlier(“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, June 2018). EIA forecasts U.S. gasoline consumption will grow by just 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 40,000 bpd in 2019, after rising by just 2,000 bpd in 2017 but 139,000 bpd in 2016 and 257,000 bpd in 2015. By contrast, U.S. distillate consumption is predicted to rise by 130,000 bpd in 2018 and another 60,000 bpd in 2019 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, June 2018). Besides the impact on miles driven, oil prices influence gasoline consumption through motorists’ choices about new vehicles purchased and the retirement of older vehicles from the fleet. During the price slump, consumers switched to purchasing larger vehicles with lower fuel economy, reversing the earlier trend towards smaller cars and more efficient engines, in the process boosting gasoline consumption. Now prices are climbing, fuel economy is set to become more important for vehicle buyers again, and there is likely to be a shift back towards smaller, more fuel-efficient engines, restraining further consumption growth. Over the last seven decades, there has been a clear link between oil prices and fuel consumption growth rates, which has been confirmed during the most recent oil-price cycle. Oil consumption is normally led by gasoline during the first phase of each cyclical upswing until distillates become the primary driver in the second phase. During the first phase of the current cyclical recovery, the rise in oil consumption was led by gasoline consumption by private motorists, but that impact is now fading as gasoline prices climb. Further consumption growth increasingly relies on the distillate fuels used in freight transport, as well as the industrial sector and on oil and gas drilling sites. Notwithstanding strong demand for distillates, rising oil prices are already starting to restrict overall consumption growth, principally through their impact on gasoline sales. As a result, EIA forecasts U.S. petroleum consumption will increase by just 53,000 bpd in 2018 and 26,000 bpd in 2019 after rising by 190,000 bpd in 2017, 153,000 bpd in 2016 and 434,000 bpd in 2015. Rising oil prices are already helping to restrain consumption growth and rebalance the oil market and any further escalation will accelerate the effect.

2018-07-03,"NAIROBI, July 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Some 300,000 Kenyans who depend on Turkana - the world’s biggest desert lake - could run short of drinking water and fish if Ethiopia moves ahead with plans to construct two more dams on a river upstream, activists said. The United Nations cultural agency (UNESCO) put Kenya’s Lake Turkana, on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites last week because of the “disruptive effect” of an existing Ethiopian dam and irrigated sugar estates over Kenya’s northern border. “We are concerned that these projects will have implication on the local communities who depend on the lake for fishing and for their livelihood,” said Guy Debonnet, a conservation expert with UNESCO. “Ethiopia is planning two new dams on the Omo river which will only make the situation worse.” Addis Ababa rejects the claims, saying its own studies show the dam will regulate the river’s flow and stabilise water levels in the flood-prone region. Also known as the Jade Sea, Lake Turkana, in northwestern Kenya, gets 90 percent of its water from the Omo River in Ethiopia - one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, using its rivers to generate power for manufacturing and export. Ethiopia’s Gibe III Dam, which was completed in 2016, and irrigation for the Kuraz sugar plantations have already reduced water into Turkana from the Omo River, said Rudo Sanyanga, Africa director of the lobby group International Rivers. The lake is likely to shrink slowly, reducing breeding grounds for fish, and become too salty for fish to survive and too toxic for people and animals to drink, possibly triggering conflict and overcrowding, she said on Monday. “Ethiopia should cancel the plans that it has to construct two more dams, Gibe IV and Gibe V, on the Omo River,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments. “These projects will only exacerbate the risk for drying up of the lake.” Ethiopia is also at loggerheads with Egypt over another dam that Addis Ababa is building on the River Nile which Cairo fears will reduce waters running to its fields and reservoirs from Ethiopia’s highlands. Ikal Angelei director of Friends of Lake Turkana, which advocates for communities living around the lake - many of whom rely heavily on livestock - said underground water basins and pasture would also be reduced. “Gibe IV and Gibe V cannot go on without the Kenyan government being a little bit more realistic of the impact,” Angelei told Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""While Kenya is planning to possibly benefit from buying the power, we have to ask ourselves what is the cost of this power on ecosystem in the longer term?""

2018-07-03,"KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi authorities began recounting votes on Tuesday from May’s disputed parliamentary election, officials said, a step towards forming a new government after weeks of delays. Counting started in the ethnically mixed northern oil-producing province of Kirkuk, the election commission said, and at least six other provinces were expected to follow suit in coming days. Parliament ordered a full recount last month after a government report concluded there were widespread violations. As a result, political blocs began heated talks about the formation of the next government. A panel of judges overseeing the recount later limited its scope, ruling that it would only cover suspect ballots flagged in formal complaints or official reports on fraud. Overseas votes cast in Iran, Turkey, Britain, Lebanon, Jordan, the United States and Germany will also be recounted, the panel added. Representatives from the United Nations and foreign embassies will attend the process, as will local and international observers. One person was killed and 20 wounded in Kirkuk on Sunday when a suicide car bomb went off near a storage site housing ballot boxes. Police sources said the warehouse was not damaged. The initial results in Kirkuk were disputed by the Turkmen and Arab communities of the region which is also inhabited by a large Kurdish population. The election commission said last month that initial results from Kirkuk indicated a win for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), a historic Kurdish party. In October, Iraqi forces backed by Shi’ite militias dislodged Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who had seized Kirkuk in 2014, preventing its capture by Islamic State militants who had overrun Iraqi army positions in northern and western Iraq. The Iraqi offensive was in response to a Sept. 25 referendum on Kurdish independence in which Kurds overwhelmingly voted for independence. The referendum was held by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government both in areas recognised by Baghdad as falling under its authority as well as other areas claimed by both the central government and the KRG that the latter seized in 2014, including Kirkuk.

Wall Street was set for another firmer session as investors positioned for strong Silicon Valley earnings before the reporting season starts next week, while European shares also rose after a deal on settling a migration policy row that had threatened Germany’s coalition government. But a July 6 deadline is looming for Washington to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods that Beijing has vowed to match with tariffs on U.S. products. President Donald Trump also threatened on Monday to “do something” if the United States was not better treated by the World Trade Organisation. Prospects of a full-blown trade war and relentless yuan weakening — it has fallen 5 percent in the past two weeks near 11-month lows — reportedly forced China into intervention via state-run banks.. A central bank advisor was also quoted as saying authorities did not expect significant yuan depreciation. That helped the yuan reverse earlier losses to move back into positive territory for the day against the dollar, standing 0.3 percent firmer in offshore trade at 6.66 per dollar. The gains filtered through to other Asian currencies, as well as the Australian dollar, considered a proxy for China risk, allowing it to edge off 1-1/2-year lows to the greenback . However, forward markets anticipate the yuan will stay under pressure. It is seen trading around 6.7 per dollar in six months’ time, with many reckoning Beijing could use currency weakness as a tool to counter U.S. trade barriers. “It is by far the biggest (yuan loss) I can remember. Prudence suggests it has to be matched across Southeast Asia because of the competitive implications,” said Bank of New York Mellon strategist Neil Mellor. “It generates a degree of instability in the market simply by virtue of its scale.” Among equities, Hong Kong dived as much as 3.3 percent to nine-month lows, hit also by U.S. curbs on China Mobile . Shanghai’s bourse hit a two-year trough but closed higher as the yuan recovered. The mood was more cheerful in Europe where a pan-European equity index rose one percent, the euro firmed and bond yields climbed after German Chancellor Angela Merkel struck a migration deal with her Bavarian conservative coalition partners. Equity futures for the U.S. S&P500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes   rose around 0.4 percent, indicating Wall Street’s tech-driven rally would continue. Tech shares have been relatively resilient to trade fears - the New York Stock Exchange’s index of 10 tech giants including China’s Alibaba has gained over 30 percent this year. “The big driver behind U.S. resilience is that tech has been strong,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at asset manager Psigma. “Expectations are pretty high for the earnings season, with talk of 20 percent earnings growth year-on-year.” Energy stocks have been boosted by Brent crude’s rise past $78 a barrel, he noted. Europe’s tech and energy sectors rose 0.5 and 1 percent respectively . That helped MSCI’s world index to rise 0.25 percent, inching further off 2-1/2 month lows hit last week. While U.S. growth and company earnings seem unassailable, tit-for-tat tariffs from China and Europe may ultimately prove detrimental for American businesses and jobs. U.S. bond yields rose slightly amid the easier mood but concern about the trade row has helped push the gap between two- and 10-year yields to the narrowest since 2007. “Basically (the flat curve) is saying the underlying growth in the U.S. economy may not be as strong as the high short-term interest rates might warrant,” McPherson said. The dollar retreated 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies and the easing tensions in Germany helped the euro to gain 0.2 percent against the greenback. However, many reckon the dollar’s three-month winning streak will continue for a while yet. Friday’s monthly payrolls data should show labour markets remain tight, keeping the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy tightening on track. “Notwithstanding the trade war concerns, the broader picture is the U.S. central bank still remains the most hawkish central bank among its peers and that should support the dollar for now,” said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.

2018-07-03,"BAKU (Reuters) - The electricity supply in Azerbaijan was being gradually restored on Tuesday after a major blackout that left the former Soviet country with no power for several hours, the energy ministry said. The massive outage was caused by an explosion at a hydropower station in the city of Mingacevir following an overload of the electrical system due to a very hot weather and use of air-conditioners. BP said the blackout did not affect oil and gas production as the electricity system was switched to standalone  generators. Azeri state oil company SOCAR said the disruption did not affect offshore oil operations either, but caused “some temporary problems with onshore production.” “Power had been restored in many areas and at essential facilities like hospitals, military bases, the Baku subway, and the airport, by early morning,” the APA.az news outlet reported, citing the energy ministry. Azerbaijan plans to import electricity from Georgia and Russia, Yahya Babanli, a spokesman for Azerenergy, a state energy supply company, told the independent Real TV. Azeri President Ilham Aliyev ordered a government commission to be set up to identify reasons for the outage.

2018-07-03,"PARIS (Reuters) - Greenpeace crashed a Superman-shaped drone into a French nuclear plant on Tuesday to demonstrate its vulnerability to outside attacks, the environmental group said.  Greenpeace said it had flown the drone - piloted by one of its activists - into the no-fly zone around utility EDF’s Bugey nuclear plant, near Lyon, and then crashed it against the wall of the plant’s spent-fuel pool building. “This action again highlights the extreme vulnerability of this type of buildings, which contain the highest amount of radioactivity in nuclear plants,” Greenpeace said.  France generates 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power in 19 nuclear plants operated by state-controlled EDF.  EDF said that two drones had flown over the Bugey site, of which one had been intercepted by French police.  “The presence of these drones had no impact on the security of the installations,” EDF said, adding that it will file a police complaint. The drone stunt follows a series of staged break-ins by Greenpeace activists into French nuclear plants, which Greenpeace says are vulnerable to outside attack, especially the spent-fuel pools. These pools can hold the equivalent of several reactor cores, stored in concrete pools outside the highly reinforced reactor building.  Greenpeace says the spent-fuel buildings have not been designed to withstand outside attacks and are the most vulnerable part of French nuclear plants. “Spent-fuel pools must be turned into bunkers in order to make nuclear plants safer,” said Greenpeace France’s chief nuclear campaigner Yannick Rousselet. EDF said the spent-fuel pool buildings are robust and designed to withstand natural disasters and accidents.  Greenpeace’s security breaches have sparked a parliament investigation into nuclear security, which is due to present its report on Thursday.  In October, Greenpeace activists broke through two security barriers and launched fireworks over EDF’s Cattenom nuclear plant.  In February, a French court gave several Greenpeace activists suspended jail sentences while ordering the group to pay a fine and 50,000 euros ($58,300) in damages to EDF.

2018-07-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - A historic peak in global mergers and acquisitions in the first half of 2018 has seen the energy and power sector retain its lead as the biggest contributor, with the value of deals increasing by 62 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed.  The value of energy and power transactions announced globally rose to $365.7 billion in the first six months of the year from $225.5 billion a year earlier and accounted for almost 16 percent of total M&A value. Utility companies in mature markets have been undergoing a wave of consolidation, seeking to create scale partly because of the increasing shift to renewable energy sources that is forcing them to change business models. Among the most high-profile deals, Germany’s top utilities RWE (RWEG.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE) agreed to break up RWE’s subsidiary Innogy (IGY.DE) and divide its assets between them in a 5.2 billion euro ($6.06 billion) deal, while China Three Gorges [CYTGP.UL] launched a $10.8 billion bid to take control of EDP (EDP.LS), Portugal’s biggest company. “Over the past few years there has been a repositioning of the utility sector toward sustainable clean energy...(a move) to something that is much more based on digitalized power forces and a world of electrification, with electric vehicles and smart houses,” said Jeanette Smits van Oyen, head of utilities investment banking EMEA at JPMorgan (JPM.N).  “The consolidation via acquisitions is driven by the inability for some to achieve that organically and the recognition that companies need synergies for this transition to take place,” she said. The momentum was likely to continue as the transition to cleaner energy would take between 10 and 20 years to happen, she added. As confidence picked up after crude oil prices climbed above $70 a barrel in January for the first time in three years, a wave of consolidation has also been seen in the downstream segment of the oil and gas sector.   Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) agreed to buy rival Andeavor ANDV.N for more than $23 billion, creating one of the largest global refiners that will benefit from access to booming U.S. shale. With governments and environmentalists forecasting a peak in oil demand within a generation, oil and gas majors are also fighting to establish themselves as the dominant players in the fast-growing businesses of solar power and electric car charging points. “The investment in renewable energy by BP (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and other oil majors over the past ten years is now continuing into the downstream energy market,” said Gavin Watson, head of law firm Dechert’s Intl Oil & Gas Group. BP said in June it was buying Britain’s top electric vehicle charging firm Chargemaster, joining rival Shell and carmakers, which have also made investments in the electric vehicle (EV) market. “To achieve that goal (oil and gas companies) need to dispose of non-core assets, and release capital to finance their future energy strategy. That results in a lot more M&A activity,” Watson added.

It said it now expected Germany’s passenger car market to grow by 1 percent to around 3.5 million vehicles this year, compared with a previous guidance for 3.4 million. “Despite economic and political uncertainty, the German automotive industry remains strong,” VDA President Bernhard Mattes told journalists at a news conference on Tuesday, according to a prepared speech text. In June, new car registrations were 4 percent higher than in the year-earlier period. Germany’s autos sector is being rattled by a threat by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 20 percent tariff on all imports of cars assembled in the European Union. VDA’s Mattes called on politicians to seek a transatlantic compromise that would see both the U.S. and Europe take a step back from tariffs and would comply with the rules set out by the World Trade Organization. “But if the U.S. should nonetheless unilaterally increase tariffs there will have to be a response,” he said.

2018-07-03,"(Adds June output, details) DUBAI, July 3 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) said on Tuesday it has the ability to increase oil production by several hundred thousand barrels per day (bpd) if required to alleviate any supply shortage in the global market. State-run ADNOC remains on track to increase its production capacity to 3.5 million bpd by the end of 2018 from around 3.3 million bpd now, it said in a statement. The United Arab Emirates pumped 2.87 million bpd in June, two industry sources said. That means the Gulf OPEC member has the potential to boost supplies by some 400,000 bpd if it produces at maximum capacity now, with the possibility of adding around 200,000 bpd more by the end of the year. U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at OPEC on Sunday with a warning to stop manipulating oil markets and piled pressure on U.S. ally Saudi Arabia to raise supplies to compensate for lower exports from Iran. On June 23, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. OPEC and non-OPEC said in their statement last month that they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. That would mean a roughly 1 million bpd increase in output. Separately, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih discussed oil market developments with his Russian counterpart, and the two agreed to continue close coordination in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy, the Saudi Energy Ministry said on Tuesday. UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei also said on Tuesday that OPEC would aim to adhere to the group’s “overall conformity levels” for the rest of 2018 and that the UAE was ready to help alleviate any supply shortage.

2018-07-03,"LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp Energia is set to start drilling the country’s first deep water offshore exploration well but with only modest hopes of success, its exploration and production director said on Monday. The project, being developed by a consortium of Galp and Italy’s ENI off the Alentejo region’s Vicentine coast, known for its beaches and large natural park, has led to protests by environmental activists and local municipalities. Thore Kristiansen told Reuters on the fringes of a petroleum engineering event in Lisbon the seismic data shots made the project look “interesting enough so that we at least have to try”, even if turns out dry. He said the partners were “calibrating” the project to meet various conditions set by the Portuguese Environmental Agency in May, but did not expect any delays. The agency has deliberated that drilling has to be carried out at some point between September 15 and January 15.  “But this is frontier drilling. Nobody has done it before and there is a high likelihood that we will not find anything,” he said, adding that the geological formation could be similar to the oil-containing structures along the eastern coast of Canada. “We have applied the same ... models for what we are doing in Portugal. But the reality is that we don’t know,” he said.  The company, which has most of its best assets in Brazil’s large offshore oil fields, plans to boost output by 50 percent by 2020 to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and hopes to increase its natural gas output after 2020 by bringing onstream the giant Mamba area in Mozambique. Partners in the Mamba project, headed by operator ENI,  expect to submit their operation and development plan to the government “very, very soon” Kristiansen said, projecting the final investment decision on the project next year. In Angola, Kristiansen expects to bring onstream the Kaombo Norte offshore project in August, while a second floating production unit should start production next year. The two should compensate for recent declines in output from mature Angolan fields. Asked about Galp’s potential interest in the likely sale of a large stake in Brazil’s offshore Santos basin by Petrobras as part of the long-running “transfer-of-rights” dispute, Kristiansen said he could not disclose any concrete plans. But he also said Galp would study all possibilities for further development and growth in Brazil, including the transfer of rights licenses.

Shanghai’s bourse hit a 2-year trough though both indexes inched higher towards the close as the yuan recovered. Japan’s Nikkei edged to a near three-month closing low. The mood was more cheerful in Europe where a pan-European equity index rose half a percent, the euro firmed marginally and bond yields rose after German Chancellor Angela Merkel struck the deal with her Bavarian conservative coalition partners. “The agreement between Chancellor Merkel and German interior minister Horst Seehofer should see German political risk fade into the background as a downside risk for the euro in the near-term,” MUFG analysts told clients. Equity futures for the U.S. S&P500 and Nasdaq indicated a firmer session after Wall Street ended higher on Tuesday for the third day in a row. Gains of around 1 percent in tech firms such as Microsoft and Apple offset concerns about trade and its impact on growth. Tech shares have been relatively resilient to trade fears - the New York Stock Exchange’s index of 10 tech giants including China’s Alibaba has gained over 30 percent this year.

The joint OPEC and non-OPEC producers’ committees will monitor overall compliance, he added. “OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation remain unwavering in their commitment to contribute to market stability, in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy,” Mazrouei said. On June 23, OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. OPEC and non-OPEC said in their joint statement after that meeting that they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts that are set to continue until the end of 2018, when the Declaration of Cooperation is due to expire. Some countries have been underproducing the targets specified by the Declaration of Cooperation, so returning to 100 percent compliance would increase output by around 1 million barrels per day, OPEC officials said.

2018-07-03,"* Trade war concerns grow as July 6 U.S. tariff deadline nears * Shanghai stocks lowest in 28 months, Hang Seng dives over 3 pct * Chinese yuan slips past 6.7 per dollar for 1st time in a year * Merkel says compromise reached on migration issue * European stocks seen opening higher By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, July 3 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks went into a tail spin on Tuesday as turbulence gripped equity markets in Asia, which sank to nine-month lows amid heightened anxiety a bitter trade dispute between the United States and major economies could derail global growth. Speculation was rife China’s central bank was intervening in the currency market to staunch losses and prevent a potentially destabilising sell-off in the yuan, while stocks came off a searing sell-off in the morning. Chinese financial markets have been jittery ahead of a July 6 deadline, when the U.S. is set to slap tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods that Beijing has vowed to match with tariffs on U.S. products. The trade row between the United States and major economies has rattled financial markets over several weeks, with no sign U.S. President Donald Trump is about to back down from his ‘America First’ protectionism policies that many fear will harm the global economy. The European stock futures point to gains of 0.3 percent in France’s CAC and Britain’s FTSE and 0.5 percent in Germany’s DAX. The Asia Pacific MSCI index ex-Japan tumbled as much as 1.4 percent to its lowest since September 29, before cutting some of the losses to be down 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average also recovered from a 0.9 percent fall and was last off 0.1 percent to a near three-month closing low. Chinese stocks were hit the hardest, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index diving as much as 3.3 percent to its lowest level in ten months, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed as much as 1.9 percent to hit a fresh 28 month low. The Hong Kong market remained choppy and was last down 1.9 percent, while the Shanghai bourse edged up 0.05 percent. “It’s not clear yet if the trade row will derail the global economy as a whole but it’s already clear that it will harm Chinese companies at least,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “That is why we’ve seen Chinese yuan and Chinese stocks have suffered selloffs. I think this will continue at least until the July 6 deadline.” The Chinese yuan, on a downward spiral since mid-June, slipped past 6.7 per dollar in early trading on Tuesday for the first time since Aug. 9, 2017 before paring losses on talk of intervention by the Chinese central bank. Four traders told Reuters that major state-owned banks were seen swapping yuan for dollars in the forwards market and immediately selling some of them into spot market, which helped support the Chinese currency. Traders and economists say major state-owned banks sometimes act on behalf of the central bank in the foreign exchange interbank market. The central bank put the midpoint roughly in line with market expectations at 6.6497 yuan per dollar, its weakest level in about 10 months, setting the stage for the day’s drop. The yuan was last traded at 6.6960 per dollar. “I detected increasing alarm over trade tensions and a lot of nervousness about a full blown trade war, which comes at a bad time for China where the economy is undergoing a downdraft at the same time the United States is seeing a sharp upturn,” Aninda Mitra, Singapore-based senior sovereign analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management, who visited Shanghai last week, said in an emailed note to media. Trump told the World Trade Organization on Monday that “we’ll be doing something” if the United States is not treated properly, just hours after the European Union said that U.S. automotive tariffs would hurt its own vehicle industry and prompt retaliation. Also on Monday, Washington moved to block China Mobile from offering services to the U.S. telecommunications market, recommending its application be rejected because the government-owned firm posed national security risks. Officials in China, the epicentre of the international trade row, have warned the United States that the tit-for-tat tariffs on each others’ goods will ultimately prove detrimental for American businesses and jobs. Elsewhere in currency markets, the euro, which had been pressured by political uncertainty in Germany, pared losses after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives settled a row over migration that threatened to topple her governing coalition after interior minister Horst Seehofer dropped his threat to quit. The euro last traded at $1.1650, after shedding 0.45 percent overnight. The dollar last stood at 110.97 yen, giving up gains following sharp falls in Chinese shares. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept rates at record lows of 1.5 percent, as widely expected, at its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday and showed no hint of hiking anytime soon. RBA Governor Philip Lowe said “one uncertainty regarding the global outlook stems from the direction of international trade policy in the United States,” cautioning that the recent U.S.-China trade tensions may pose a risk. China is Australia’s major export market and its currency, the Australia dollar, is considered a liquid proxy for China-related risk. The Aussie dollar came off a 1-1/2-year low of $0.7311 plumbed overnight, fetching $0.7368. On commodity markets, copper edged higher on Tuesday but was still near a seven-month low reached in the previous session as the trade tensions raised concerns about demand. Oil prices climbed after Libya declared force majeure on some of its supplies, with Brent crude rising 0.8 percent to $77.93 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 1.1 percent to $74.77 a barrel.

2018-07-03,"TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japan’s JERA has bulked up into one of Asia’s biggest energy traders with its second acquisition of a key team from France’s EDF Trading - its LNG business - a deal aimed at making the utility more savvy and nimble, as well as gaining better access to European markets.  The signing of the deal, which follows the purchase of EDF Trading’s coal business last year, brings a further infusion of the French company’s more aggressive trading style into a traditional power firm. And together they plan to put together a large trading operation. “There are no other utilities in Japan that trade both coal and LNG,” Yuji Kakimi, president of JERA, a venture between Tokyo Electric Power and the Chubu Electric Power, told Reuters in an interview. “Altogether, we’re a 300-strong team whereas other Japanese utilities have just a few,” he said. That number for JERA Trading, a unit based in Singapore, represents an increase of about 100. That includes 10 people from EDFT, 60 LNG-related staff in Tokyo while the rest will be a mix of current JERA employees and new hires. Trader numbers will be “a few dozen”, a company official said. Competitors say the combination of JERA, the world’s biggest importer of LNG and a leading buyer of thermal coal, with EDF’s highly regarded coal and gas teams could herald big changes for the industry. “They have plentiful cash, they have global positions to allow them to move fast, and they have the personnel to act,” said a senior trader with a major commodity merchant, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. “The question is, whether Japan’s conservative utility culture can or wants to keep western gung-ho traders on their books,” he added. Addressing the concern that the two disparate business cultures might not work well, Kakimi acknowledged “there are differences in about how much risk we take in various trades.” But he said he had no plans to change the way EDFT traders did business and that JERA Trading would have a lot of autonomy. He added the two firms have been doing business for 10 years and shared the same purpose: ensuring their parent firms’ fossil fuel plants had cheap fuel. JERA Trading is two-thirds held by JERA with EDF Trading holding the rest and will handle spot trades. Long-term supply deals would remain under the parent firms in Japan. The deal is likely to be finalised by early 2019. Kakimi also said JERA Trading could in the future look at collaborating with EDFT’s team for liquefied petroleum gas, though he added no concrete discussions were taking place. Platts JKM LNG swaps cleared through ICE & CME: reut.rs/2KGXlYi The move comes amid booming LNG demand in which China will soon overtake Japan as the world’s biggest buyer. The market is also moving away from its established model - dominated by Japan - of receiving the fuel under fixed volumes and prices towards one in which cargoes are bought and sold at short notice in the spot market. Trade data shows spot market volumes this year have already exceeded those of all of 2016 fivefold, and they will likely double between 2017 and 2018. In particular, JERA is seeking to boost spot market know-how and expand its access to Europe, a huge pipeline gas market that consumes 400 million tonnes annually and where excess LNG could be sold. “The consumption of LNG is changing greatly and the LNG market is gradually becoming more commoditised and so our main objective is become a firm that can deftly respond to those changes...and key to that is access to Europe,” Kakimi said. The deal allows JERA to share EDFT’s access to 15 LNG terminals in Europe that connect to six gas hubs in Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. EDFT’s coal trading team has already proven its earnings worth, Kakimi said, adding that JERA Trading has been buying coal at least several percentage points cheaper than Japan’s average import price, and JERA has been making steady profits from trading. “We have cultivated a financial trading capability via coal trading, and we can do it for LNG too,” he said. He also said long-term contracts will likely slide to around 50 percent of JERA’s LNG contracts by around 2030, compared with about 80 percent now.

2018-07-03,"SINGAPORE, July 3 (Reuters) - Australian thermal coal prices have broken through $120 per tonne for the first time since 2012, driven up by strong consumption in Asia and spot market buying by Japanese utilities to meet demand through the rest of 2018. Thermal coal cargoes for prompt export from Australia’s Newcastle port last settled at $120.10 per tonne. That’s the highest close since November 2012 and up by 140 percent from record contract lows in late 2015/early 2016. The price surge has been driven by strong demand from China to feed healthy power demand and industrial growth, despite a drive to shift industry and millions of households from coal to cleaner natural gas. Restocking to provide cooling over the hottest summer months has added to demand, along with constraints on supply due to earlier mine closures and high hurdles to developing new mines amid concerns about pollution and global warming. Indonesia has been the biggest beneficiary of China’s strong demand, but Australian miners have also benefited. “Indonesian shipments to China saw the most gains, estimated to reach 61.8 million tonnes or approximately 49 percent of Chinese imports in the first 6 months of 2018, up from 46.3 million during the same period in 2017,” ship brokerage Banchero Costa said in a note to clients. “Imports from Australia were estimated at 42.84 million tonnes or 34 percent of China’s imports in 1H 2018, marginally higher compared to the 42.62 million tonnes shipped during the same period in 2017,” it added. Demand has also been supported by Japanese utilities, which buy about 40 percent of Australia’s thermal coal exports. Traditionally, Japanese utilities receive most of their coal under long-term deals which they negotiate with suppliers. However, talks between Japanese utility Tohoku Electric Power and Glencore, the world’s biggest supplier of seaborne thermal coal, were recently abandoned after they failed to reach an agreement. Traders said this forced Tohoku into the spot market to cover anticipated demand for the rest of the year. “Once it became clear there would be no agreement, Tohoku went into the spot market to order supplies from Australia,” said one trader with a major merchant, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media about commercial matters. “Other utilities, which in the past have used the Tohoku/Glencore deal as a price benchmark, also rushed into the spot market to order coal,” he added. Tohoku was not immediately available for comment.

2018-07-03,"(Corrects spelling error in second paragraph after subheading) * Market held back by rising OPEC output * High fuel prices, trade disputes are slowing down demand By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, July 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed on Tuesday after Libya declared force majeure on significant amounts of its supply, but rising overall output from OPEC as well as in the United States was dragging on markets. Brent crude oil futures were at $78.06 per barrel at 0112 GMT, up 76 cents, or 1 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 75 cents, or 1 percent, at $74.69. Traders said that disruptions to Libyan supplies were pushing up prices on Tuesday, outweighing a rise in June in supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC’s June output was 32.32 million barrels per day (bpd), a Reuters survey showed on Monday, up 320,000 bpd from May. The June total is the highest since January 2018. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) declared force majeure on loadings from Zueitina and Hariga ports on Monday, resulting in total production losses of 850,000 bpd due to the closure of eastern fields and ports. Traders have also been watching U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has surged by 30 percent over the last two years to 10.9 million barrels per day (bpd), absorbing at least some of the recent disruptions. Overall, however, analysts said OPEC’s production policy as well as unplanned supply disruptions were currently the main price drivers. “In the near-term, the level of OPEC production - deployment of spare capacity by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait (and ex-OPEC by Russia), and involuntary disruptions in Libya, Venezuela, Iran - are more important drivers of crude prices,” Goldman Sachs said in a note published late on Monday. What has become a concern, at least for producers, is a slowdown in demand which may end years of consecutive records. “U.S. petroleum demand growth slowed significantly to 385,000 bpd year-on-year in April, compared with a growth of more than 730,000 bpd year-on-year in Q1,” Barclays bank said, adding that this was mostly due to higher fuel prices. In Asia, the world’s biggest oil consumption region, seaborne oil imports have been falling since May, as higher costs turned off consumers and the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China starts to impact the economy. “There are ... signs that growth in China has slowed in recent months, particularly infrastructure spending by local governments. I would assume that infrastructure investment is quite energy intensive, so perhaps that had a knock-on effect to oil demand,” said Frederic Neumann, Co-Head of Asian Economic Research at HSBC in Hong Kong. “At this stage, however, it appears more that growth in Asia is softening, rather than decelerating sharply,” he added.

2018-07-03,"New York (Reuters) - The worst start to a year for world shares since 2010 continued into the third quarter on Monday, with another slump in Chinese shares and weakening global factory surveys leading global equity markets lower.  Shanghai’s bear market lurch continued overnight, with losses of up to 3 percent as firms await U.S. tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods this week, and new business surveys showed some worrying signs of deterioration. The STOXX 600 index of European shares fell 0.8 percent  and the euro slid 0.5 percent to $1.1630 EUR=EBS as differences over immigration threatened Angela Merkel's German coalition government.  On Wall Street, shares turned positive in late afternoon trading as investors weighed trade concerns against Commerce Department data that showed U.S. construction spending increased more than expected in May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared earlier losses and rose 35.77 points, or 0.15 percent, to 24,307.18, while the S&P 500 index gained 8.34 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,726.71. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 57.02 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,097.82.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe slid 0.4 percent.  The trade strains were compounded by an EU threat to hit the United States with retaliatory tariffs, lingering concerns over President Donald Trump’s dislike for the World Trade Organization, and by data showing the weakest euro zone manufacturing growth in 18 months. “There’s not a lot of good news for markets to start the week,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James.  German 10-year bond yields dipped to five-week lows.The U.S. yield curve held near its flattest level in over a decade as investors preferred longer-dated U.S. government debt on worries about a global trade war. Concerns over trade tariffs helped sink Japan's Nikkei .N225 2.2 percent to an 11-week low, with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment deteriorating in the face of trade war threats.  A report from Oxford Economics warned that tariff threats, if realized, would hit over 4 percent of world imports – a more than tenfold rise versus the 0.3 percent of imports hit by the new tariffs imposed so far. “The threat to world growth is significant,” it said. “In a scenario of escalating tariffs, our modeling suggests world GDP could be cut by up to 0.4 percentage points in 2019.”     The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobbying group and customarily a close ally of Trump’s Republican Party, is launching a campaign on Monday to oppose Trump’s trade tariff policies, the organization told Reuters. In currency markets, the euro was knocked back on reports German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer had rejected a migration deal Merkel negotiated at an EU summit on Friday. The Mexican peso see-sawed after leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory for president. Dealers said the clear win might settle one source of political uncertainty, but Obrador was also expected to sharpen Mexican divisions with Trump.

2018-07-03,"* U.S. reimposing sanctions on Iran oil from November * Extra supplies of CPC Blend drive down price * Europe has limited appetite, other light crude options By Olga Yagova and Jane Chung MOSCOW/SEOUL, July 3 (Reuters) - South Korea has imported four times more CPC Blend BFO-CPC crude so far in 2018 than in the same period last year, as the major Asian oil consumer seeks to replace Iranian supplies, shipments data and trading sources said. South Korea, which consumes about 3 percent of the world’s oil output, is increasingly buying CPC Blend as its refiners prepare to halt imports from Iran and comply with U.S. sanctions on Tehran that will kick-in from November. The Asian nation’s Iranian oil imports could fall to the lowest in three years in September, sources have said. The most visible drop in Seoul’s imports from Iran was in May, when purchases fell to 179,444 barrels per day (bpd), the lowest since January 2016, data from the state-run Korea National Oil Corp show. As Iranian imports have fallen, CPC Blend shipments to South Korea since May have been setting record monthly highs and are set to exceed 284,000 bpd in July, Reuters flows system shows. South Korea bought 4 million tonnes of CPC Blend for delivery in January to July this year, compared to 1 million tonnes in the same seven-month period of 2017. CPC Blend, mostly made of Kazakh oil with some crude from Russia’s Caspian fields, is named after the CPC pipeline through which it flows to the Russian Black Sea terminal of Yuzhnaya Ozereyevka. The pipeline is co-owned by U.S. firm Chevron. The CPC pipeline capacity has been increased by 20 percent this year to 67 million tonnes, or 1.4 million bpd, which is expected to boost exports and make it cheaper. Russia and Kazakhstan are expected to increase output after a deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to ease production curbs that have been in place since January 2017. Asian traders say CPC Blend offers the same quality as Iranian light crude oil and condensate at a competitive price. “We have been snapping up purchases of CPC Blend, because of the good economics and quality. We may keep purchasing it if it is economically viable,” a spokesman at South Korean refiner GS Caltex told Reuters. CPC Blend is a light, sweet crude oil with about 0.5 percent sulphur content and 46.5 API degrees, specifications putting it at roughly the mid-point between Iranian condensate and Iranian light crude, making it a suitable replacement, traders said. The blend’s traditional market is Europe, where it is usually mixed with other grades, including Russia’s heavier Urals blend. But European refiners tend to limit intake of CPC Blend due to its high content of mercaptan, a pungent gas. South Korea’s more modern refineries do not have the same challenges processing mercaptan, market sources said. South Korea is the fourth biggest importer of CPC Blend so far in 2018, behind Italy, the Netherlands and France. Rising flows of CPC Blend have pushed prices down, as Europe has plenty of alternative options for supplies of light barrels from Azerbaijan, West Africa and the United States. CPC’s discount to dated Brent fell to $2.90 a barrel in May, it widest since 2012, helping drive sales to South Korea for June delivery, traders said. The discount has since narrowed.

2018-07-03,"(Repeats July 2 column; no changes to text) By John Kemp LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - The White House can drive Iran’s oil exports to zero, or it can have moderate U.S. gasoline prices, but it probably cannot have both. The awkward tension between the administration’s foreign policy priority (tough Iran sanctions) and its electoral calculation (to keep gasoline prices low) explains its increasingly frequent comments about oil prices. President Donald Trump has already blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for the sharp rise in prices that has pushed the average cost of U.S. gasoline close to $3 per gallon. “Looks like OPEC is at it again,” the president wrote in a message on Twitter on April 20. “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Under pressure from the United States, OPEC and its allies agreed on June 23 to boost production by an implied 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from the start of July. Saudi Arabia is expected to provide most of the increase, with smaller contributions from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Russia, though specific country allocations were not included in the accord. But the agreement failed to bring prices down and senior U.S. officials have since indicated they want an even larger increase to dampen the market. The president has now weighed in by pressing Saudi Arabia for a much bigger increase in oil production, with another message on Twitter on June 30: “Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference,” the president wrote. “Prices to high! He has agreed!” Saudi Arabia’s official news agency confirmed the telephone call though it made no mention about volumes of extra oil. According to the Saudi Press Agency: “The two leaders stressed the need to make efforts to maintain the stability of oil markets, the growth of the global economy, and the efforts of producing countries to compensate for any potential shortage of supplies.” The White House also softened its position on extra barrels. “The two leaders agreed that balancing the energy market is essential,” it said in an official statement. “In response to the President’s assessment of a deficit in the oil market, King Salman affirmed that the Kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day spare capacity, which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance and stability, and in coordination with its producer partners, to respond to any eventuality.” However, the president later made much more explicit the link between Iran sanctions and OPEC/Saudi Arabia’s production, in a television interview with Fox News on July 1. Asked whether OPEC was manipulating the oil market, the president replied affirmatively: “100 percent, OPEC is, and they better stop it, because we are protecting those countries, many of those countries.” “OPEC is manipulating, and you know they allowed (a production increase) less than we thought last week, they have to put out another 2 million barrels in my opinion, because we don’t want that happening.” “Don’t forget the one negative to the Iran deal is that you lose a lot of oil, and they got to make up for it. And who is their big enemy? Iran.” “Iran is their big enemy, so they are going to have to do it. And I have a very good relationship with the king and with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and with the others around and they are going to have to put out more oil.” In contrast to the Obama administration, which employed sanctions to reduce Iran’s oil exports gradually, the Trump administration has made clear it wants to see Iran’s oil exports fall to zero from November. In a media briefing on June 26, a senior State Department official repeatedly stated the administration wants U.S. allies as well as India and China to cut imports from Iran to zero and does not plan to issue waivers. So far in 2018, Iran has been exporting well over 2 million bpd of crude and condensates, according to the Joint Organizations Data Initiative. The problem is that the total amount of unused and available spare capacity held by OPEC members was just 3 million bpd at the end of May, International Energy Agency data shows. Most of the remaining spare capacity is in Saudi Arabia (2 million bpd) with smaller volumes in Iraq (330,000 bpd), the United Arab Emirates (330,000 bpd) and Kuwait (220,000 bpd). Other analysts put the level of spare capacity much lower. Russia also has the capacity to increase output by several hundred thousand barrels per day over the next six months, but unused capacity elsewhere is negligible. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Russia have already pledged to boost their combined output by 1 million bpd from July. If Iran’s exports are pushed close to zero from November, and Saudi Arabia and its allies step up production to fill the gap, remaining spare capacity will fall to 1 million bpd or less by the end of 2018. The volume of spare capacity has not fallen that low since 2004, and before that, the first U.S.-Iraq Gulf War in 1991. But if spare capacity is adjusted for increases in consumption, it will be at the lowest level since the oil shocks of 1973/74 and 1980/81. The oil market relies on a set of shock absorbers to help manage variations in production and consumption and ensure the smooth flow of oil from wellhead to consumer. In rough order of availability, these shock absorbers are: * Commercial inventories (including floating storage) * OPEC spare capacity * OECD strategic stocks * Short-cycle oil production (shale and development within existing oilfields) Most of these shock absorbers have become seriously depleted as a result of the recent tightening of the oil market. Commercial inventories have fallen below the average of the last five years and are much tighter if adjusted for the increase in consumption since 2013. If Iran’s exports are eliminated entirely, and Saudi Arabia and its allies step up their own production to compensate, the OPEC spare capacity shock absorber will also disappear. The market will then rely on strategic stocks and an increase in short-cycle oil production to meet any further disruptions of supply or unexpectedly fast growth in consumption. Stock releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and other IEA members could help ease future shortages and calm prices but only as a temporary measure. Inventory releases (a one-time adjustment in stock levels) cannot offset an ongoing disruption in production (a flow problem). In the medium term, the market would have to rely on an increase in short-cycle production to cover any remaining production-consumption gap. Short-cycle producers, especially U.S. shale firms, could raise their output but their response will be limited by the lack of available pipeline capacity. The oil market is already at a relatively late stage in the cycle, when prices tend to rise to stimulate faster production growth and moderate consumption growth. Other things being equal, prices are more likely to rise than fall over the next two years, assuming the global economic expansion remains on track. If the Trump administration takes a tough line on sanctions and attempts to push Iran’s oil exports close to zero, it will be removing a further 2 million bpd of production from a market that is already likely to be very tight. The most likely outcome is that prices will rise to cut consumption growth and rebuild the spare capacity and inventory shock absorbers to a more comfortable level. The almost inevitable consequence is a further increase in gasoline and diesel costs and/or a slowdown in the global economy to curb consumption growth – perhaps as a result of the oil price increase or rising trade tensions. Markets have fundamental constraints of their own quite distinct from politics. No matter how much it presses Saudi Arabia to boost oil supplies, the White House cannot escape this logic.

2018-07-03,"(Repeats July 2 column; no changes to text) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2KFCXa3 By John Kemp LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - Hedge funds became much more bullish about the outlook for U.S. crude prices last week, following an outage on Canada’s Syncrude system, which supplies the U.S. Midwest, and a drawdown in crude stocks around Cushing. But in the rest of the petroleum complex, the persistent liquidation of formerly record bullish positions continued for the tenth week running, according to an analysis of exchange and regulatory data. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 36 million barrels in the week to June 26. Net long positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI climbed by 75 million barrels, the largest one-week increase since OPEC decided to cut its production levels at the end of November 2016. Gross short positions in NYMEX WTI were slashed by 30 million barrels to leave just 20 million barrels remaining, the smallest number of short contracts since Feb 2013. The rush of short covering and the creation of fresh long positions sent nearby futures prices surging and has pushed the six-month WTI calendar spread to a backwardation of more than $6 per barrel. But bullish in WTI was linked to specific locational factors. Elsewhere, fund managers continued to realise profits and liquidate long positions (tmsnrt.rs/2KFCXa3). Net long positions were cut in Brent (-5 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-11 million barrels) and European gasoil (-15 million barrels) in the week to June 26. Net length in Brent has fallen by a total of 179 million barrels since peaking in early April while net length in refined products is down by 131 million barrels since peaking in mid-May. Portfolio managers remain essentially bullish about the outlook for oil prices in the second half of 2018, with long petroleum positions outnumbering short ones by a margin of 9 to 1. But funds have become more cautious since the middle of April, when the margin was almost 14 to 1, given the significant rise in prices over the last 12 months and potential for a slowdown in consumption growth.
