2018-09-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States is considering a request from Poland for a permanent U.S. military presence in the fellow NATO country, acknowledging that he shares Poland’s concerns about possible Russian aggression.  Polish President Andrzej Duda asked Trump for a permanent U.S. base during a White House meeting, offering to name it “Fort Trump,” and explaining it would be a bulwark against what he considers a threat from Russia. Trump said he agreed with Duda that Moscow had “acted aggressively” in the region and said the request for a base was under consideration. He said he appreciated Duda’s offer to put more than $2 billion into the project. “We’re looking at it very seriously, I know Poland likes the idea very much, and it’s something that we are considering, yes,” Trump told reporters. Moscow expressed concern in May over reports about Poland’s request, saying NATO’s expansion towards Russia’s borders undermined stability in Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, and since then other former communist states, including Baltic republics bordering Russia, have joined despite Moscow’s strong opposition. Poland has repeatedly requested a permanent U.S. military presence on its soil. The United States currently rotates troops through Poland temporarily but permanently stationing forces there would be expensive because of costs that can include housing for families, schools and hospitals. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the U.S. military was studying options with Poland but cautioned that no decisions had been made. “It’s not just about a base. It’s about training ranges, it’s about maintenance facilities at the base, all these kinds of things. There’s a host of details we’ve got to study alongside the Poles,” Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. Trump and Duda also expressed shared concerns about Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline which they said could make Europe overly reliant on Moscow for energy and expose it to the risks of what Duda called “political blackmail” with shipments. But Trump said the United States was not looking to sanction companies that participated in the project with Russia. “We just think it’s very unfortunate for the people of Germany that Germany is paying billions and billions of dollars a year for their energy to Russia,” he said. In a joint statement released later on Tuesday, after the press conference, Trump and Duda said they will continue coordinating efforts “to counter energy projects that threaten our mutual security, such as Nord Stream 2.” Trump also said the United States was considering a visa waiver programme for Poland.

2018-09-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump Administration on Tuesday rolled back an Obama-era rule on emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas operations on public lands in its latest step to ease regulations on the industry. The so-called Waste Prevention Rule was aimed at reducing leaks of natural gas, or methane, that occur through venting and flaring during oil and gas production on federal land.  David Bernhardt, the Interior Department’s deputy secretary,   said revisions to the rule reflect President Donald Trump’s policy avoiding “regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production, constrain growth and prevent job creation.”  Environmentalists slammed the rollback of the rule, which will not be implemented until after a 60-day comment period. “The Trump administration is relentless in its push to give the oil and gas industry multi-million-dollar handouts at the expense of Americans’ health and environment,” said David Doniger, the Natural Resource Defense Council’s senior strategic director for climate and clean energy.    Revisions to the Obama-era plan include changes to the percentage of methane that must be captured at drilling locations and measures on well completions and leak detections, the department said.  The Obama administration had said that venting of methane cost taxpayers over $330 million a year in lost revenue from natural gas. But industry complained that the Waste Prevention Rule would be costly on public lands, where 5 percent of U.S. oil and 9 percent of U.S. gas is produced, and that states with public lands already had their own regulations on the emissions. The rule was challenged in court by the industry and some states, including Wyoming.  The Interior Department said the Obama-era rule would have had a net cost of $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion over 10 years. The Trump administration’s revisions would save drillers about $734 million to $1 billion over 10 years, and lead to more royalty payments that benefit the public, the department said.   Methane is a major force in short-term global warming because it has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say. The oil and gas business is the largest single source of the emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Last week, Trump’s EPA proposed weakening requirements for testing and repairing methane leaks in drilling operations, the latest step toward rolling back Obama-era regulations to combat climate change. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the administration over delays in implementation of the Obama-era rules, said his state will do “everything in our power to hold them accountable to our people and planet.” Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Dan Grebler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-interior-methane/update-1-trump-administration-eases-rule-on-methane-leaks-on-public-land-idUKL2N1W41NU,18 Sep 2018,"The Trump Administration on

2018-09-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures rose more than 1 percent on Tuesday on signs that OPEC would not be prepared to raise output to address shrinking supplies from Iran, and as Saudi Arabia signaled an informal target near current levels. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 98 cents, or 1.3 percent,  to settle at $79.03 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained 94 cents to settle at $69.85 a barrel, a 1.4 percent increase. Prices pared gains in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.2 million barrels in the week to Sept. 14 to 397.1 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.7 million barrels. Official U.S. government data is due to be released on Wednesday. Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers meet on Sunday to discuss compliance with output policies. OPEC sources have told Reuters no immediate action was planned and producers would discuss how to share a previously agreed output increase. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed Saudi sources, that the kingdom was currently comfortable with prices above $80 per barrel, at least for the short term. Bloomberg reported that while Saudi Arabia had no desire to push prices higher than $80, it may no longer be possible to avoid it. U.S. sanctions affecting Iran’s petroleum sector are due to come into force from Nov. 4.  Reuters previously reported that Saudi Arabia wants oil to stay between $70 and $80 a barrel for now, as the world’s biggest crude exporter strikes a balance between maximizing revenue and keeping a lid on prices until U.S. congressional elections. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said an oil price between $70 and $80 was temporary and sanctions-driven, adding the long-term price would stand around $50 a barrel.  U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said last week in Moscow that he did not foresee any price spikes once sanctions came into effect, and was positive about Saudi output. Oil futures also drew support from geopolitical risk on Tuesday.  Russia’s Defense Ministry said a Russian military plane was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft systems, but accused Israel of indirectly causing the incident, saying Israeli jets nearby had put the Russian plane in the path of danger. Russia has told Israel it will take all necessary measures to protect its military personnel in Syria, the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said. The longer-term outlook remains weighed down, however, by an escalation in the China-U.S. trade war that has clouded the outlook for crude demand.  China, one of the world’s largest oil consumers, on Tuesday added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list. The move was in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. On Monday, the Trump administration said it would begin to levy new tariffs of 10 percent on about $200 billion of Chinese products next Monday, with the tariffs to go up to 25 percent by the end of 2018. The tariffs are likely to limit economic activity in both China and the United States. “The brinkmanship between Beijing and Washington has the potential to severely impact the competitiveness of U.S. crude oil and petroleum products in the Chinese market, and it will also deter Chinese investment in the U.S. energy sector,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London.

2018-09-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Tuesday as the latest tit-for-tat U.S.-Chinese trade dispute was seen as barely denting world growth, while U.S. Treasury yields rose in anticipation the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this year and next. China said it will levy tariffs on about $60 billion (45.6 billion pounds) worth of U.S. goods, as previously planned, but cut the level of tariffs it will collect. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese products will start next week and reach 25 percent by year-end.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.48 percent. Chinese shares initially slid as investors in Asia digested the details of China’s response but then rallied to push the blue-chip CSI index up 2 percent. China has limited retaliatory levers it can pull on the tariff front, said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Troy, Michigan.  Any escalation is likely to involve its currency or making it harder for U.S. companies to operate in China, but the immediate dent on the economic picture is likely to be small, he said.  “We anticipate this last round of tariffs, the $200 billion, it’s only probably going to add 0.2 percentage points to consumer prices. That’s nothing,” Saglimbene said. “The market is smart and it’s sniffing out through the end of the year the tariff impact is likely to be small on economic growth and it’s small on corporate profits,” he added. The United States took 300 consumer products off its original list of products to receive tariff hikes, which will blunt the impact on the consumer, Saglimbene said.      Dutch bank ING estimated that 2.5 percent of world trade was now affected by the tariffs and it will be 4 percent if Trump carries out threats to put levies on all Chinese imports.   In Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares closed up 0.15 percent. Wall Street rallied.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 184.84 points, or 0.71 percent, to 26,246.96. The S&P 500 gained 15.51 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,904.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 60.32 points, or 0.76 percent, to 7,956.11. MSCI’s 24-country emerging market index was up for the fourth day in the last five. Despite all the noise, the widely tracked dollar currency index rose 0.14 percent, with the euro slid 0.16 percent to $1.1664.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.43 percent versus the greenback at 112.31 per dollar. U.S. benchmark 10-year and 30-year yields both climbed to fresh four-month peaks as investors continued to price in more interest rate increases by the Fed this year and next. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 13/32 in price to lift its yield to 3.0514 percent. In Europe, Italian government bond yields fell sharply on growing optimism that Italy’s new coalition budget will respect European Union rules on fiscal discipline. Two- and five-year yields fell as much as 15 basis points to their lowest levels since July, while yields on short-dated top-rated German debt rose to four-month highs. Oil rose almost $1 a barrel on signs the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would not be prepared to raise output to address shrinking supplies from Iran, and as Saudi Arabia signalled it was in no rush to bring prices down. U.S. crude rose 94 cents to settle at $69.85 per barrel and Brent settled up 98 cents at $79.03 per barrel. U.S. gold futures $2.90 to settle at $1,202.90 an ounce.

2018-09-18,"Sept 18 (Reuters) - As the trade war between Beijing and Washington escalates, fewer vessels carrying U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) have been going to China. China, which purchased about 15 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped in 2017, has taken delivery from just four vessels since June versus 17 during the first five months of the year. Prior to the slowdown, China was on track to import 141.6 billion cubic feet (bcf) of U.S. LNG in 2018, up from 103.4 bcf in 2017 and 17.2 bcf in 2016. It imported no LNG from the United States in 2015. At its current pace, however, China is now on track to purchase less than 100 bcf of U.S. LNG in 2018 - less than last year. The United States, meanwhile, is on track to export over 1,000 bcf of gas as LNG in 2018. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. In addition to the trade war, LNG traders noted the slowdown was also partially due to seasonal weather factors. China uses more gas during winter months for heating than during the summer for cooling.

2018-09-18,"* Chinese tariff set at 10 pct, lower than expected * Trump pushing to make U.S. a global energy leader * China was world’s second-biggest LNG importer last year (Adds comments by LNG trade executives, adds graphic, updates share prices) By Scott DiSavino and Sabina Zawadzki NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - China set a 10 percent tariff on U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, extending a trade dispute into energy and casting a shadow over U.S. export terminals that would propel the United States into the world’s second-largest LNG seller. Beijing on Tuesday said it would tax U.S. products worth $60 billion effective Sept. 24 in retaliation for tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in an escalating trade war. The rate was smaller than the 25 percent tariff China had touted earlier, which offered some relief and helped shares in listed U.S. LNG companies climb. The tariffs undermine Trump’s drive to use U.S. shale oil and natural gas to turn the United States into a global energy leader. The U.S. is on track to export over 1,000 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas as LNG in 2018. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. But China, which purchased about 15 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped in 2017, is now on track to buy less than 100 bcf of U.S. LNG in 2018, less than last year, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking and U.S. Department of Energy data. The country has taken delivery from just four vessels since June versus 17 during the first five months of the year. [For a graphic on U.S. LNG deliveries to China, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2n9bQKn] Proposed U.S. export terminals, many expected to supply Chinese customers, were expected to account for 60 percent of all new LNG production coming to market by 2023, according to industry data. LNG, which involves super-cooling natural gas so it can be transported by ship rather than pipeline, has become one of the fastest growing commodity trades as nations seek cleaner fuels. The tariff’s extension to an energy commodity much in demand in China was a worrisome sign for trade relations and for billions of dollars in proposed U.S. terminals, said trade group executives. Including LNG “is a good indicator of how serious things have gotten between the U.S. and China on this trade issue,” said Charlie Riedl, executive director of Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a group whose members include Cheniere Energy, Chevron and Exxon Mobil. “While we would like to see this resolved quickly, I don’t see that happening right now,” said Riedl, speaking by phone from a natural gas conference in Spain. The longer the dispute lasts, the less likely proposed projects will find financial backers, he said. Analysts say the tariffs will particularly hit plans by U.S. companies, such as Cheniere Energy, Sempra and Kinder Morgan, to build new terminals or expand existing ones by adding processing units. “Some commercial agreements may be on hold until there is more visibility,” said Stacey Morris, director of energy research at Alerian Indexes. Cheniere, Kinder Morgan and Dominion Energy declined to comment. But the smaller-than-expected Chinese tariff helped lift Cheniere Energy, whose shares on Tuesday were up 2.9 percent, and Golar LNG, whose stock rose 2 percent. China imported 1.6 million tonnes, or 11 percent, of the 14.9 million tonnes of LNG exported from the United States so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. That accounted for 5 percent of total Chinese LNG imports. The U.S. has been looking to Europe to take on more of its natural gas as the China dispute continues. Germany said on Tuesday the country would decide by year-end where to locate a new LNG receiving terminal as a gesture to the Trump administration.

2018-09-18,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela has sold 9.9 percent of shares in oil joint venture Sinovensa to a Chinese oil company, President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday, adding the OPEC nation expected some $5 billion in joint investment with China to boost its crude output. He did not say how much Venezuela received or which company bought the shares in Sinovensa, which is partly owned by state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). China will own 49 percent in Sinovensa after the sale, he said. Maduro traveled to China, his key foreign financier, last week in search of fresh funds for his cash-starved government, which is presiding over a grueling economic depression. But it remains unclear whether he secured any new credit lines. Maduro said the Sinovensa sale formed part of plan to invest $5 billion over the next year in Chinese projects to double oil production and be able to send a million barrels per day to China. Venezuela’s oil production is at a 60-year low after years of little investment and crumbling infrastructure. Speaking at a news conference, Maduro complained about media coverage that has portrayed the four-day trip as unsuccessful. “They are all going to say the same: Maduro went to China and found nothing, they mistreated him,” he said. Instead, he said, they had sealed a “very important deal.” Over a decade, China invested over $50 billion in Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements, securing energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-U.S. ally in Latin America. The flow of cash halted nearly three years ago, however, when Venezuela requested a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse. Asked by reporters on Tuesday whether Maduro had asked for a new grace period to meets its debt obligations with China, he said “Venezuela pays on time.” Maduro on Tuesday said he could count on China as an ally to survive an “economic war” he accuses the United States of waging against Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has levied several rounds of sanctions on Maduro’s government.

2018-09-18,"Sept 18 (Reuters) - The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) should postpone this week’s decision on whether to reinstate Russia’s anti-doping agency (RUSADA), anti-doping leaders said on Tuesday. National anti-doping bodies from around the world, including ones from the United States, Britain and Australia, said in a joint statement that WADA should not reinstate RUSADA until Russia can prove it has fulfilled the WADA roadmap to code compliance. WADA’s executive committee is set to meet on Thursday to review RUSADA’s efforts towards reinstatement. RUSADA was suspended in November 2015 over a WADA report outlining evidence of state-backed, systematic doping in Russian athletics. It has since undertaken broad reforms in a bid to revamp Russia’s anti-doping system and restore international trust in the country’s sport. According to the WADA roadmap, for the agency to regain accreditation, Russian authorities must acknowledge the findings of a WADA-commissioned report that found more than 1,000 Russian athletes benefited from a state-run scheme to conceal positive tests over a five-year period. Russia has vehemently denied those allegations. The authorities must also provide access to urine samples stored at the suspended Moscow anti-doping laboratory. WADA said last week that its compliance review committee had reviewed a letter from the Russian sports ministry it said had “sufficiently acknowledged the issues identified in Russia,” thus fulfilling the first of two remaining criteria for its reinstatement. But the group of anti-doping leaders, which also includes Austria, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Poland, said it was dismayed by what it called a compromise by WADA’s compliance review committee. “We cannot understand or accept that the simple fact that the two remaining conditions — regarding Russian acceptance of the McLaren Report and access for WADA to the Moscow laboratory — remain unfulfilled, and yet WADA’s leading compliance body is recommending the reinstatement of a country that perpetrated the worst doping system ever seen in international sport,” the anti-doping bodies said in a statement. The statement added: “We, the international anti-doping leaders wish to place on record that the goal posts have been moved. The Roadmap has changed. “This is quite simply unacceptable and will not restore confidence in global sport at a time when athletes and sports fans need it most.” The group also said WADA should postpone any decision until Russia has “clearly and publicly” met the outstanding conditions of the roadmap to code compliance and until it is in possession of the data from the Moscow lab. “Now is not the time for WADA to U-Turn on its Roadmap,” the group said. “It is not the time for WADA to turn its back on the majority: the clean athletes and sports fans.” (Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto Editing by Toby Davis)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/sport-doping-wada/doping-wada-should-postpone-ruling-on-rusada-say-anti-doping-leaders-idUKL8N1W46DV,18 Sep 2018,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) should postpone this week's decision on whether to reinstate Russia's anti-doping agency (RUSADA), anti-doping leaders said on Tuesday.","Doping-WADA should postpone ruling on RUSADA, say anti-doping leaders"
2018-09-18,"Sept 18 (Reuters) - Oil production in the biggest U.S. shale field will rise next month at the lowest level since late 2016 as transport limits erode gains, U.S. government data this week showed. Operators will pump an additional 31,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, bringing its output to 3.46 million bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, the number of drilled-but-uncompleted wells in the Permian will rise by 211 to 3,630, the largest monthly increase since the EIA began tracking the data in September 2016. Uncompleted wells are those not connected to a pipeline. Slower production growth helped firm prices of West Texas Intermediate at Midland WTC-WTM on Tuesday, trading as strong as a $10.50 per barrel discount to U.S. crude futures, the highest since Aug. 10. Transport constraints will continue to overshadow the Permian’s crude production growth, keeping Midland grades at a steep discount to WTI, traders said. WTI Midland hit a six-year low last month. The differential recently contracted ahead of a deadline for shippers to nominate pipeline volumes, accelerating crude purchases. “With differentials being so wide, they’d have to take off a lot of production” to affect Midland spot prices, a trader said. “Really it comes down to the pipelines.” (Reporting by Collin Eaton; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-crude-permian/top-u-s-shale-fields-output-to-rise-at-slowest-pace-since-late-2016-idUKL2N1W41C2,18 Sep 2018,"Oil production in the biggest U.S. shale

2018-09-18,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A resident of a Massachusetts city rocked by last week’s deadly gas blasts that damaged dozens of homes sued utility operator NiSource Inc on Tuesday, accusing it of inadequately maintaining its distribution system. The proposed class action lawsuit targets NiSource and its subsidiary Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which services Andover, North Andover and Lawrence, three communities northwest of Boston that staged large-scale evacuations following the Thursday afternoon blasts that killed one person and injured at least 25. The lawsuit in Essex County Superior Court is the first to be filed after Thursday’s explosions. It claims the gas pipeline system used by Columbia Gas to service those communities was “poorly maintained, antiquated, obsolete, and highly dangerous.” Merrillville, Indiana-based NiSource did not respond to a request for comment. It has set up set up a phone centre and an office to accept residents’ claims for property damage and costs related to the fires and evacuation. The lawsuit said the company failed to implement reasonable safety and leak prevention practices and failed to replace obsolete high-risk materials in the system, which used pipelines constructed of cast and wrought iron rather than plastic. The complaint, filed by Lawrence resident Francely Acosta, who was forced to evacuate, accused NiSource of negligence and creating a public nuisance by failing to maintain gas pressure in its “antiquated” system, which it blamed for Thursday’s explosions. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of residents affected by the incident and an order requiring NiSource to stop operating its system in an unsafe manner. The blasts on Thursday destroyed as many as 80 houses in the largest natural gas pipeline accident in the United States since 2010. Some 8,000 people were displaced amid evacuations of entire neighbourhoods as firefighters raced for hours from one blaze to another and utility crews rushed to shut off gas and electricity.  The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, which Columbia Gas has said affected 8,600 of its customers. NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt on Sunday said over-pressurisation of the gas distribution system was to blame and that the agency was looking at pressure sensors attached to a line that was taken out of service before the explosions. In a letter to NiSource on Monday, U.S. Senators Edward Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats of Massachusetts, said the pressure in the pipeline system had been 12 times greater than it was intended to hold.

2018-09-18,"WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - The Trump Administration is slated on Tuesday to roll back an Obama-era rule on emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas operations on public lands in its latest step to ease energy industry regulations, environmental groups said. The Interior Department did not have an immediate comment on the rule but said it would have a press call at 4 p.m. EDT regarding final changes revising the venting and flaring rule. The rule is aimed at reducing leaks of natural gas, or methane, that occur through venting and flaring during oil and gas production on federal land. The Obama administration said that venting of methane cost taxpayers over $330 million a year in lost revenues from natural gas. The department in February proposed replacing the so-called Waste Prevention Rule by returning to standards that date back to the 1970s. President Donald Trump had issued an executive order in 2017 directing the department to review the rule that was published late in former President Barack Obama’s second term. The rule has been challenged in court by industry and some states, including Wyoming. Last week, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency proposed weakening requirements for testing and repairing methane leaks in drilling operations, the latest step toward rolling back Obama-era regulations to combat climate change. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, and the oil and gas business is the largest single source of the emissions, according to the EPA. Environmentalists slammed the rollback of the Waste Prevention Rule. “The Trump administration is relentless in its push to give the oil and gas industry multi-million-dollar handouts at the expense of Americans’ health and environment,” said David Doniger, the Natural Resource Defense Council’s senior strategic director of its climate and clean energy program.

2018-09-18,"* German minister says three cities vying for LNG plant * EU says it will import more U.S. LNG, soybeans * Trump says Germany “captive” to Russia over gas (Adds quote from EU energy chief) By Alissa de Carbonnel BRUSSELS, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Germany will chose where to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal by the end of 2018 as a gesture to the United States which wants to ship more gas to Europe, the economy minister said on Tuesday. In a bid to deter U.S. President Donald Trump from imposing hefty new trade tariffs on European Union goods, the EU said in July it would work to increase imports of U.S. soybeans and LNG. Trump wants U.S. LNG to compete with Russian natural gas exports in Europe. He has accused Germany of being a “captive” to Moscow because of its heavy reliance on Russian gas and has called for Berlin to drop support for the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline plan to pump more gas from Russia to Germany. “This is a gesture to our American friends,” Peter Altmaier said of plans to decide on a site for the LNG terminal. “We have three competing cities and we will take a decision before the end of the year,” he said after meeting Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice president and EU energy chief. But Altmaier said the LNG plan was not related to Germany’s support for Nord Stream 2, which he told reporters was “a project that has a long life already and much money has been invested.” At talks in Brussels, Altmaier and Sefcovic discussed the future of gas transit via Ukraine, the traditional route for Russian gas supplies that make up more than a third of EU needs. Critics of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline say it will deprive Ukraine of lucrative gas transit fees and increase dominance of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom. Altmaier repeated Germany’s request for Moscow to continue to send “substantial” supplies via Ukraine after their contract expires in 2019 but did not put a figure on volumes. Sefcovic said volumes had to be substantial enough to pay for maintenance of Ukraine’s gas pipeline infrastructure. He also said the United States had to do more to make its gas exports competitive on European markets. German firms are considering building an LNG terminal as gas demand rises in Europe and the Netherlands, one of Germany’s crucial suppliers which is winding down its giant Groningen field and plans to close it in 2030. German utility Uniper said on Monday it was ready to import LNG and distribute it should a terminal be built at Wilhelmshaven, close to its storage facilities.

China said it will levy tariffs on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, as previously planned, but cut the level of tariffs it will collect. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump said 10-percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese products will take effect on Sept. 24, reaching 25 percent by year-end. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.43 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.02 percent. Wall Street was higher. China has limited retaliatory levers it can pull on the tariff front, said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Troy, Michigan. “The dent on the economic picture is likely to be small. We anticipate this last round of tariffs, the $200 billion, it’s only probably going to add 0.2 percentage points to consumer prices. That’s nothing,” he said. The United States took 300 consumer products off its original list of products to receive tariff hikes, which will blunt the impact on the consumer, Saglimbene said. Dutch bank ING estimated that 2.5 percent of world trade was now affected by the tariffs and it will be 4 percent if Trump carries out threats to put levies on all Chinese imports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80.49 points, or 0.31 percent, to 26,142.61. The S&P 500 gained 13.49 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,902.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.75 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,962.55. Overnight in Japan, the Nikkei in Tokyo ended 1.4 percent higher and MSCI’s 24-country emerging market index was up for the fourth day in the last five. Despite all the noise, the widely-tracked dollar currency index rose 0.03 percent, with the euro was up 0.06 percent to $1.169. The Japanese yen weakened 0.45 percent versus the greenback at 112.37 per dollar. U.S. benchmark 10-year and 30-year yields both climbed to fresh four-month peaks as investors continued to price in more interest rate increases by the Fed this year and next. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 8/32 in price to lift its yield to 3.031 percent. In Europe, Italian government bond yields fell sharply on growing optimism that Italy’s new coalition budget will respect European Union rules on fiscal discipline. Two- and five-year yields fell as much as 15 basis points to their lowest levels since July, while yields on short-dated top-rated German debt rose to four-month highs. Oil rose more than $1 a barrel on signs the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would not be prepared to raise output to address shrinking supplies from Iran, and as Saudi Arabia signalled it was in no rush to bring prices down. U.S. crude rose 84 cents to $69.75 per barrel and Brent was last up 83 cents at $78.88 per barrel. Reporting by Herbert Lash

2018-09-18,"(Reuters) - Carbon credits could be used to cut the high costs involved with setting up charging stations for electric vehicles, an industry lobby said on Tuesday. A carbon credit represents a reduction of one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions and would be available for sale in the United States in 2019, the Electric Vehicle Charging Carbon Coalition (EVCCC) said. A shortage of adequate charging infrastructure, which requires huge investments with no immediate returns, has been affecting the production and sale of electric vehicles. “One of the original motivations for this project was to compensate for the higher costs of deploying and operating EV charging infrastructure,” said Sue Hall, chief executive officer of Climate Neutral Business Network, which has developed a method to trade on carbon credits, along with the EVCCC. The carbon credits can be sold by entities investing in installation of electric vehicle chargers to firms or companies looking to go carbon neutral, and could generate a 5-10 percent return on capital over 10 years, the EVCCC said. Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) unit Electrify America, electric vehicle charging station provider EVgo, electric power generation company Exelon Corp and German engineering giant Siemens AG are some of the members of the EVCCC.

2018-09-18,"Sept 18 (Reuters) - China has set a 10 percent tariff on imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas just as trade of the super-chilled fuel between the two nations started to ramp up and exports from new terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast are poised to begin. Beijing announced on Tuesday it would tax thousands of U.S. products worth $60 billion in retaliation for tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump as the trade war between them escalated. China became the world’s second-largest importer of LNG last year, behind Japan and ahead of South Korea, driven by a push to convert to cleaner gas from coal generation energy. At the same time, the United States is poised to become a major exporter with the majority of LNG supply growth in coming years from new terminals being planned or built now. China imported 1.6 million tonnes of the 14.9 million tonnes of LNG that has been exported from the United States so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts and traders have said that although China is a huge buyer of LNG especially in the run-up to and during winter, it should easily find supplies from other large exporters such as Qatar and Australia. State-owned Qatargas said this month it had signed a 22-year deal to supply a unit of PetroChina with 3.4 million tonnes a year. For U.S. companies developing LNG export terminals such as Cheniere Energy, Sempra and Kinder Morgan , the tariff casts doubt over their projects’ final investment decisions (FIDs), which trigger construction of facilities. “It’s a problem for Cheniere as it makes their LNG uncompetitive in China,” Noel Tomnay, vice president for gas and LNG consulting at Wood Mackenzie, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry event in Barcelona, Spain. “But the biggest problem is for all those U.S. LNG projects trying to get FID. China would be the biggest market for all of them. While these tariffs last, it’s unlikely they can take off. That’s a potential opportunity for non-U.S. projects (e.g. Canada) to go ahead.” Four new U.S. terminals and one extension will come onstream in stages over the next two years. Once they run at capacity, they will constitute 60 percent of all new supplies expected to be added to the global market by 2023. Aside from that, there are dozens of new trains, or facilities, planned at existing or new terminals, which all need FIDs before they progress.

2018-09-18,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will levy tariffs on about $60 billion (45.60 billion pounds) worth of U.S. goods in retaliation for the latest round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese products, as previously planned, but has reduced the level of tariffs that it will collect on the products. The tit-for-tat measures are the latest escalation in an increasingly protracted trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.  On Monday, the U.S. administration said it will begin to levy new tariffs of 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese products on Sept. 24, with the tariffs to go up to 25 percent by the end of 2018.  Previously, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hit those goods with 25 percent tariffs immediately.  “China is forced to respond to U.S. unilateralism and trade protectionism, and has no choice but to respond with its own tariffs,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement on its website late on Tuesday. China will levy tariffs on a total of 5,207 U.S. products, at 5 and 10 percent, instead of the previously proposed rates of 5, 10, 20 and 25 percent, even as the products remain unchanged from the previous plan, the finance ministry said.  China will impose a 10 percent tariff on U.S. products it previously designated for a rate of 20 and 25 percent, and 5 percent tariffs on goods previously under the 5 and 10 percent rates.  Items previously designated to be hit by 20 or 25 percent tariffs included products ranging from liquefied natural gas and mineral ores to coffee and various types of edible oil. Those goods will now be taxed 10 percent.  Goods previously marked under the 10 percent category included products such as frozen vegetables, cocoa powder and chemical products. Those products will now be taxed 5 percent.  The new tariff measures will take effect at 12:01 p.m. (0401 GMT) on Sept. 24.   China will further respond accordingly if the United States insists on increasing tariffs, according to the Finance Ministry.

2018-09-18,"SARAJEVO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Shareholders of Bosnian power utility EPBiH gave the go ahead on Tuesday for construction of a China-backed coal-fired unit, which will be the largest postwar energy project in the Balkan state. The Balkans are increasingly turning to China for funding as the European Union, World Bank and other institutions cut back on financing coal-based projects. China Gezhouba Group and Guandong Electric Power Design will build the 450 megawatt (MW) unit in the city of Tuzla at a cost of 1.8 billion Bosnian marka ($1.1 bln), to replace three outdated units at the 715 MW plant. EPBiH said its shareholders approved on Tuesday a set of decisions aimed at expediting construction of the unit. The project will be financed via a 1.2 billion marka loan from the state-funded Export Import Bank of China while the remainder will be provided by EPBiH. The Chinese loan will be repaid over 20 years, including a five-year grace period. The project is expected to be completed within 56 months, the shareholders’ assembly said. The new unit will generate 2,740 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity and around 390 GWh of thermal energy a year and will increase EPBiH’s power generating capacity by 26.7 percent. Chinese firms are implementing projects in the Balkans, mainly in the energy sector, and worth around 3.8 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in Bosnia alone. Environmentalists object to the coal projects planned with China, saying they do not meet EU rules and could add to already high levels of air pollution, while also exposing cash-strapped Bosnia to costly plant upgrades once it joins the EU. EPBiH shareholders, however, said the new unit at Tuzla will reduce greenhouse gas emissions there by up to 20 times compared to emissions from ageing units. Bosnia obtains 40 percent of its electricity from hydropower, while the rest comes from coal-fired power plants.

2018-09-18,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union energy ministers agreed on Tuesday to pool efforts to increase the use of hydrogen in transport and power as part of the bloc’s attempt to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030. The non-binding initiative, seen by Reuters and endorsed by 25 EU nations, calls for governments to increase cooperation on research into the potential for hydrogen use in energy storage, transport, power and heating. “The acceleration of early implementation and wider application of sustainable hydrogen technology is able to contribute to the economic competitiveness of the Energy Union,” the document said. Agreed by energy ministers at an informal meeting in Linz, Austria, the document highlights the need for renewable energy, such as hydrogen, to reduce dependence on fossil fuels for which Europe is reliant on imports from Russia. Technologies fuelled by hydrogen, one of the world’s most abundant elements, have long held promise but uptake has been slow. Germany on Monday began running the world’s first passenger trains powered by hydrogen fuel cells, replacing two diesel-fired trains on a line of nearly 100 km (62 miles) between Cuxhaven and Buxtehude in Lower Saxony. Germany is leading efforts in the EU to explore ways to use and store renewable energy at a number of power-to-hydrogen and power-to-gas sites as a boom in wind and solar power in the country has led to excess production. Running renewable power through water to split it into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis produces green hydrogen that can be used in transport or gas grids, which can absorb 10 percent hydrogen as a complementary fuel to natural gas. Carmakers such as Toyota (7203.T) have touted the benefits of hydrogen vehicles, which take less time to refuel than the recharging of battery electric cars, but are expensive and suffer from a lack of refuelling stations. So far the technology has mostly been used in buses and long-haul trucks.

Not world stock markets, it seems. The response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to go ahead next week with collecting 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, ratcheting up to 25 percent in January, was unusual and unexpected on Tuesday. Trump’s measures initially hit U.S. stocks, Treasuries and the dollar while stirring a rally in Chinese equities and the yuan. China then retaliated just before U.S. markets were due to open with $60 billion worth of tariffs of its own but still traders barely flinched. European stocks wobbled slightly but Wall Street futures still pointed to a steady start and even copper and the Aussie dollar, which have been highly sensitive to the trade tensions, made good ground. “In a way it is remarkable that the market is holding up so well,” said Rabobank’s Head of Macro Strategy Elwin de Groot. “This is clearly a further ratcheting up of the trade war and we are now getting close to a situation where you can almost speak of a full-fledged trade war. Clearly that is not positive.” One theory for the becalmed reaction was that the $200 billion U.S. move had been largely priced in to markets following weeks of hinting reports and social media speculation. Chinese shares had initially dipped as Asia digested the details but then rallied to close up 2 percent as some locals bet on Beijing stepping up infrastructure investment to keep the economy humming. Japan’s Nikkei also ended 1.4 percent higher and MSCI’s 24-country emerging market index was up for the fourth day in the last five as 1.3 percent gains in Poland and Russia added to Asia’s rebound. Trump’s announcement “is largely consistent with the claims made earlier,” Citi analysts said in a note, estimating a 33 basis point drag on China’s economic growth from the 10 percent tariff. Taking a bigger picture view, Dutch bank ING estimated that 2.5 percent of world trade was now affected by the tariffs and it will be 4 percent if Trump carries out threats to put levies on all of the U.S.’s Chinese imports. “Although this percentage may seem small, the tariffs will disrupt Sino-American supply chains, and may, therefore, triple the effects on world trade,” ING also warned. U.S. stock exchange futures were all around 0.2 percent higher, with a rise in oil prices expected to lift oil majors and on relief that the tariffs on Chinese goods had spared high-tech gadgets like smart watches. China’s promise to respond to the moves also came as The South China Morning Post newspaper reported that Beijing was reviewing plans to send a delegation headed by Vice Premier Liu He to Washington for trade talks. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing later that the U.S. steps had brought “new uncertainty” to talks between the two countries. “China has always emphasised that the only correct way to resolve the China-U.S. trade issue is via talks and consultations held on an equal, sincere and mutually respectful basis. But at this time, everything the United States does does not give the impression of sincerity or goodwill,” he added. Not to be outdone, Trump later tweeted “There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!” Despite all the noise, the widely-tracked dollar currency index was broadly flat at 94.438 although on an individual basis it rose against the Japanese yen to just over 112.20 and took 1.7 percent off Turkey’s troubled lira. At the same time it was down slightly against the Chinese yuan in ‘offshore’ markets. The sensitive Australian dollar also moved up 0.3 percent to $0.72 having also initially been hit when the tariff details broke. With FX participants wary that Beijing authorities may quickly step in to markets at any point, investors were “spontaneously” liquidating their short yuan positions said a trader at one Chinese bank. “China is likely to reject the invitation from the U.S. Treasury for the new round of trade talk,” OCBC Bank also said in a note on Tuesday. Oil prices had been down in Asia and through most of the European morning session but then went on a tear as fresh signs emerged that OPEC doesn’t plan to raise output to offset shrinking supplies from Iran. International benchmark Brent futures jumped over a dollar to $79.21 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures bounced up to just shy of $70 a barrel. Copper prices surged 2 percent too and gold had also clawed itself into positive territory at $1,200 having been struggling for most of the day.

2018-09-18,"OSLO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Sweden’s largest utility Vattenfall said on Tuesday it was struggling to find enough skilled staff to fill engineering and technical positions at power plants across Sweden. Vattenfall, which employs around 20,000 people, is growing its operations while facing a wave of retirements, and needs to recruit some 1,000 employees to operate nuclear plants and other facilities. “It’s hard to find... This in a time when there is a major shortage of skilled labour in a competitive market. For this reason, starting today, Vattenfall is carrying out a new recruitment campaign,” the company said in a statement.

2018-09-18,"* No plan to start new coal-fired power plant projects * Aims to double renewable energy generation ratio by 2023 * Other trading houses also boosting renewable energy deals (Adds details and other trading houses’ move) By Osamu Tsukimori and Yuka Obayashi TOKYO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Japan’s Marubeni Corp said it would no longer start new coal-fired power plant projects and will halve its net coal power generating capacity of about 3 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 to cut greenhouse gas emissions and tackle global climate change. “As a general principle, Marubeni will no longer enter into any new coal-fired power generation business,” the trading house said in a statement announcing its new business policies on coal-fired power and renewable energy. The decision comes as a growing number of companies and pension funds across the world are divesting assets or companies that generate revenues from fossil fuels, especially coal. The new goal will be achieved by selling or transferring some of its coal-fired power assets and not renewing contracts at a time of expiry, a Marubeni spokeswoman said. But it added that it might consider pursuing coal-fired power projects that adopt the best available technology and are compliant with government policies, leaving leeway for new deals. Marubeni, which has a total of net power generating capacity of about 12 GW worldwide — the biggest among Japanese trading houses — aims to raise the ratio of power generated by renewable energy in its power supply capacity to 20 percent by 2023 from about 10 percent now. Other trading houses are also shifting their focus toward renewable energy in power generation projects. Mitsui & Co plans to boost the renewable power ratio in its 9.3 GW power generating capacity to 30 percent by 2030 from 16 percent now, while Sumitomo Corp is also lifting the renewable portion to 30 percent by 2035 from 20 now and slashing the coal-fired power ratio to 30 percent from 50. Mitsubishi Corp aims to double the ratio of renewable power in its electricity generation output to 20 percent by 2030 from 10 percent now. Japan has come under fierce criticism from environmentalists and more subtle pressure from allies as it is one of the few industrialised countries to heavily promote coal power both at home and abroad, including advanced technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Given that pressure, companies and financial institutions in Japan have been slowly changing their coal policies over the past year, with some trading houses offloading thermal coal mining assets, and banks and insurers stopping financing coal-fired power projects.

The Colombo stock index ended 0.95 percent weaker at 5,971.21, its lowest close since March 15, 2016. It lost 1.4 percent last week, its first weekly drop in four. Earlier in the session, the Sri Lankan rupee fell 0.5 percent and hit an all-time low of 166.00 per dollar, dented by higher dollar demand from importers amid reluctant greenback sales by exporters, market sources said. The sliding rupee and political uncertainty weighed on sentiment, said Preshan Fernando, CEO, Acuity Stockbrokers. “Foreign selling in Keells dragged the market,” he said. Conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc ended 2 percent down at 131.90 rupees after hitting a 30-month low earlier in the trade. Foreigners sold a net 2.1 million shares in Keells, data from the bourse showed. Turnover was 881.2 million rupees ($5.32 million) on Tuesday, more than this year’s daily average of 797.5 million rupees. Foreign investors sold a net 200.7 million rupees worth of shares extending the year-to-date net foreign outflow to 4.8 billion rupees worth of equities. Analysts said the fuel price hike also hurt investor confidence as it could hit corporate earnings.

2018-09-18,"(Adds dettails, quotes) By Vladimir Soldatkin GORKY, Russia, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday that current high oil prices of between $70 and $80 per barrel were  temporary and were mainly driven by sanctions, adding that the long-term price would stand at around $50 per barrel. Speaking at a meeting of government officials and the heads of domestic oil majors, convened to discuss ways of propping up domestic oil production, he said the $50 per barrel forecast was based on estimates by analysts and oil companies. “The current situation, related to the price rise to $70-$80 (per barrel), is mainly... connected to the premium in the price linked to the possible risks of sanctions and lower supply,” Novak said. He didn’t specify which sanctions he was referring to but oil traders are concerned about the potential impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran and the effect on the availability of crude at the end of the year. Novak said last week that global oil markets remained “fragile” due to geopolitics and production declines in several regions and that Russia was ready to crank up oil output. Russia has been producing oil at the pace of around 11.21 million barrels per day, near a post-Soviet record high, but Novak warned that the output could sharply fall in a few years if the government fails to introduce measures to spur it. Novak also said he expected Russia’s oil production in 2018 to total 553 million tonnes (11.105 million barrels per day), up from around 547 million tonnes in 2017, and that production would peak at 570 million tonnes in 2021. On Tuesday, he outlined several measures aimed at encouraging a boost in oil production, which is declining in West Siberia, the country’s main oil producing region. The measures include introducing benefits for exploration, greenfields developing, increasing production rates, as well as profit-based tax for all oilfields in West Siberia. The proposals are yet to be approved by the government and the parliament. Writing by Vladimir Soldatkin and Tom Balmforth; editing by

2018-09-18,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are investigating whether BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) colluded to restrict the rollout of clean emission technology, a move that could lead to hefty fines for the German carmakers. The European Commission opened an in-depth investigation on Tuesday, nearly a year after it raided the companies and two years after it slapped a record 2.93 billion euro ($3.4 billion)fine on a group of truckmakers including Daimler for fixing prices and delaying the adoption of cleaner engine technology. The EU executive said the “circle of five” - BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen Group’s VW, Audi and Porsche - held meetings where they may have colluded to limit the development and roll-out of certain emissions control systems for cars sold in Europe. “These technologies aim at making passenger cars less damaging to the environment. If proven, this collusion may have denied consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars, despite the technology being available to the manufacturers,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. The Commission said the technologies involved were selective catalytic reduction systems, which reduce nitrogen oxides from diesel car emissions, and “Otto” particulate filters that reduce particulate matter emissions from petrol cars. The EU antitrust enforcer said the carmakers had also discussed other technical issues, such as common requirements for car parts and testing procedures, but it did not have sufficient indications that these meetings were anti-competitive. It also said there were no signs that the companies illegally coordinated with each other in the use of so-called defeat devices to cheat regulatory testing. Volkswagen admitted to using such illegal software in 2015, sparking a scandal that has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines. Volkswagen and Daimler, which has claimed whistleblower status to avoid any fines, said they were cooperating with the Commission. BMW said it would continue to support the EU authority. Campaign group Transport & Environment said it was time for regulators to take action. “The automotive industry was once a jewel in Europe’s industrial crown, but its global reputation is now deeply tarnished and cannot be trusted anymore,” said Greg Archer, a director at the group.  “It has become its own worst enemy and needs regulators to act with strength and decisiveness to clean it up and establish rules that put it on a path to zero emissions.” Companies can face fines up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU rules. The car industry has in recent years faced billion euro fines worldwide for fixing prices of various auto parts.

2018-09-18,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Power has gone off in western and southern Libya including the capital Tripoli after renewed fighting between rival groups knocked out most power stations, the state electricity firm said. New fighting between armed groups erupted on Monday, ending a shaky truce brokered by the United Nations two weeks ago after more than 60 people had been killed in clashes since the end of August. Power has been patchy since the first outbreak of violence, but since Monday night supplies have gone down all the way from Tripoli to the western border with Tunisia, the western mountains region and southern Libya, the power firm said in a statement. It said a key power distributor was hit during the fighting in southern Tripoli where most of the clashes have taken place in the area of the former Tripoli International airport, which was destroyed in a different militia battle in 2014. Tripoli and western Libya are technically run by a U.N.-backed government but in reality armed groups allied to it are in charge, fighting over access of public funds and business contracts.

2018-09-18,"ZURICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - Switzerland’s Clariant (CLN.S) and new anchor shareholder Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE will merge their high-performance materials businesses and install a SABIC manager as head of the group as they strengthen their partnership. The new joint venture and governance accord announced on Tuesday mark the first concrete signs of how SABIC’s arrival as a white knight in January is reshaping the speciality chemicals group that U.S. activists had targeted. The partners had agreed that SABIC would not take over Clariant but could boost the 24.99 percent stake it bought from the activists to rescue Clariant from a hostile takeover threat, Clariant Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann told a news conference.  Reuters reported in June that SABIC, the world’s fourth-largest chemicals maker, was considering increasing its holding in Clariant and pursuing joint ventures. Clariant shares were up 6.1 percent at 0915 GMT, leading the European chemical sector index .SX4P, after news of the revamp that will let Clariant focus on higher-value speciality chemicals. SABIC shares gained 0.7 percent. SABIC Specialties Executive Vice President Ernesto Occhiello, 58, will take over next month as chief executive. Kottmann, who is 62 and has been CEO for 10 years, will now become chairman. Clariant and U.S. group Huntsman (HUN.N) last Ocotber  abandoned plans for a $20 billion merger, a win for activist investors who fought the deal for months on the grounds it would destroy shareholder value.  Clariant will hold a majority stake in the new business, which combines its Additives and high-value Masterbatches divisions with parts of SABIC’s Specialties business. Clariant will divest the remaining Plastics & Coatings business by 2020, it said in a statement. By 2021, the group aims to generate annual sales of around 9 billion Swiss francs ($9.36 billion), compared with 6.38 billion in 2017, and a margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 20 percent. Kottmann said it was important to gain critical mass in specialty chemicals and said the $15 billion in sales the company could have achieved if it had merged with Huntsman was “still the number which is important for us”. “The move now is a first move into this direction. I’m sure that we will have more opportunities in the years to come to further go into higher value specialities and to strengthen our business areas, for example care chemicals or catalysis or natural resources,” Kottmann said. Middle Eastern companies have been eager to expand into advanced downstream chemicals operations like the catalysts that Clariant produces to help speed up processes at chemicals plants. Saudi state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in 2015 bought half the synthetic rubber business of Germany’s Lanxess (LXSG.DE) for around 1.2 billion euros. The moves show that Saudi companies are increasingly trying to raise their influence outside the kingdom as part of the ambitious Vision 2030 plan which was set out by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the country’s economy from oil. The group said combining operations was set to generate annual synergies of around 100 million Swiss francs over three years from the deal’s closing. It would cost 80 million to implement the plan, which would take force at the start of 2020 and significantly boost earnings per share in the first year. Under the governance agreement, Clariant’s board of directors will expand to 12 members from 10 now, of which four will be nominated by SABIC. Shareholders must approve the change at a meeting set for Oct. 16. Even including a one-off payment to SABIC to be determined later, its pro forma 2019 net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio should not exceed 2.4 times and leave Clariant’s investment-grade debt rating untouched, it said. Increased earnings quality and operating cash flow will let Clariant at least maintain a steady if not higher dividend every year, it said.

2018-09-18,"* China’s total oil demand to peak 2030 at 13.8 mln bpd * Gas demand to hit 620 bcm in 2035, +160 pct vs 2017 * Gas production to hit 300 bcm in 2035 vs 147 bcm in 2017 (Adds forecasts on gas; peak energy demand) BEIJING, Sept 18 (Reuters) - China’s diesel demand has peaked and gasoline will peak in 2025, while natural gas demand will increase over the next two decades to feed a massive gasification campaign, according to a forecast released on Tuesday by a research arm on a state energy group. The research unit of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) also said that China’s total oil demand will top out at around 690 million tonnes a year, or 13.8 million barrels per day (bpd), by 2030. China, the world’s top crude oil importer, will maintain annual crude oil production of 200 million tonnes, or about 4 million barrels per day, before 2030, CNPC said. Demand for diesel is waning amid moderating economic growth and tighter environmental scrutiny, while gasoline demand is capped by slowing growth in private car sales and the rise of electric and natural gas-fuelled vehicles. One of the government’s recent plans is to replace a million heavy-duty diesel trucks, almost 20 percent of the national fleet, with ones that burn cleaner fuels such as natural gas and lower-sulphur diesel, as Beijing ramps up its war on pollution. This would be a blow to China’s oil refineries, as diesel is a main contributor to its fuel sales revenue. As additions to China’s refining capacity outpace the nation’s fuel demand growth, more than 50 million tonnes of surplus fuel is forecast for 2050, CNPC said. The country’s natural gas demand will reach 620 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2035, CNPC also said. That represents 160 percent growth from the consumption level for 2017. Domestic gas production is expected to reach 300 bcm by 2035, the forecast said, more than doubling the 147 bcm produced last year. China’s campaign to clear its skies has increased demand for the fuel and will keep it reliant on imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and piped gas. Demand for the cleaner-burning fuel has risen nearly 17 percent in the first half of the year. CNPC also brought forward the timeline for peak total energy demand for the world’s second-largest economy to 2035, from a previous forecast of 2040.

2018-09-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Carbon prices in major advanced economies are too low to cut greenhouse gas emissions and stave off the worst effects of climate change, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said on Tuesday. Carbon pricing, via taxes or emissions trading schemes, is used by many governments to make energy consumers pay for the costs of pollution, and to spur investment in low-carbon technology. The OECD examined carbon pricing between 2012, 2015 and 2018 in 42 OECD and G20 economies, which represent around 80 percent of global carbon emissions. It found the average pricing level across the countries in 2018 was 76.5 percent lower than the benchmark 30 euros ($35) a tonne it said is needed. The pricing gap had narrowed, from 79.5 percent in 2015, but “carbon prices need to increase considerably more quickly than they have done in recent years in order to ensure a cost-effective low-carbon transition”, the report said.

Not world stock markets it seems. The response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to go ahead next week with collecting 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, ratcheting up to 25 percent in January, was unusual and unexpected on Tuesday. It initially hit U.S. stocks, Treasuries and the dollar while stirring a rally in Chinese equities and the yuan in Asia. China then confirmed it would retaliate but still traders barely flinched. European stocks gained over a third of one percent on course for a third day of gains, Wall Street futures climbed and even copper and the Aussie dollar which have been highly sensitive to the trade tensions in recent months held firm. “In a way it is remarkable that the market is holding up so well,” said Rabobank’s Head of Macro Strategy Elwin de Groot. “This is clearly a further ratcheting up of the trade war and we are now getting close to a situation where you can almost speak of a full-fledged trade war. Clearly that is not positive.” One theory for the becalmed reaction was that the $200 billion U.S. move had been largely priced in to markets following weeks of reports and social media speculation. Chinese shares did dip initially as Asia digested the details but then rallied to push the blue-chip CSI index up 2 percent. Some locals were betting that Beijing will step up infrastructure investment to keep the economy humming. Japan’s Nikkei also ended 1.4 percent higher and MSCI’s 24-country emerging market index was up for the fourth day in the last five as 1 percent gains in Poland and a 0.7 percent rise in Russia added to Asia’s rebound. Trump’s announcement “is largely consistent with the claims made earlier,” Citi analysts said in a note, estimating a 33 basis point drag on China’s economic growth from the 10 percent tariff. “The trade war may get worse before it gets better. A full-blown trade war looms closer now,” they added however. China’s promise to respond to the new U.S. tariffs also came as The South China Morning Post newspaper reported Beijing was reviewing plans to send a delegation headed by Vice Premier Liu He to Washington for trade talks. In currencies, the dollar was broadly flat at 94.438 although on an individual basis it was a fraction firmer against the Japanese yen at just shy of 112. At the same time it was down slightly against the Chinese yuan in ‘offshore’ markets. The sensitive Australian dollar also moved up 0.4 percent to $0.7212 having also initially been hit when the tariff details broke. With FX participants wary that Beijing authorities may quickly step in to markets at any point, investors were “spontaneously” liquidating their short yuan positions said a trader at one Chinese bank. “China is likely to reject the invitation from the U.S. Treasury for the new round of trade talk,” OCBC Bank also said in a note on Tuesday.

U.S. stock futures took a knock as well, with E-Minis for S&P 500 and the Dow Minis both down 0.2 percent. U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, and warned of tariffs on more goods if China took any retaliatory action. Trump spared smart watches from Apple and Fitbit and other consumer products such as bicycle helmets and baby car seats. “The announcement dashes hopes of any trade negotiations between two rivals. Be prepared for a prolonged period of risk-off,” analysts at ING said in a note. “Although the levy saw a lower rate, it could foment a response from China who had previously threatened to walk away from the negotiating table,” it said. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is set to convene a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday morning to discuss the government’s response, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person briefed on the matter. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.3 percent with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index off 0.7 percent and Australian stocks down 0.4 percent. Chinese shares were largely unchanged while Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend, gaining more than 1.5 percent. Some analysts said the market reaction was a bit muted because Tuesday’s announcement was in line with expectations and was baked into the prices, while others see the U.S. economy riding out the impact for now. Investors were also bracing for Beijing’s response. “Tariffs on another $200 billion will mean about 12 percent of U.S. imports have seen a tariff hike. That means an average tariff increase of 1.6 percent across all imports, so tiny compared to the 1930s, when they were 20 percent,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney. “I still don’t see a resolution between China and the U.S. until after U.S. mid-terms elections in November to early 2019. “In the currency market, the dollar index gained briefly against a basket of major currencies but was last unchanged at 94.465. Against the yen, the greenback inched up 0.1 percent to 111.98. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar shed as much as 0.5 percent on the tariff news to near a recent 2-1/2 year low, then it changed direction and was up 0.2 percent at $0.7194. The euro gained a fraction to $1.1692. The tariff announcement drove some investors to the safety of U.S. Treasuries with 10-year yields coming off Monday’s four-month top of 3.0220 percent. They were last at 2.9940. Oil prices fell on worries rising trade tensions could dent global crude demand.

2018-09-18,"BEIJING, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Oil markets dropped on Tuesday as the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war clouded the outlook for demand, although concerns over tightening supply offered prices some support. Brent crude futures had declined 27 cents, or 0.35 percent, to $77.78 per barrel by 0054 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 32 cents, or 0.46 percent, to $68.59 per barrel. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he would impose 10 percent U.S. tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week invited top Chinese officials to a new round of talks on the dispute, but thus far nothing has been scheduled. “The growing trade dispute has hurt trading sentiment. The impact on economic growth is slowly dripping in, which again hurts oil prices,” Wang Xiao, head of crude research at Guotai Junan Futures, said on Tuesday. But supporting crude futures were potential supply cuts from U.S. sanctions on Iran. Sanctions affecting Iran’s petroleum sector will come into force from Nov. 4. Iranian crude oil export loadings have declined by 580,000 barrels per day in the past three months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note to clients. Meanwhile, oil output from seven major U.S. shale formations is expected to rise by 79,000 barrels per day to 7.6 million bpd in October, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Monday. Elsewhere, Russia’s energy minister, Alexander Novak, said on Monday that the country was ready to discuss cooperation with the United States to balance the oil market.

2018-09-18,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2pfLG9I By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have remained bullish towards Brent even as the approach of Hurricane Florence turned them against WTI and refined fuels were hit by liquidation. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 29 million barrels in the week to Sept. 11. The reduction in net length was a notable reversal after portfolio managers had boosted their bullish position by a total of 172 million barrels over the two previous weeks (tmsnrt.rs/2pfLG9I). For the third week running, fund managers added to their net long position in Brent, raising it by another 23 million barrels last week and by a total of 116 million since Aug. 21. But that was more than offset by reductions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-28 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million), U.S. heating oil (-6 million) and European gasoil (-11 million). The liquidation of WTI positions is likely to have been encouraged by the approach Hurricane Florence and more generally by the peaking of the tropical cyclone season in the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. Florence was already clearly tracking towards the Atlantic coast, an area of net petroleum consumption, where it ultimately made landfall, rather than the production and refining centres on the Gulf Coast. However, concerns about the risk of other storms, coupled with memories of last year’s Hurricane Harvey, which put multiple refineries out of action for several weeks in 2017, appear to have encouraged caution. Rising inventories of both gasoline and middle distillates, after an unusually long and heavy summer refining season, have inspired a similar restraint towards fuels. In contrast, sentiment towards Brent remained positive, as traders focused on the loss of exports from Iran as a result of U.S. sanctions as well as a levelling off in U.S. shale production and strong consumption growth. Fund managers have become more cautious towards the entire petroleum complex since the first quarter, reducing gross long positions across the six contracts to just 1.159 billion barrels, from a peak of 1.625 billion in January. But hedge funds’ short positions remain close to multi-year lows, at just 113 million barrels, suggesting few managers are willing to bet on the possibility of a significant pull back in either crude or fuel prices. Positioning is still lopsided, with fund managers holding 10 bullish long positions for every bearish short position, down from a ratio of almost 14:1 in April but sharply up from just 4:1 a year ago. Overall, the hedge fund community is still anticipating a further rise in oil prices, even as they touch the highest level for almost four years.
