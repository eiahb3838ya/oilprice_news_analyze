2018-07-23,"WASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - A Republican lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a bill calling for a carbon tax on Monday, saying he hoped the legislation would at the very least renew a U.S. debate on climate change that has languished for a decade. Representative Carlos Curbelo, a member of the House tax committee who faces a tough re-election bid in Florida, said the legislation, called the “Market Choice Act,” enjoys small but growing support among Republicans, who in recent years have been better known for knee-jerk rejection of carbon tax proposals. The measure is sure to fail. But Curbelo, speaking at a Washington forum on Monday, remained upbeat. “I truly believe that one day this bill, or legislation similar to it, will become law,” Curbelo said. “It will spark an important debate about investing in our country’s infrastructure, the way we tax and what to do to protect the environment,” he said. Curbelo said his legislation would exceed the carbon reduction goals of the Paris climate change pact by imposing a $24-per-ton levy on industrial carbon-dioxide emissions, which would begin in 2020 and rise annually. It would replace existing taxes on gasoline and aviation fuel. He said the tax would generate $700 billion in revenue over a decade for infrastructure investments. The bill would also impose a moratorium on U.S. regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation represents a small but meaningful shift for Republicans on climate politics, driven in part by candidates in swing states where increasingly frequent hurricanes and floods make no distinction between Republicans and Democrats. Many Republicans supported a climate bill 10 years ago. But it died in the Senate. Since then, Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have largely stood firm on two positions: cutting taxes and opposing climate legislation. Last week, the Republican-controlled House voted 229-180 to approve a resolution expressing “the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.” Curbelo opposed the measure, along with five other Republicans. A seventh chose not to support the resolution by voting “present.” Curbelo intends to discuss his bill with the 86-member bipartisan House Climate Solutions caucus, which includes 42 other Republicans. “We’re seeing trends in the House that should give us hope,” said Curbelo. The bill would be introduced formally later on Monday.

2018-07-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - About 40 rig workers started a 24-hour strike on Monday on the Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar platforms in the British North Sea, curbing gas flows to shore, but stored crude was expected to mitigate any oil supply disruption.  The platforms halted production at 0500 GMT, said Unite, Britain’s largest labour union. Unite and Total (TOTF.PA), which operates the platforms, had failed to agree on work shifts and pay, a union spokesman said. No fresh talks are currently planned, another union spokesman said. The fields account for about 10 percent of Britain’s gas output, while their oil production contributes about 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the Forties and Brent Blend crude streams. Forties and Brent Blend are key oil grades used to set the dated Brent benchmark that prices more than half of the world’s oil trades.  Brent futures LCOc1 were up 68 cents at $73.75 a barrel at 1527 GMT, off the day’s high of $74.50. Gas traders said the strike had curbed flows to shore, helping to boost the within-day wholesale gas price TRGBNBPWKD by 1.9 percent to 58.3 pence per therm. The contract had already been at multi-year highs for this time of year. The affected fields contribute about 10 percent of the Forties stream, but supply can be supported by using stored crude. July loadings of Forties were set at 330,000 bpd and August at 271,000 bpd.  A Total spokeswoman confirmed that industrial action had gone ahead “despite the new proposals that were made by the company”. Other 24-hour stoppages are slated to take place on Aug. 6 and 20, while the 12-hour strikes will occur on July 30 and Aug. 13. Total shares finished the day unchanged from Friday’s close. Total is seeking to extend the time workers at its fields spend offshore to three-week rotations instead of two, matching the rota system at its newly acquired Maersk fields.  “However, we’re pleased to be able to continue discussions with staff at the Shetland Gas Plant and remain committed to further consultation and open dialogue with offshore staff,” the spokeswoman said.  “What is at stake here is to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business in the North Sea, to enhance overall safety and remain the most efficient in our operations.” Other strikes are looming in the North Sea. Unite union members at services company Aker Solutions announced their decision to strike at Equinor’s (EQNR.OL) non-producing Mariner platform. GMB, another British union representing oil workers on Mariner, said its members had also voted to strike. It was not clear whether the two strikes would be coordinated. Equinor said that offshore work on Mariner was progressing well and that there was no change to its plan to start production from the field by the end of this year.  Aker Solutions said it had offered an enhancement to terms and conditions worth up to 8,000 pounds ($10,482.40) per employee, adding that it has sought further discussions with the unions. In a separate development, Unite was balloting 2,500 offshore oil service workers for another possible strike over pay, which would affect 106 North Sea oil platforms.  Last week 1,600 Norwegian rig drillers ended industrial action.

2018-07-23,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates was ordered by the highest U.N. court on Monday to immediately allow Qatari families affected by a dispute between the countries to reunite, imposing the measure before it hears the full case filed by Qatar at a later date.  The UAE had argued before judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague on June 28 [L8N1TU3GS] that the case was without merit and should be dismissed, but on Monday the judges granted Qatar’s request for so-called provisional measures by a majority vote of 8 to 7. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on Qatar in June 2017, severing diplomatic and transport ties and accusing it of supporting terrorism, which it denies. According to Qatar, which filed the suit in June, the UAE has as part of the boycott expelled thousands of Qataris, blocked transport and closed down the offices of the Doha-based Al-Jazeera news channel. “Many Qataris residing in the UAE appeared to have been forced to leave their place of residence without the possibility of return,” the judges’ ruling said. “There is an imminent risk that the measures adopted by the UAE could lead to irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked by Qatar.”   Qatar’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Lulwa al-Khater, welcomed the ruling.  “This is only the first step on a long road to defend our rights, but at the same time this sends an early strong signal that there will be no tolerance shown to countries that take arbitrary measures against Qataris,” she said in Arabic language comments published by state news agency QNA. The United Arab Emirates said it was already implementing the provisional procedures ordered by the court.  “The judges rejected the Qatari demands and called for three procedures relating to families, students and adjudication and they are measures the UAE has already implemented according to its national regulations,” UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said in a Twitter post in Arabic.  The court found that mixed UAE-Qatari families have been separated, Qatari students have been deprived of the opportunity to complete their education, and Qataris have been denied equal access to justice. “The court concludes that the conditions required by its statute for it to indicate provisional measures are met,” it said. The ICJ is the United Nations venue for legal disputes between states. Its verdicts are binding, but it has no enforcement powers.  Final verdicts generally take years and no date was set for the case to be heard in full.

2018-07-23,"* Eskom posts 2.3 bln rand ($171 mln) loss for 2017/18 * Executives considering all options to save utility * Ramaphosa has made reforming Eskom a priority * Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2NFfW94 (Writes through with new quotes, detail) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Reuters) - South Africa’s struggling state-run power firm Eskom said on Monday it was considering cutting staff and selling assets after reporting a $171 million loss which underlined the gravity of its financial position. Eskom, Africa’s largest public utility, was embroiled in corruption scandals under former president Jacob Zuma and narrowly avoided a liquidity crunch early this year after banks halted lending. Zuma has denied wrongdoing. The company is critical to South Africa. It supplies more than 90 percent of the country’s power, has around 270 billion rand ($20 billion) of state-guaranteed debt and is often cited as a threat to South Africa’s credit ratings, which hover on the edge of junk status. Cash-strapped Eskom has also become one of the most visible examples of the effects of corruption at state-run companies in South Africa, as a pay dispute with unions triggered protests leading to a spate of rolling blackouts last month. New President Cyril Ramaphosa replaced Eskom’s entire board and top executives in January, in one of his first interventions since becoming leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). “Eskom is undoubtedly facing one of the most difficult times in its history,” Eskom Chairman Jabu Mabuza told reporters. “We are not able to tell you today that all the skeletons are out.” Eskom blamed the 2.3 billion rand loss for the financial year which ended in March on increases in financing costs and depreciation of assets like Kusile and Medupi, two massive coal-fired power stations which have suffered significant delays and cost overruns. It also reported 19.6 billion rand of irregular expenditure and said it had 15.8 billion rand of cash at the end of March, down from 20.4 billion a year earlier. Eskom’s new management is combing its finances from late 2012 in an effort to recover money lost through corruption. It has asked for criminal cases to be opened against some former employees and suppliers. Chief Executive Phakamani Hadebe said Eskom had started discussions with the government about getting its staff numbers right, a veiled reference that the firm is considering cuts to its bloated 47,000 workforce. Analysts have long called for Eskom to take action to reduce ballooning staff costs, and Eskom Chairman Mabuza said on Monday the company believed it had around one-third too many employees. (For a graphic of Eskom's financial woes: tmsnrt.rs/2NFfW94) Eskom executives also said they were looking at whether to sell non-core assets to shore up the firm’s balance sheet. ANC sources told Reuters this month that Ramaphosa had secured the backing of senior figures in the ruling party for steps to boost private investment in the power supply industry, including by selling off non-essential parts of Eskom’s business. Eskom has already announced plans to sell a mortgage lender it owns. “We are busy with the process of optimising our balance sheet,” Chief Financial Officer Calib Cassim said, warning that high financing costs would continue to drag on Eskom’s bottom line in the 2018/19 financial year. Cassim added: “We are leaving all our options open.” ($1 = 13.5152 rand) (Editing by James Macharia and Kirsten Donovan)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/safrica-eskom/update-2-south-africas-eskom-considering-asset-sales-staff-cuts-after-big-loss-idUKL5N1UJ1V9,23 Jul 2018,"* Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NFfW94

2018-07-23,"* Bond yields spike on fears BoJ to scale back stimulus * U.S. curve steepens further; dollar nudged off two-week lows * Stocks weaken on trade fears ahead of big earnings * Oil gains on U.S.-Iran row, but gold loses more luster (Updates to U.S. equity market open; changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Signs that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) might scale back support for the economy faster than expected sent tremors through debt markets on Monday, while stocks slipped as threats of further U.S. tariffs on China drained risk appetite. Bond yields climbed after a Reuters report that the BoJ was discussing modifying its huge stimulus program sent Japan’s 10-year bond yield to a six-month high. The report rekindled anxieties about monetary stimulus easing around the world and piled further pressure on investors already struggling to navigate rising protectionism. The yield on Europe’s benchmark bond, the German 10-year Bund, hit a one-month high of 0.39 percent. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also hit their highest in a month at 2.937 percent. The Japanese yen climbed 0.05 percent to two-week highs against the greenback at 111.34 per dollar. “It’s all that concern investors have about the move from global quantitative easing to global quantitative tightening. That fear gets stoked when you have reports such as this,” said Rory McPherson, Psigma Investment Management’s head of investment strategy. The dollar index rose a bit off two-week lows it hit after U.S. President Trump criticized the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. Beijing said it has no intention of devaluing the yuan to help exports. “We see the latest news on trade policy as pointing to continued high risk of escalation between the U.S. and China, and a renewed focus of the Trump Administration on currency matters,” Goldman Sachs analysts said. Trump’s warnings about excessive interest rate hikes also helped the gap between short and long-term Treasury yields widen. That “steepening” of the yield curve continued on Monday, with yields on 30-year Treasuries more than 0.46 percentage points higher than their 2-year counterparts, the biggest gap in nearly a month. Short-end yields are influenced by U.S. monetary policy, and longer-term government bonds are driven by more by inflation and growth expectations. The yield curve’s flattening, or the shrinking gap between short and long yields, has been seen as a possible sign of an coming recession. The U.S. president’s new threats to slap duties on all $500 billion of U.S. imports from China triggered sell-offs across global stock markets that hit market-leading technology names, such as Amazon.com Inc, when U.S. markets opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 25,007.72, the S&P 500 lost 2.02 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,799.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.11 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,814.09. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.15 percent, with stocks broadly lower across Europe, Asia and emerging markets. Investors are bracing for a packed earnings week, including results from Google parent Alphabet, and a meeting between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Trump to discuss threatened tariffs which may affect carmakers. “The global economy is still okay, but the risk is now very high, and if trade policies don’t make a U-turn very soon, we’ll see a measurable impact on growth already next year,” UniCredit chief economist Erik Nielsen said. Concerns about growth affecting demand for fuel had dented crude prices in early trading, but oil rose again as tensions worsened between Iran and the United States. U.S. crude rose 0.35 percent to $68.50 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.52, up 0.62 percent on the day. In metals, copper - among the most sensitive to trade tensions - rose 0.07 percent from a one-year low hit last week, trading at $6,151.50 a tonne. Gold, hit by a strong greenback that makes the metal priced in dollars more expensive to foreign buyers, fell further towards one-year lows. Spot gold dropped 0.5 percent to $1,225.52 an ounce.

2018-07-23,"PARIS (Reuters) - French retailer Leclerc said on Monday it planned to start selling electricity to French households in autumn, targeting a market share of 10 percent by 2025. Privately owned Leclerc is now France’s largest food retailer by market share, having overtaken larger rival Carrefour (CARR.PA), thanks to its focus on low prices. “I confirm that Leclerc is making a start in providing power to consumers ... In a market of 32.4 million consumers, our target is to rapidly become the reference alternative supplier, recruiting three million clients by 2025, or a 10 pct market share,” CEO Michel-Edouard Leclerc said on his official blog. Leclerc said he would provide further details on his plan  in September, pledging that the new service Energies E. Leclerc would be “the cheapest in the market”. Leclerc is the second major retailer to enter the power market following Casino, (CASP.PA) online subsidiary Cdiscount  last year started offering retail customers a 15 percent discount to regulated electricity prices. In the 1980s, Leclerc started selling petrol and its CEO said his firm is now France’s second-largest gas station operator after oil group Total. (TOTF.PA)  Despite the arrival of several newcomers in French power retailing, which was opened to competition a decade ago, French state-controlled utility EDF (EDF.PA) still dominates with a market share of about 84 percent. Gas and power utility Engie (ENGIE.PA) - France’s former monopoly gas supplier - is EDF’s top challenger and had 3.8 million electricity clients in France at the end of December. France’s main independent power vendor, Direct Energie, DIREN.PA in April agreed to sell itself to oil major Total, (TOTF.PA) which will add 2.6 million new clients to the 1.5 million electricity clients Total already had. Total is targeting over six million customers in France by 2022.   More than 30 alternative gas and electricity suppliers operate in the French retail market, including Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI).

2018-07-23,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Kurdish security forces killed gunmen who had stormed a government building in the Kurdish city of Erbil on Monday and took hostages in an attack suspected of being carried out by Islamic State, security officials said.  Armed with pistols, AK-47 rifles and hand grenades, the assailants shot their way into the building housing the governorate from the main gate and a side entrance.  According to preliminary investigations, one government employee was killed in four hours of clashes. Two policemen were wounded. The gunmen approached the building shortly before 8 a.m. and opened fire, Erbil deputy governor Tahir Abdullah told Reuters. Seizing the third floor and taking an unspecified number of hostages, the men screamed “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greatest).  There were conflicting accounts on the details of the attack. Security officials said two of the men carried out suicide bombings.  But Erbil Governor Nawzad Hadi said none of the men blew themselves up. There were three assailants, he added. Snipers took up positions on a nearby building in Erbil’s busy commercial district and opened fire at the militants. Hand grenades were hurled at security forces.  “We believe that the attackers are from Islamic State because of the tactics they used in breaking into the building from the main gate. Two gunmen used pistols to shoot at the guards,” said a security official. Hisham al-Hashimi, an expert on Islamic State who advises the Iraqi government, said the attack was more likely carried out by Ansar al-Islam, a predominantly Kurdish, Salafist organisation which had links to Al Qaeda. The attack lacked the sophistication of Islamic State operations, he said.  “Daesh should not be ruled out,” he said, using a Arabic acronym used to describe the group.  “They were wearing the local Kurdish outfits used by Ansar al-Islam. There were no suicide belts.”    Iraq announced in December that it had defeated Islamic State. The militants came close to Erbil during a lightning offensive in 2014 before being pushed back, but were only driven from the city of Mosul, about 85 km west of Erbil, a year ago after a long, Western-backed campaign. The group still carries out attacks in parts of Iraq, an OPEC oil producer and close ally of the United States. Such high-profile assaults are rare in Erbil, seat of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).  The semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq was already facing difficulties before Monday’s violence. Last year a Kurdish bid for independence from the central government was quashed by the Iraqi army and militias allied with Iran. Tensions are high between the two main Kurdish parties because of difference over the independence issue. Kurdish security forces said the gunmen, who were speaking Kurdish, asked the women to leave and kept the men inside. Islamic State has in the past established units composed solely of Kurdish militants who fought in both Iraq and Syria.

2018-07-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government said on Monday it will distribute up to 557 million pounds in subsidies for less-established renewable energy sources through auctions that will take place every two years from mid-2019. The next so-called contracts for difference (CfD) allocation round for renewable energy technologies such as offshore wind will open by May next year, the government said. Energy companies and turbine makers who are investing in UK offshore wind, such as Sweden’s Vattenfall, Britain’s SSE, EDF, MHI Vestas, welcomed the announcement.  Under the CfD scheme, the government guarantees qualifying projects a minimum price at which they can sell electricity, with renewable power generators bidding for CfD contracts in a round of auctions. Offshore wind and, for the first time, remote island wind providers will be able to bid for contracts to power up to four million homes, it said. The government will hold another allocation round in 2021 and auctions around every two years.  Depending on the price achieved, the auctions will deliver between 1 and 2 gigawatts of offshore wind each year in the 2020s. “The government’s guarantee that auctions will be held every two years from 2019 onwards provides much-needed certainty for the UK’s offshore wind industry,” Paul Cooley, utility SSE’s director of generation development, said in a statement. SSE is involved in the development of the 2.6 billion pound Beatrice offshore wind farm off the Scottish coast, which should be completed in spring next year.  “At a time of uncertainty, providing visibility of future auctions will help support investment in clean growth and further drive down the cost of offshore wind,” said Danielle Lane, UK country manager for Vattenfall.

2018-07-23,"(Reuters) - Homes and businesses in Texas will likely use record amounts of power again on Monday as consumers keep their air conditioners cranked up on what is expected to be the last day of a week-long heat wave, the operator of much of the state’s power grid said. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) forecast demand would reach 74,647 megawatts on Monday, which would top the current record of 73,259 MW set on July 19. One megawatt can usually power about 1,000 U.S. homes. But on a hot day in Texas, ERCOT said one megawatt could only power about 100 homes. Over the past week, high temperatures in Houston, the fourth-largest U.S. city, have reached 99-100 degrees Fahrenheit (37-38 Celsius) every day since July 16 and are expected to top out at 101 degrees on Monday, according to AccuWeather. After Monday, however, power usage is expected to ease with demand on Tuesday only projected to reach 69,964 MW as temperatures return to near normal levels of around 95 degrees. Over the past week, ERCOT said demand for power set peak records for the month on July 16 and 17 before breaking the grid’s all-time high on July 18 and 19 and the all-time weekend high on July 21 and 22. Power prices at the ERCOT North hub rose to $194.25 per megawatt hour (MWh) on Friday from $176 on Thursday. That, however, was down from the near seven-year high of $351 set earlier last week. Those prices compare with an average of $42.30/MWh so far this year, $26.67 for all of 2017 and a five-year (2013-2017) average of $33.03. Despite the retirement of three big coal plants in early 2018 due to low power prices in recent years, ERCOT has said it expects to have sufficient operational tools to manage tight reserves and maintain system reliability this summer. Those tools include using a previously mothballed power plant, imports from other regions, consumer conservation and demand response efforts, which compensate consumers for cutting electric usage. ERCOT manages the grid for 24 million Texas customers, representing about 90 percent of the state’s electric load. The biggest power utilities in Texas include units of Sempra Energy, CenterPoint Energy Inc and American Electric Power Co Inc.

Beijing said it has no intention of devaluing the yuan to help exports. “We see the latest news on trade policy as pointing to continued high risk of escalation between the U.S. and China, and a renewed focus of the Trump Administration on currency matters,” Goldman Sachs analysts said. Trump’s comments about rates also helped the Treasury yield curve reach its steepest in three weeks. The yield curve’s flattening has been seen by some as a sign of an impending recession. The U.S. president’s new threats to slap duties on all $500 billion of U.S. imports from China triggered sell-offs across stock markets, though good earnings kept a lid on losses. S&P 500 and Dow Jones benchmark futures were flat, while futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent by 1205 GMT, indicating a tepid start for Wall Street. Europe’s STOXX 600 fell 0.1 percent by 1205 GMT as investors braced for a packed earnings week and a meeting between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Trump to discuss threatened tariffs which may affect carmakers. “The pattern of Trump’s meetings has generally been more conciliatory when he meets in person. It could actually be good for autos,” Psigma’s McPherson said. Europe’s autos sector was down 0.7 percent, hitting a 2-1/2 week low. The index is down 9 percent this year and is among the worst-performing European sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts said auto tariffs, if they came to pass, were likely to cause weakness in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, possibly also affecting the euro, pound, yen, and Korean won as investors priced in a hit to the economy. “The global economy is still okay, but the risk is now very high, and if trade policies don’t make a U-turn very soon, we’ll see a measurable impact on growth already next year,” UniCredit chief economist Erik Nielsen said. Concerns about growth affecting demand for fuel had dented crude prices in early trading, but oil rose again as tensions worsened between Iran and the U.S. and a rig workers’ strike caused potential supply disruption. U.S. crude rose 1.1 percent to $69.04 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent crude climbed 1.4 percent to $74.08 a barrel. Around 40 rig workers started a 24-hour strike on three North Sea oil platforms operated by Total, curbing gas flows to shore. In metals, copper - among the most sensitive to trade tensions - rose 0.7 percent from a one-year low hit last week, trading at $6,192.5 a tonne. Emerging market equities eased 0.1 percent as the dollar recovered. Dollar strength has driven selling in emerging market stocks this year, putting pressure on emerging economies with large dollar-denominated debt piles. Reporting by Helen Reid

2018-07-23,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 23 (Reuters) - Crude oil isn’t formally part of the trade dispute between the United States and China, but it may well be the first major flow to be disrupted significantly by the rising tensions. One of the successes in the efforts to lower the trade surplus enjoyed by China over the United States was exports of crude, a result of the shale oil boom that has taken the U.S. to within a whisker of being the world’s top oil producer. Crude exports from the United States to China have surged this year, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts showing China imported 60.2 million barrels, or about 333,000 barrels per day (bpd), of U.S. oil in the first half of the year. This was up from just 24.9 million barrels, or 138,000 bpd, over the same period last year, according to the data. Much of the gain so far this year has been in recent months, with the April to July period being four of the five strongest months on record, and January this year being the other. July is set to be the second-strongest month for Chinese imports of U.S. crude, with the data pointing to the arrival of 12.32 million barrels, or about 397,000 bpd. Expected shipments in August appear to be heading substantially lower, however, with only 9.58 million barrels, or about 309,000 bpd, expected to arrive at Chinese ports. While these numbers may still change, they are unlikely to shift much, given the typical six-week journey between U.S. ports in the Gulf of Mexico and China. This means all U.S. cargoes slated to arrive in China in August should have already left. It also means most cargoes likely to arrive in September would also have departed the United States, but so far no such fixtures are showing. This doesn’t mean there will be zero U.S. crude exports arriving China in September, but it does raise the possibility that there will be a sharp decline. To put it in perspective, of the 10 U.S. cargoes unloaded in China in June, nine left U.S. ports in April. Given there is only one week left of July and no cargoes have yet left the U.S. for arrival in China in September, it seems risks are rising that U.S. oil shipments to China are falling off a cliff. This may add to the existing trade tensions between China and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made it clear he wants a lower trade deficit with China. If crude oil exports do plummet, though, the trade deficit is likely headed higher, notwithstanding tariffs already placed on some Chinese exports by the Trump administration. While this sounds like a poor outcome for U.S. crude exporters, there is evidence suggesting other importers in North Asia are taking up cargoes no longer being bought by China. South Korea may import a record amount of U.S. crude in September, with vessel-tracking data pointing to the arrival of 5.94 million barrels, or about 198,000 bpd. Japan may bring in 2.6 million barrels in September, or about 86,600 bpd, the highest since January this year. Taiwan’s imports from the United States are slated at 5.89 million bpd for August, or about 196,300 bpd, which would be the highest on record. While additional imports from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are probably insufficient to make up for the loss of Chinese purchases, they will provide some comfort to U.S. oil exporters. But they are also unlikely to do anything to ease the trade tensions between the Trump administration and China. The looming slump in China’s purchases of U.S. crude may be taken as a sign that Beijing is prepared to fight back against Trump, even if the tactics are somewhat different. Rather than impose tariffs, China may simply persuade its state-owned refiners to move away from buying U.S. crude. This means pain can be inflicted on the United States without needing to impose tariffs or resorting to the bombastic rhetoric that typifies the Trump administration.

2018-07-23,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LhKO1S By John Kemp LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have slashed bullish long positions in petroleum at the fastest rate in more than a year, as the gentle profit-taking in previous weeks turned into a rush for the exit. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 178 million barrels in the week to July 17. Net long positions were reduced by the third-largest number of barrels on record, according to an analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges going back to the first quarter of 2013. The net long position in petroleum was cut below 1 billion barrels for the first time since the middle of September 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2LhKO1S). The reduction was concentrated on the long side of the market, where positions were slashed by 170 million barrels, as managers took profits after the year-long rally in oil prices. Short positions rose by just 8 million barrels and remain close to multi-year lows, confirming the shift in net positioning is being driven by profit-taking rather than any newfound bearishness. Long liquidation was concentrated in Brent, with net long positions in the North Sea benchmark cut by 95 million barrels, the largest one-week reduction since the series began in 2013. But portfolio managers also cut net long positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-34 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-17 million barrels) and European gasoil (-25 million barrels). Hedge fund managers hold most of their positions in futures and options with a relatively short duration to expiry since these tend to offer the most liquidity, so the sell-off has hit near-dated contracts especially hard. Brent liquidation has therefore crushed the calendar spreads, with contracts nearest to expiry now trading in contango, and the whole of the first six months in a backwardation of less than 40 cents per barrel. The accelerating sell-off in petroleum futures and options is not entirely surprising and conforms to a common pattern in financial markets. The sharpest liquidation and price falls come not straight after prices peak, but when prices have been under gentle pressure for some time, and the initial trickle of selling finally turns into a torrent. Benchmark Brent prices have repeatedly failed to break up through the peak of just over $80 per barrel set in May. Fund managers are still essentially bullish towards the outlook for oil prices, but the extremely stretched positioning during the first quarter has been partially corrected. Portfolio managers hold more than eight bullish long positions for every short bearish position in the petroleum complex, but the ratio is down from almost 14:1 in the middle of April. In Brent, the ratio of hedge fund longs to shorts is down to 8:1, from 20:1 in late April; in European gasoil, the ratio is down to 13:1, from 129:1 in late May. For most market analysts and traders, the oil market outlook remains fundamentally tight, with strong growth in consumption, while production continues to be disrupted by problems in Venezuela and Libya. Pipeline capacity shortages in the United States may limit further growth in production from the prolific Permian Basin later in 2018 and early 2019. On top of all this, U.S. sanctions on Iran threaten to remove millions more barrels from the market from the start of November, though how many remains unclear. But the sharp rise in output and exports from Saudi Arabia in June and July has increased the availability of crude in the near term, contributing to the sell-off in Brent calendar spreads. And there are growing concerns about the combined impact of high oil prices, a strengthening dollar and trade tensions on the health of the global economy and oil consumption in the rest of 2018 and 2019. In the circumstances, many fund managers have chosen to reduce their long exposure to oil, without choosing to go short (yet) in a classic long liquidation cycle.

2018-07-23,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An explosion of hot gas at a boiler at NTPC’s Unchahar power plant last year that killed 45 workers was the result of an “error in judgement” by some of the plant’s most experienced operators, according to an internal report on the state-run electricity producer’s biggest disaster. The plant’s Head of Operation, Head of Ash Handling Maintenance and Head of Boiler Maintenance - each with 28 years of experience - made a decision not to shut down a 500-megawatt (MW) boiler at Unchahar to clear a buildup of ash prior to an overpressurisation in the unit that caused the gas release, said a summary of the report reviewed by Reuters. “The shut down of the boiler much before the incident would have been prudent,” the report, prepared by an internal committee of NTPC, said. It was not clear from the summary when the report was submitted. The three experienced engineers died in the accident. Reuters was unable to verify the claims made in the report. The Nov. 1 accident at the 1,550-megawatt coal-fired power station in Unchahar in northern India killed 45 people and left survivors with severe burns.  NTPC is the country’s top power producer and accidents have been rare at its facilities. The plant operators were aware of an ash buildup in the Unit-6 boiler and had reduced the unit’s load to 300 MW while workers cleared the ash from the furnace bottom in the hours leading up the accident, the report said. The ash buildup, however, caused a boiler tube carrying steam to leak, leading to a high pressure buildup and subsequent burning of flammable substances, the report said. That led to a build up of steam pressure in the unit that caused it to “trip”, or involuntarily shut down, following which hot ash and gases were released at high speeds that killed and injured the workers, according to the summary.  NTPC declined to release the full report or comment on the lapses mentioned in it. The company has revised its safety policy and is regularly conducting safety audits and mock drills, a spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters. A spokesman for Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd which made the boiler tubes at Unchahar did not respond to repeated calls and emails.  Two NTPC officials, who did not want to be named citing government policy, said the company did not have the equipment to measure the amount of ash buildup in its plants and relied on physical inspection. NTPC has now begun talks with BHEL to install a system to measure and monitor ash content online, the officials said.

2018-07-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - More than half of Germans think Europe can defend itself without military backing from the United States, a poll showed on Monday, less than two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said he could withdraw support. Only 37 percent of respondents said they believed Europe depended on U.S. military help, the Forsa poll showed. The survey found no significant difference between eastern German regions and western areas, which have stronger historical ties to the United States. In the east, 60 percent thought Europe did not need Washington, and in the west, 55 percent. Trump gave an ultimatum to European allies on July 12, warning a NATO summit the United States could withdraw its support if Europe did not share more of what he called an unfair burden on U.S. taxpayers in funding the alliance. In a rebuke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he also called Germany a “captive” of Moscow because, he said, Berlin supported a Baltic Sea gas pipeline from Russia. About 84 percent of respondents said Trump’s comments about Russia controlling Germany were “completely absurd”, according to the poll which surveyed 1,004 Germans. Even more - 92 percent - said they suspected that Trump’s motive for making the comments was primarily to promote the sale of U.S. liquefied gas in Europe and Germany.  Two thirds said they supported the construction of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea pipeline because it would help provide Germany with a more reliable supply of natural gas.

2018-07-23,"HANOI (Reuters) - A court in Vietnam on Monday jailed 10 people for terms ranging from two to 3-1/2 years after they were arrested in last month’s nationwide protests against new economic zones, state media said. Despite sweeping reforms, communist-ruled Vietnam tolerates little dissent and arrested the 10 at protests sparked by fears that investors from China would dominate land leases for up to 99 years being offered for development of the economic zones. The official Voice of Vietnam Radio said a people’s court in the central province of Binh Thuan convicted the offenders, aged between 18 and 43, of “causing public disorder”. They were seen hurling bricks and stones at police, besides damaging several police vehicles and causing traffic jams during a June 10 protest, it cited the indictment as saying.  Their lawyers were not immediately available for comment. Monday’s trial came days after a court in Ho Chi Minh City ordered the release and deportation of an American man of Vietnamese descent accused of the same charge. William Anh Nguyen, 32, detained in a protest in Vietnam’s economic hub, had been in police custody until his release. Police arrested dozens of people during the June protests, which spanned several cities and turned violent in Binh Thuan.

2018-07-23,"(Reuters) - California’s power grid operator on Monday issued an alert to homes and businesses to conserve electricity on Tuesday and Wednesday when a heat wave is expected to blanket the state. The California Independent System Operator (ISO), the grid operator, said it issued the so-called “Flex Alert” due to high temperatures across the western United States, reduced electricity imports into the state, tight natural gas supplies in Southern California and high wildfire risk. The ISO’s alert followed an earlier notice by Southern California Gas Co (SoCalGas), the gas utility for the southern part of the state. SoCalGas issued a gas curtailment watch on Monday, notifying customers to be prepared to reduce gas use if needed, with power generators expected to burn more fuel this week than usual to keep air conditioners humming. SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy, said the watch would remain in effect until further notice. High temperatures in Los Angeles were forecast to top 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) Monday-Friday with the mercury expected to reach 97 degrees on Wednesday, according to AccuWeather. The normal high in the city at this time of year is 84 degrees. The ISO said consumers “can help avoid power interruptions” by turning off all unnecessary lights, using major appliances before 5 p.m. and after 9 p.m., and setting air conditioners to 78 degrees or higher. Gas supplies are expected to remain tight in Southern California this summer and winter due to reduced availability from SoCalGas’ Aliso Canyon storage facility in Los Angeles, following a massive leak between October 2015 and February 2016, and ongoing shutdowns of several pipelines. SoCalGas projected gas demand would rise from 3.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Monday to 3.1 bcfd on Tuesday and 3.2 bcfd on Wednesday and Thursday, while receipts of the fuel via pipelines into California would only total about 2.6 bcfd. That means SoCalGas will have to tap storage fields to make up the difference, which could hurt the utility’s ability to stockpile enough fuel to avoid curtailments for some power and industrial customers on the coldest days during the winter heating season. State and federal agencies have projected SoCalGas will only be able to deliver about 3.6 bcfd from non-Aliso storage fields due to the Aliso limitations and pipeline outages, which has only occurred once in the summer in the past five years but is fairly common in the winter.

2018-07-23,"NEW YORK and ABU DHABI (Reuters) - One of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) largest and most valuable customers, Saudi Arabia, is lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work, according to five people familiar with the situation.    State-controlled Saudi Electricity Co 5110.SE has qualified at least two companies to provide service or parts for some of its more than 50 GE-made F-class turbines, and it is in talks with two others over investments to set up facilities to service the plants over many years, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.     These approvals for the first time put Saudi Electricity in a position to break GE’s hold on that work by having others bid against GE on maintaining the F-Class fleet - among the largest owned by a single entity and among the most lucrative service portfolios in the industry - when the existing contracts come up, according to the sources and industry databases.     Saudi Electricity Co (SEC) has not yet offered any substantial F-Class contracts to new bidders, and it is unclear how soon it intends to seek bids, according to sources familiar with the matter.          In response to questions from Reuters, GE said: “At present, GE’s F-class units in SEC continue to be covered under long-term service agreements.” Saudi Electricity initially declined to comment. In a joint statement to Reuters on Sunday after Reuters published, the companies stressed they have been partners on power generation for nearly 40 years.     “SEC has always embarked on a very balanced policy of procurement to ensure well diversified sources of suppliers,” said Khalid Al-Tuaimi, executive vice president for generation of Saudi Electricity.  Saudi Electricity “always qualifies multiple vendors to bid on services,” Al-Tuaimi said, adding, “We have repeatedly found GE to be an excellent strategic partner for meeting our servicing needs.”  Joseph Anis, President and CEO of GE Power Services, Africa, India and the Middle East, and Hisham Al Bahkali, President and CEO of GE Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, said: “We support more than half of the Kingdom’s power supply, and are proud to be a part of the ongoing development of the sector.”  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer, has grown increasingly cost conscious, and under its “Vision 2030” reform plan it aims to reduce oil dependence, lower state budget deficits and create jobs.  The kingdom also wants to obtain the best possible prices on large contracts with big companies, according to a source with direct knowledge of Saudi Electricity. Saudi Electricity is in the process of getting other companies involved in bidding for power plant services, rather than relying on GE as the sole provider, because qualifying competitors will lower prices, the source said.  Saudi Electricity previously created competition for an earlier generation of turbines known as the E-class, according to the sources. After bidding began, GE ended up with less work and prices for the work fell by about 40 percent, sources said.  One source with knowledge of GE’s service history in Saudi Arabia said some F-Class turbines that Saudi Electricity purchased more recently may not be under long-term agreements because the service price was high, and those could be opened for bidding at any time. One side effect of Saudi Electricity qualifying third-party firms to repair its F-Class is that it is large enough to enable competitors to set up operations that they could use to sell the parts and repair services to customers outside Saudi Arabia, potentially threatening portions of GE’s service business globally, three sources said.  Saudi Electricity’s rigorous qualification process is seen as a stamp of approval that will help bidders sell to other utilities and industries, one of the sources said.  The companies Saudi Electricity has qualified for work on GE’s F-Class are Power Systems Mfg LLC, a unit of Ansaldo Energia SpA of Genoa, Italy, and San Diego-based Combustion Parts Inc. Both declined to comment.    GE Chief Executive John Flannery has said service revenue is important to restoring growth to GE’s power business, where profit fell 58 percent in the second quarter. The division, which makes equipment for gas, coal and nuclear power plants, is coping with a steep drop in orders for new plants. Flannery said on Friday that fixing the unit was “clearly our top priority.”  As a sign of its emphasis on increasing its own service revenue, GE in May posted videos on YouTube saying it is offering high-tech upgrades to turbines made by rivals Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (7011.T).  Two other service companies said they are in talks to qualify to work on Saudi Electricity’s F-Class plants: Chromalloy, based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and Al Masaood John Brown, in Dubai. Both said they already work on SEC’s E-Class turbines. Al Masaood John Brown shareholders have approved investment to enable it to repair certain F-Class components at its Dubai facility. It plans to present details of the planned investment to SEC as a way of “kick starting” the formal pre-qualification process, General Manager Brian Waddell said in an email.   Chromalloy said it is considering a large investment to enable it to work on Saudi Electricity’s F-Class turbines for the long term. “We’re definitely willing to make that commitment and are in discussions with SEC on that,” said spokesman Jeff Romaine. “We’re looking at doing parts repairs or manufacturing of parts for the long term,” he added. “That’s what SEC is asking us for.”  Reporting by Alwyn Scott in New York, Stephen Kalin in Saudi Arabia and Stanley Carvalho in Abu Dhabi; editing by Joe White and Edward Tobin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ge-saudi/exclusive-general-electrics-power-unit-faces-threat-in-saudi-arabia-idUKL1N1UI055,23 Jul 2018,"One of General

2018-07-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British infrastructure arm of Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund said on Monday it had agreed to buy oil and gas pipeline firm North Sea Midstream Partners (NSMP) from private equity firm ArcLight Capital. Wren House, the London-based infrastructure investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), declined to disclose the financial terms of the transaction. However, two sources told Reuters it was paying around 1.3 billion pounds ($1.70 billion). Wren House fought off bids from JP Morgan (JPM.N), Blackstone (BX.N), and private equity fund KKR (KKR.N) to buy NSMP, according to one of the sources. “Wren House was bidding against some very big players and they simply offered the best terms,” said the source.  Its bid was lower than one other but it offered better overall terms, according to one of the sources.  The current management team, including NSMP CEO Andy Heppel, will remain, the source said. NSMP was valued at around 1.2 billion pounds to 1.3 billion pounds ($1.6 to $1.7 billion), the sources said. Wren House is headed by Hakim Drissi Kaitouni, a former investment banker who worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) in London and New York. “NSMP’s catchment areas, in particular the West of Shetland basin, represent one of the most promising areas in terms of exploration and future developments,” said managing director Drissi Kaitouni.        The Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute ranks KIA as the world’s fourth-biggest sovereign fund, managing $592 billion. Only Norway, China and United Arab Emirates have bigger sovereign funds. Wren House’s other investments in the United Kingdom include stakes in Associated British Ports, London City Airport and Thames Water. NSMP owns a 67 percent interest in the SIRGE pipeline that transports natural gas from the West of Shetlands basin and a 100 percent interest in the FUKA pipeline which transports gas from the SIRGE pipeline and various fields in the northern and central North Sea. NSMP also owns the St. Fergus Gas Terminal and Teesside Gas Processing Plant. NSMP counts the Rhum gas field, in the North Sea and which is 50 percent owned by the Iranian Oil Company, among its clients. Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised ArcLight on the transaction. Patrick de Loe, Merrill’s managing director of EMEA infrastructure, declined to comment. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer was ArcLight’s legal adviser. Wren House was advised by Jefferies (JEF.N) and Macquarie Capital. Its legal advisor was Slaughter and May. Wren House said the transaction was expected to complete in 2018, following the receipt of merger clearance.

2018-07-23,"* Bond yields spike; BoJ may scale back stimulus * U.S. curve steepens further as dollar nudged off two-week lows * Stocks rise ahead of major earnings * Oil volatile on U.S.-Iran row, and gold loses more luster (Updates to early afternoon with oil price declines, U.S. stock gains) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Fears that monetary policymakers in the U.S. and Japan will scale back support for the economy sent quivers through debt markets on Monday, while U.S. stocks gained ahead of major company earnings reports. Bond yields climbed as the Federal Reserve was seen as likely to continue raising interest rates despite criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and after a Reuters report that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) was discussing modifying its huge stimulus program sent Japan’s 10-year bond yield to a six-month high. The report rekindled anxieties about how much monetary policymakers will continue supporting economies around the world and piled further pressure on investors already struggling to navigate rising protectionism. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit their highest in a month and traded at 2.9597 percent, following a rise in Europe’s benchmark 10-year German Bund. “It’s all that concern investors have about the move from global quantitative easing to global quantitative tightening. That fear gets stoked when you have reports such as this,” said Rory McPherson, Psigma Investment Management’s head of investment strategy. Sage Advisory Services Ltd Chief Investment Officer Bob Smith said there is no “800-pound gorilla” willing to absorb an increasing supply of bonds. The U.S. has several bond auctions scheduled this week. “You’re sitting right in the dead of summer,” he said. “I don’t think the super-heroes are on the desks right now. They’re probably on the beach.” The dollar index rose 0.14 percent off two-week lows it hit after Trump criticized the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. Beijing said it has no intention of devaluing the yuan to help exports. “We see the latest news on trade policy as pointing to continued high risk of escalation between the U.S. and China, and a renewed focus of the Trump Administration on currency matters,” Goldman Sachs analysts said. Trump’s warnings about excessive interest rate hikes last week also widened the gap between short and long-term Treasury yields. That “steepening” of the yield curve continued on Monday, with yields on 30-year Treasuries more than 0.46 percentage points higher than their 2-year counterparts, the biggest gap in nearly a month. Short-end yields are influenced by U.S. monetary policy, and longer-term government bonds are driven by more by inflation and growth expectations. A shrinking gap between yields this year has been seen as a possible sign of a coming recession. Trump’s threats to slap duties on all $500 billion of U.S. imports from China triggered selloffs across global stock markets that hit market-leading technology names, such as Amazon.com Inc. Yet U.S. equities largely dodged threats of further American tariffs on China, rising ahead of potentially blockbuster earnings. Financials stand to benefit from a steeper curve because they borrow at short-term rates and lend over longer time periods. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.03 percent, with stocks broadly lower across Europe, Asia and emerging markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.93 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,066.05, the S&P 500 gained 4.37 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,806.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.53 points, or 0.17 percent, to 7,833.73. Investors are bracing for a packed earnings week, including results from Google parent Alphabet, and a meeting between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Trump to discuss threatened tariffs. Oil lost strong early gains on U.S.-Iran tensions after traders weighed the risk that Saudi Arabia and other large producers could ramp up production ahead of a November deadline for other countries to comply with U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude sales. U.S. crude fell 0.76 percent to $67.74 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.69, down 0.52 percent. In metals, both copper and gold neared one-year lows. Copper - among the most sensitive to trade tensions - lost 0.16 percent, trading at $6,137.50 a tonne. Spot gold, hit by a strong greenback that makes the metal priced in dollars more expensive to foreign buyers, dropped 0.6 percent to $1,224.01 an ounce. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

2018-07-23,"DUBAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have been picked to advise on Saudi Aramco’s plan to buy a controlling stake in petrochemical maker SABIC 2010.SE, several sources familiar with the matter said. Aramco aims to buy such a stake, possibly taking the entire 70 percent holding owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, two of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Monday.  Late last week, Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE confirmed a Reuters report that it was working on the possible purchase of a “strategic stake” in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE from the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s top sovereign wealth fund. Aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the company, which is the world’s largest oil producer. Boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help to attract investors for the initial public offering. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley had already been among the advisers assisting Aramco on its IPO.  Aramco’s initial thinking is to buy the full stake owned by the PIF, but if that fails to materialise Aramco could end up with a stake in SABIC of more than 50 percent, making it a majority owner, two of the sources said.     No final decision has been made on the size of the stake as discussions are at a very early stage, they added. Aramco, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.  The PIF did not respond to a request for comment on the size of the stake sale. Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, has a market capitalisation of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals ($103 billion). The potential acquisition would affect the time frame of Aramco’s planned IPO set for later this year, the state oil giant’s chief executive, Amin Nasser, said in a TV interview on Friday. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to cut the risk of an oil demand slowdown. [L8N1TE423] Aramco plans to raise its refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels per day, from around 5 million bpd now, and double its petrochemicals production by 2030.

2018-07-23,"WASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - A Republican lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a bill calling for a carbon tax on Monday, saying he hoped the legislation would at the very least renew a U.S. debate on climate change that has languished for a decade. Representative Carlos Curbelo, a member of the House tax committee who faces a tough re-election bid in Florida, said the legislation, called the “Market Choice Act,” enjoys small but growing support among Republicans, who in recent years have been better known for knee-jerk rejection of carbon tax proposals. The measure is sure to fail. But Curbelo, speaking at a Washington forum on Monday, remained upbeat. “I truly believe that one day this bill, or legislation similar to it, will become law,” Curbelo said. “It will spark an important debate about investing in our country’s infrastructure, the way we tax and what to do to protect the environment,” he said. Curbelo said his legislation would exceed the carbon reduction goals of the Paris climate change pact by imposing a $24-per-ton levy on industrial carbon-dioxide emissions, which would begin in 2020 and rise annually. It would replace existing taxes on gasoline and aviation fuel. He said the tax would generate $700 billion in revenue over a decade for infrastructure investments. The bill would also impose a moratorium on U.S. regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation represents a small but meaningful shift for Republicans on climate politics, driven in part by candidates in swing states where increasingly frequent hurricanes and floods make no distinction between Republicans and Democrats. Many Republicans supported a climate bill 10 years ago. But it died in the Senate. Since then, Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have largely stood firm on two positions: cutting taxes and opposing climate legislation. Last week, the Republican-controlled House voted 229-180 to approve a resolution expressing “the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.” Curbelo opposed the measure, along with five other Republicans. A seventh chose not to support the resolution by voting “present.” Curbelo intends to discuss his bill with the 86-member bipartisan House Climate Solutions caucus, which includes 42 other Republicans. “We’re seeing trends in the House that should give us hope,” said Curbelo. The bill would be introduced formally later on Monday.

2018-07-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - About 40 rig workers started a 24-hour strike on Monday on the Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar platforms in the British North Sea, curbing gas flows to shore, but stored crude was expected to mitigate any oil supply disruption.  The platforms halted production at 0500 GMT, said Unite, Britain’s largest labour union. Unite and Total (TOTF.PA), which operates the platforms, had failed to agree on work shifts and pay, a union spokesman said. No fresh talks are currently planned, another union spokesman said. The fields account for about 10 percent of Britain’s gas output, while their oil production contributes about 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the Forties and Brent Blend crude streams. Forties and Brent Blend are key oil grades used to set the dated Brent benchmark that prices more than half of the world’s oil trades.  Brent futures LCOc1 were up 68 cents at $73.75 a barrel at 1527 GMT, off the day’s high of $74.50. Gas traders said the strike had curbed flows to shore, helping to boost the within-day wholesale gas price TRGBNBPWKD by 1.9 percent to 58.3 pence per therm. The contract had already been at multi-year highs for this time of year. The affected fields contribute about 10 percent of the Forties stream, but supply can be supported by using stored crude. July loadings of Forties were set at 330,000 bpd and August at 271,000 bpd.  A Total spokeswoman confirmed that industrial action had gone ahead “despite the new proposals that were made by the company”. Other 24-hour stoppages are slated to take place on Aug. 6 and 20, while the 12-hour strikes will occur on July 30 and Aug. 13. Total shares finished the day unchanged from Friday’s close. Total is seeking to extend the time workers at its fields spend offshore to three-week rotations instead of two, matching the rota system at its newly acquired Maersk fields.  “However, we’re pleased to be able to continue discussions with staff at the Shetland Gas Plant and remain committed to further consultation and open dialogue with offshore staff,” the spokeswoman said.  “What is at stake here is to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business in the North Sea, to enhance overall safety and remain the most efficient in our operations.” Other strikes are looming in the North Sea. Unite union members at services company Aker Solutions announced their decision to strike at Equinor’s (EQNR.OL) non-producing Mariner platform. GMB, another British union representing oil workers on Mariner, said its members had also voted to strike. It was not clear whether the two strikes would be coordinated. Equinor said that offshore work on Mariner was progressing well and that there was no change to its plan to start production from the field by the end of this year.  Aker Solutions said it had offered an enhancement to terms and conditions worth up to 8,000 pounds ($10,482.40) per employee, adding that it has sought further discussions with the unions. In a separate development, Unite was balloting 2,500 offshore oil service workers for another possible strike over pay, which would affect 106 North Sea oil platforms.  Last week 1,600 Norwegian rig drillers ended industrial action.

2018-07-23,"BARCELONA, July 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When the Caribbean island of Barbuda was battered by Hurricane Irma last September, about 90 percent of homes were destroyed or damaged, and the entire population had to be evacuated. Since the school year ended last month, the pace of families returning from neighbouring Antigua - where many lodged with relatives or in state-run centres - has picked up, even though reconstruction is unfinished, the Red Cross said. Almost half of Barbuda’s roughly 1,800 people have gone back, as the cash-strapped, twin-island nation works on ways to protect people from future disasters while waiting for promised aid funds to rebuild homes - which could take years. “It’s going to be a long and painful process,” Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We just have to rely mostly on our resources, and to find creative ways to generate income to continue the recovery efforts.” In the face of serious and growing threats, experts detect a sea change in many of the world’s 57 small island states and other remote island economies that share development challenges. They are finding innovative alternatives to lurching from one crisis to the next - whether the problem is extreme weather, mass tourism, plastic waste, water shortages or migration. Barbuda, aware it will take time to get back on its feet even as this year’s hurricane season began in June, aims to stay safer in future - like many of its Caribbean neighbours. Brennan Banks, Red Cross operations manager for the Irma response, said the aid agency plans to build a new office on Barbuda that can double up as an emergency shelter. It is also offering free first-aid training to locals and fixing up rainwater-collection systems, while working with the government to improve early warning on the two islands. Such solutions - often developed at least partly with islands themselves - are already improving lives, and protecting communities and environments on a small scale. But their fledging efforts need far more funding to make a difference - and lessons learned in these living laboratories must be shared widely, say officials and resilience experts. Hugh Riley, secretary-general of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, believes the region is better prepared for this year’s hurricane season, even if it is still vulnerable. “Every time we have an incident of some kind, we learn from it,” he said. “The whole business of rebuilding stronger has resonated with us, rebuilding better has resonated with us, rebuilding smarter has resonated with us.” Recent improvements include better government coordination, communications systems that work more smoothly, and faster evacuation plans, he said. According to a June report from the World Bank, building back from a disaster stronger, faster and in a way that includes everybody can yield major dividends for small island nations. Doing so would reduce losses in people’s wellbeing by an average 59 percent across a sample of 17 island states, it said, compared with 31 percent for all 149 countries in the study. For Antigua and Barbuda, the reduction would be as large as 78 percent. Co-author Stephane Hallegatte said the benefits of reconstruction that also protects against future disasters are comparatively large for small islands because they face a high level of risk and exposure to storms and other natural threats. Many tend to have low-quality housing unable to resist even moderate hazards, the World Bank economist noted. “There is a lot of potential for improvement,” he said. “There are very cheap opportunities.” Those can be as simple as giving local people who repair their own homes tougher roofing materials, and teaching them how to attach the roof more firmly so it stays on in high winds. When the British Virgin Islands were blasted by Hurricane Irma in September, more than a third of the territory’s 7,000 homes were destroyed or sustained major damage, authorities say. Construction workers have flocked in from all corners of the Caribbean, working marathon shifts to rebuild. But materials - from windows to plywood and galvanised roofing – are only arriving in dribs and drabs from Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland, with delays of up to three months. The government is working on a new building code tailored to more extreme weather, and has set up a $15-million assistance programme to help lagging residents build back. Yet some in the relatively affluent British overseas territory, which has a population of just 32,000, are falling through the cracks. “It’s as if the hurricane happened yesterday,” said 55-year-old government employee Albert Wheatley, surveying the debris of his pink wooden house now overgrown with weeds. “And I don’t know when this will change.” One way to cut long waits for financial help after a disaster is to use social welfare systems to channel cash to recipients, said the World Bank’s Hallegatte. After top-strength Cyclone Winston hit Fiji in February 2016, the government used its three main social assistance programmes to deliver top-up payments, equivalent to three months of regular benefit, to help residents recover. But many small island states have “very little” in terms of social welfare, Hallegatte noted. Disasters can trigger the establishment of such schemes, however, and the World Bank is now seeing greater government interest, he said. “If there is one place on Earth where you really want to design your social protection system considering natural disasters ... that will be small islands,” he added. Resilience advisor Stewart Sarkozy-Banoczy said helping islands withstand the pressures they face requires a broad view, encompassing everything from nature and culture, to economics and the law. The Island Resilience Initiative he leads is working with Palau, the Marshall Islands and Fiji in the Pacific to track their progress towards the global development goals agreed by the 193 U.N. members in 2015, and decide on priority projects. The aim is to pave the way to an approach “much more angled on resilience and ‘precovery’ rather than constantly talking about recovery” after disasters, said Sarkozy-Banoczy. In the British Virgin Islands resort of Cane Garden Bay, the onslaught of Hurricane Irma made residents realise rapid development to cater for mass tourists disgorged by cruise ships had damaged their natural defences, putting them in harm’s way. They have since formed a volunteer committee to restore coral reefs, wetlands, mangroves and ponds that trap rainfall running off hillsides, to protect the village from future floods and storms and preserve its natural beauty. “You have to have a balance, or you lose what you love,” said local celebrity Quito Rymer, a reggae singer-songwriter now rebuilding his restaurant and hotel wrecked by the hurricane. “We have decided to take things in our hands.” Scientists say warmer air and warmer seas around the globe are increasing rainfall and wind speed in storms - and may have intensified the two top-strength hurricanes that battered the Caribbean last year, causing about 235 direct deaths and losses estimated at $130 billion. In its latest flagship report published in 2014, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pointed to rising sea levels as one of the most widely recognised climate change threats to low-lying coastal areas on islands and atolls. Combined with extreme events like storm surges, it identified “severe sea flood and erosion risks” for islands, with saltwater degrading groundwater supplies. Other risks from hotter seas include increased coral bleaching and reef damage, which could undermine coastal protection, fisheries and tourism, hurting island communities and costing jobs, scientists said in the report. Mindful of those risks, some islands in the Caribbean - the world’s most tourism-dependent region - are looking beyond beach holidays for fresh ways to entice tourists, from music festivals to fertility vacations and sports camps. Kate Brown, executive director of the Global Island Partnership (GLISPA), an alliance spearheaded by island leaders, believes many islanders are painfully aware of climate change and wider environmental threats. In Vanuatu, Palau and the Seychelles, for example, they are already acting to manage the risks - whether by introducing locally managed marine reserves or banning plastic bags and straws, she said. “You can go to a village virtually anywhere, and they understand that climate change is impacting them,” she added. “Heaps of changes are being made ... There has been a big shift away from waiting for other people to do things.” One area that has seen a “huge push”, said Brown, is action to clean up plastic waste, which is polluting the oceans to the tune of 8 million to 13 million tonnes per year. Eight million tonnes is like covering an area 34 times the size of New York’s Manhattan Island to ankle-depth, according to a study by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California-Santa Barbara. On the Indonesian island of Bali, tour guide Wayan Aksara joined, and later became chairman of Trash Hero Indonesia after getting a growing number of complaints from clients about rubbish on its once-pristine beaches. The community group, which has more than 20 chapters across Indonesia and about 12 on Bali, uses social media to organise weekly garbage collection events for volunteers. “There is a plastic problem in Bali ... We need time but we (have) started already,” Aksara told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Big things start from small things.” On Ibiza, a Balearic island off Spain’s east coast known for its clubbing scene, activists are pooling efforts to raise awareness of the growing plastic problem among its 144,000 residents and 3.25 million annual visitors. Love Ibiza Now, one of about 20 organisations in a “Plastic Free Ibiza” alliance started in late June, is promoting beach cleans, tote bags and biodegradable straws, for instance, and recruiting villa rental agencies, restaurants and top DJs to help sell an eco-friendly approach to tourists. “The thing that makes this do-able is the small size of the island,” said Sarah Drewer, who runs online communications for Love Ibiza Now. “The message has to be really simple and without judgment.” To manage scarce resources better and grow their economies cleanly, some islands are turning to smart technology and digital solutions. On drought-prone Mallorca, another of Spain’s four main Balearic islands, the small town of Esporles is experimenting with the “Internet of Things”, installing sensors to monitor water consumption and help detect leaks faster. It plans to extend its antenna-based network to check on air pollution and ease parking problems in busy summer months. “I think the data gives us very valuable information - to analyse it and understand the next steps we need to take,” said the town’s 30-year-old mayor, Maria Ramon Salas. Meanwhile, across Europe’s islands, authorities are aiming to adopt renewable energy technologies to shrink the expense of providing electricity and cut their climate-changing emissions. Energy costs on the continent’s 2,400 inhabited islands are between 100 and 400 percent higher than on the mainland, Christopher Jones, senior energy advisor at the European Commission, told an April conference on “smart islands”. But in the past five years, renewables - from solar plants with battery storage to offshore wind turbines - have become cheaper, and switching to them creates jobs, he added. “Today we have extraordinary opportunities,” he said. “We are at the start of an energy revolution on islands.” The tiny Greek island of Tilos, for example - which suffers regular power cuts - is betting on a new hybrid wind and solar power plant to meet its electricity needs. Until this summer, Tilos got all its electricity from a diesel power plant on the island of Kos, 69 km (43 miles) away - which struggles to meet demand in the peak tourist season. Mayor Maria Kamma hopes Tilos’ Europe-funded push for a self-sustaining clean energy supply will go beyond keeping hotel lights on, and ensure residents “have a very good standard of living”, allowing them to work there all year round, deterring young people from leaving and even enticing newcomers. Experts say a rise in renewable energy provision on islands also could help entrepreneurs like former development worker Joanna Edghill. She and her husband set up an electric car company on the Caribbean island of Barbados five years ago. Their business, called Megapower, has since sold 300 electric vehicles and set up 50 charging stations plus a handful of solar car-ports on the 34 km-long island - and is now expanding in the region. Faced with high fuel import costs, “the Caribbean is ripe for the electrification of transportation”, said Curtis Boodoo, an academic working on the issue with the CARICOM regional group of 15 countries. Sourcing an adequate supply of food can also send import bills sky-rocketing for islands in the Caribbean and beyond. In many places, residents and visitors get most of their food from shipping containers, said Ian McNeel, who co-founded Slow Food Barbados, which promotes local organic produce and runs school programmes to reconnect children with farming. Poor families in Barbados can spend up to three-quarters of their income on food, often buying low-quality imported products that contribute to bad diets driving obesity and diabetes, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). But some Caribbean farmers are working to reverse that trend by reviving traditional crops and sharing their knowledge, said Arno Boersma, manager of the Centre of Excellence for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. They include award-winning Belmont Estate, a 17th-century plantation on Grenada that produces organic cocoa and spices, and runs farm tours, a restaurant and a museum, he noted. Besides a shortage of home-grown food, many islands also suffer from insufficient drinking water - but the islanders of Kavaratti, capital of the Lakshadweep archipelago, a group of 36 islands in the Arabian Sea off India, are making their own. Once forced to use brackish water as the sea seeped into their limited groundwater supplies, they now have a locally developed desalination plant. “The best part is that we can close our eyes and drink a glass of water without worrying about falling ill,” resident Khadeeja Lavanakkal told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Buoyed by the project’s success, the Chennai-based National Institute of Ocean Technology set up two more desalination plants on Lakshadweep islands in 2011, and is now building six more, hoping to power them in future with the ocean’s energy. The common wisdom is that as environmental pressures worsen with climate change - making it harder to fish, farm and find clean water - some island populations might be forced to look for a new home. In the Pacific, that has raised ethical questions about whether larger countries like New Zealand should offer humanitarian visas to so-called “climate migrants” - a policy now under consideration. Some low-lying islands, such as Kiribati, have bought land elsewhere with a view to moving whole communities, while Choiseul Province in the Solomon Islands has plans to shift its capital to a safer location. But in other regions, where sea level rise is less of an existential threat, some islands are seeing migrants arrive, not leave - and governments are grappling with how to handle them. Trinidad and Tobago, for example, has received asylum requests from about 3,300 Venezuelans struggling to survive amid a political crisis and harsh recession at home, according to April data from the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). Ambulance driver Miguel Vegas, 39, is seeking refugee status for himself and his family. “We just want permission to work. We want to pay taxes,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The government of the twin-island nation is working on a new asylum system, as lawyers say the current process does not meet international obligations to protect asylum seekers. But the influx of Venezuelans is causing anxiety over whether there are enough jobs and social services to go round. On the Greek island of Tilos, which has welcomed about 30 Syrian refugees fleeing war back home, restaurants and other businesses offer the newcomers work in the tourist season. But there is little employment for the rest of the year. Abdulkader Hamo, a Kurdish refugee who left Syria with his family last summer, says his children are happy on Tilos, where they go to school and are no longer afraid of air strikes. Nonetheless, he is considering moving elsewhere. “There is no work here. It’s not great for a family,” he said. Anastasia Giannakopoulou, a social worker with Greek aid group Solidarity Now, said refugees face the same difficulties as the 550 local residents, “living in a small place”, with some seeking work on other islands in winter. The authorities are committed to creating job openings for everyone, such as a planned cheese factory using milk from island goats that will employ 15 people, including six refugees. “This is a really sustainable and profitable business which can withstand the passing of time, and grow by adding more refugees in future,” said Tilos’ Mayor Kamma. While there is no shortage of solutions to island problems, not all are moving at the same speed, creating a hunger for more knowledge and finance, experts say. “We need to figure out how to give a hand up to those that are going to struggle,” said GLISPA’s Brown. Many island treasuries, especially in the Caribbean, are massively indebted, and lack the cash to build back better after disasters or pursue a more sustainable economic model. Some Caribbean islands are selling citizenship and passports to foreigners for chunky donations or investments. “It’s bringing in an enormous amount of money, and it’s helping us to reduce our debt burden in a very serious way,” said Keith Mitchell, Grenada’s prime minister. After the 2017 hurricanes, Saint Kitts and Nevis offered citizenship for a family of four in return for a $150,000 payment to a relief fund. Those involved say vigorous vetting eliminates applicants with criminal backgrounds, on international watch lists or involved in money laundering. But analysts say security risks remain and tax loopholes are easily exploited. Overall, islands face big hurdles in attracting donor funds and private investment, noted the World Bank’s Hallegatte. Their governments often lack the staff to prepare and sell projects to potential backers. The investment sought is often too small to appeal, and the cost of making deals and doing business is very high due to remote locations, he added. But international development banks can help by working with islands to group diverse resilience projects and market them to investors as green bonds, Hallegatte said. Regional insurance pools are also helping island states get quick cash to kick-start recovery after a disaster - although they have attracted more governments in the Caribbean than the Pacific so far. Under one innovative financing model, eight Caribbean island states have set up national trust funds to protect biodiversity and manage natural resources wisely - and are putting in their own cash to match donor contributions, noted GLISPA’s Brown. Yet despite “exciting” developments, there remains a gap in securing investment on the scale required, she added. ""There's a huge amount of resources needed for islands to get to where they want to be, and also just to become more resilient to all the changes that are going on,"" she said.

BEIJING, July 23 (Reuters) - Chinese independent refiner Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical Group and a chemical trader have filed for joint bankruptcy, according to a court filing, the latest sign of deepening pain for the sector amid high oil prices and greater regulatory scrutiny. The companies registered their joint bankruptcy at a court in the county of Juxian in Shandong province on July 16, according to a court filing on a website run by China’s Supreme Court. “The two companies, which share highly similar business scope, company structure, finance and assets, own assets that are smaller than their debts and are unable to service their loans, are applying for joint bankruptcy,” the local court filing said. Smaller independent or “teapot” refiners have enjoyed strong growth in recent years as China liberalised oil imports to increase competition in a sector dominated by state-owned giants, but their expansion has been curbed by tighter conditions. Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical, established in 2006, is the first teapot refiner to file for bankruptcy in recent years. Its crude oil distillation unit with capacity of around 70,000 barrels per day has been shut since May. The other company, Shandong Hongju New Energy Co, is a fuel and chemicals dealer based in the same county and was set up in 2013. A person who answered the phone at Haiyou said she was not able to comment. Calls to the company president’s office went unanswered. Chinese soybean crusher Shandong Sunrise Group, which used to control Haiyou, also filed for bankruptcy on Friday after failing to repay its debts. Juxian Public Transport Development Co Ltd and the county’s assets regulator, the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) each own 30 percent of Haiyou, according to an online portal run by the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC).

2018-07-23,"* Bank of Japan easing report sends bond yields up * European shares wilt as heavy earnings week kicks off * U.S. dollar falls to two-week low * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Graphic: Japanese bond yields jump to 6-month high reut.rs/2LgVPjJ By Helen Reid LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Signs that the Bank of Japan could scale back its monetary stimulus faster than expected sent tremors through bond markets on Monday, while European stocks slid as threats of further U.S. tariffs on China drained risk appetite. Europe’s bond yields climbed after a Reuters report that the BoJ was discussing modifying its huge easing programme sent Japan’s 10-year bond yield to a six-month high. The report rekindled anxieties about global monetary policy easing and piled further pressure on investors already struggling to navigate rising protectionism and tense geopolitics. The yield on Europe’s benchmark bond, the German 10-year Bund, hit a one-month high of 0.39 percent while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also hit their highest in a month at 2.90 percent. The yen climbed to two-week highs against the dollar and was last up 0.4 percent at 110.98 per dollar. “It’s all that concern investors have about the move from global quantitative easing to global quantitative tightening. That fear gets stoked when you have reports such as this,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management. “The ECB meeting this week will be more in focus now that we’ve had this concern about Japan.” The dollar index meanwhile languished at two-week lows after U.S. President Trump criticised the Federal Reserve’s tightening policy and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. “We see the latest news on trade policy as pointing to continued high risk of escalation between the U.S. and China, and a renewed focus of the Trump Administration on currency matters,” said Goldman Sachs analysts. Trump’s comments against Fed rate hikes also helped steepen the Treasury yield curve. Trump’s new threats to slap duties on all U.S. imports from China triggered sell-offs across stock markets, though good corporate earnings kept a lid on losses. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.1 percent and the MSCI all-country world index declined just 0.02 percent. Europe’s STOXX 600 fell 0.3 percent as investors braced for a packed week of corporate earnings in Europe and a meeting between European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker and Trump to discuss threatened auto tariffs which could damage carmakers. Goldman Sachs analysts said auto tariffs, if they came to pass, would likely cause weakness in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, possibly also affecting the euro, pound, yen, and Korean won as investors priced in a hit to the economy. “The global economy is still OK, but the risk is now very high, and if trade policies don’t make a U-turn very soon, we’ll see a measurable impact on growth already next year,” said UniCredit chief economist Erik Nielsen. The euro, which has been gaining from dollar weakness, climbed for a third straight day to a two-week top of $1.1750. It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.135. Concerns about fuel demand dented oil prices after finance ministers and central bank governors at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires said the risks to global economic growth have increased due to trade and geopolitical tensions. U.S. crude fell slightly to $68.24 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent crude rose 16 cents to $73.23. Copper, among the most sensitive to trade tensions, hovered above a one-year low hit last week, trading at $6,151 a tonne. Copper fell for the sixth week in a row last week.

2018-07-23,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 23 (Reuters) - Crude oil isn’t formally part of the trade dispute between the United States and China, but it may well be the first major flow to be disrupted significantly by the rising tensions. One of the successes in the efforts to lower the trade surplus enjoyed by China over the United States was exports of crude, a result of the shale oil boom that has taken the U.S. to within a whisker of being the world’s top oil producer. Crude exports from the United States to China have surged this year, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts showing China imported 60.2 million barrels, or about 333,000 barrels per day (bpd), of U.S. oil in the first half of the year. This was up from just 24.9 million barrels, or 138,000 bpd, over the same period last year, according to the data. Much of the gain so far this year has been in recent months, with the April to July period being four of the five strongest months on record, and January this year being the other. July is set to be the second-strongest month for Chinese imports of U.S. crude, with the data pointing to the arrival of 12.32 million barrels, or about 397,000 bpd. Expected shipments in August appear to be heading substantially lower, however, with only 9.58 million barrels, or about 309,000 bpd, expected to arrive at Chinese ports. While these numbers may still change, they are unlikely to shift much, given the typical six-week journey between U.S. ports in the Gulf of Mexico and China. This means all U.S. cargoes slated to arrive in China in August should have already left. It also means most cargoes likely to arrive in September would also have departed the United States, but so far no such fixtures are showing. This doesn’t mean there will be zero U.S. crude exports arriving China in September, but it does raise the possibility that there will be a sharp decline. To put it in perspective, of the 10 U.S. cargoes unloaded in China in June, nine left U.S. ports in April. Given there is only one week left of July and no cargoes have yet left the U.S. for arrival in China in September, it seems risks are rising that U.S. oil shipments to China are falling off a cliff. This may add to the existing trade tensions between China and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made it clear he wants a lower trade deficit with China. If crude oil exports do plummet, though, the trade deficit is likely headed higher, notwithstanding tariffs already placed on some Chinese exports by the Trump administration. While this sounds like a poor outcome for U.S. crude exporters, there is evidence suggesting other importers in North Asia are taking up cargoes no longer being bought by China. South Korea may import a record amount of U.S. crude in September, with vessel-tracking data pointing to the arrival of 5.94 million barrels, or about 198,000 bpd. Japan may bring in 2.6 million barrels in September, or about 86,600 bpd, the highest since January this year. Taiwan’s imports from the United States are slated at 5.89 million bpd for August, or about 196,300 bpd, which would be the highest on record. While additional imports from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are probably insufficient to make up for the loss of Chinese purchases, they will provide some comfort to U.S. oil exporters. But they are also unlikely to do anything to ease the trade tensions between the Trump administration and China. The looming slump in China’s purchases of U.S. crude may be taken as a sign that Beijing is prepared to fight back against Trump, even if the tactics are somewhat different. Rather than impose tariffs, China may simply persuade its state-owned refiners to move away from buying U.S. crude. This means pain can be inflicted on the United States without needing to impose tariffs or resorting to the bombastic rhetoric that typifies the Trump administration.

2018-07-23,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LhKO1S By John Kemp LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have slashed bullish long positions in petroleum at the fastest rate in more than a year, as the gentle profit-taking in previous weeks turned into a rush for the exit. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 178 million barrels in the week to July 17. Net long positions were reduced by the third-largest number of barrels on record, according to an analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges going back to the first quarter of 2013. The net long position in petroleum was cut below 1 billion barrels for the first time since the middle of September 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2LhKO1S). The reduction was concentrated on the long side of the market, where positions were slashed by 170 million barrels, as managers took profits after the year-long rally in oil prices. Short positions rose by just 8 million barrels and remain close to multi-year lows, confirming the shift in net positioning is being driven by profit-taking rather than any newfound bearishness. Long liquidation was concentrated in Brent, with net long positions in the North Sea benchmark cut by 95 million barrels, the largest one-week reduction since the series began in 2013. But portfolio managers also cut net long positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-34 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-17 million barrels) and European gasoil (-25 million barrels). Hedge fund managers hold most of their positions in futures and options with a relatively short duration to expiry since these tend to offer the most liquidity, so the sell-off has hit near-dated contracts especially hard. Brent liquidation has therefore crushed the calendar spreads, with contracts nearest to expiry now trading in contango, and the whole of the first six months in a backwardation of less than 40 cents per barrel. The accelerating sell-off in petroleum futures and options is not entirely surprising and conforms to a common pattern in financial markets. The sharpest liquidation and price falls come not straight after prices peak, but when prices have been under gentle pressure for some time, and the initial trickle of selling finally turns into a torrent. Benchmark Brent prices have repeatedly failed to break up through the peak of just over $80 per barrel set in May. Fund managers are still essentially bullish towards the outlook for oil prices, but the extremely stretched positioning during the first quarter has been partially corrected. Portfolio managers hold more than eight bullish long positions for every short bearish position in the petroleum complex, but the ratio is down from almost 14:1 in the middle of April. In Brent, the ratio of hedge fund longs to shorts is down to 8:1, from 20:1 in late April; in European gasoil, the ratio is down to 13:1, from 129:1 in late May. For most market analysts and traders, the oil market outlook remains fundamentally tight, with strong growth in consumption, while production continues to be disrupted by problems in Venezuela and Libya. Pipeline capacity shortages in the United States may limit further growth in production from the prolific Permian Basin later in 2018 and early 2019. On top of all this, U.S. sanctions on Iran threaten to remove millions more barrels from the market from the start of November, though how many remains unclear. But the sharp rise in output and exports from Saudi Arabia in June and July has increased the availability of crude in the near term, contributing to the sell-off in Brent calendar spreads. And there are growing concerns about the combined impact of high oil prices, a strengthening dollar and trade tensions on the health of the global economy and oil consumption in the rest of 2018 and 2019. In the circumstances, many fund managers have chosen to reduce their long exposure to oil, without choosing to go short (yet) in a classic long liquidation cycle.

2018-07-23,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An explosion of hot gas at a boiler at NTPC’s Unchahar power plant last year that killed 45 workers was the result of an “error in judgement” by some of the plant’s most experienced operators, according to an internal report on the state-run electricity producer’s biggest disaster. The plant’s Head of Operation, Head of Ash Handling Maintenance and Head of Boiler Maintenance - each with 28 years of experience - made a decision not to shut down a 500-megawatt (MW) boiler at Unchahar to clear a buildup of ash prior to an overpressurisation in the unit that caused the gas release, said a summary of the report reviewed by Reuters. “The shut down of the boiler much before the incident would have been prudent,” the report, prepared by an internal committee of NTPC, said. It was not clear from the summary when the report was submitted. The three experienced engineers died in the accident. Reuters was unable to verify the claims made in the report. The Nov. 1 accident at the 1,550-megawatt coal-fired power station in Unchahar in northern India killed 45 people and left survivors with severe burns.  NTPC is the country’s top power producer and accidents have been rare at its facilities. The plant operators were aware of an ash buildup in the Unit-6 boiler and had reduced the unit’s load to 300 MW while workers cleared the ash from the furnace bottom in the hours leading up the accident, the report said. The ash buildup, however, caused a boiler tube carrying steam to leak, leading to a high pressure buildup and subsequent burning of flammable substances, the report said. That led to a build up of steam pressure in the unit that caused it to “trip”, or involuntarily shut down, following which hot ash and gases were released at high speeds that killed and injured the workers, according to the summary.  NTPC declined to release the full report or comment on the lapses mentioned in it. The company has revised its safety policy and is regularly conducting safety audits and mock drills, a spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters. A spokesman for Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd which made the boiler tubes at Unchahar did not respond to repeated calls and emails.  Two NTPC officials, who did not want to be named citing government policy, said the company did not have the equipment to measure the amount of ash buildup in its plants and relied on physical inspection. NTPC has now begun talks with BHEL to install a system to measure and monitor ash content online, the officials said.

2018-07-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - More than half of Germans think Europe can defend itself without military backing from the United States, a poll showed on Monday, less than two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said he could withdraw support. Only 37 percent of respondents said they believed Europe depended on U.S. military help, the Forsa poll showed. The survey found no significant difference between eastern German regions and western areas, which have stronger historical ties to the United States. In the east, 60 percent thought Europe did not need Washington, and in the west, 55 percent. Trump gave an ultimatum to European allies on July 12, warning a NATO summit the United States could withdraw its support if Europe did not share more of what he called an unfair burden on U.S. taxpayers in funding the alliance. In a rebuke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he also called Germany a “captive” of Moscow because, he said, Berlin supported a Baltic Sea gas pipeline from Russia. About 84 percent of respondents said Trump’s comments about Russia controlling Germany were “completely absurd”, according to the poll which surveyed 1,004 Germans. Even more - 92 percent - said they suspected that Trump’s motive for making the comments was primarily to promote the sale of U.S. liquefied gas in Europe and Germany.  Two thirds said they supported the construction of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea pipeline because it would help provide Germany with a more reliable supply of natural gas.

2018-07-23,"HANOI (Reuters) - A court in Vietnam on Monday jailed 10 people for terms ranging from two to 3-1/2 years after they were arrested in last month’s nationwide protests against new economic zones, state media said. Despite sweeping reforms, communist-ruled Vietnam tolerates little dissent and arrested the 10 at protests sparked by fears that investors from China would dominate land leases for up to 99 years being offered for development of the economic zones. The official Voice of Vietnam Radio said a people’s court in the central province of Binh Thuan convicted the offenders, aged between 18 and 43, of “causing public disorder”. They were seen hurling bricks and stones at police, besides damaging several police vehicles and causing traffic jams during a June 10 protest, it cited the indictment as saying.  Their lawyers were not immediately available for comment. Monday’s trial came days after a court in Ho Chi Minh City ordered the release and deportation of an American man of Vietnamese descent accused of the same charge. William Anh Nguyen, 32, detained in a protest in Vietnam’s economic hub, had been in police custody until his release. Police arrested dozens of people during the June protests, which spanned several cities and turned violent in Binh Thuan.

2018-07-23,"* Threats of further U.S.-China tariffs hit European shares * Heavy earnings week kicks off on Europe * U.S. dollar recovers from two-week low * Graphic: Japanese bond yields jump to 6-month high reut.rs/2LgVPjJ By Helen Reid LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Signs that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) might scale back its monetary stimulus faster than expected sent tremors through bond markets on Monday, while European stocks slipped as threats of further U.S. tariffs on China drained risk appetite. Europe’s bond yields climbed after a Reuters report that the BoJ was discussing modifying its huge easing programme sent Japan’s 10-year bond yield to a six-month high. The report rekindled anxieties about monetary stimulus easing around the world and piled further pressure on investors already struggling to navigate rising protectionism. The yield on Europe’s benchmark bond, the German 10-year Bund, hit a one-month high of 0.39 percent and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also hit their highest in a month at 2.90 percent. The yen climbed to two-week highs against the dollar and was last up 0.2 percent at 111.14 per dollar. “It’s all that concern investors have about the move from global quantitative easing to global quantitative tightening. That fear gets stoked when you have reports such as this,” Psigma Investment Management’s head of investment strategy, Rory McPherson. “The ECB meeting this week will be more in focus now that we’ve had this concern about Japan.” The dollar index meanwhile bounced back, up 0.1 percent from two-week lows hit after U.S. President Trump criticised the Federal Reserve’s tightening policy and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. “We see the latest news on trade policy as pointing to continued high risk of escalation between the U.S. and China, and a renewed focus of the Trump Administration on currency matters,” Goldman Sachs analysts said. Beijing said it has no intention of devaluing the yuan to help exports. Trump’s comments about rates also helped the Treasury yield curve reach its steepest in three weeks. The yield curve’s flattening has been seen by some as a sign of an impending recession. The U.S. president’s new threats to slap duties on all $500 billion of U.S. imports from China triggered sell-offs across stock markets, though good earnings kept a lid on losses. The MSCI all-country world index declined just 0.1 percent while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent. Europe’s STOXX 600 fell 0.2 percent by 1000 GMT as investors braced for a packed earnings week and a meeting between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Trump to discuss threatened auto tariffs which could damage carmakers. “The pattern of Trump’s meetings has generally been more conciliatory when he meets in person. It could actually be good for autos,” Psigma’s McPherson said. Europe’s autos sector fell 0.6 percent, hitting a 2-1/2 week low. The index is down 9 percent this year and is among the worst performing European sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts said auto tariffs, if they came to pass, were likely to cause weakness in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, possibly also affecting the euro, pound, yen, and Korean won as investors priced in a hit to the economy. “The global economy is still okay, but the risk is now very high, and if trade policies don’t make a U-turn very soon, we’ll see a measurable impact on growth already next year,” UniCredit chief economist Erik Nielsen said. A rally in the euro, which has been gaining from dollar weakness, fizzled out. The single currency was down 0.2 percent at $1.1691 by 1000 GMT. The euro’s weakening over the past few months is likely to boost earnings for euro zone exporters, analysts say. Crude prices recovered from a fall as concerns over production losses eclipsed worries about fuel demand. U.S. crude rose 0.6 percent to $68.64 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent crude rose 1 percent to $73.77 a barrel. Copper, among the most sensitive to trade tensions, rose 0.2 percent from a one-year low hit last week, trading at $6,160 a tonne, having declined for the sixth week in a row last week. Gold prices declined 0.2 percent to $1,229.1 an ounce . Emerging market equities traded down 0.1 percent as the dollar recovered. Strength in the greenback has driven selling in EM stocks this year as the currency puts pressure on emerging economies with large dollar-denominated debt piles. Reporting by Helen Reid

2018-07-23,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A private oil refiner and an agricultural processor in China’s Shandong province have filed for bankruptcy, as tightening credit and weakening market conditions exact a toll on one of China’s industrial engines. While the companies are relatively small compared with state-controlled companies, they represent deeper lingering problems faced by heavy industry across swathes of China. Shandong Sunrise Group, a soybean crusher, registered for bankruptcy last week after failing to repay its debts, while Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical Group, an independent refiner, filed for joint bankruptcy with Shandong Hongju New Energy Co, a chemical trader. Both Haiyou and Hongju were previously controlled by Sunrise. Haiyou is now majority owned by the local government, according to local government documents. The company is headquartered in Rizhao, in the eastern province of Shandong. The applications were made in a court in Juxian county in Shandong on July 16, according to filings posted on a website run by China’s Supreme Court on Friday. Few other details were available about the cause of the companies’ problems. The companies did not respond to requests for comment. But their financial plight underscores deepening financial pain among small teapot refiners and crushers alike. Many operators in both sectors are losing cash as a domestic glut of product hurts margins. It also highlights concerns about growing debt and tightening credit for small businesses as Beijing seeks to crack down on financial risks across its economy.  In Shandong, China’s third largest province by gross domestic product, is an industrial and agricultural hub, home to farms, refiners and soybean crushers. The non-performing loan ratio of its banking sector stood at 2.64 percent at end-March, compared with 1.75 percent nationwide. Shandong Sunrise, which is run by Shao Zhongyi, China's 230th richest man according to Forbes' 2016 rich list and his brother, accounted for an estimated 12 percent of China's soybean imports in 2014, although it has shrunk in size in recent years, according to traders. reut.rs/2uRwCkQ Its financial problems are due to falling demand for animal feed after pig farmers in China, the world’s biggest pork consumer, began culling their herds because of declining meat prices. Crushing companies reduce soybean seeds to both oil and meal. Crushers in Shandong are losing almost 50 yuan ($7.40) per ton of soybeans they process, according to Shanghai JC Intelligence. China’s vast farm sector is also facing uncertainty as Washington’s trade dispute with Beijing threatens to curb supplies of critical farm goods, including soybeans, and inflate costs. Haiyou is the first bankruptcy by a teapot refinery since China liberalized oil imports in 2015 to increase competition in a sector dominated by state-owned giants. Many of China’s independent refiners, which buy a fifth of imported crude, are losing cash due to the resurgent oil price, tough new taxes and shrinking diesel demand. “It’s the tip of the iceberg,” said Harry Liu, oil consultant with IHS Markit. “We may see more smaller plants, especially those without import quotas, fold, as their margins are squeezed harder.”  He said that the change was a sign that a tax policy begun by Beijing in March was having “a bigger blow on some of the teapots than we expected”.  Beijing enacted new rules in March to enforce collection of a $38 per barrel gasoline consumption tax and a $29 per barrel tax on diesel, a response to the alleged use of illicit fuel invoices by many of the teapots to evade the taxes.

2018-07-23,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Crude oil isn’t formally part of the trade dispute between the United States and China, but it may well be the first major flow to be disrupted significantly by the rising tensions. One of the successes in the efforts to lower the trade surplus enjoyed by China over the United States was exports of crude, a result of the shale oil boom that has taken the U.S. to within a whisker of being the world’s top oil producer. Crude exports from the United States to China have surged this year, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts showing China imported 60.2 million barrels, or about 333,000 barrels per day (bpd), of U.S. oil in the first half of the year. This was up from just 24.9 million barrels, or 138,000 bpd, over the same period last year, according to the data. Much of the gain so far this year has been in recent months, with the April to July period being four of the five strongest months on record, and January this year being the other. July is set to be the second-strongest month for Chinese imports of U.S. crude, with the data pointing to the arrival of 12.32 million barrels, or about 397,000 bpd. Expected shipments in August appear to be heading substantially lower, however, with only 9.58 million barrels, or about 309,000 bpd, expected to arrive at Chinese ports. While these numbers may still change, they are unlikely to shift much, given the typical six-week journey between U.S. ports in the Gulf of Mexico and China. This means all U.S. cargoes slated to arrive in China in August should have already left. It also means most cargoes likely to arrive in September would also have departed the United States, but so far no such fixtures are showing. This doesn’t mean there will be zero U.S. crude exports arriving China in September, but it does raise the possibility that there will be a sharp decline. To put it in perspective, of the 10 U.S. cargoes unloaded in China in June, nine left U.S. ports in April. Given there is only one week left of July and no cargoes have yet left the U.S. for arrival in China in September, it seems risks are rising that U.S. oil shipments to China are falling off a cliff. This may add to the existing trade tensions between China and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made it clear he wants a lower trade deficit with China. If crude oil exports do plummet, though, the trade deficit is likely headed higher, notwithstanding tariffs already placed on some Chinese exports by the Trump administration. While this sounds like a poor outcome for U.S. crude exporters, there is evidence suggesting other importers in North Asia are taking up cargoes no longer being bought by China. South Korea may import a record amount of U.S. crude in September, with vessel-tracking data pointing to the arrival of 5.94 million barrels, or about 198,000 bpd. Japan may bring in 2.6 million barrels in September, or about 86,600 bpd, the highest since January this year. Taiwan’s imports from the United States are slated at 5.89 million bpd for August, or about 196,300 bpd, which would be the highest on record. While additional imports from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are probably insufficient to make up for the loss of Chinese purchases, they will provide some comfort to U.S. oil exporters. But they are also unlikely to do anything to ease the trade tensions between the Trump administration and China. The looming slump in China’s purchases of U.S. crude may be taken as a sign that Beijing is prepared to fight back against Trump, even if the tactics are somewhat different. Rather than impose tariffs, China may simply persuade its state-owned refiners to move away from buying U.S. crude. This means pain can be inflicted on the United States without needing to impose tariffs or resorting to the bombastic rhetoric that typifies the Trump administration. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-crude-china/column-china-imports-of-u-s-crude-to-slump-rest-of-north-asia-steps-up-russell-idUKL4N1UJ1PH,23 Jul 2018,"Crude oil isn't

2018-07-23,"(Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched a rhetorical assault on Iran’s leaders on Sunday, comparing them to a “mafia” and promising unspecified backing for Iranians unhappy with their government. Pompeo, in a California speech to a largely Iranian-American audience, dismissed Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated a nuclear deal with the United States and five other countries, as “merely polished front men for the ayatollahs’ international con artistry.” U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew in May from the 2015 nuclear accord designed to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran has said its nuclear work is just for electricity generation and other peaceful projects. Iran “is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government,” Pompeo said, citing what he called Iranian leaders’ vast wealth and corruption. Pompeo’s speech was the latest step in a communications offensive launched by the Trump administration that is meant to foment unrest in Iran and help pressure its government to end its nuclear programme and support of militant groups, U.S. officials familiar with the matter said. The offensive is meant to work in concert with severe economic sanctions that Washington plans to reimpose in the coming months, including on Tehran’s oil exports, its principal revenue generator. The United States will work with countries that import Iranian oil “to get imports as close to zero as possible” by Nov. 4, Pompeo said. Rouhani cautioned Trump on Sunday about pursuing hostile policies against Tehran, saying: “War with Iran is the mother of all wars.” But he did not rule out peace between the two countries, which have been at odds since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “You are not in a position to incite the Iranian nation  against Iran’s security and interests,” Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to reports of efforts by Washington to destabilise Iran’s Islamic government. Trump responded to Rouhani in a tweet late on Sunday, saying: “NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!”  ‘LONG-IGNORED VOICE OF PEOPLE’ Publicly, the Trump administration says its policy with Iran is not “regime change,” but to change Tehran’s behaviour so it stops nuclear and missile work, support for proxies in the Middle East and backing of militant groups. “While it is ultimately up to the Iranian people to determine the direction of their country, the United States ... will support the long-ignored voice of the Iranian people,” Pompeo said. Pompeo spoke at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, to a packed house of about 1,000 people. He received frequent applause, although one audience member heckled him over the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Several dozen protesters lined the route to the site, including one group that distributed fliers opposing both Iran’s current government and any U.S. intervention in Iran. Pompeo said senior Iranian leaders had benefited from embezzlement, sweetheart deals and other ill-gotten gains. Iran’s ayatollahs, he said, were “hypocritical holy men” who “seem more concerned with riches than religion.” Pompeo said the U.S. government broadcasting agency was launching a 24/7 Farsi-language channel on TV, radio, digital and social media platforms. The U.S. government also is taking steps to help Iranians get around internet censorship, he said.

2018-07-23,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Life Insurance Co [NPNLI.UL] will no longer extend loans for, or invest in, coal-fired power plants due to environmental concerns, an official at Japan’s biggest life insurer said, in the first such move by a major Japanese institutional investor. Japanese banks in recent months have tightened lending criteria for coal power, indicating a global divestment of fossil-fuel assets that has cut $6 trillion worth of investment has reached the world’s third-biggest economy. “We have decided to stop new investment and lending to coal-fired power projects at home and overseas,” Yusuke Takaishi, deputy general manager at Nippon Life’s finance and investment planning department, told Reuters in an interview. Exceptions would be where a power station employs technology that captures the environmentally harmful carbon dioxide emitted by burning coal and stores it underground, an expensive option used in only a few locations worldwide. Nippon Life has assets of over 74 trillion yen ($667 billion) so its action may influence other Japanese investors, analysts said. Burning coal to generate power produces large quantities of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. An international agreement reached in Paris in 2015 committed signatories to cutting fossil fuel use. Climate change is the cause of more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heat waves, as average global temperatures reach record highs, ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise. “There are discussions among institutional investors, mainly those in Europe and the U.S., on how to deal with the issue of climate change and we are part of those discussions,” Takaishi said. “Our decision on coal power is just one result of our ongoing discussions on climate change and we are not just considering coal,” he said, without elaborating. He declined to disclose how much Nippon Life had invested in coal. Anti-fossil fuel campaign group 350.org calculates Nippon Life advanced $82 million in loans to domestic coal plant builders from 2011 through 2016. In 2011, a nuclear meltdown prompted the closure of all nuclear power plants and increased emphasis on fossil fuels. The insurer also has $1.3 billion invested in the bonds and shares of coal plant builders, according to research commissioned by urgewald, a German non-profit organization that campaigns against environmental destruction. The coal plant builders include utilities such as Tokyo Electric Power Co and trading houses such as Marubeni Corp.  Japan is one of the few industrialized countries that heavily promotes coal power both at home and abroad, including technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Its banks are among the biggest financiers of coal-related projects globally.     However, that appears to be changing. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd [SUMI.UL] told Reuters it would stop providing project finance for new coal-fired power stations “as a basic rule”. Exceptions would be evaluated “cautiously,” it said. The bank lent $536 million to coal power plant project finance from 2014 through 2017, according to Thomson Reuters SDC Platinum data. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc, Japan’s third-biggest bank by assets, said in May it would tighten criteria on lending for coal power. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc also said in May it would make decisions on financing based on the “recognition of both the local and the international circumstances surrounding coal-fired power generation”.

The insurer also has $1.3 billion invested in the bonds and shares of coal plant builders, according to research commissioned by urgewald, a German non-profit organisation that campaigns against environmental destruction. The coal plant builders include utilities such as Tokyo Electric Power Co and trading houses such as Marubeni Corp. Japan is one of the few industrialised countries that heavily promotes coal power both at home and abroad, including technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Its banks are among the biggest financiers of coal-related projects globally. However, that appears to be changing. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd told Reuters it would stop providing project finance for new coal-fired power stations “as a basic rule”. Exceptions would be evaluated “cautiously,” it said. The bank lent $536 million to coal power plant project finance from 2014 through 2017, according to Thomson Reuters SDC Platinum data. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc, Japan’s third-biggest bank by assets, said in May it would tighten criteria on lending for coal power. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc also said in May it would make decisions on financing based on the “recognition of both the local and the international circumstances surrounding coal-fired power generation”.

2018-07-23,"* Dollar eases after Trump complains about greenback strength * Trump ratchets up protectionist rhetoric, hits stocks * Investors await Trump-Juncker trade talks later this week By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, July 23 (Reuters) - Asian shares dipped on Monday on fears of more protectionist measures from the United States while the dollar declined against major currencies after U.S. President Donald Trump criticised the Federal Reserve’s tightening policy. Trump, on Friday, lamented the recent strength of the U.S. dollar and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. The dollar index is so far up 2.4 percent this year led largely by Fed rate rises, strong macro-economic data and nervousness about a full-blown tariff war. It was last down 0.2 percent at 94.27, the lowest in more than two weeks. Trump’s remarks on Friday, coupled with new threats to slap duties on all U.S. imports from China, triggered sell-offs in Wall Street and European stocks on Friday, despite good corporate earnings. Asian stocks took Wall Street’s cue on Monday with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan falling 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stumbled 1.4 percent, Australian shares and South Korea’s KOSPI index fell 0.9 percent each. Chinese shares also opened lower but quickly reversed their losses, with both the blue-chip index and Shanghai’s SSE Composite up a touch. “Although U.S. equities edged lower on Friday and the yen strengthened, most cross-asset moves are supportive of APAC equities - particularly dollar weakness, strength in emerging markets FX, and a dramatic bear steepening of global yield curves. Commodities are also mostly trading higher,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note to clients. Trump’s comments against Fed rate hikes helped steepen the Treasury yield curve. Also playing a role in the global tick-up in yields was a Reuters report that the Bank of Japan was in unusually active discussions to modify its massive easing programme. The BOJ, in turn, offered to buy an unlimited amount of five- to- 10-year Japanese government bonds on Monday. Benchmark 10-year JGB futures, which had started lower on Monday, pared some of their losses on the announcement. The Reuters report and the dollar’s weakness together added to the yen’s strength, which was last up 0.5 percent at 110.91 per dollar. “Trade tensions remain a risk, but with an extended period until implementation (of the tariffs) and the next round of escalation, APAC equities are unlikely to respond much to Trump repeating threats already known,” JPMorgan added. Investors are now looking ahead to an important meeting between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. “Trade tensions are likely to remain in the headlines as Juncker meets President Trump in Washington to discuss potential U.S. tariffs on European autos,” asset manager Insight Investment, which is owned by BNY Mellon, said in a note. “It’s probably a little too early for the indirect impact of the U.S.-China trade issue to be showing up in the data. Nonetheless, the trade numbers that were released for Singapore and Japan were worse than expected.” In Singapore, for example, exports rose 1.1 percent in the year to June compared with expectations of a 7.6 percent increase, while electronic exports slipped 7.9 percent. Elsewhere, the euro climbed for a third straight day to a two-week top of $1.1746. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.1741. In commodities, oil prices were held back by concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions and increased supply. U.S. crude was last off 16 cents at $68.1 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent eased 17 cents to $72.90. Spot gold was barely changed at $1,231.8 an ounce.

2018-07-23,"(Adds comment from court filing in paragraph 3 and detail about ownership in last two paragraphs.) BEIJING, July 23 (Reuters) - Chinese independent refiner Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical Group and a chemical trader have filed for joint bankruptcy, according to a court filing, the latest sign of deepening pain for the sector amid high oil prices and greater regulatory scrutiny. The companies registered their joint bankruptcy at a court in the county of Juxian in Shandong province on July 16, according to a court filing on a website run by China’s Supreme Court. “The two companies, which share highly similar business scope, company structure, finance and assets, own assets that are smaller than their debts and are unable to service their loans, are applying for joint bankruptcy,” the local court filing said. Smaller independent or “teapot” refiners have enjoyed strong growth in recent years as China liberalised oil imports to increase competition in a sector dominated by state-owned giants, but their expansion has been curbed by tighter conditions. Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical, established in 2006, is the first teapot refiner to file for bankruptcy in recent years. Its crude oil distillation unit with capacity of around 70,000 barrels per day has been shut since May. The other company, Shandong Hongju New Energy Co, is a fuel and chemicals dealer based in the same county and was set up in 2013. A person who answered the phone at Haiyou said she was not able to comment. Calls to the company president’s office went unanswered. Chinese soybean crusher Shandong Sunrise Group, which used to control Haiyou, also filed for bankruptcy on Friday after failing to repay its debts. Juxian Public Transport Development Co Ltd and the county’s assets regulator, the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) each own 30 percent of Haiyou, according to an online portal run by the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC). Four individuals own the remaining 40 percent, according to SAIC.

2018-07-23,"* Bank of Japan easing report sends bond yields up * European shares wilt as heavy earnings week kicks off * U.S. dollar falls to two-week low * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Graphic: Japanese bond yields jump to 6-month high reut.rs/2LgVPjJ By Helen Reid LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Signs that the Bank of Japan could scale back its monetary stimulus faster than expected sent tremors through bond markets on Monday, while European stocks slid as threats of further U.S. tariffs on China drained risk appetite. Europe’s bond yields climbed after a Reuters report that the BoJ was discussing modifying its huge easing programme sent Japan’s 10-year bond yield to a six-month high. The report rekindled anxieties about global monetary policy easing and piled further pressure on investors already struggling to navigate rising protectionism and tense geopolitics. The yield on Europe’s benchmark bond, the German 10-year Bund, hit a one-month high of 0.39 percent while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also hit their highest in a month at 2.90 percent. The yen climbed to two-week highs against the dollar and was last up 0.4 percent at 110.98 per dollar. “It’s all that concern investors have about the move from global quantitative easing to global quantitative tightening. That fear gets stoked when you have reports such as this,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management. “The ECB meeting this week will be more in focus now that we’ve had this concern about Japan.” The dollar index meanwhile languished at two-week lows after U.S. President Trump criticised the Federal Reserve’s tightening policy and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. “We see the latest news on trade policy as pointing to continued high risk of escalation between the U.S. and China, and a renewed focus of the Trump Administration on currency matters,” said Goldman Sachs analysts. Trump’s comments against Fed rate hikes also helped steepen the Treasury yield curve. Trump’s new threats to slap duties on all U.S. imports from China triggered sell-offs across stock markets, though good corporate earnings kept a lid on losses. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.1 percent and the MSCI all-country world index declined just 0.02 percent. Europe’s STOXX 600 fell 0.3 percent as investors braced for a packed week of corporate earnings in Europe and a meeting between European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker and Trump to discuss threatened auto tariffs which could damage carmakers. Goldman Sachs analysts said auto tariffs, if they came to pass, would likely cause weakness in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, possibly also affecting the euro, pound, yen, and Korean won as investors priced in a hit to the economy. “The global economy is still OK, but the risk is now very high, and if trade policies don’t make a U-turn very soon, we’ll see a measurable impact on growth already next year,” said UniCredit chief economist Erik Nielsen. The euro, which has been gaining from dollar weakness, climbed for a third straight day to a two-week top of $1.1750. It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.135. Concerns about fuel demand dented oil prices after finance ministers and central bank governors at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires said the risks to global economic growth have increased due to trade and geopolitical tensions. U.S. crude fell slightly to $68.24 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent crude rose 16 cents to $73.23. Copper, among the most sensitive to trade tensions, hovered above a one-year low hit last week, trading at $6,151 a tonne. Copper fell for the sixth week in a row last week. Gold prices declined 0.1 percent to $1,30.76 an ounce. Reporting by Helen Reid, Graphic by Dhara Ranasinghe, Editing

The world’s fifth-largest steelmaker raised its revenue outlook for 2018 to 64.1 trillion won ($56.7 billion) from its April forecast of 63 trillion won. POSCO said in a filing it expected Chinese steel prices to remain high on tighter supplies following a shutdown of old mills amid ongoing restructuring in the China steel business. The brighter full-year forecast comes after consolidated operating profit for April-June climbed 28 percent to 1.25 trillion won from 979.1 billion won a year earlier. That was slightly below a bullish average estimate for POSCO’s core earnings of 1.32 trillion won from 12 analysts polled by Reuters. Revenue for the quarter advanced 7.6 percent to 16.08 trillion won from 14.95 trillion won a year ago, helped by rising prices. That trend showed up in Shanghai benchmark steel , up 14 percent in April-June from the previous quarter with firm demand and lower output in China. On Monday POSCO said it expected average prices for iron ore, a key input in steelmaking, to be between $60 and $65 per tonne in the third quarter, down from $65 per tonne in the second quarter.

2018-07-23,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco aims to buy a controlling stake in petrochemical maker SABIC 2010.SE, possibly taking the entire 70 percent stake owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Late last week Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE confirmed a Reuters report that it was working on a possible purchase of a “strategic stake” in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE from the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s top sovereign wealth fund. Aramco’s initial thinking is to buy the full stake owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), but if that fails to materialise Aramco could end up with a stake in SABIC of more than 50 percent, making it a majority owner, the sources said.     No final decision has been made on the size of the stake as the discussions are still at a very early stage, they added. Aramco declined to comment. The PIF did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals firm, has a market capitalisation of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals (£78 billion). The potential acquisition would affect the time frame of Aramco’s planned initial public offering set for later this year, the state oil giant’s chief executive, Amin Nasser, said in a TV interview on Friday. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to cut the risk of an oil demand slowdown. Aramco plans to raise its refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels per day, from around 5 million bpd now, and double its petrochemicals production by 2030.  Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, pumps around 10 million bpd of crude oil.

2018-07-23,"* Dollar eases after Trump complains about greenback strength * Trump ratchets up protectionist rhetoric, hits stocks * Investors await Trump-Juncker trade talks later this week By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, July 23 (Reuters) - Asian shares dipped on Monday while the dollar fell after U.S. President Donald Trump criticised the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and amid reports Japan’s central bank could wind back its massive fund purchases. Trump, on Friday, lamented the recent strength of the U.S. dollar and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. The remarks, coupled with new threats to slap duties on all U.S. imports from China, have triggered an equities sell-off with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan falling 0.2 percent on Monday. Spreadbetters pointed to a soft start for European shares, extending losses from Friday, while Wall Street futures were a shade weaker with E-Minis for the S&P 500 off 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stumbled 1.3 percent while South Korea’s Kospi index slipped 0.8 percent. “It does feel like we are hearing far too much from the President’s Twitter account at the moment and the market is not receiving many of his comments well,” said Nick Twidale, analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “But...investors are quite rightly positioning themselves accordingly,” he added. “The threat that U.S. policies pose to global growth is considerable and the market will continue to react to presidential tweets and comments while they are coming thick and fast.” Trump’s comments against Fed rate hikes eased the greenback and helped steepen the Treasury yield curve. Also playing a role in the global tick-up in yields and declines in the dollar was a Reuters report that the Bank of Japan was in unusually active discussions to modify its massive easing programme. The BOJ, in turn, offered to buy an unlimited amount of five- to- 10-year Japanese government bonds on Monday. Benchmark 10-year JGB futures, which had started lower on Monday, pared some of their losses on the announcement. The Reuters report and the dollar’s weakness together added to the yen’s strength, which was last up 0.4 percent at 111 per dollar. The dollar index went as deep as 94.207 on Monday, the lowest in more than two weeks. It was last down 0.1 percent at 94.38. Analysts at JPMorgan said these moves, together with a lower greenback and better commodity prices, should be positive for Asian equities. Indeed, Chinese and Hong Kong shares were in positive territory on Monday after a subdued start. The blue-chip index gained 0.5 percent while the Hang Seng index was a touch firmer. “Trade tensions remain a risk, but with an extended period until implementation (of the tariffs) and the next round of escalation, APAC equities are unlikely to respond much to Trump repeating threats already known,” JPMorgan added. Investors are now looking ahead to an important meeting between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in the White House where they will discuss potential U.S. tariffs on European goods. “Trade tensions are likely to remain in the headlines,” asset manager Insight Investment, which is owned by BNY Mellon, said in a note. “It’s probably a little too early for the indirect impact of the U.S.-China trade issue to be showing up in the data. Nonetheless, the trade numbers that were released for Singapore and Japan were worse than expected.” In Singapore, for example, exports rose 1.1 percent in the year to June compared with expectations of a 7.6 percent increase, while electronic exports slipped 7.9 percent. Elsewhere, the euro dithered near a two-week top of $1.1746. It was flat at $1.1727. In commodities, oil prices were held back by concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions. U.S. crude was last off 14 cents at $68.12 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent eased 10 cents to $72.97. Spot gold was barely changed at $1,230.82 an ounce.

2018-07-23,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Crude oil isn’t formally part of the trade dispute between the United States and China, but it may well be the first major flow to be disrupted significantly by the rising tensions. One of the successes in the efforts to lower the trade surplus enjoyed by China over the United States was exports of crude, a result of the shale oil boom that has taken the U.S. to within a whisker of being the world’s top oil producer. Crude exports from the United States to China have surged this year, with vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts showing China imported 60.2 million barrels, or about 333,000 barrels per day (bpd), of U.S. oil in the first half of the year. This was up from just 24.9 million barrels, or 138,000 bpd, over the same period last year, according to the data. Much of the gain so far this year has been in recent months, with the April to July period being four of the five strongest months on record, and January this year being the other. July is set to be the second-strongest month for Chinese imports of U.S. crude, with the data pointing to the arrival of 12.32 million barrels, or about 397,000 bpd. Expected shipments in August appear to be heading substantially lower, however, with only 9.58 million barrels, or about 309,000 bpd, expected to arrive at Chinese ports. While these numbers may still change, they are unlikely to shift much, given the typical six-week journey between U.S. ports in the Gulf of Mexico and China. This means all U.S. cargoes slated to arrive in China in August should have already left. It also means most cargoes likely to arrive in September would also have departed the United States, but so far no such fixtures are showing. This doesn’t mean there will be zero U.S. crude exports arriving China in September, but it does raise the possibility that there will be a sharp decline. To put it in perspective, of the 10 U.S. cargoes unloaded in China in June, nine left U.S. ports in April. Given there is only one week left of July and no cargoes have yet left the U.S. for arrival in China in September, it seems risks are rising that U.S. oil shipments to China are falling off a cliff. This may add to the existing trade tensions between China and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made it clear he wants a lower trade deficit with China. If crude oil exports do plummet, though, the trade deficit is likely headed higher, notwithstanding tariffs already placed on some Chinese exports by the Trump administration. While this sounds like a poor outcome for U.S. crude exporters, there is evidence suggesting other importers in North Asia are taking up cargoes no longer being bought by China. South Korea may import a record amount of U.S. crude in September, with vessel-tracking data pointing to the arrival of 5.94 million barrels, or about 198,000 bpd. Japan may bring in 2.6 million barrels in September, or about 86,600 bpd, the highest since January this year. Taiwan’s imports from the United States are slated at 5.89 million bpd for August, or about 196,300 bpd, which would be the highest on record. While additional imports from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are probably insufficient to make up for the loss of Chinese purchases, they will provide some comfort to U.S. oil exporters. But they are also unlikely to do anything to ease the trade tensions between the Trump administration and China. The looming slump in China’s purchases of U.S. crude may be taken as a sign that Beijing is prepared to fight back against Trump, even if the tactics are somewhat different. Rather than impose tariffs, China may simply persuade its state-owned refiners to move away from buying U.S. crude. This means pain can be inflicted on the United States without needing to impose tariffs or resorting to the bombastic rhetoric that typifies the Trump administration. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-crude-china/column-china-imports-of-u-s-crude-to-slump-rest-of-north-asia-steps-up-russell-idUKL4N1UJ1PH,23 Jul 2018,"Crude oil isn't

2018-07-23,"(Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched a rhetorical assault on Iran’s leaders on Sunday, comparing them to a “mafia” and promising unspecified backing for Iranians unhappy with their government. Pompeo, in a California speech to a largely Iranian-American audience, dismissed Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated a nuclear deal with the United States and five other countries, as “merely polished front men for the ayatollahs’ international con artistry.” U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew in May from the 2015 nuclear accord designed to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran has said its nuclear work is just for electricity generation and other peaceful projects. Iran “is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government,” Pompeo said, citing what he called Iranian leaders’ vast wealth and corruption. Pompeo’s speech was the latest step in a communications offensive launched by the Trump administration that is meant to foment unrest in Iran and help pressure its government to end its nuclear programme and support of militant groups, U.S. officials familiar with the matter said. The offensive is meant to work in concert with severe economic sanctions that Washington plans to reimpose in the coming months, including on Tehran’s oil exports, its principal revenue generator. The United States will work with countries that import Iranian oil “to get imports as close to zero as possible” by Nov. 4, Pompeo said. Rouhani cautioned Trump on Sunday about pursuing hostile policies against Tehran, saying: “War with Iran is the mother of all wars.” But he did not rule out peace between the two countries, which have been at odds since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “You are not in a position to incite the Iranian nation  against Iran’s security and interests,” Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to reports of efforts by Washington to destabilise Iran’s Islamic government. Trump responded to Rouhani in a tweet late on Sunday, saying: “NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!”  ‘LONG-IGNORED VOICE OF PEOPLE’ Publicly, the Trump administration says its policy with Iran is not “regime change,” but to change Tehran’s behaviour so it stops nuclear and missile work, support for proxies in the Middle East and backing of militant groups. “While it is ultimately up to the Iranian people to determine the direction of their country, the United States ... will support the long-ignored voice of the Iranian people,” Pompeo said. Pompeo spoke at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, to a packed house of about 1,000 people. He received frequent applause, although one audience member heckled him over the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Several dozen protesters lined the route to the site, including one group that distributed fliers opposing both Iran’s current government and any U.S. intervention in Iran. Pompeo said senior Iranian leaders had benefited from embezzlement, sweetheart deals and other ill-gotten gains. Iran’s ayatollahs, he said, were “hypocritical holy men” who “seem more concerned with riches than religion.” Pompeo said the U.S. government broadcasting agency was launching a 24/7 Farsi-language channel on TV, radio, digital and social media platforms. The U.S. government also is taking steps to help Iranians get around internet censorship, he said.

2018-07-23,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Life Insurance Co [NPNLI.UL] will no longer extend loans for, or invest in, coal-fired power plants due to environmental concerns, an official at Japan’s biggest life insurer said, in the first such move by a major Japanese institutional investor. Japanese banks in recent months have tightened lending criteria for coal power, indicating a global divestment of fossil-fuel assets that has cut $6 trillion worth of investment has reached the world’s third-biggest economy. “We have decided to stop new investment and lending to coal-fired power projects at home and overseas,” Yusuke Takaishi, deputy general manager at Nippon Life’s finance and investment planning department, told Reuters in an interview. Exceptions would be where a power station employs technology that captures the environmentally harmful carbon dioxide emitted by burning coal and stores it underground, an expensive option used in only a few locations worldwide. Nippon Life has assets of over 74 trillion yen ($667 billion) so its action may influence other Japanese investors, analysts said. Burning coal to generate power produces large quantities of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. An international agreement reached in Paris in 2015 committed signatories to cutting fossil fuel use. Climate change is the cause of more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heat waves, as average global temperatures reach record highs, ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise. “There are discussions among institutional investors, mainly those in Europe and the U.S., on how to deal with the issue of climate change and we are part of those discussions,” Takaishi said. “Our decision on coal power is just one result of our ongoing discussions on climate change and we are not just considering coal,” he said, without elaborating. He declined to disclose how much Nippon Life had invested in coal. Anti-fossil fuel campaign group 350.org calculates Nippon Life advanced $82 million in loans to domestic coal plant builders from 2011 through 2016. In 2011, a nuclear meltdown prompted the closure of all nuclear power plants and increased emphasis on fossil fuels. The insurer also has $1.3 billion invested in the bonds and shares of coal plant builders, according to research commissioned by urgewald, a German non-profit organization that campaigns against environmental destruction. The coal plant builders include utilities such as Tokyo Electric Power Co and trading houses such as Marubeni Corp.  Japan is one of the few industrialized countries that heavily promotes coal power both at home and abroad, including technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Its banks are among the biggest financiers of coal-related projects globally.     However, that appears to be changing. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd [SUMI.UL] told Reuters it would stop providing project finance for new coal-fired power stations “as a basic rule”. Exceptions would be evaluated “cautiously,” it said.

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc, Japan’s third-biggest bank by assets, said in May it would tighten criteria on lending for coal power.

2018-07-23,"* Dollar eases after Trump complains about greenback strength * Trump ratchets up protectionist rhetoric, hits stocks * Investors await Trump-Juncker trade talks later this week By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, July 23 (Reuters) - Asian shares dipped on Monday on fears of more protectionist measures from the United States while the dollar declined against major currencies after U.S. President Donald Trump criticised the Federal Reserve’s tightening policy. Trump, on Friday, lamented the recent strength of the U.S. dollar and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. The dollar index is so far up 2.4 percent this year led largely by Fed rate rises, strong macro-economic data and nervousness about a full-blown tariff war. It was last down 0.2 percent at 94.27, the lowest in more than two weeks. Trump’s remarks on Friday, coupled with new threats to slap duties on all U.S. imports from China, triggered sell-offs in Wall Street and European stocks on Friday, despite good corporate earnings. Asian stocks took Wall Street’s cue on Monday with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan falling 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stumbled 1.4 percent, Australian shares and South Korea’s KOSPI index fell 0.9 percent each. Chinese shares also opened lower but quickly reversed their losses, with both the blue-chip index and Shanghai’s SSE Composite up a touch. “Although U.S. equities edged lower on Friday and the yen strengthened, most cross-asset moves are supportive of APAC equities - particularly dollar weakness, strength in emerging markets FX, and a dramatic bear steepening of global yield curves. Commodities are also mostly trading higher,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note to clients. Trump’s comments against Fed rate hikes helped steepen the Treasury yield curve. Also playing a role in the global tick-up in yields was a Reuters report that the Bank of Japan was in unusually active discussions to modify its massive easing programme. The BOJ, in turn, offered to buy an unlimited amount of five- to- 10-year Japanese government bonds on Monday. Benchmark 10-year JGB futures, which had started lower on Monday, pared some of their losses on the announcement. The Reuters report and the dollar’s weakness together added to the yen’s strength, which was last up 0.5 percent at 110.91 per dollar. “Trade tensions remain a risk, but with an extended period until implementation (of the tariffs) and the next round of escalation, APAC equities are unlikely to respond much to Trump repeating threats already known,” JPMorgan added. Investors are now looking ahead to an important meeting between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. “Trade tensions are likely to remain in the headlines as Juncker meets President Trump in Washington to discuss potential U.S. tariffs on European autos,” asset manager Insight Investment, which is owned by BNY Mellon, said in a note. “It’s probably a little too early for the indirect impact of the U.S.-China trade issue to be showing up in the data. Nonetheless, the trade numbers that were released for Singapore and Japan were worse than expected.” In Singapore, for example, exports rose 1.1 percent in the year to June compared with expectations of a 7.6 percent increase, while electronic exports slipped 7.9 percent. Elsewhere, the euro climbed for a third straight day to a two-week top of $1.1746. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.1741. In commodities, oil prices were held back by concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions and increased supply. U.S. crude was last off 16 cents at $68.1 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent eased 17 cents to $72.90. Spot gold was barely changed at $1,231.8 an ounce.

2018-07-23,"DENPASAR, Indonesia, July 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Five years ago, tour guide Wayan Aksara noticed that more and more visitors he showed around the Indonesian island of Bali were complaining about garbage on its once-pristine beaches. Bali’s mounting rubbish problem was also becoming personal for Aksara, who lives near Saba beach - an undeveloped area close to the holiday resort of Sanur, which faces a constant battle with trash washed onto its shores from a nearby river. “Every time we drove around, our guests ... would comment about it not being clean and the large amount of plastic,” said Aksara. “They would say the trash is bad, that tourism here is not sustainable, and ask what we are doing about it.” Aksara joined - and is now chairman of - Trash Hero Indonesia, a community group with more than 20 chapters across Indonesia and about 12 on Bali. It uses social media to organise weekly garbage-collection events for volunteers. Aksara, a father-of-two, also gives talks at schools and community events on how to manage waste better. Like many parts of Asia, the Indonesian archipelago of more than 17,000 islands has a fast-growing economy and population, and a huge coastline with many densely populated cities. These factors have created a “perfect storm” for garbage in the surrounding seas, said Susan Ruffo, a managing director at the U.S.-based non-profit group Ocean Conservancy. Garbage collection services and infrastructure have largely failed to keep pace with rapid development. Now, as awareness rises, civil society groups like Trash Hero are playing an important role in Bali’s push to keep its famous beaches and temples free of rubbish. On Saba beach, surrounded by coconut trees and grazing cows, the garbage strewn about includes toothpaste tubes, shoes, plastic bottles, nappies, drinking straws and cigarette packets. “There is a plastic problem in Bali ... We need time but we (have) started already,” Aksara told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Big things start from small things.” Globally, more than 8 million tonnes of plastics are dumped into the ocean each year, scientists say - about one truckload per minute. China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand are the top five culprits, said Ocean Conservancy’s Ruffo. Aside from the impacts on human health and wildlife, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, a 21-nation forum, has put the cost to the region’s tourism, fishing and shipping industries at about $1.3 billion per year. Stung by criticism, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo - who has targeted “10 new Balis” across the archipelago to boost tourism - has been quick to act. Last year, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia’s coordinating minister for maritime affairs, launched a national action plan pledging up to $1 billion to cut ocean waste 70 percent by 2025. In June, local media reported the government had teamed up with Muslim clerics to tell their more than 100 million followers to choose reusable bags over plastic ones. Jenna Jambeck, a University of Georgia professor who specialises in plastic waste and marine debris, said Indonesia had become a leader on the issue out of a desire “to protect their amazing resources and beautiful country”. Bali’s most popular tourist beaches are now cleaned of trash at least once a day by local authorities using heavy machinery. Mass clean-ups are organised at least three times a year on Bali and across Indonesia, bringing together tens of thousands of tourists and locals to tidy up communities. Despite this, the rubbish problem on Bali was so bad late last year that officials declared a “garbage emergency”. “If you’re finding plastic on the beach, it’s already too late,” said Ocean Conservancy’s Ruffo. “It should never be there in the first place. How do you stop it at source? There is no one fix or silver bullet.” Tracing the origins of the trash on Bali’s beaches is difficult, but experts estimate up to 80 percent comes from the island itself. Rubbish collected from hotels and villages by informal workers is often dumped in rivers and then carried out to sea before eventually finding its way back to the coastline. A rise in the use of plastic packaging over the last decade, coupled with increased wealth and consumption, has exacerbated the problem, experts told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Bali desperately needs to improve its landfill sites, invest in more recycling facilities, carry out regular trash collections and expand its piped water supply, they added. Businesses, meanwhile, should redesign products or change materials so they are easier to reuse or recycle, said Jambeck. Governments also can make a difference by requiring a certain amount of recycled content in products, banning plastic bags or taxing single-use plastics, she added. Based in Bali’s cultural centre of Ubud, local company Rumah Kompos has six trucks that collect waste from hotels and private homes. The trash is then separated at the company’s depot to recycle, turn into compost or send to landfill. A new $1-million recycling facility, funded by the government, will boost Rumah Kompos’ capacity later this year, said manager Supardi Asmorobangun. The facility will host local children at weekend green camps, with a cinema showing films on climate change and plastic waste, he said. The company has also begun piloting a free reusable water bottle scheme at schools in Ubud. “My dream for the next five years is for every village on Bali to do (rubbish) separation,” Asmorobangun said. “We must do it now, not tomorrow.” New technologies and Asia’s army of informal rubbish collectors and scavengers are also key tools, experts said. At Sanur Kaja village in Denpasar, garbage gatherers are reaping the financial rewards of joining a pilot project run by Gringgo Trash Tech, reflected in a row of brand new motorcycles parked near the local authority’s waste collection facility. The company mapped out Denpasar and began a self-funded project last year using existing waste infrastructure to improve recycling and collection. Apps and GPS helped create a zoning system in the village of 5,000 residents, enabling garbage gatherers to become better-organised and more efficient. As a result, they can collect more rubbish from more households to increase their earnings. “If these guys stop working, this city will be shut down in less than a week,” said Gringgo co-founder Olivier Pouillon. Besides improving coordination with the local authority, Gringgo’s app provides the latest prices for recyclable waste. The system now serves about 60-65 percent of the village, with three times as much rubbish collected, said Pouillon. ""The quickest way to stop the pollution is to track where the waste is going, and that's exactly what we've done,"" he said.

2018-07-23,"(Repeats July 20 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2LzLuvB * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2LC7Zjh By John Kemp LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - The rising value of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies is creating an additional headwind for oil prices, as it pushes up the local price of crude and fuels across much of Asia, Europe and Latin America. In trade-weighted terms, the dollar has risen to its highest since late 2016 and early 2017, and before that 2002/2003 (tmsnrt.rs/2LzLuvB). Adjusted for inflation, the dollar’s trade-weighted value is close to its highest since 2004, according to the broad exchange rate index compiled by the Federal Reserve (tmsnrt.rs/2LC7Zjh). The U.S. dollar has appreciated by more than 8 percent against China’s yuan since the end of March, in response to the worsening trade tensions between the two countries. China overtook the United States to become the world’s largest crude importer in 2017 and net imports of crude and fuels are now running at around 9 million barrels per day. Brent crude prices have risen nearly 9 percent this year in dollar terms but are up more than 13.5 percent in yuan as a result of the exchange-rate shift. China’s currency depreciation is partly driven by bilateral tensions as the country’s authorities actively engineer or passively permit the exchange rate to act as a shock absorber (the practical effect is the same). But the U.S. dollar has also appreciated against every other major currency, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, the South Korean won and the Canadian dollar. The U.S. currency is also rising against most emerging-market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah. In general, it is the U.S. dollar appreciating rather than other currencies depreciating, mostly as a result of strong economic growth in the United States, steadily rising interest rates and safe-haven capital flows. The result is that oil prices in most oil-consuming countries are now rising much faster than the international benchmark prices quoted in dollars. There is no simple and stable relationship between exchange rates and oil prices quoted in dollars – the two have sometimes been correlated and sometimes not. Exchange rates are only one of many influences on the price of oil, and the relationship is not strong or predictable enough to be tradeable. But a strong dollar is generally associated with lower benchmark oil prices, and vice versa, all other things being equal. The last period of very high oil prices between 2011 and the first half of 2014 coincided with a period of dollar weakness, which cushioned the impact in many major oil-consuming countries. But oil’s recent rise has been accompanied by a strengthening dollar, especially in recent months, which will intensify the impact on consumers. Many emerging markets also took advantage of low oil prices in 2015 and 2016 to scale back fuel subsidies and price controls. Consumers in many of the fastest-growing fuel markets are being exposed to the impact of pricier oil much more than before. Gasoline and diesel prices in India, for example, one of the fastest-growing fuel markets, recently hit record levels because of a cocktail of higher crude prices, a stronger dollar, fiscal changes and the reduction of price controls. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, rising oil prices are likely to prompt a much larger demand-response from consumers than in 2011-2014. In the current oil-price cycle, demand restraint is likely to be felt much faster and more aggressively than in 2006-2008 or 2011-2014, so long as the dollar remains strong.

2018-07-23,"TOKYO, July 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed on Monday as finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 warned that risks to global growth have increased with rising trade and geopolitical tensions among other vulnerabilities. Brent crude was up 2 cents at $73.09 a barrel by 0037 GMT, having ended up 49 cents on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate was down 8 cents at $68.18 a barrel, after finishing up 2 cents on Friday. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors ended a meeting in Buenos Aires over the weekend calling for more dialogue to prevent trade and geopolitical tensions from hurting growth. “Global economic growth remains robust and unemployment is at a decade low,” the finance leaders said in a statement. “However, growth has been less synchronised recently, and downside risks over the short and medium term have increased.” The talks come amid escalating rhetoric in the trade conflict between the United States and China, the world’s largest economies, which have so far slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s goods. U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes on Friday with a threat to impose tariffs on all $500 billion of Chinese exports to the United States unless Beijing agrees to major structural changes to its technology transfer, industrial subsidy and joint venture policies. U.S. energy companies last week cut the number of oil rigs by the most in a week since March as the rate of growth has slowed over the past month or so with recent declines in crude prices.

2018-07-23,"SYDNEY, July 23 (Reuters) - The dollar declined on Monday against major currencies to its lowest in more than two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump criticised the Federal Reserve’s tightening policy, while stocks slipped on fears of further trade protectionist measures. Trump, on Friday, lamented the recent strength of the U.S. dollar and accused the European Union and China of manipulating their currencies. The remarks, coupled with Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on all U.S. imports from China, triggered a bout of sell-offs in Wall Street and European stocks on Friday, despite good corporate earnings. Asian stocks followed that lead on Monday with Japan’s Nikkei stumbling 0.9 percent. Australian shares were off 0.1 percent while the New Zealand market was down 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up a touch waiting for other markets to open. Trump’s comments also hit the greenback, which was last down 0.2 percent at 94.25 against a basket of six major peers, and steepened long-term Treasury yields. “The President’s remarks also make it very clear he has a distaste for a stronger dollar, effectively limiting the greenback’s ability to perform, at least near term,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank. The dollar index is so far up 2.4 percent this year. A Reuters report on Friday that the Bank of Japan was in unusually active discussions to modify its massive easing also played a role in the tick-up in yields globally. Benchmark 10-year Japanese Government Bond futures opened weaker on Monday, sending yields to six-month highs. The Reuters report also added to the yen’s strength, which was last up 0.3 percent at 111.07 per dollar. “The market took the news as a possible sign the anchor at the long end may allow for some natural drift higher,” ANZ said in a note to clients. Investors are now looking ahead to an important meeting on trade between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House. A breakdown in talks could hit risk sentiment, hurting global equities, analysts said. The euro climbed for a third straight day to a two-week top of $1.1746. In commodities, oil prices were caught between a weakening dollar which supported the market and concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions and supply increases which undermined sentiment. U.S. crude was last off 3 cents at $68.24 a barrel after posting its third straight weekly loss. Brent settled at $73.18, up 11 cents. Reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-07-23,"(Repeats from July 20. No changes to text) * Kansai Electric, Osaka Gas square off amid liberalised markets * Kansai Electric quickens pace of gas customer acquisitions in Q2 * Power, gas companies may enter M&A age in future - analysts By Osamu Tsukimori OSAKA, Japan, July 23 (Reuters) - Retail power and gas heavyweights Kansai Electric Power and Osaka Gas are locked in a struggle for dominance in the Kansai region, whose economy is nearly the size of South Korea’s and includes Osaka, the second-biggest city in Japan. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the country’s power monopoly system - in place for nearly 70 years - was partially dismantled in 2016, followed by the liberalisation of the retail gas market a year later. Hundreds of new power sellers soon arrived on the scene, some with just a few dozen accounts. Since then, the Kansai region has seen the most gas customers, and the second-highest number of power customers, switch providers. Nowhere is that churn more evident than with Kansai Electric and Osaka Gas. Kansai Electric pulled about 580,000 retail gas customers from Osaka Gas, but lost about 680,000 power customers to it. Overall, Kansai Electric lost nearly 1.7 million power users. But its shares have risen 27 percent since the beginning of 2017, compared with about 1 percent decline for Osaka Gas. “It’s like the elephants battling horses. When power and gas firms battle it out against Tokyo Electric (Tepco) or Kansai Electric for an extended period, gas firms could lose,” said Reiji Ogino, senior analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. He said Kansai Electric is predicted to shed 10 to 20 percent of its customers in coming years. Osaka Gas, however, is expected to see its customer base shrink by 20 to 30 percent, he added. That is because power companies, which tend to be larger and more diverse, can better weather deregulation, Ogino said. Kansai Electric, for instance, now sells gas to retail customers. And the company, already the third-largest power supplier in Japan, has an additional advantage: in the past 14 months, it has resumed operations at four reactors idled after the Fukushima disaster. That has allowed it to cut its electricity prices by 5.4 percent in July, making them the fourth-lowest among the former 10 power monopolies. A price war is especially beneficial for large users such as 7-Eleven Japan, which has switched its thousands of convenience stores to Kansai Electric. The savings could amount to tens of millions of dollars per year, according to local media reports. Osaka Gas, which has 2 gigawatts of domestic power plant capacity, mostly fired by gas, reacted by undercutting Kansai Electric’s prices. But Kansai Electric still offers cheaper combined power and gas service than Osaka Gas. This year it also began offering additional discounts, such as waiving basic monthly fees for gas, which have accelerated the pace of customer acquisitions from its chief rival. Ogino said that the power and gas industries in Japan are likely to enter a period of alliances of former power and gas monopolies in different regions by 2020. The 10 years after that might see mergers and acquisitions, he added. But he said a merger of the two Osaka-area rivals would be unlikely. “I don’t think the trade ministry would allow the creation of one giant power and gas company in the Kansai region because the competition principle does not work,” Ogino said. Shinichi Yamazaki, senior sector analyst at Okasan Securities, agreed. “Chances for acquisitions or mergers in Kansai region may be slim because the companies are large in size, but there may be such cases in remote areas,” Yamazaki said. Kansai Electric has tried to strengthen its position further by buying stakes in LNG projects outside Japan, getting into retail gas sales and even delving into real estate. “The history of their battle goes back two or three decades, but given Osaka Gas thinks it’s no match for Kansai Electric, it has been diversifying its businesses from way back,” he said. “History repeats itself, and the battle will continue.” Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/japan-energy-battle/rpt-japans-kansai-region-a-major-battleground-for-gas-and-electric-utilities-idUKL4N1UJ01K,23 Jul 2018,"* Kansai Electric, Osaka Gas square off amid liberalised
