2018-05-07,"WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Monday announced sanctions on three Venezuelans and 20 companies with ties to socialist President Nicolas Maduro for narcotics trafficking, with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence calling for more nations to increase pressure on Caracas. The new sanctions continue a pattern of stepped-up U.S. measures on individuals connected to Maduro, who is blamed by President Donald Trump’s administration for a deep recession and hyperinflation that have caused food shortages in Venezuela and sent a exodus of migrants into neighbouring countries. The individuals sanctioned on Monday are fairly low-profile and the move is unlikely to create major economic hardship. Trump has been considering but has so far opted not to impose sanctions on a Venezuelan oil services company and on insurance coverage for tankers carrying Venezuelan oil. Those measures are still under consideration, though, one administration official said on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Pence told the 35-nation Organization of American States - which includes Venezuela as a member - that they needed to take greater steps to isolate Maduro. “We believe it is time to do more, much more,” Pence said in an address to the OAS in Washington. “Every free nation gathered here must take stronger action to stand with the Venezuelan people and stand up to their oppressors.” Pence said the OAS should suspend Venezuela’s membership, and urged other members to cut off the nation’s leaders from financial systems and restrict their travel visas. He also called on Maduro to suspend elections scheduled for May 20, saying he expected voter intimidation and manipulation of data. “There will be no real election in Venezuela on May 20, and the world knows it,” Pence said. The suggestion was immediately rejected by Caracas. “There is zero possibility that elections will be suspended,” said Samuel Moncada, Venezuela’s ambassador to the United Nations, condemning Pence’s speech. Maduro, himself subject to sanctions last year, regularly laughs off Washington’s disapproval and blames the U.S. “empire” for his country’s economic woes, saying it is trying to undermine his administration. Of the newly sanctioned companies, 16 are based in Venezuela and four in Panama. They are owned or controlled by the three individuals, the U.S. Treasury said in a statement. The measures are aimed at having a “chilling effect” on other drug traffickers in Venezuela and are one in a series of many steps, said Carlos Trujillo, U.S. ambassador to the OAS. “I think the (Trump) administration is willing to do anything, whatever it takes, to make sure that Venezuelan people get to enjoy democracy and the liberties that come with it,” Trujillo said in an interview. Trujillo said he thinks Venezuela could leave the OAS by the end of 2018 - something he said was needed for the group to “be taken seriously.” “Venezuela has said in the past that they want to leave, but it seems they don’t find their way to the door,” he said.

2018-05-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to fresh 2018 highs on Monday while oil prices climbed to their highest since late 2014, driven by declining Venezuelan crude production and worries the United States could re-impose sanctions on Iran. The crude surge lifted energy stocks in Europe and on Wall Street, with European shares supported by strong results and gains in Nestle (NESN.S) after the Swiss company agreed to pay $7.15 billion to Starbucks (SBUX.O) in a global coffee alliance. The euro broke below $1.19 for the first time this year on weaker-than-expected German industrial orders and declining euro zone investor sentiment. Investors increased bets that rising U.S. interest rates would continue to boost the dollar, while traders unwound their bearish positions on the greenback. An index that tracks the dollar against a basket of leading currencies .DXY climbed to 92.974, its highest since December. The index was last up 0.23 percent at 92.782. “The general view right now is that the dollar is probably going to continue to move a bit higher against the euro in particular, maybe against the yen as well,” said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Solutions.  The euro could slip to $1.1750 or even $1.15 as a support level as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy and the European economy trends weaker, he said. “There’s a general appreciation the Fed is going to move at least twice again this year and the consensus is shifting toward three more moves this year.” The euro EUR= fell 0.3 percent to $1.1922, while the Japanese yen JPY= slipped 0.04 percent to 109.07 per dollar. Venezuelan oil exports came under threat after U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips (COP.N) moved to take Caribbean assets of state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award, three sources told Reuters.  The move could further crimp PDVSA’s declining oil output and exports. Widespread expectations that President Donald Trump will withdraw the United States from the Iranian nuclear pact also weighed on crude prices. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose $1.01 to settle at $70.73 a barrel, breaking above the $70 mark for the first time since November 2014, while Brent LCOcv1 gained $1.30 to settle at $76.17. Nestle (NESN.S) rose 1.6 percent after it gained the rights to market Starbucks products around the world outside of the U.S. company’s coffee shops. Nestle was the biggest contributor to the 0.59 percent advance in the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading regional shares. Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) and Total (TOTF.PA) were the fourth- and seventh-biggest  contributors, respectively. On Wall Street, the S&P energy index .SPNY was the biggest gainer among the 11 major sectors during much of the session but faded by the close, ending up 0.18 percent. Trump tweeted that on Tuesday he would announce his decision on whether to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. “Oil has done well in anticipation of the announcement from Trump. People are braced for the worst,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed up 94.81 points, or 0.39 percent, at 24,357.32. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 9.21 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,672.63 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 55.60 points, or 0.77 percent, to 7,265.21.  Euro zone government bond yields slid as the unexpected fall in German industrial output was seen as encouraging the European Central Bank to prolong an unwinding of stimulus. The yield on the benchmark 10-year German bund DE10YT=TWEB fell to 0.53 percent, while yields on U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose slightly to 2.9516 percent.

2018-05-07,"May 7 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co (SoCalGas) on Monday boosted its estimated cost for the massive leak at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility between October 2015 and February 2016 to around $954 million, up 4.4 percent from the estimate of $913 million last quarter, according to a quarterly report with U.S. financial regulators. SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy , warned the “estimate may rise significantly” due to pending lawsuits, possible fines and other costs. It said costs not covered by insurance or delays in receiving insurance payments “could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’s and Sempra Energy’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.” The utility said the latest estimate included $928 million of costs already recovered or likely to be recovered from insurance. It said about 60 percent of the total cost was for temporary relocation of residents who live near the facility, which is close to the Porter Ranch neighborhood in Los Angeles, including cleanup costs. Aliso Canyon, with a capacity of 86 billion cubic feet (bcf), is SoCalGas’ biggest storage facility. State regulators estimated 4.62 bcf of gas leaked at Aliso Canyon. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. The facility represents 63 percent of the utility’s gas storage capacity, making it a key part of the company’s ability to deliver fuel to customers, especially on the coldest days when demand for heating is highest and the hottest days when a lot of gas is used to generate power for air conditioning. State regulators have limited the amount of gas SoCalGas can inject into Aliso Canyon to a total of 24.6 bcf. They have also said the company can only withdraw gas from the facility when other options are not available to meet demand. Many residents and government officials want SoCalGas to shut the Aliso Canyon facility. [reut.rs/2wlAmPG ] Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-05-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for the fourth straight day on Monday to hit levels not seen since late 2014, boosted by the latest trouble for Venezuelan oil company PDVSA and the possibility that the United States could re-impose sanctions on Iran.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $1.01, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $70.73 a barrel. This was the first time since November 2014 that WTI had climbed above $70. Brent crude futures jumped $1.30, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $76.17 a barrel.  U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips moved to take Caribbean assets of Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award. “If ConocoPhillips is successful, then it will limit the revenues PDVSA will have and give them even more problems paying their bills and producing their oil,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition in Stamford.  In total, the company’s actions would affect about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) typically shipped from the three locations, about a third of its exports. In the first quarter, PDVSA exported 1.19 million bpd of crude from its terminals in Venezuela and the Caribbean, a 29-percent decline versus the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Venezuela’s oil output has halved since the early 2000s. U.S. President Donald Trump said a decision on whether to remain in the Iran nuclear deal or to impose sanctions would be announced at 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Tuesday, four days earlier than expected. “I think it’s a sign that he’s planning on reimposing sanctions, and the only question for oil markets is how soon,” said Joe McMonigle, an energy analyst at Hedgeye Research. “I think they would as quickly as possible try to implement the sanctions.” The agreement has a dispute resolution clause that provides at least 35 days to consider a claim that any party has violated its terms. That can be extended if all parties agree. If Trump restores core U.S. sanctions, under U.S. law he must wait at least 180 days before imposing their furthest-reaching measure: targeting banks of nations that fail to significantly cut their purchases of Iranian oil. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said Iran’s exports could be cut by 200,000 to 300,000 bpd as a result. Iranian officials, however, said that the country’s oil industry would continue to develop even if the United States pulls out of the accord.

2018-05-07,"OSLO (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) will double the size of its data center in Sweden’s northern city of Lulea, raising its total investments in the region to about 8.7 billion crowns ($987 million), the company said on Monday. The campus, opened in 2013, is the first Facebook data center set up outside the United States. The expansion will make it one of the largest data centers in the world, said Node Pole, an investment hub, partly owned by utility Vattenfall [VATN.UL], which seeks to promote investments in power-hungry data centers. Sweden and its Nordic neighbors, with cheap electricity and low temperatures, are attractive for data centers, with many Silicon valley giants and cryptocurrency miners rushing to move in.  Facebook will add a third building to the existing two at the Lulea data center, which Vattenfall supplies electricity to. “This third building will measure nearly 50,000 square meters, and we anticipate will start serving traffic in early 2021,” Facebook said in a statement. The expansion will increase the social media giant’s total cumulative investment in the region to around 8.7 billion crowns, it added, without disclosing the exact cost of the new project. Lulea’s mayor Niklas Nordstrom said the new building would double the size of the data center to more than 100,000 square meters (1.1 million square feet) and double its capacity of operations. The current two-building campus consumes more than one percent of Sweden’s total power production and that will also double, he told Reuters. The expansion will create about 100 new Facebook jobs at the center, which currently employs fewer than 200 people, while its construction will create about 1,000 temporary jobs, Nordstrom said. In 2017, Sweden cut its tax rate on electricity for data centers by 97 percent, to the same level as other heavy industries such as steelworks and car plants, making it attractive for new investments, said Node Pole. “Sweden now has the lowest energy cost in the EU, with the lowest carbon footprint,” it said, explaining Facebook’s move. The city of Lulea in northern Sweden, on the same latitude as Alaska’s Fairbanks, was built on the foundation of the steel industry. In the past decade, it has also developed into a hot-spot for data centers and other energy-intensive industries. More than 18 data centers today operate in the area, with German car maker BMW (BMWG.DE) one of the companies storing data in the region. Amazon (AMZN.O) also recently announced that three data centers will be built in Sweden. Boston Consulting Group estimated data centers could employ 30,000 people in Sweden by 2025 – twice as many as are employed in the country’s steel industry today, according to a press release by Lulea’s mayor and Lulea Naringsliv, a local development company. “We call it the ‘Facebook effect’. The new business and new jobs generated by the initial investment makes this about much more than a data center,” said Li Skarin, chief executive of Lulea Naringsliv.

2018-05-07,"NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - Wind farms have boosted local tax bases and generated new revenue as they expand across the United States, especially for rural areas, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report on Monday. “What we’re seeing is wind farms generate new operating revenues, lower the tax burden for local residents,” Moody’s analyst Frank Mamo told Reuters. “In many cases, local governments are using this new money to address what was a growing backlog of deferred capital expenditures.” In Adair County, Iowa, construction of 10 new wind farms has grown the tax base nearly 30 percent over the last decade, giving it money to fix bridges and streets. Wind farm taxes are also paying over 40 percent of debt service for Webb Consolidated Independent School District in Texas, Moody’s noted. In Jackson County, Minnesota, a wind production tax generates nearly 20 percent of the county’s annual operating revenues and helped fund construction of a new public works facility. Nearly half of the country’s installed wind power capacity is located in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and California, the report showed. Yet wind power is growing elsewhere. At least 400 counties in 41 states had wind farms as of January, more than double the number that had them 10 years ago, Moody’s found. The developments have expanded rapidly in Kansas and Minnesota, for instance. The primary factor for placing wind farms is an abundance of wind, but government tax incentives and mandated clean energy requirements can also drive their location. The tax boost is especially strong in counties that are allowed to apply their locally determined property tax rate to the valuation of wind turbines, as they do in Iowa. There, the state lets wind farms be phased into a county’s tax base, starting at 5 percent of a turbine’s assessed valuation annually until it hits a maximum of 30 percent. Iowa’s booming wind energy sector also prompted tech companies, including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook, to invest a total of nearly $10 billion on data centers, Moody’s said. Counties can also tax annual kilowatt hours of wind energy produced, as is the case in Minnesota. Moody’s expects demand for wind energy to remain strong despite the phase-out of a federal production tax credit, talk of tariffs on imported steel and waning political support for state incentives.

2018-05-07,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The Iranian oil industry will continue to develop even if the United States pulls out of the 2015 nuclear deal, and Tehran would see the accord as operational as long as it can sell oil, the Oil Ministry’s news service quoted senior officials as saying on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the Iran deal by not extending sanctions waivers when they expire on May 12 unless European signatories of the accord fix what he calls its “flaws”. “They cannot stop Iran. Our oil industry’s development will continue even if new sanctions are imposed on Iran,” SHANA quoted Gholamreza Manouchehri, deputy head of the National Iranian Oil Company, as saying on its website.  Sanctions imposed on Iran in early 2012 by the United States and European Union over its nuclear programme cut Iran’s crude exports from a peak of 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) before the sanctions to a little more than 1 million bpd. But Iran re-emerged as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions were suspended in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme.     Manouchehri said Iran planned to finalise seven upstream contracts worth around $40 billion with foreign investors, SHANA reported. “These contracts will be finalised under the current challenging circumstances by mid-Iranian year (October) ... This planning has been made with the assumption of delayed presence of Western companies,” he added.   Major European companies, partly fearing harsh penalties because of the remaining U.S. sanctions on Iran, have been reluctant to do business with Tehran, which needs to attract over $100 billion in foreign investment to boost its crude output. France’s Total became the first Western energy firm to sign a deal with Iran after the easing of international sanctions in 2016, agreeing to develop Phase 11 of the South Pars offshore gas field with a total investment of $5 billion.  Deputy Oil Minister Amirhossein Zamaninia also said that Iran considered the deal alive “if we can continue to sell our oil and its products”, even if the United States pulls out. “Also, we should be able to maintain Iran’s oil market, receive our oil money and secure foreign investment in our oil industry,” he added. Iran says it aims to raise its crude oil production capacity to 4.7 million bpd within the next four years, though exports might be disrupted if Trump refuses to renew Iran’s sanctions waivers next week. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and several other producers began to reduce oil output in January 2017 in an attempt to erase a supply glut and prop up prices. They have extended the pact until December 2018, and meet in June to review policy. “We back OPEC’s decisions under normal circumstances ... But Iran always gives priority to its own interests ... whoever produces more oil has more power in the market,” Zamaninia said. Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has shown a willingness to keep tightening crude markets. The world’s largest crude exporter has consistently opposed Iran’s nuclear deal, fearing that it will strengthen Iran economically and allow it to increase funding for proxy conflicts in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. “Saudi officials want to limit Iran’s oil market ... This is a fight over controlling the crude market,” Zamaninia said. Saleh Hendi, head of the NIOC’s exploration organisation, said 14 exploration blocks were also scheduled to be tendered in July. “Of the 14 exploration blocks, six blocks, for which development agreements will be signed, are expected to be attractive to foreign investors,” Hendi said.

2018-05-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers are telling the Trump administration they want to reach an agreement with California to avoid a legal battle over fuel efficiency standards, and support continued increases in mileage standards through 2025. “We support standards that increase year over year that also are consistent with marketplace realities,” Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing major automakers, will tell a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Tuesday, according to written testimony released on Monday. The Trump administration is weighing how to revise fuel economy standards through at least the 2025 model year, and one option is to propose freezing the standards through 2026, effectively allowing automakers to delay investments in technology to cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning petroleum. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not formally submitted its joint proposal with the Environmental Protection Agency to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. Even so, last week, California and 16 other states sued to challenge the Trump administration’s decision to revise U.S. vehicle rules. Auto industry executives have held meetings with the Trump administration for months and have urged the administration to try to reach a deal with California even as they support slowing the pace of reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that the Obama administration rules outlined.  One automaker official said part of the message to President Donald Trump at a meeting on Friday will be to consider California like a foreign trade deal that needs to be renegotiated. Automakers want to urge him to get automakers a “better deal” – as opposed to potentially years of litigation between major states and federal regulators. On Friday, Trump is set to meet with the chief executives of General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) and the top U.S. executives of at least five other major automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), to talk about revisions to the vehicle rules. Senior EPA and Transportation Department officials will also attend. Environmental groups are eager to keep the rules in place, saying they will save consumers billions in fuel costs. A coalition of groups plans to stage a protest outside Ford’s headquarters in Michigan. The Obama administration’s rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleetwide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025. Heidi King, the Trump administration’s nominee to head NHTSA, which oversees Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, is set to have a confirmation hearing on May 16 before the Senate Commerce Committee.

2018-05-07,"(Adds context, background) KHARTOUM, May 7 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia would supply Sudan’s energy needs for five years on credit under an agreement being discussed by both governments, Sudan Oil Minister Abdulrahman Othman said on Monday. Othman said the deal would provide about 1.8 million tonnes of oil a year to Sudan, which in recent months has been hit by a sharp foreign currency crisis and an acute fuel shortage that has forced people to queue at gas stations for hours. Once an oil exporter, Sudan was forced to begin importing it after the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of the country’s oil output and its main source of foreign currency. A source in the presidency’s office in Khartoum said the final agreement is expected to be signed within days. Sudan’s foreign currency crunch arose from decades of U.S. sanctions that were lifted last year, but new sources of foreign currency have failed to materialise. Khartoum has been expecting financial support from wealthy Gulf Arab allies but little has trickled into the sprawling country of 40 million people. The potential oil deal comes after Sudan’s defence minister told parliament last week that the government was reconsidering its military participation in Yemen, where Sudan has sent at least 3,000 ground troops to support a Saudi-led coalition.

2018-05-07,"CAIRO, May 7 (Reuters) - Technical talks between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over a disputed dam Ethiopia is building on the Nile river failed to make a breakthrough, Egypt’s foreign minister said on Monday, amid pressure for a deal before the project opens this year. Egypt and Ethiopia are at loggerheads over the construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam, a $4 billion-hydroelectric project that Cairo fears will reduce waters that run to its fields and reservoirs from Ethiopia’s highlands and via Sudan. Addis Ababa hopes the dam will make it a hub for the electricity-hungry region and denies it will undermine Egypt’s access to water. Sameh Shoukry said technical experts who met in Addis Ababa last week did not achieve a breakthrough. “I have spoken to the minister of irrigation, who attended this meeting, and what has reached me is that the obstruction that has bogged down this path for more than a year has not been overcome,” Shoukry told reporters during a news conference in Cairo with his visiting Ugandan counterpart. He said both Ethiopia and Sudan continued to have reservations about a technical report by a French firm commissioned to assess the dam’s environmental and economic impact. Ties between Egypt and Sudan were strained when Khartoum backed the dam because of its need for electricity. The three African neighbours are set to meet on May 15 for further talks, Shoukry said, adding Egypt had initially proposed several earlier dates for negotiations, but they were turned down by the two other countries. Earlier this month, talks in Khartoum between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan also failed to reach agreement, but were described by Sudan’s foreign minister as “constructive”.

2018-05-07,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq’s state-run North Oil Company signed an agreement with BP (BP.L) on Monday to triple output from the Kirkuk fields in the north of the country, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said. The agreement was signed in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, he told a news conference after the signing. Under the deal, BP will boost output capacity from six fields in the Kirkuk region to a total of more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd), three times today’s capacity in the region. The oilfields were returned to Baghdad’s control in October after Iraqi government forces dislodged Kurdish fighters from the area. The minister began talks with BP in October, days after the Kurdish fighters were driven expelled. Oil exports from the region, transported by pipeline toTurkey, were halted after the Iraqi military operation, which was launched in retaliation against an independence referendum held on Sept. 25 by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Iraq plans to start trucking crude from Kirkuk to Iran, but the road to the border has yet to be secured from attacks by Islamic State insurgents. BP had agreed in 2013 to help Baghdad halt a sharp decline in output from Kirkuk. The KRG then took control of the Kirkuk region in 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State’s sweeping advance in northern and western Iraq. The Kurdish move prevented the fields from falling into the hands of the militants. Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to BP. BP has provided technical assistance in the past to North Oil to help redevelop the Kirkuk field. Iraq, the second biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries behind Saudi Arabia, has capacity to produce almost 5 million bpd, but now produces 4.45 million bpd to comply with an OPEC-led deal to curb supplies. Most of Iraq’s crude is produced from areas managed by the central government of Baghdad, in the south, and exported from southern ports on the Gulf. The KRG exports about 300,000 bpd of crude from northern Iraq through a pipeline across Turkey.

The quake struck the Borynia-Zofiowka-Jastrzebie coal mine in southern Poland on Saturday morning, trapping seven people almost a kilometre underground. Two of them have been found dead and two others rescued. “Rescue teams ... are progressing at a pace of several metres per hour. We’re narrowing the area where miners are located,” JSW’s chief executive, Daniel Ozon, told a news conference. Friends and relatives lit candles at the mine’s entrance, next to a banner reading “Miners of Zofiowka - We Are With You”. “My husband works here too, that is why my heart goes out to the families ... I would not like to be in their place,” said one woman who only gave her first mane, Malgorzata. About 250 people were working underground at the time of the quake. The missing miners were from a team drilling a new tunnel. The 3.5-4.0 magnitude quake was the strongest recorded in the mine, officials there said.

2018-05-07,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria plans to offer foreign investors concessions for farm land for the first time, according to an official document, as the oil producer seeks to boost food output and reduce reliance on imports. Under the plan, which is expected to be discussed by the cabinet this week before being submitted to parliament, any foreign investor would need to work in partnership with the state or a private Algerian firm, the document seen by Reuters said. Algeria, a member of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been encouraging farmers with incentives such as low interest loans in a bid cut the state’s $50 billion annual bill for food and other imports. The government relies on oil exports for about 60 percent of its revenues, which are only now starting to recover after a crash in crude prices from above $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016. “Agricultural concessions will also be open to foreigners,” the government said in the document on the initiative. The document did not give details about what areas of farmland would be offered or say how concessions would be granted. An official said details would be outlined in separate legislation. Foreign investors have long complained about bureaucratic red tape and other hurdles to investment in Algeria, a nation of 41 million people. In 2010, Algeria approved a law allowing private firms to lease state-owned farmland for 40 years. The private firms were allowed to enter partnerships with foreigners, but the foreign investors were not allowed to directly hold a concession. That initiative failed to provide a major agricultural boost. Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said this year that 3 million hectares from that scheme were still undeveloped and he promised more steps to improve the situation. Algeria, one of the world’s largest grain importers, bought 8.4 million tonnes of cereals in 2017 at a cost of $1.7 billion. The government aims to boost wheat output to 5.3 million tonnes by 2022 from 3.5 million tonnes in 2017. It also wants to double production of potatoes, milk, meat and other products in the next four years. As part of its effort to boost agriculture, the government plans to expand areas under irrigation to 2 million hectares in 2019 from 1.3 million hectares now with new dams, helping offset the reliance of farms on unpredictable rainfall.

2018-05-07,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline; changes dateline; previous LONDON) * Venezuela crisis, Iran nuclear pact drive oil prices * Dollar rallies to 2018 high as euro dips below $1.19 * Nestle deal with Starbucks, energy stocks lift equities By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to fresh 2018 highs on Monday while oil prices surged to their highest since late 2014, driven by declining Venezuelan crude production and worries the Unites States could re-impose sanctions on Iran. The crude surge lifted energy stocks in Europe and on Wall Street, with European shares supported by strong results and gains in Nestle after the Swiss company agreed to pay $7.15 billion to Starbucks in a global coffee alliance. The euro broke below $1.19 for the first time this year on weaker-than-expected German industrial orders and declining euro zone investor sentiment. Investors increased bets that rising U.S. interest rates would continue to boost the dollar, while traders unwound their bearish positions on the greenback. An index that tracks the dollar against a basket of leading currencies climbed to 92.974, its highest since December. The index was last up 0.18 percent at 92.729. “The general view right now is that the dollar is probably going to continue to move a bit higher against the euro in particular, maybe against the yen as well,” said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Solutions. The euro could slip to 117.50 or even 115 as a support level, Hatheway said, as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy and the European economy trends weaker, he said. “There’s a general appreciation the Fed is going to move at least twice again this year and the consensus is shifting toward three more moves this year.” The euro slid 0.27 percent to $1.1926, while the Japanese yen was little changed at 109.09 per dollar. Venezuelan oil exports came under threat after U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips moved to take Caribbean assets of state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award, three sources told Reuters. The move could further crimp PDVSA’s declining oil output and exports. Widespread expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will withdraw from the Iranian nuclear pact also weighed on crude prices. U.S. crude rose 73 cents to $70.45 a barrel, while Brent gained $1.22 to $76.09. Nestle rose 1.6 percent after it gained the rights to market Starbucks products around the world outside of the U.S. company’s coffee shops. Nestle was the biggest contributor to the 0.61 percent advance in the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares. Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and Total also were among the biggest contributors. On Wall Street, the S&P energy index was the biggest gainer, rising more than 2 percent, among the 11 major sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 163.91 points, or 0.68 percent, to 24,426.42, the S&P 500 gained 13.78 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,677.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.01 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,274.62. Euro zone government bond yields slid as the unexpected fall in German industrial output was seen as encouraging the European Central Bank to prolong an unwinding of stimulus. The yield on the benchmark 10-year German bund fell to 0.531 percent, while yields on U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.9572 percent.

2018-05-07,"BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Tourism is responsible for a twelfth of world greenhouse gas emissions, and a vacation boom is complicating a global drive to slow climate change, scientists said on Monday. Emissions from tourism, mostly by domestic travelers, were highest in the United States, China, Germany and India, according to a review of 160 nations led by the University of Sydney and published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Tourism, including flights, hotels, food and even the production of souvenirs, emitted the equivalent of 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2013, the most recent data available, or 8 percent of all man-made greenhouse gases, up from 3.9 billion in 2009, it said. That was far above many previous estimates, using narrower definitions, that tourism accounts for just 2.5 to 3.0 percent of world emissions, it said. And on current trends, the trillion-dollar tourism industry will emit 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon emissions by 2025, the review said, making it one of the fastest-growing source of the planet-warming gases that governments are trying to cut. Flights were the biggest single contributor, according to the study by scientists in Australia, Taiwan and Indonesia. “We recommend flying less and staying Earth-bound where possible, e.g. use public transport,” co-author Arunima Malik of the University of Sydney told Reuters in an email. Lead author Manfred Lenzen said plane tickets would have to be far more expensive to reflect the harm caused by greenhouse gas emissions from burning jet fuel. “If I flew from Melbourne to the UK return, I would pay at least an additional A$205 ($150) to offset my emissions; for a return trip between Sydney and Brisbane, about A$18 extra,” he wrote in a news release. Almost 200 nations are meeting in Bonn this week to write a “rule book” for the 2015 Paris Agreement, which seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions to avert more heat waves, downpours, droughts and extinctions. Patricia Espinosa, head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat hosting the talks, said the tourism industry itself was making “good progress” to clean up. “A lot of what the industry is selling depends on the preservation and conservation and the protection of the environment,” she told a news conference.   The study added up all emissions from tourism but did not try to compare how a holiday compared with staying at home, where people also emit greenhouse gases, through everything from heating to commuting.

It is not finished yet,” the senior official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. In recent years, Gulf countries have looked at ways to shake-up  their oil firms, including privatisations, to make them more efficient during a period of low oil prices. Saudi Arabia is seeking a public listing for its flagship oil company Saudi Aramco, while Abu Dhabi National Oil Co has embarked on a plan to privatise its services business and has signed deals with global partners on upstream projects. Oil prices have recently recovered to their highest since late 2014 following output cuts by major producers. McKinsey could not immediately be reached for a comment. Oman has been considering privatisations of a wide range of state firms for several years. Last year, it said it planned to sell shares in some state-owned downstream energy companies to the public, partly to raise money as low oil prices pressure its finances. With smaller oil and financial reserves than its wealthy neighbors, Oman has spent heavily on industrial and infrastructure projects to diversify its economy beyond oil.

A Nissan spokeswoman said there would be a gradual withdrawal of diesel cars in Europe. A source had earlier told Reuters last month that Nissan would cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland plant, Britain’s biggest automotive factory, due to falling demand for diesel models in Europe. The auto industry and its suppliers are facing a global regulatory crackdown on diesel emissions and are adjusting their businesses, including investing heavily in electric vehicles. German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is also still in the process of emerging from a 2015 emissions cheating scandal that resulted in about $30 billion (22.15 billion pounds) in fines and other costs.  “Along with other manufacturers and industry bodies we can see the progressive decline of diesel but we do not anticipate its sudden end in the short-term. At this point in time and for many customers, modern diesel engines will remain in demand and continue to be available within Nissan’s powertrain offering,” said the Nissan spokeswoman. “In Europe, where our diesel sales are concentrated, our electrification push will allow us to discontinue diesel gradually from passenger cars at the time of each vehicle renewal,” she added.

2018-05-07,"(Repeats with correct slug) CAIRO, May 7 (Reuters) - A planned pipeline connecting Cyprus’ Aphrodite gas field to Egypt’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities will cost between $800 million and $1 billion, Egyptian Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla said on Monday. Egypt has rapidly increased its production of natural gas and hopes to become a hub for exporting to Europe after making a series of big discoveries in recent years. Molla, speaking at a joint news conference with Cyprus Energy Minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis, said Cypriot gas would be used in part for domestic consumption and in part for export. Molla said last month that Egypt aims to sign an agreement with Cyprus for a pipeline to transport gas from the Aphrodite field to its LNG facilities. Lakkotrypis said a final agreement on the pipeline would be signed as quickly as possible but did not specify when. Egypt hopes to halt gas imports by 2019 and achieve self-sufficiency. Egypt has an extensive pipeline network and two idle gas liquefaction plants ready to export new gas as it arrives. The country believes its strategic location straddling the Suez Canal and the land bridge between Asia and Africa and its well-developed infrastructure will help turn it a trading and distribution center for countries in the region and beyond. Molla said that domestic gas production has increased to 5.7 billion cubic feet per day as a result of new production coming online, up from 5.5 billion in February. It rapidly increased its production of natural gas in 2017 with four major new gas production projects coming online, some ahead of schedule. Its newly discovered fields include the mammoth Zohr field discovered by Italy’s Eni in 2015.

With trading thinned by a holiday closure in London, European shares opened higher, boosted by energy stocks as well as encouraging earnings updates. “It’s a positive environment for the equity markets,” said Niels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea in Copenhagen. Nestle shares also gained after the Swiss-based food firm agreed to pay Starbucks $7.15 billion in cash for the rights to sell the U.S. coffee chain’s products around the world. Most Asian markets also rose after Friday’s tame reading on U.S. wage growth lessened the chances of a pick-up in the pace of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Gains were capped by  Sino-U.S. trade tensions. U.S. equity futures  pointed to a positive open for Wall Street. The day’s eye-catching moves came in energy markets. U.S. crude oil prices rose more than 70 cents, or 1.1 percent, pushing above $70 a barrel for the first time since November 2014 as the crisis in OPEC member state Venezuela threatened to further crimp its production and exports. Brent crude oil futures gained to $75.64 per barrel at 1210 GMT, up 1.14 percent and having also touched their highest since November 2014. Also driving oil prices higher was the May 12 deadline set by U.S. President Donald Trump for Europeans to “fix” the deal with Iran over its nuclear programme. If they do not, Trump has said he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief for the oil-producing Islamic Republic. Germany and France on Monday vowed to stand by the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers even if the United States pulls out. The European oil and gas share index was up 0.5 percent. The dollar rose to a new 2018 peak, extending its 2-1/2 week-long rally as investors unwound short positions against the currency and bet that the relative strength of the U.S. economy would feed through to a stronger greenback. Against a basket of currencies the dollar, which has enjoyed a sudden reversal in fortunes as investors bet on more Fed rate hikes and a slower pace of tightening in the euro zone, rose 0.4 percent to 92.968, having shrugged off Friday’s weaker-than-expected jobs report. The euro slid to below $1.19 versus the dollar,, down half a percent on the day and its weakest since Dec. 28. In data from the euro zone’s largest economy Germany, industrial orders unexpectedly dropped for the third month running in March, suggesting factories there are shifting into lower gear. The week ahead includes readings on the health of the Chinese economy and, U.S. inflation, and a Bank of England monetary policy meeting. “Looking at the U.S. economic data, everything is looking quite positive. No one expects higher interest rates to be a brake on economic growth,” said Christensen. The soft German data supported euro zone government bond markets as investors continued to bet on caution from the European Central Bank. “A lot has been repriced in terms of the ECB so the outlook for bonds is a bit more mixed,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann.

2018-05-07,"(Adds comments from French foreign minister, details, context) BERLIN, May 7 (Reuters) - Germany and France on Monday vowed to stand by the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers even if the United States pulls out, with the German foreign minister saying the world would be less safe without it. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to retreat from the deal by not extending sanctions waivers when they expire on May 12, unless European signatories of the accord fix what he calls its “flaws”. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said it was clear that the agreement made the world securer and there was a risk of escalation were it to be cancelled. “We don’t think there is any justifiable reason to pull out of this agreement and we continue to make the case for it to our American friends,” Maas said during a joint news conference with visiting French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. “We’ll deal with the (U.S.) decision but like Jean-Yves said, we want to adhere to this agreement,” Maas added. Le Drian said France, Britain and Germany would keep to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran irrespective of the United States’ decision later this week because it is the best way to avoid nuclear proliferation. “We are determined to save this deal because this accord safeguards against nuclear proliferation and is the right way to stop Iran getting a nuclear weapon,” Le Drian said. France, Germany and Britain have for weeks been campaigning to keep the deal alive and have been negotiating since January with the U.S. to find ways to convince Trump to keep to the accord. Maas said “good proposals” had been made in recent weeks. In an effort to keep Washington in the deal, the three EU states have been discussing how to tackle Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 - when key provisions of the deal expire - and its role in the wars in Syria and Yemen. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday the United States would regret any decision to leave the deal and Tehran would fiercely resist U.S. pressure to limit its influence in the Middle East.

2018-05-07,"* Production seen at 481 million tonnes in 2018 and 2019 * 400 mln tonne output cap in 2019 unlikely -mining ministry * Miners waiting up to 12 months for excavators - contractor (Adds industry comments) By Fergus Jensen NUSA DUA, Indonesia, May 7 (Reuters) - Indonesia is targeting annual production of 481 million tonnes of coal this year and next, a mining ministry official said on Monday, as producers of the fuel are struggling to get new heavy equipment and parts. That’s up around 4 percent from the 461 million tonnes Indonesia produced in 2017. Indonesia’s National Development Planning Board (BAPPENAS) has pushed for coal output to be capped at 400 million tonnes in 2019, but according to coal and minerals director general Bambang Gatot Ariyono that target needs to be “harmonised” with other considerations. “Otherwise there could be idle capacity or (miners’) coal production could be sub-optimal,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the Coaltrans Asia conference. Ariyono referred to environmental permits allowing output to reach 609 million tonnes this year and 651 million tonnes in 2019, and feasibility studies presenting other figures. Amid concerns Indonesia could exhaust existing minable coal reserves of 13 billion tonnes 25 years, the government is considering measures to push miners to carry out exploration work before they can obtain permits to increase output. “It could start next year,” Ariyono said. Indonesian coal exploration has increased as “almost all” miners have increased their capital spending this year, Pandu Sjahrir, chairman of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association, told reporters. “To improve the mine life a lot of miners are carrying out pre-stripping and increasing stripping ratios to increase reserves. That’s a saving for the future - almost all players,” he said. However, heavy equipment shortages are limiting expansion, particularly for smaller miners, Sjahrir said. “In general, getting equipment parts is difficult (and) up to the middle of 2019 it will be difficult to increase production, but for smaller players it will be more difficult because of shortages of financing.” Suppliers remain wary of providing equipment to contractors as purchases of costly heavy equipment are often repaid over a period of up to five years, Sjahrir said. According to Andy Coles, president director of mining services contractor BIS Industries, waiting times for 200-tonne excavators are currently around 12 months. “Everyone is looking for equipment,” he said. Shortages of equipment like trucks, rollers and graders made by Caterpillar Inc, Komatsu and Volvo mean it is harder for miners to ramp up output and take advantage of recent improvements in coal prices, he said. The shortages also threatened to disrupt mining operations, Coles added. “When you get rain combined with no maintenance you get a significant deterioration of roads (and) that impacts your hauling equipment, destroys the springs. Engines, everything falls apart.” According to Indika Energy Group Managing Director Azis Armand, wet weather hit operations of many Indonesian miners in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, but conditions are now improving.

Putin was sworn in for another term, buoyed by popular support but weighed down by a costly confrontation with the West, a fragile economy and uncertainty about what happens when his term ends. The make-up of the new government is one of the key uncertainties that still hang over the market. Whoever Putin puts forward as prime minister, the decision is widely expected to be supported by Russia’s parliament. “The market is pricing in the appointment of strong economists for the key roles,” Alor Brokerage said. The rouble shed 0.6 percent to 62.88 against the dollar as of 0951 GMT and eased 0.3 percent to trade at 74.98 versus the euro. The finance ministry put pressure on the rouble, announcing a 34 percent increase in the amount of foreign currency it plans to purchase on the Moscow Exchange over the next month. “The rouble is weakening after an excessive strengthening last Friday,” a dealer at a major Russian bank in Moscow said. “The market is thin, half of the dealers are away,” he said, referring to Russia’s so-called May holidays that usually see people taking holidays in the first half of the month. Prices for oil, Russia’s key export, had a positive impact on the Russian market. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark, was up 0.9 percent at $75.53 a barrel. Higher oil pushed Russian stock indexes higher. The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 1.0 percent to 1,157.5 points, while its rouble-based peer MOEX rose 0.9 percent to 2,310.6 points.

2018-05-07,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Aker BP (AKERBP.OL), partly owned by oil major BP (BP.L), beat quarterly earnings forecasts on Monday, helped by record output and higher oil prices, and said it may drill more wells this year than previously planned. The company, controlled by a Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, is focusing more on developing its existing business after growing via a series of acquisitions, including last year’s purchase of Hess (HES.N) assets for $2 billion (1.5 billion pounds). Thanks to the latest purchase, which included a stake in the Valhall field, the company reported record first-quarter production of 158,600 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd), up from 145,300 boepd in the same quarter a year ago. Its January-March operating profit (EBIT) was $472 million, compared with the average forecast of $449 million in a Reuters poll of analysts, and $273 million a year ago.  The company repeated plans to increase full-year dividends by $100 million in 2019 from $450 million this year. At 1000 GMT, Aker BP shares were up 6.4 percent at 282 Norwegian crowns.  Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said the company still saw “significant and interesting” acquisition targets on the Norwegian continental shelf, although the competition had increased since a year ago. Meanwhile, the company will step efforts to find resources itself by drilling 12-14 exploration wells this year, up from the previously planned 12. Aker BP said it had postponed two wells in the Barents Sea until 2019, but would drill more wells around its recent 30-60 million boe Frosk discovery south of Alvheim field. The company repeated its financial guidance for 2018, including a plan to spend $350 million on exploration, but saw rates in longer-term rig contracts going up. “There is a bit of cost inflation ... The long-end of those contracts are turning upwards,” Hersvik said. Aker BP expects to resolve its dispute with majority state-owned Statoil over development of the so-called North of Alvheim and Askja-Krafla (NOAKA) area in the North Sea by the end of 2018. Aker BP wants to develop a group of discoveries containing about 500 million boe by using a manned processing platform, combined with offshore wind turbines to provide power, while Statoil wants to have two unmanned processing platforms. The companies have to get an approval from the government for the project, which could be the largest development off Norway after Statoil’s Johan Castberg Arctic oilfield. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in March it expected start-up of the NOAKA project to be delayed by one year until 2023 due to the dispute.

2018-05-07,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France and four other European Union countries have called for ambitious CO2 emissions reduction targets for trucks, ahead of a proposal from the European Commission expected later this month.  In a position paper, seen by Reuters, France says it wants “ambitious objectives to be fixed for 2025, 2030 and 2050 in order to expand efforts to decarbonise transport.” In another letter, seen by Reuters, ministers from Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Luxembourg call on the Commission to set a CO2 emission reduction target of at least 24 percent for 2025 and 35-45 percent for 2030. Unlike other countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada, the EU has no limits on CO2 emissions from trucks, which account for a quarter of road transport emissions while making up just 5 percent of the vehicles on the road. The Commission will propose the EU’s first-ever CO2 standards for trucks on May 16, following which they will have to be agreed by the European Parliament and national governments. It has already indicated that it is looking at an interim target for 2025 to be followed by a stricter one in 2030. Both documents called on the Commission to introduce a review clause for 2021 to set the final 2030 target and lower it if necessary. The auto industry has said it would welcome the introduction of CO2 standards for trucks and that a “realistic ambition level would be a 16 percent tail-pipe CO2 reduction between 2019 and 2030, with an intermediate target of 7 percent in 2025.” “As this is the first time that CO2 targets are set for heavy-duty vehicles, it is of utmost importance that they are designed properly, and reflect the diversity of the truck market,” said Joachim Drees, CEO of truckmaker MAN (VOWG_p.DE). The EU wants to curb greenhouse gas emissions from transport as part of a drive to cut emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Luxembourg, Ireland, Lithuania and the Netherlands also called for “ambitious and mandatory 2025 and 2030 sales targets of zero emissions trucks for OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).” “Member states are crystal clear that they want 2025 targets that will fully decarbonise trucks by 2050,” said Stef Cornelis, cleaner trucks officer of campaign group Transport & Environment.  “To achieve this Europe needs to introduce 2025 standards that will cut emissions of new trucks by 24 percent.

2018-05-07,"JERUSALEM/NICOSIA (Reuters) - An ownership squabble over Cyprus’ main natural gas field is threatening to delay multi-billion dollar plans to turn the eastern Mediterranean into a major energy hub. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz are flying to Cyprus on Tuesday to spur plans to join the two countries’ electricity grids and construct a pipeline to link newly found gas fields to mainland Europe. Standing in the way, however, is a dispute over Aphrodite, a gas field discovered in 2011 at the edge of Cyprus’ economic waters. One tip of it stretches across the border into Israel’s maritime zone. At stake is 7-10 billion cubic metres of gas worth close to $1.5 billion (1.1 billion pounds), according to one recent estimate in Israel.  That is less than 10 percent of Aphrodite’s total reserves and a fraction of the gas already discovered in Israel. Israel says it will not give up on the gas and the companies operating on the Israeli side are ready for legal action in case Aphrodite is developed without them. “I assume we will find a solution in good spirit so we can keep cooperating on bigger, more important, things,” Steinitz told Reuters. Several large gas fields have been discovered in the region over the past decade and Israel and Cyprus have grown close while collaborating in their development.  Steinitz says he and his Cypriot counterpart, Yiorgos Lakkotrypis, have become good friends. But that does not guarantee a quick solution. “The government of Israel cannot give up, not even as a gesture of friendship, on its territories or its natural resources,” Steinitz said. He said the governments have asked the companies to reach an understanding among themselves on how much gas is on each side. “If they don’t reach an understanding, then we will ask a professional arbiter or a professional group ... to examine the findings from both sides and decide on the proper division,” he said.     The Cypriot Energy Ministry declined to comment, but officials in Nicosia said Lakkotrypis has suggested a similar course of action. Steinitz said during his visit that the countries may agree on a general format to solve the issue, but a final agreement could take weeks or months. Charles Ellinas, CEO of energy consultancy e-CNHC, said this should not be a deal breaker. “If the two governments between them agree to abide by the findings of the arbitration then it takes the heat out of it. And that’s what they need to do at this meeting this week,” he said. Aphrodite is smaller than two huge gas fields, Tamar and Leviathan, discovered in Israel around the same time, but it was a milestone for Cyprus. Developing it are Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Texas-based Noble Energy (NBL.N) and Israel’s Delek Drilling (DEDRp.TA). They are looking to sell the gas domestically and abroad, with a focus on Egypt, where Shell has a liquefaction plant. The field is also meant to be a link in the 2,000 km pipeline being planned by IGI Poseidon, a joint venture between Greece’s natural gas firm DEPA and Italian energy group Edison, to carry Israeli and Cypriot gas to western Greece. A final investment decision on the pipeline, with an expected price tag of up to 6 billion euros (5.3 billion), could come next year. Deep-sea exploration in both countries continues and many current and future discoveries will likely be connected to each other to cut costs on infrastructure. The Aphrodite partners would not comment on the dispute, though a footnote in Delek’s 2017 financial report stated that “the vast majority” of gas was in Cyprus and a “minority” was in the adjacent Yishai prospect on the Israeli side. The Yishai consortium, which includes energy firm Israel Opportunity (ISOP.TA) and Nammax Oil and Gas, a company linked to billionaire Beny Steinmetz, has already spent $120 million on exploratory drilling. The group commissioned a third-party assessment that concluded Yishai’s estimated 7-10 bcm of gas could be worth close to $1.5 billion. Production will have to happen in Cyprus since that is where most of the gas lies, said Rony Halman, chairman of Israel Opportunity, but he envisions the Yishai group being like “smaller partners for Aphrodite, but we will be part of the system”. They are prepared to bring a legal challenge in Europe in case of any opposition. “We as a company will bring a commercial claim that will stop the development. We have already sat with lawyers in London. We retained lawyers for this issue,” Halman said. “We are not willing to give up on this.” Additional reporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Jason Neely",https://uk.reuters.com/article/israel-cyprus-aphrodite/cyprus-israel-seek-gas-sharing-formula-to-unlock-east-med-energy-hub-idUKL8N1SD08P,07 May 2018,"An ownership squabble

In November, Siemens said it would cut 6,900 jobs, mainly at the PG division, which once thrived on supplying turbines for electricity generation. Excluding its services business, the PG division has around 30,000 employees worldwide, of which 12,000 are based in Germany. “The shutdowns are part of a comprehensive package of measures, which also includes issues such as travel costs, sponsoring, participation in trade fairs and investments,” Siemens said in a statement on Monday. Siemens said it aimed to temporarily shut down all of its PG sites after the Pentecost holiday later in May, depending on local regulation. It did not say how long each site would be closed for. In Siemens’ fiscal first quarter through end-December, the division’s profit nearly halved and its profit margin shrank from 12 percent to 7.6 percent, well below the target range of 11 to 15 percent. Analysts on average expect this to have accelerated in the second quarter, with the division’s profit seen down 62 percent from the year-earlier period, according to a Reuters poll.  Siemens is due to publish second-quarter results on Wednesday.

2018-05-07,"* China could increase import quota by 500,000 T - Li * Indonesia exported 3.73 mln T of palm oil to China in 2017 * China-Indonesia discussed closer economic ties (Adds comment, background) By Agustinus Beo Da Costa BOGOR, Indonesia, May 7 (Reuters) - China is open to increasing its import quota of Indonesian palm oil by at least 500,000 tonnes, Premier Li Keqiang said on Monday, speaking after a meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo at the country’s presidential palace in Bogor. Li’s comment came at a joint news conference with Widodo before the Chinese premier travelled to Jakarta to visit the headquarters of ASEAN. The two countries also signed a number of memoranda of understanding, including on the construction of dams in Indonesia’s Sulawesi island and South Kalimantan province on Borneo. China currently consumes 5 million tonnes of palm oil, said Li, scheduled to fly on Tuesday from Jakarta to Tokyo for a summit with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, exported 3.73 million tonnes of palm oil to China last year, a leading destinations after India and the European Union. Li said boosting palm oil imports was aimed at helping smallholder farmers in Indonesia, and said China also planned to increase coffee and tropical fruit imports. “Indonesian agricultural products have an advantage, we do not have many of them in China,” Li told reporters. According to data from Indonesia’s investment agency, China was the third-largest foreign investor in Indonesia last year, contributing around 10 percent of total foreign direct investment. “We discussed an increase in economic cooperation including trade,” said President Widodo, speaking at the news conference. “As a country with a 1.37 billion population, China is a big market for Indonesia. I stressed about exports increasing from Indonesia to China.” said Widodo. Indonesia’s palm oil exports have come under pressure in Europe where lawmakers have approved draft measures on power reform that include plans to ban the use of palm oil in biodiesel from 2021, even though the E.U. recently removed anti-dumping duties for imports of biodiesel containing palm oil for some Indonesian producers. China sees Indonesia as a key partner in its Belt and Road initiative that aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. Indonesia said last week it was seeking ways to accelerate a $5 billion high-speed rail project being built by a consortium of local and Chinese state firms, which is facing obstacles from land ownership issues.

2018-05-07,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian jet fuel buyers are paying the highest premiums for this time of year in 10 years as new and expanded airports in the region push its consumption to new highs. The premium for jet fuel cargoes in the Asian trading hub of Singapore was $1.01 a barrel above benchmark quotes on Friday JET-SIN-DIF, the highest for this time of year since 2008, according to data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. (Chart: bit.ly/2I1SpM6) The booming aviation market has also pushed up the profit margins, known as cracks, refiners make from producing jet fuel to their highest since early 2015. JETSGCKMc1  Demand for jet fuel, which is composed of the middle distillate fuel kerosene that is also used for heating, was expected to ease after the winter heating season, but consumption has stayed strong on a jump in orders from the aviation industry. The demand earlier this winter drove the jet fuel/kerosene premium to $2.28 a barrel Feb. 27, the most since May 2008. “A rise in air-passenger traffic coming from increasing consumer affluence and improving infrastructure supports the strength in Asian jet fuel demand growth,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu of energy consultancy FGE. The Asia Pacific region makes up over one-third of the global air passenger market, gaining on average a bit over 1 percent in global market share per year. “Asia will remain the corner-stone for global jet fuel demand expansion in the coming decades,” Paravaikkarasu said. In March alone, Asia’s passenger traffic rose by 12 percent compared to last year, according to data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) released last week. “The strong first quarter provides healthy momentum heading into the peak travel period in the northern hemisphere. Benign economic conditions are supporting — and being supported by —good demand for air travel,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s chief executive said last week. The current run of seasonal oil refinery maintenance in Asia has added to the pricing pressure by curtailing the supply of jet fuel available to the market.  There is 2.46 million barrels per day (bpd) of Asian oil refining capacity planned to undergo maintenance in May, according to data from consultants Energy Aspects. That is nearly equal to the crude oil demand of South Korea. This supply tightness is occurring as travel demand in country’s like China and India spur more jet consumption. China’s domestic air traffic alone climbed 15 percent in March from a year ago, the strongest pace in five months, IATA data showed. India’s March domestic traffic rose by 28 percent, marking the 43rd straight month of double-digit growth, as the government embarks on an ambitious infrastructure development plan. Lagging slightly behind India and China, but still seeing strong expansion thanks to economic growth and rising tourism figures, is Southeast Asia.  Singapore’s DBS Bank expects passenger growth for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), home to more than 600 million people in 10 countries, to be around 6 percent in 2018. The general boom in demand is a boon for refiners. Asia’s jet fuel crack was at $15.75 per barrel above benchmark Dubai crude, more than 50 percent higher than a year ago. The cracks peaked at $18.03 in February. For all of 2018, Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta, said he expects an average jet fuel crack of $16.50 per barrel. While an advantage for refiners, the high jet fuel prices threaten airline profits, for whom fuel is by far the biggest cost factor. “We are on track to post a profit in 2018, but (this) will depend on the fuel price going ahead,” said Pahala Mansury, chief executive of Indonesia’s state-owned carrier Garuda (GIAA.JK), this week.

2018-05-07,"MOSCOW, May 7 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble weakened in early trade on Monday ahead of Vladimir Putin’s inauguration for a six-year presidential term that will be followed by the appointment of a new government later this week. The configuration of the new government is one of the key uncertainties that still hang over the market. Whoever Putin’s protege for the prime minister seat is, the decision is widely expected to be supported by the parliament. “The market is pricing in appointment of strong economists for the key roles in the government,” Alor Brokerage said in a note. At 0715 GMT, the rouble was 0.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 62.75 and eased 0.1 percent to trade at 74.28 versus the euro. Room for a recovery in the rouble, hit hard by U.S. sanctions in April, is limited by expectations that the Russian finance ministry will increase daily purchases of foreign currency for state coffers this month. Prices for oil, Russia’s key export, play on the upside for the Russian market. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark, was up 0.7 percent at $75.40 a barrel. Higher oil pushed Russian stock indexes higher. The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 1.0 percent to 1,157.9 points, while its rouble-based peer MOEX rose 0.7 percent to 2,305.8 points.

Energy shares were on a roll as oil prices hit their highest in more than three years amid strains in Venezuela’s output and talk of possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran.

2018-05-07,"HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips has moved to take Caribbean assets of Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award over a decade-oil nationalization of its projects in the South American country, according to three sources familiar with its actions. The U.S. firm targeted facilities on the islands of Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius that accounted for about a quarter of Venezuela’s oil exports last year. The three play key roles in processing, storing and blending PDVSA’s oil for export.  The company received court attachments freezing assets at least two of the facilities, and could move to sell them, one of the sources said.  Conoco’s legal maneuvers could further impair PDVSA’s declining oil revenue and the country’s convulsing economy. Venezuela is almost completely dependent on oil exports, which have fallen by a third since its peak and its refineries ran at just 31 percent of capacity in the first quarter.  The Latin American country is in the grip of a deep recession with severe shortages of medicine and food as well as a growing exodus of its people.  PDVSA and the Venezuelan foreign ministry did not respond on Sunday to requests for comment. Dutch authorities said they are assessing the situation on Bonaire.       Conoco’s claims against Venezuela and state-run PDVSA in international courts have totaled $33 billion, the largest by any company.  “Any potential impacts on communities are the result of PDVSA’s illegal expropriation of our assets and its decision to ignore the judgment of the ICC tribunal,” Conoco said in an email to Reuters.     The U.S firm added it will work with the community and local authorities to address issues that may arise as a result of enforcement actions. PDVSA has significant assets in the Caribbean. On Bonaire, it owns the 10-million-barrel BOPEC terminal which handles logistics and fuel shipments to customers, particularly in Asia. In Aruba, PDVSA and its unit Citgo lease a refinery and a storage terminal.  On the island of St. Eustatius, it rents storage tanks at the Statia terminal, owned by U.S. NuStar Energy, where over 4 million barrels of Venezuelan crude were retained by court order, according to one of the sources.  NuStar is aware of the order and “assessing our legal and commercial options,” said spokesman Chris Cho. The company does not expect the matter to change its earnings outlook, he said.  Conoco also sought to attach PDVSA inventories on Curacao, home of the 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery and Bullenbay oil terminal. But the order could not immediately be enforced, according to two of the sources. Last year, PDVSA’s shipments from Bonaire and St Eustatius terminals accounted for about 10 percent of its total exports, according to internal figures from the state-run company. The exports were mostly crude and fuel oil for Asian customers including ChinaOil, China’s Zhenhua Oil and India’s Reliance Industries. From its largest Caribbean operations in Curacao, PDVSA shipped 14 percent of its exports last year, including products exported by its Isla refinery to Caribbean islands and crude from its Bullenbay terminal to buyers of Venezuelan crude all over the world.  PDVSA on Friday ordered its oil tankers sailing across the Caribbean to return to Venezuelan waters and await further instructions, according to a document viewed by Reuters. In the last year, several cargoes of Venezuelan crude have been retained or seized in recent years over unpaid freight fees and related debts. “This is terrible (for PDVSA),” said a source familiar with the court order of attachment. The state-run company “cannot comply with all the committed volume for exports” and the Conoco action imperils its ability to ship fuel oil to China or access inventories to be exported from Bonaire.       At the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Conoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for broken contracts and loss of future profits from two oil producing joint ventures, which were nationalized in 2007 under late Venezuela President Hugo Chavez. The U.S. firm left the country after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA.  A separate arbitration case involving the loss of its Venezuelan assets is before a World Bank tribunal, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. Exxon Mobil Corp also has brought two separate arbitration claims over the 2007 nationalization of its projects in Venezuela.

2018-05-07,"* Brent just under $75/b, WTI at almost $70/b * U.S. deadline over Iran looms on May 12 * Highest U.S. oil drilling since 2015 holds market back By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 7 (Reuters) - Oil markets held firm on Monday, with prices near late-2014 highs as a decision looms on whether the United States walks away from a deal with Iran and instead re-imposes sanctions on Tehran. Brent crude oil futures were at $74.94 per barrel at 0035 GMT, up 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were also up 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $69.79 per barrel. The slightly rise in prices came after WTI on Friday hit its highest level since November 2014. “Crude oil prices pushed higher as concerns over the impact of the U.S. pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal continue to drive investor sentiment,” ANZ bank said on Monday. “The big story this week is going to be about oil and the Iran Nuclear deal. We know President Trump doesn’t like it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. “All in all, the bets are – based on the price action in oil – that President Trump does withdraw from the deal,” he added. Iran re-emerged as a major oil exporter in 2016 after international sanctions against it were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. The United States has since then, however, expressed doubts over Iran’s sincerity in implementing those curbs. Trump has threatened to walk away from the 2015 agreement by not extending sanctions waivers when they expire on May 12, which would likely result in a reduction of Iran’s oil exports. Some traders, however, are becoming cautious about ever higher oil prices. Hedge funds cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to May 1, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday, reducing their exposure to positions that would profit from further crude price rises by 11,825 contracts to 444,060. Looming over markets is surging output from the United States, where crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has soared by more than a quarter in the last two years, to 10.62 million barrels per day. Only Russia produces more, at around 11 million bpd. U.S. output will likely rise further this year, towards or past Russia’s levels, as its energy firms keep drilling for more. U.S. energy companies added nine oil rigs looking for new production in the week to May 4, bringing the total count to 834, the highest level since March 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said last Friday.

That outlook cheered Wall Street where the Dow ended Friday up 1.39 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 1.28 percent and the Nasdaq 1.71 percent. Apple Inc hit a record high after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed that it had raised its stake in the iPhone maker. The recent run of solid U.S. economic news contrasts with a softer turn in European data and lifted the dollar to its highest for the year so far against the euro. The single currency was last at $1.1961, having been down as deep as $1.1911 on Friday.  The dollar also reached its highest since December against a basket of currencies and was last trading at 92.576. It had less luck against the Japanese yen, in part because strains in emerging market currencies were supporting safe havens such as the yen. The dollar was at 109.03, having topped out around 110.05 last week. “It’s this recovery in the U.S. dollar – one based on the data flow in the U.S. against the rest of the world – which is catching many by surprise and causing ructions across emerging markets,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. Markets from Argentina to Turkey have been under intense pressure, in part because many of these countries have large amounts of U.S. dollar debt which gets more expensive to finance as the currency rises. A firming U.S. dollar has also been negative for some commodities, with gold falling for a third straight week to last trade at $1,114.79 an ounce. Oil, on the other hand, was near its highest in more than three years as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran. President Donald Trump has set a May 12 deadline for Europeans to “fix” the deal with Iran over its nuclear program or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief for the oil-producing Islamic Republic. Brent crude futures added 11 cents to $74.98 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained 9 cents to $69.81.
