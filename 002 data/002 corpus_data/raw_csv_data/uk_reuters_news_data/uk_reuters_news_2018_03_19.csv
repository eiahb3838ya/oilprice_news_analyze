The coal producer’s underlying profit rose to A$115.6 mln for the half-year ended Jan. 31 from A$54.9 million a year earlier. The Ipswich-based company also reported a 36 percent rise in its revenue for the period, as burgeoning sales volume boosted its top-line. Demand for high quality Australian coal remains strong in Asia, underpinned by the construction of modern, efficient coal fired power stations, Managing Director Shane Stephan said. Australian thermal coal exports from Newcastle port averaged $100 a tonne in the during the period, up from $85 a year earlier, and are currently trading at $94.95 a tonne.

2018-03-19,"(Adds details on detention, oil purge) By Mircely Guanipa PUNTO FIJO, March 19 (Reuters) - Venezuela has arrested the former refining boss of state oil company PDVSA for alleged corruption, two sources told Reuters on Monday, extending a crackdown on the OPEC nation’s ailing oil sector. Veteran oil executive Jesus Luongo joins a list of dozens of oil managers who have been arrested over the last few months for alleged graft in crisis-wrought Venezuela. Former oil minister Eulogio Del Pino and former PDVSA President Nelson Martinez are the most high-profile prisoners of the sweep that began late last year. Authorities had issued an arrest warrant for Luongo and four other oil executives, the two sources with knowledge of the detention said. Luongo turned himself on Monday in the northwestern Paraguana peninsula, home to Venezuela’s biggest refining complex, which he once led, one of the sources said. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, the other source added. PDVSA and the Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Luongo. Luongo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Whatsapp. The messaging system said he had not logged on since Sunday. Socialist President Nicolas Maduro has promised a vast anti-corruption purge to cleanse the oil industry of “mafias.” At least 70 executives have been detained so far, panicking PDVSA workers, depriving Venezuela’s oil industry of much of its top brass and stalling decision-making in the company overseeing the world’s biggest crude reserves, insiders have said. The opposition dismisses the probe as a power struggle within the government, noting that the industry has been under tight control of the Socialist Party since early in the late President Hugo Chavez’s 14-year rule. State prosecutor Tarek Saab, a former ruling party governor, has blasted those accusations as an opposition effort to discredit what he calls a “crusade” against graft. His office has called a press conference on Tuesday to make announcements about “the fight against corruption.” (Additional reporting by Alexandra Ulmer in Caracas; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-corruption/update-1-venezuela-arrests-ex-oil-refining-boss-for-alleged-graft-sources-idUKL1N1R11WO,19 Mar 2018,"Venezuela has arrested the

2018-03-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The heads of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Agriculture Department are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to winnow down proposals to lower the cost of the nation’s biofuels policy to oil refiners, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The meeting in Washington marks the latest development in the Trump administration’s efforts to find common ground between the rival oil and corn industries over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard, a law requiring refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s gasoline and diesel. The program has created a vast new market for Midwest corn farmers, but refiners have complained the regulation costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year - creating a rift between two of Trump’s key electoral constituencies. EPA chief Scott Pruitt and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue will draft a list of options for President Donald Trump to choose from during their meeting on Tuesday, according to the sources, who asked not to be named discussing the confidential matter. It is unclear whether the list will include a broad range of options mooted by both sides during recent negotiations hosted by the White House, or whether it will provide narrower recommendations, the sources said.  Officials for the EPA and Agriculture Department did not respond to requests for comment. The RFS requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel each year, or buy credits, known as RINs, from those that do. As biofuels volumes have increased, the price of RINs has too. Merchant refiners such as Valero and bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions say the costs have become too burdensome. Trump told lawmakers and industry officials in a closed-door meeting earlier this month that he supported a temporary cap on the price of RINs at 10 cents each, according to a source who attended but asked not to be named. But a group of corn-state lawmakers told Trump in a letter last week that a cap would have “severe and immediate” consequences to farmers and the biofuels industry, by reducing incentives for blending.  Trump also said he supported expanding sales of high-ethanol gasoline year-round – a tweak long sought by ethanol producers, according to the source.  Credit costs have fallen roughly 40 percent in the past three weeks amid the political uncertainty, trading at 40 cents each on Monday, traders said.

2018-03-19,"NEW YORK, 2018 - U.S. stocks joined a broad decline in global equity markets on Monday as traders turned cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting this week and amid continuing concerns about the threat of a global trade war.  At the same time, shares of Facebook Inc (FB.O) shed nearly 7 percent after reports that a political consultancy that worked on U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million of the social network’s users. That decline dragged other technology stocks, which have led the market higher over the last two years.  “If they start to decay, then it may leave investors wondering what’s left to become the new leader to resume the bulls’ advance,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell as much as 425 during the session and ended won 335.60 points, or 1.35 percent, at 24,610.91. The S&P 500 .SPX index lost 39.09 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,712.92 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite .IXIC index dropped 155.07 points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,334.24. MSCI’s main 47-country world stock index fell 1.1 percent in afternoon trading after European stocks dipped and benchmark U.S. indexes declined. Global equities are on their worst run since November. The drop in European and U.S. indexes came as central banks appeared to be preparing for more rate hikes. A Reuters report that the European Central Bank expects a rate hike by mid-2019 started helping the euro recover from a difficult morning against the dollar. Wall Street is looking toward the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday, with 104 analysts polled by Reuters expecting the central bank will raise rates 25 basis points to a range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent. Yields in benchmark 10-year Treasuries held steady, reflecting investor rate hike expectations.    After the meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a his first press conference as the central bank’s new chief.  Analysts at JPMorgan see a risk the Fed might not only add one more rate rise for this year but for 2019 as well. “The worst case is the ‘18 and ‘19 dots both move up - the Fed is currently guiding to five hikes in ‘18 and ‘19 combined, but under this scenario that would shift to seven hikes,” they warned in a note to clients. “Stocks would probably tolerate one net dot increase over ‘18 and ‘19, but a bump in both years could create problems.” The dollar index .DXY fell 0.4 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.39 percent to $1.2335 Any nod to four hikes would normally be considered as bullish for the U.S. dollar, yet the currency has shown scant overall correlation to interest rates in recent months. Dealers cite concerns about the U.S. budget and current account deficits, chaos in the White House, better growth in overseas markets, particularly Europe, and the risk of a U.S.-led trade war. Fears of a global trade war triggered by Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports cast a cloud over a two-day G20 meeting in Buenos Aires this week. The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates weighed on non-yielding gold XAU=, which touched its lowest in more than two weeks but turned positive in later trade, up 0.3 percent at $1,317.49 per ounce by 1:33 p.m. EST (1733 GMT). Oil prices eased after ending last week with a solid bounce. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.5 percent to settle at $62.06 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 settled at $66.05, down 0.24 percent on the day.

2018-03-19,"WARSAW (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she hoped authorities in Warsaw would satisfy Europe’s concerns over the rule of law in Poland, as the two countries also faced gaps to bridge over migration and a new gas pipeline. Merkel travelled to Warsaw on her second foreign trip since being sworn in for a fourth term to highlight Germany’s commitment to Poland at a time of tension relations with both Russia and the United States. Following a meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, she said she hoped talks between Poland and EU authorities would be successful. In December, the European Commission launched a rule-of-law procedure - known as Article 7 - against Poland over reforms that Brussels says undermine the independence of the country’s judiciary. “I hope that the issue of Article 7 proceedings ... can be settled,” Merkel said via a translator at a joint conference with Morawiecki. Brussels has given Poland three months to address its concerns.  Morawiecki said Poland had entered a “constructive dialogue” with the European Commission. “I can say that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that we will reach an agreement,” he said.     Merkel must pull off a delicate balancing act - reassuring Warsaw about Berlin’s commitment to NATO military spending targets while not backing away from the EU core principles that the European Commission says Poland has undermined. Neither leader mentioned the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline designed to ship Russian gas to Germany, avoiding transit through Ukraine. It has Germany’s approval, but Poland has urged that Western sanctions be imposed on it . Ties between Germany and Poland have worsened since the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) came to power in Warsaw in 2015, with the two countries also at odds over Poland’s refusal to take in asylum seekers under an EU-wide quota system. “I am confident that this new federal government will approach the Polish-German relations with new energy,” Merkel said. “We on the German side would wish good, intensive, friendly relations with Poland for the good of Europe and our two countries.” Additional reporting by Pawel Florkiewicz in WARSAW and Joseph Nasr in BERLIN; Writing by Marcin Goettig and Justyna Pawlak; editing by John Stonestreet",https://uk.reuters.com/article/poland-germany-merkel/update-1-merkel-hopes-poland-can-satisfy-eu-concerns-over-judicial-reform-idUKL8N1R16U4,19 Mar 2018,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel

2018-03-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Monday as Wall Street slid more than 1 percent and energy market investors remained wary of growing crude supply, although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran gave prices some support. Brent crude futures dropped 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, to settle at $66.05 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell 28 cents, or 0.5 percent, to end at $62.06 a barrel.  “The equity markets are certainly a driving factor behind this slide today,” said Brian LaRose, technical analyst at United-ICAP in Jersey City. “Since the open, they have been hit pretty hard,” he said.  Wall Street’s main indexes fell more than 1.5 percent as investors worried about a potential trade war and as Facebook shares dragged down the tech sector. [.N] Oil prices have been increasingly moving in tandem with equities.  Strong demand, however, prevented oil from sliding further, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “We keep talking about all this shale oil production, but it’s not really showing up that much in global inventories; they continue to be tight,” Flynn said.  Still, last week’s rise in the U.S. rig count remains a potential headwind for oil bulls. U.S. drillers added four oil rigs last week, bringing the total count to 800, Baker Hughes  said on Friday.  “At the current oil price level, drilling activity – and thus output – in the U.S. is likely to increase further,” analysts at Commerzbank said in a note.      U.S. crude oil production has risen more than a fifth since mid-2016, to 10.38 million barrels per day (bpd). Prices also climbed on Friday after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom would develop nuclear weapons if arch-rival Iran did. “This week there will be ... a pricing of some geopolitical risk with the crown prince going on a visit to the United States which is likely to provide a lot of headlines against Iran and the (sanctions) deal,” Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said, referring to Iran’s pact that has removed sanctions on that country in return for limits on its nuclear program.  President Donald Trump has criticized the deal frequently, raising the possibility that the United States could stop its sanctions relief.  Britain, France and Germany have proposed fresh European Union sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles program and its role in Syria’s war.

2018-03-19,"PARIS (Reuters) - France and its arms suppliers face heightened legal risks for supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE despite warnings such arms could be used in the war in Yemen, a law firm’s report commissioned by human rights groups said on Monday. The two Gulf Arab states are leading a coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than three million. The report follows criticism of President Emmanuel Macron by rights groups and French lawmakers over his support for the coalition, opaque arms sales and inadequate safeguards to prevent its weapons being used in Yemen operations.  “This study shows a legally high risk that France’s arms transfers are contrary to its international commitments,” concluded Joseph Breham et Laurence Greig, authors of Ancile Avocats’ 92-page report commissioned by Amnesty International and the French human rights group ACAT. “The French government has authorised exports of military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the UAE in circumstances where these weapons can be used in the conflict in Yemen and could be used to carry out war crimes.” Asked about the export licensing system, France’s foreign ministry said government processes are “robust and transparent”. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are among the biggest buyers of French arms, receiving tanks, armoured vehicles, munitions, artillery and, in the UAE’s case, fighter jets. While some other European states have scaled back their military ties with the Saudi-led coalition, Britain and the United States continue to pursue them. The report came at an awkward time for Macron, who is due to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in early April. French-Saudi relations are more strained than in recent years.  However, French officials say privately they have already told weapons suppliers that they should refrain from seeking new export licences for Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  “I don’t think you’ll see a clear pushback from us. What’s more likely is an informal message to companies to not bother asking for licences,” said a French diplomat. “It will be a de facto restriction but without saying it publicly, so as not to annoy the Saudis.”  Export licensing procedures, however, have no parliamentary checks or balances. Some French diplomats and aid officials say there is no evidence Paris has halted or reduced its arms exports to the two countries.

2018-03-19,"NEW YORK, March 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fifteen cities in Asia and Africa could each see at least a million fewer premature deaths this century if they cut toxic carbon dioxide emissions along the levels promoted in the global climate change agreement, scientists said on Monday. The metropolis of Kolkata in India stands to benefit most from cutting carbon pollution - a by-product of burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal - with 4.4 million fewer early deaths by 2100. The findings come as nearly 200 countries are looking at ways to uphold pledges they made as part of the 2015 Paris accord to slash emissions of planet-warming gases. The study by U.S. scientists, which was published in the journal Nature Climate Change, showed 11 of the 15 cities are on the Indian subcontinent. India’s capital, Delhi, and its northeastern city of Patna, along with Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka, and Pakistan’s Lahore could each avoid between 2.6 and 4 million deaths, according to computer models applied to 154 large cities. “They have very weak air-quality regulations currently,” said Drew Shindell, the study’s lead author and a professor at Duke University in the U.S. state of North Carolina. Ibadan in Nigeria, Bandung and Jakarta in Indonesia, and Dongguan in China are the only four megacities located in other regions of the world that could also see more than a million people’s lives saved with less air pollution, the study said. To arrive at their conclusions, the scientists considered deaths indirectly tied to carbon dioxide, namely those due to surface-level micro-particles and ozone gas that form with high concentrations of carbon, Shindell said by phone. Those deaths are typically caused by respiratory ailments and cardiovascular diseases such as strokes and lung cancer, the researchers said. “Our cars still give out that pollution that leads to particles and ozone, our power plants do, our furnaces,” Shindell told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “You see that black smoke when people fire up their oil burners in the winter - it’s black because there are particles.” The scientists’ estimates are based on nations achieving the carbon emissions cuts necessary to meet the Paris accord’s most ambitious target of keeping the global temperature hike to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. But according to a draft United Nations' report seen by Reuters earlier this year, unless governments make unprecedented economic shifts from fossil fuels, temperatures are on track to breach the 1.5C limit.

Parliament chose Armen Sarkissian, a former prime minister and ambassador to Britain, as president on March 2 in a vote that was meant to herald the start of a power shift to the  prime minister and parliament. Opposition leaders have accused Sarksyan of planning to become prime minister so as to continue governing Armenia, though he has denied any such intention until now. “If we finally decide that I’m putting forward my candidacy (for the post of prime minister), it would be done with one reservation - that ... I will be paying more time to sharing experience with young leaders,” Sarksyan told Armenian Internet media Tert.am. Sarkissian’s inauguration is set for April 9. After that, parliamentary parties will nominate candidates for prime minister and parliament will make a final choice on April 17. Under the terms of an amended constitution approved in 2015 by a referendum, the presidency is meant to become largely ceremonial with real power gravitating towards the prime minister and parliament. Armenia, a South Caucasus country of around three million people, is in line with some other former Soviet republics and countries in eastern Europe in moving away from direct democracy, according to many analysts. The country seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991, but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling the economy.

2018-03-19,"(Corrects to clarify that Total does not have a controlling stake in Total Eren, headline and paragraph 1) By Joe Bavier ABIDJAN, March 19 (Reuters) - Renewable energy company Total Eren said on Monday it had opened the world’s largest solar-thermal hybrid plant in Burkina Faso, the first of what it hopes will be many projects supplying the African mining industry’s growing need for power. Total Eren and Africa-focused independent power producer AEMP inaugurated Essakane Solar over the weekend, adding 15 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity to an existing 57-MW heavy fuel oil power plant at Toronto-listed IAMGOLD’s Essakane mine. Christophe Fleurence, Total Eren’s vice-president for business development in Africa, told Reuters the plan was to replicate this with other mining projects. “It’s gathering pace in terms of interest in all the discussions we’ve had with our contacts in the mining industry,” Fleurence said. He declined to give details of potential future deals. Mining companies operating in remote areas have long relied on thermal power plants, making their operations carbon-intensive and their costs vulnerable to fluctuations in world oil prices. As the price of photovoltaic panels has dropped in recent years, several mining operations have added solar capacity to help cut power costs. However, most of those projects have been relatively small. The Essakane plant, made up of nearly 130,000 solar panels, is expected to decrease the mine’s fuel consumption by some 6 million litres per year and reduce CO2 emissions by around 18,500 tonnes per year. The gold mine will buy the entirety of the plant’s production via a 15-year power purchasing agreement signed with a special-purpose company in which Total Eren owns a 90 percent stake. AEMP, Total Eren’s strategic partner for its industrial and mining business in Africa, holds the remaining 10 percent. “We do see this as likely to be adopted more and more going forward,” AEMP co-founder Richard Duffy said. “We talk to a number of mining companies. We have various projects in the pipeline - some of them not dissimilar to Essakane.” He said future projects were not at a stage where he could provide further details. Bruised by pressure on oil prices in recent years and in search of new long-term revenue sources, French oil major Total has intensified its push into renewable energy. It paid 237.5 million euros ($292 million) in September to acquire a 23 percent stake in solar and wind energy producer EREN RE, changing its name to Total Eren. It has a five-year option to acquire full control of the business.

2018-03-19,"(Adds details, quotes, background) By Nailia Bagirova, Margarita Antidze and Rania El Gamal BAKU/LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Azerbaijan are discussing deepening cooperation, including possible Azeri membership of OPEC, two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters on Monday. Azerbaijan, along with some other non-OPEC nations led by Russia, and OPEC are cutting oil production jointly by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to stabilise oil markets and boost the price of crude. The arrangement is due to run until the end of this year. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo visited Baku from March 17-19, holding talks with Azeri President Ilham Aliyev on Sunday and with Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov on Monday. “Barkindo and the energy minister discussed prospects of future cooperation between Azerbaijan and OPEC,” one of the sources said. “There are three options. First - OPEC membership, the second - to become an associate member and the third - to continue cooperation the way it is now.” OPEC’s headquarters in Vienna could not immediately be reached for comment. The Azeri Energy Ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. At a briefing on Monday in Baku, Barkindo said OPEC and Azerbaijan were thinking about how to upgrade relations beyond rebalancing the oil market. “All options, including membership, are under consideration,” the second source told Reuters. Azeri oil production stood at 806,000 bpd in February, compared to 814,600 bpd in January. “(In) the future, the strategic interest of Azerbaijan lies within OPEC,” Barkindo said in a separate interview with Azeri TV station Real TV on Monday. “We share the same views, we share the same perspectives, we share the same interests and Azerbaijan has been fully implementing decisions that we have been jointly taking together.” (Additional reporting by Alex Lawler in LONDON Writing by Katya Golubkova Editing by Dale Hudson and Alexander Smith)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-azerbaijan/update-1-azerbaijan-discussing-possible-membership-with-opec-sources-idUKL8N1R15WM,19 Mar 2018,"The Organization of the

2018-03-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Power generation from Britain’s wind farms hit a record 14.2 gigawatts (GW) on March 17, National Grid said on Monday. Wind power represented 34.2 percent of domestic electricity generation at 1430 GMT on Saturday, Britain’s power grid operator said. “2017 was a record year for green energy and it’s looking likely 2018 is set to exceed that,” said Fintan Slye, director of the system operator at National Grid. Predicting wind output can be difficult as it depends on wind speeds and power demand, but it is expected to increase this year as more wind farms open. Industry group Renewable UK forecasts around 2 GW of wind capacity will be added in 2018. Britain is looking to wind power to help bridge a looming electricity supply gap as old nuclear plants and coal-fired power stations close. Wind capacity in the country grew by about a fifth in 2017 to around 19 GW, data from industry association Wind Europe showed, as wind farms such as Orsted’s Burbo Bank offshore extension and Vattenfall’s Pen-y-Cymoedd onshore project opened. In Britain’s most recent renewable subsidy auction last year, the price guarantee given to new offshore wind projects fell below that given to new nuclear generation for the first time. Prices are tipped to keep falling as technology advances. The previous wind generation record, of 13.8 GW, was set on March 1, when a cold snap gripped Britain and National Grid issued its first gas deficit warning in eight years. Germany has the most wind capacity in Europe, at around 56 GW, followed by Spain with 23 GW and then Britain, Wind Europe data showed.

2018-03-19,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development sees enormous prospects in Lebanon, but potential investors need to see progress on reform and, over the border, a process towards a settlement of Syria’s war, the bank’s president said. On his first visit since the EBRD began operating in Lebanon in September, EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti said he saw a role for the bank in financing small and medium-sized enterprises and renewable energy, energy efficiency and infrastructure projects. On Thursday Lebanon agreed its first two EBRD deals: a 2.51 percent equity investment in Lebanon’s largest lender Bank Audi and a $50 million trade finance line with Fransabank, the third-largest.  “I think the prospects for the EBRD in Lebanon are enormous,” he told Reuters, and added that the bank has not set an upper limit on investment in Lebanon. “It depends on the demand we get from private sector players.”  While the war in Syria continues, Lebanon’s biggest challenge will remain regional risk. “Providing (Lebanon) continues with that (economic) reform process, provided there is a process towards a settlement in Syria, I think the prospects are really good,” Chakrabarti said. Set up by governments in 1991 to invest in the ex-communist economies of eastern Europe and owned mainly by developed countries, the EBRD has expanded its mandate in the last decade to operate in almost 40 countries. Lebanon joins Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia in the EBRD’s southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region, where it has invested more than 6.5 billion euros ($8 billion) in 170 projects since 2012.   Lebanon has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world at about 150 percent. Growth and state revenues have been low for years, undermined by war in neighbor Syria and domestic political inertia. To help stimulate the economy, Lebanon is seeking up to $16 billion for infrastructure this year from investors and donors. Fundraising will begin with an April 6 conference in Paris. Chakrabarti said the EBRD will voice support for Lebanon in Paris and is keen to invest further, especially in public private partnership (PPP) projects.  “The $16 billion cannot be financed unless there are more PPPs,” he said.  Chakrabarti said the EBRD and other lenders will be “very much focussed” on how Lebanon implements promised reforms and projects. “No-one should believe that just having a conference in Paris is a success in itself.” After agreeing a president and prime minister in late 2016 after years of political paralysis, Lebanon has passed its first budget since 2005, signed it first offshore oil and gas deals and signed a long-awaited PPP law. Chakrabarti said these developments have made him more confident “than I would have been a couple of years ago”. “Conversations we’ve had ... suggest there actually is a consensus building that more reform is going to be required.”  Lebanon is due to hold its first parliamentary elections since 2009 in early May. They will be held under a new electoral law, making it harder to predict the outcome.   “People are talking very openly that they don’t think the parliamentary elections will derail this process. Even after the election we can expect a continued push in the right direction.” Through equity in its investment in Bank Audi, Chakrabarti said the EBRD hopes to establish itself in Lebanon’s banking sector where it wants to help banks reach new customers.  “If Lebanon is to achieve the rates of growth economic growth that it can do, lending has to increase in the medium term without a doubt,” he said.     A group of customers Chakrabarti is passionate about reaching is women entrepreneurs.  “We have our Women in Business programs in 17 countries. We have learned how to do this really well,” he said. Chakrabarti said the EBRD can work well with Lebanon’s entrepreneurial spirit and its move towards a private sector-focused development model. Lebanon’s capital investment plan also focuses on EBRD strengths: energy, infrastructure and SMEs.    Lebanon has hosted over a million refugees fleeing Syria’s conflict, straining public services around the country. Chakrabarti said the bank has been talking to the Lebanese government about projects to help host communities and refugees. But this will require donors to contribute funds alongside the EBRD’s market-based loans.

2018-03-19,"NEW YORK, March 19, 2018 - U.S. stocks joined a slide on global equity markets on Monday as traders turned cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting this week and amid continuing concerns about the threat of a global trade war. MSCI’s main 47-country world stock index fell for a fifth straight day, after European stocks dipped and benchmark U.S. indexes declined. Global equities are on their worst run since November. The defensiveness came as fears of a global trade war triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports cast a cloud over a two-day G20 meeting in Buenos Aires this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 176.45 points, or 0.71 percent, to 24,770.06, the S&P 500 index lost 19.46 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,732.55 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 81.58 points, or 1.09 percent, to 7,400.41. Shares of Facebook Inc shed 5.5 percent after reports that a political consultancy that worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million of the social network’s users. London’s FTSE was down double other European indexes as a savage profit warning wiped more than half the value off one of its big tech firms, even as a two-year Brexit transition deal gave the pound its best day in almost two months against the euro. A Reuters report that the European Central Bank is starting to think a bit more about the future pace of euro zone interest rate rises helped the euro recover from a difficult morning against the dollar. It had struggled as the gap between 10-year German and U.S. government yields, referred to as the ‘transatlantic spread,’ ratcheted to its widest since December 2016. Many analysts had expected that spread to narrow as the ECB nears the end of its stimulus program, but that hasn’t proved the case. The shorter-dated two-year borrowing cost gap is near its widest level in more than 20 years. “There has been the narrative of supposed policy convergence between the ECB and the Fed, but that is just not the reality,” said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank. With as many as four hikes seen this year, expectations were “chomping at the max” he added. Wall Street is looking toward the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday, with 104 analysts polled by Reuters expecting that the central bank will raise rates by 25 basis points to a range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent. They were less certain on whether the “dot plot” forecasts of the members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee members would remain at three hikes for this year or shift higher. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting, his first as the central bank’s new chief. “Expected is a confident Fed Chair, both with respect to the economy’s strength and the Fed’s approach to policy,” analysts at Westpac said in a note. “Gradual and timely are the operative words for policy.” Analysts at JPMorgan, however, see a risk the Fed might not only add one more rate rise for this year but for 2019 as well. “The worst case is the ‘18 and ‘19 dots both move up - the Fed is currently guiding to five hikes in ‘18 and ‘19 combined, but under this scenario that would shift to seven hikes,” they warned in a note to clients. “Stocks would probably tolerate one net dot increase over ‘18 and ‘19, but a bump in both years could create problems.” Any nod to four hikes would normally be considered as bullish for the U.S. dollar, yet the currency has shown scant overall correlation to interest rates in recent months. Dealers cite concerns about the U.S. budget and current account deficits, chaos in the White House, better growth in , particularly Europe, and the risk of a U.S.-led trade war, as among the reasons. As U.S. trading began, the dollar had recovered to 106.23 yen having been as low as 105.69 overnight, though its wilt against the euro left it around 0.3 percent weaker against a basket of currencies at just below 90. The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates was been a burden for non-yielding gold, which slipped 0.8 percent last week. On the day, the metal was down at $1,311.20 per ounce. Oil prices eased after ending last week with a solid bounce. U.S. crude fell 0.24 percent to $62.19 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.18, down 0.05 percent on the day.

2018-03-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - India is the most vulnerable country to climate change, followed by Pakistan, the Philippines and Bangladesh, a ranking by HSBC showed on Monday. The bank assessed 67 developed, emerging and frontier markets on vulnerability to the physical impacts of climate change, sensitivity to extreme weather events, exposure to energy transition risks and ability to respond to climate change. The 67 nations represent almost a third of the world’s nation states, 80 percent of the global population and 94 percent of global gross domestic product. HSBC averaged the scores in each area for the countries in order to reach the overall ranking. Some countries were highly vulnerable in some areas but less so in others. Of the four nations assessed by HSBC to be most vulnerable, India has said climate change could cut agricultural incomes, particularly unirrigated areas that would be hit hardest by rising temperatures and declines in rainfall. Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines are susceptible to extreme weather events, such as storms and flooding. Pakistan was ranked by HSBC among nations least well-equipped to respond to climate risks.  South and southeast Asian countries accounted for half of the 10 most vulnerable countries. Oman, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Mexico, Kenya and South Africa are also in this group. The five countries least vulnerable to climate change risk are Finland, Sweden, Norway, Estonia and New Zealand. In its last ranking in 2016, HSBC only assessed G20 countries for vulnerability to climate risk.

2018-03-19,"(Adds background, opinion by Justice Thomas) By Andrew Chung WASHINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider rolling back the wide latitude federal agencies are given to interpret their own regulations in a case that could have bolstered President Donald Trump’s push toward deregulation and curbing agency power. The court turned away an appeal by Garco Construction Inc of a lower court ruling that deferred to the interpretation of officials at Malmstrom Air Force Base, a nuclear weapons facility in Great Falls, Montana, of its contractor policy. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed by Trump last year, dissented from the court’s action, saying they would have heard the case. The Spokane, Washington-based company, which had a contract to building housing at the base, objected after officials refused to admit workers with criminal records who a subcontractor had hired for the job. Although the case could have boosted the Trump administration’s plan for broad deregulation, the U.S. Justice Department urged the Supreme Court not to hear it because, although Garco’s criticism has “merits in other contexts,” the Air Force’s reading of its rules was correct. The case involves a legal doctrine known as “Auer deference” that lets courts defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own rules unless the interpretation is plainly wrong or inconsistent or incompatible with the regulation. Garco said the base did not follow its own rules in violation of the construction contract, and thus were owed no deference in their interpretation. The dispute had attracted the attention of various states and business groups as it could have undermined the power of federal agencies and departments to write and enforce their own regulations. Conservative justices, including John Roberts and Samuel Alito, have questioned such deference in the past. Noting the prior skepticism, Thomas wrote in his dissent, joined by Gorsuch, that the court should have reviewed whether its precedents allowing for deference should be overruled, calling such deference “constitutionally suspect.” Malmstrom Air Force Base is one of three bases that operate Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles. The August 2006 contract allowed for the use of employees with criminal records, according to court papers. But a subcontractor found some of its workers were barred entry. Garco said this exclusion amounted to an abrupt change that added full background checks well before a new, written policy on such checks was implemented in October 2007. The Air Force disagreed and said there was no change in policy over that time because its prior policy encompassed full background checks. It denied Garco’s request for additional payments of more than $450,000 to account for locating, hiring and training personnel to replace the workers with prior criminal convictions. Conservative and business groups say administrative agencies have accumulated tremendous power, and judicial deference is part of the reason why. Judges should not cede their jobs to these agencies, they argue.

A 0.6-1.3 percent drop for Europe’s main bourses amid a flurry of gloomy company news and weaker Wall Street futures meant MSCI’s main 47-country world stocks index was down for a fifth day. The caution also came against the backdrop of global trade war worries which are set to dominate a two-day G20 meeting starting later in Argentina as well as plenty of idiosyncratic factors. Facebook shares slumped 3.7 percent in premarket trading after reports that 50 million of its users’ data had been misused by a political consultancy firm ahead of the 2016 U.S. election and Brexit vote.

Many analysts had been expecting that spread to be narrowing as the ECB nears the end of its stimulus programme, but it hasn’t proved the case.

With as many as four hikes seen this year, expectations were “chomping at the max” he added. Weakness in equity markets was almost worldwide, meanwhile. Japan’s Nikkei had ended down almost 1 percent as its exporters were hit by more overnight strength in the yen which eventually reversed in early U.S. trading. The rest of Asia had struggled too, though China did manage to eke out some gains as Beijing announced a new economic team. It included a surprise new central bank chief but for the most part was largely as anticipated and is expected to keep the focus on halting riskier types of lending in the giant economy. Wall Street look set to lose more ground when New York reopens having seen the Dow lose 1.57 percent last week, the S&P drop 1.04 percent and the Nasdaq 1.27 percent. The decline was somewhat surprising given figures from Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed a record $43.3 billion of inflows into equities last week, outpacing bond flows for the first time since 2013. Whether the cash continues to flow could depend on what the Fed decides on Wednesday. All 104 analysts polled by Reuters expected the Fed would raise rates to between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent on Wednesday. They were less certain on whether the “dot plot” forecasts of committee members will stay at three hikes this year or shift higher.

2018-03-19," LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds continue to turn more cautious on the outlook for oil prices, but the liquidation of former bullish positions is very gradual, suggesting most see price risks close to balance. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 23 million barrels in the week to March 13. Funds have trimmed their net long position in six of the last seven weeks by a total of 268 million barrels, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges. But managers still hold a net long position across the petroleum complex that is 906 million barrels higher than at the end of June 2017. (For a chartbook, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2HKextT) The entire adjustment has come from the bullish side of the market, with long positions cut by 277 million barrels since Jan. 23. Bearish short positions have actually declined by 10 million barrels in the same period. Long positions in Brent, NYMEX and ICE WTI, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil total 1,347 million barrels compared with just 131 million barrels of short positions. As a result, long positions outnumber short ones by a ratio of more than 10:1, not far below the record ratio of 12:1 set almost two months ago. The liquidation of bullish positions shows no sign of accelerating. There are no signs of significant fresh short selling. And the hedge fund positioning remains exceptionally lopsided. Fund managers have become slightly more cautious about the prospect of a further increase in oil prices following the strong rally between June and January, but few are willing to bet prices will drop back much. The fund community still expects oil prices to rise further, but it has inevitably and logically become slightly less bullish given prices have risen by more than $20 (almost 50 percent) already. Fund positioning in the oil market continues to look stretched and remains a source of considerable downside price risk if and when portfolio managers try to realise more of their profits. But the fact liquidation has so far been gradual, there has been no rush for the exit, and prices have remained steady, have given bullish managers more resilience and confidence. Prices appear capped on the upside by the threat of increasing output from U.S. shale producers, but supported from below by strong consumption growth and OPEC’s determination to continue cutting inventories. For now, traders seem comfortable with prices moving in a relatively narrow range around $65 per barrel for Brent, which is contributing to the fall in volatility to its lowest level since 2012-2014.

2018-03-19,"OSLO, March 19 (Reuters) - Norway’s parliament votes on Tuesday on a motion of no confidence in the justice minister, and the centre-right government is expected to resign if it is passed. Sylvi Listhaug, of the right-wing Progress Party, has caused a political storm by accusing the opposition Labour Party - the target of a 2011 massacre - of putting terrorists’ rights before national security. The outcome of the vote will depend on the small Christian Democratic Party (CDP), traditionally a supporter of the government, which on Monday held meetings to decide its position. Snap elections are not allowed, and Norway’s next is not due until 2021. Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg might be able to form a new cabinet, but the task could fall to Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere if the CDP switches sides. Below is a summary of key policy issues: With more than $1 trillion saved from Norway’s oil and gas industry, parliament faces key questions over how to organise the fund and whether to allow investments beyond the foreign stocks, bonds and real estate it currently holds. The government is due to present a white paper on the fund in April but a change of power would almost certainly lead to a postponement. Parliament must also decide on whether to back the fund’s wish to drop the shares of oil and gas companies from its benchmark index, though this issue is unlikely to come to a vote until 2019 or later. The Conservatives are open to reducing the state’s stakes in several companies, notably in telecoms firm Telenor, where it has permission from parliament to cut its holding to 34 percent from 54 percent. Labour said ahead of last year’s election it would ask parliament to reverse the Telenor sales permit. A plan to change the name of oil firm Statoil could be at stake. The current oil minister backs the board’s plan to rename the company Equinor, but Labour has voiced scepticism. The Conservatives seek cuts in taxes for corporations, on personal incomes and in wealth and property taxes. They want tariff cuts to promote free trade. Labour vowed in last year’s general election to raise taxes for above-average earners and the wealthy by up to $2 billion to improve public services and reduce reliance on the sovereign wealth fund. It blamed its defeat partly on the tax strategy, and said it might be more reluctant to hike income taxes in the future. The party has backed a government plan to cut corporate taxes. In return for support from the centrist Christian Democrats and the Liberals, Solberg agreed last year to extend a moratorium on oil and gas exploration around the Arctic Lofoten archipelago for another four years. If the government collapses, the agreement will be void, and the fate of drilling in the area, thought to hold vast resources, will ultimately be decided by parliament. If the Conservatives were to rule alone, Solberg could seek the support of Progress and Labour to move towards exploration. This would further sour relations with the two centrist parties, so Solberg may instead use the question of drilling as leverage to win continued support. Labour has sought a compromise that could see some of the area opened for drilling, but faces a tricky dilemma because opposition within the party to Lofoten exploration is growing.

2018-03-19,"BRUSSELS/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - EU antitrust authorities are investigating whether limits placed by German grid operator TenneT on cross-border electricity capacity with Denmark breaches EU antitrust rules. The European Commission said it has “constructive dialogue” with German transmission system company TenneT, a subsidiary of TenneT Holding IPO-TTH.AS, the Dutch government-owned operator of electrical grids in the Netherlands and Germany. “We’ve had several complaints from Danish producers who say they want to supply power to our neighbours but cannot get access,” Europe’s antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said at a press briefing in Copenhagen on Monday. “We suspect that access is deliberately decreased when too much power is produced.” TenneT controls 40 percent of the cross-border network capacity of 1800 MW. Vestager added. TenneT responded with a statement saying that the German-Danish border suffered from transmission bottlenecks, adding that transmission capacities were stretched to the limit because of market liberalisation and the transition to renewable energy. The company said the EU investigation will include calculations on whether capacities approved under European law put foreign providers at an unfair disadvantage. “The examination can therefore set a precedent for all border connections in Europe,” it added. Power producers in Denmark, Sweden and Norway have long complained of limited access to the power link between Western Denmark and Northern Germany, according to lobby group Danish Energy. “Germany has for years prevented Danish, Swedish and Norwegian producers in supplying green energy to the rest of Europe,” said Anders Stouge, deputy director of Danish Energy. In 2016, when access was limited to 200 MW, lost revenue for Nordic power producers amounted to about 500 million Danish crowns (£58.7 million), Stouge said. A temporary solution was found last year, gradually raising access to 60 percent of capacity until 2020. “We are pleased that the Commission is looking into this but hope that this won’t be used as a chance to quit the temporary solution agreed last year,” he said. TenneT said it will submit concrete solutions on Monday, including an extension of the temporary solution agreed last year. Danish state-owned power transmission company Energinet.dk was not immediately available for comment.

2018-03-19,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 19 (Reuters) - The market narrative consuming crude oil markets currently is the interplay between supply cuts by OPEC and its allies and rising U.S. shale output, with a side helping of Chinese imports driving demand. While there are solid reasons for industry participants to focus on these dynamics, there is also the risk of missing out on other factors that help shape the market. Such a factor is India, which has long flown below the radar of the crude oil market, despite becoming the second-biggest importer in the fast-growing Asian market behind China, and the third-biggest in the world after the United States. India is also a market where there is virtually no direct influence being exerted by U.S. shale oil as the South Asian nation hardly imports any crude from the United States. It also imports a relatively small amount from Russia, the main ally in the agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Countries and other producers to limit output in order to drain excess global inventories, thereby boosting crude prices. But what makes India important is that it’s a major importer of Middle Eastern crudes, and one of the fastest-growing demand centres in the world. And there are currently some worrying trends for Middle Eastern exporters to India, especially for the region’s top shipper, Saudi Arabia. The International Energy Agency (IEA) put India’s crude oil demand at 4.68 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 in its report released last month, and estimated that this year will see demand rise to 4.98 million bpd, an increase of 6.4 percent. The IEA expects total world oil demand to increase by 1.4 million bpd, which makes India’s expected growth of some 300,000 bpd the most significant source of growth for crude producers outside of China’s expected lift in demand of about 380,000 bpd. India has traditionally bought the bulk of its crude oil from the Middle East, which makes sense give the geographic proximity and the decision of India’s refiners to focus on processing heavier grades through complex plants in order to maximise the value of fuels produced. However, despite the overall growth in India’s crude demand in 2017, the volume of imports from the Middle East dropped by 0.5 percent to around 2.75 million bpd, according to data obtained from sources and compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. Saudi Arabia lost its status as India’s biggest oil supplier, with imports from the kingdom dropping 8.9 percent to around 747,900 bpd, the data showed. Other losers from the Middle East included Iran, with a 0.5 percent drop to 470,500 bpd, and the United Arab Emirates with a 16.5 percent slump to 288,500 bpd. The region’s winner in exporting to India was Iraq, which increased 12.2 percent to 885,900 bpd, most likely as a result of Baghdad’s willingness to offer deeper discounts on its heavier grades of crude compared to similar grades from other exporters. If the Middle East overall was surrendering market share in India, the main gainers were two Latin American exporters, with Brazil’s shipments jumping 53 percent to 94,700 bpd and those from Mexico by 15.8 percent to 155,300 bpd. Among smaller suppliers to India, there were some impressive gains from countries such as Egypt, which was up 23.8 percent to 45,200 bpd, Sudan with a gain of 1,157 percent to 21,900 bpd, and Algeria, which rose 125 percent to 47,700 bpd. While many of these increases were off very small volumes, they have the potential to become more important in coming years. If Brazil and Mexico can compete in India, despite a sea voyage of at least four times the distance when compared to cargoes from the Persian Gulf, that should be a worry for Middle East producers. India’s refineries have shown they can be quite flexible in the crude slates they process and it appears that the output cuts instituted by OPEC and its allies is encouraging more diverse sources of supply. The risk for OPEC and its allies is that this sort of market share is hard to recover once the self-imposed production cuts are lifted. And as India shows, the battle is far more than just a simple OPEC and allies versus U.S. shale producers.

2018-03-19,"(Adds quotes, background) By Raya Jalabi and Ahmed Rasheed BAGHDAD, March 19 (Reuters) - Iraq sent money to pay salaries of state employees in the Kurdish region on Monday for the first time since 2014, the Baghdad government said, although a dispute over how much it will send the Kurds in future remains unresolved. Monday’s agreement represents a step towards normalising relations between the central government and the autonomous Kurdish region, which held a vote for independence last year that the central government swiftly crushed. Under the constitution, the Kurdish region is entitled to a share of the national budget. But that arrangement collapsed in 2014, when Iraq’s army fled the north in the face of an advance by Islamic State militants. The Kurds seized control of Iraq’s main northern oil fields at Kirkuk from Islamic State and began selling Kirkuk’s oil independently; Baghdad stopped sending money to the Kurds. Last year, after Islamic State was driven out of the north, the Kurds held an independence referendum, voting overwhelmingly to secede. But the central government responded by swiftly launching a military offensive and recapturing control of Kirkuk, which quashed the Kurdish independence bid. The central government and the Kurds have yet to agree on a full plan to resume payments from Baghdad to the Kurdish region. The 2018 budget, passed in parliament earlier this month despite a boycott by Kurdish lawmakers, calls for the 17 percent of total revenue allocated to the Kurds to be cut in line with the region’s share of Iraq’s population, which is disputed. The Kurdish region still conducts independent oil sales, although it has far less oil to sell now that it no longer controls Kirkuk. “The federal finance ministry transferred a cash sum of 317 billion Iraqi dinars ($267 million) to the region’s finance ministry,” Baghdad government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi said. Hadithi said the transfer would cover the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) salaries for a month, for employees of all ministries and for the Peshmerga Kurdish security forces. In a statement, the KRG said its finance ministry had received the transfer and would distribute it. Asked about future payments to the KRG to cover salaries, Hadithi said the federal government would agree to pay a portion while the rest should be covered by the KRG from its oil sales. Other measures imposed by Baghdad to curtail the Kurdish region’s autonomy in the wake of last year’s referendum are gradually being eased, including a ban on direct international flights which was lifted last week. The first international flight landed at Erbil airport on Monday morning. However, the issues of the KRG’s independent oil sales and share of the budget remain unresolved. Baghdad has sent teams of auditors to Kurdistan in recent months to assess the number of employees on the region’s payroll. A statement from the Prime Minister’s office announcing the agreement on Monday, specified that the audit was ongoing.

2018-03-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Electric vehicles and stricter marine fuel regulations are generally not perceived as good news for the oil refining industry.  But the head of European downstream firm Varo Energy, Roger Brown, says he believes the complete opposite. At least for the medium-term.  Varo, which has refineries and storage assets in Western Europe, announced on Monday that it would list in Amsterdam this year. Its shareholders, which include private equity firm Carlyle and oil trading merchant Vitol, plan to sell a combined 30-40 percent of stock on Euronext. The company could be valued at 2 billion euros (£1.75 billion), according to banking sources.  Brown, a veteran BP trader who was hired as Varo chief executive in 2015, believes some refiners could benefit from forecasts of a peak in oil demand within a generation. “I don’t think many people will build new refineries amid all the talk about peak oil demand. So hence current refiners will have to run at full capacity,” said Brown. Many commodity traders, oil companies and analysts expect oil consumption to slow in years to come as sales of electric vehicles accelerate, and wind and solar power provide more of the world’s electricity. Some predict oil demand will peak some time after 2030. Another challenge for the refining industry is upcoming stricter regulations for marine fuel, which will drastically reduce the use of fuel oil for shipping but increase the use of diesel. Brown says that, too, would present an opportunity for the refining industry in Europe as existing refineries would need to fill the additional demand for diesel in the shipping sector. Varo, which saw underlying earnings rise to $371 million last year from $328 million in 2016, owns two refineries in Switzerland and Germany, and storage, blending and distribution assets in those two countries as well as the Benelux nations and France.  Varo has made nine acquisitions since being set up in 2012 and Brown says more are coming.  On Monday, Varo said it intended to pay out a dividend of 30-50 percent of its profit after tax and achieve over the medium term high single-digit growth in underlying earnings. The company wants to invest 30–50 percent of its free cashflow in organic and inorganic growth. The company had revenues of $13.4 billion in 2017, up from $10.5 billion in 2016.  Varo, run as a standalone business from Vitol, has the trader as its sole crude supplier. Brown says the deal with Vitol was extended until 2022 and the trader is obliged to supply Varo at the lowest available price in the market while Varo will also fully hedge oil price, refining margins and foreign exchange risks. Brown says he sees a lot of scope for growth as several family-run storage businesses in Europe are considering selling out due to a lack of succession planning and the high costs of keeping assets in compliance with stringent regulations in Europe.   Post-acquisitions, Varo has focused on upgrading refineries, developing biofuel terminals and optimising value chains.  “A lot of us at Varo remember BP’s integration days under (former CEO) John Browne. We worked on integrating Castrol, Mobil Europe and Veba Oil. What we learnt is that you cannot build bridges. You need full integration,” said Brown. “Margins tend to move up and down from refiner to terminal. So having an integrated business model helps taking a lot of market volatility out of your results,” he added.

2018-03-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has rebuffed calls from the gas industry for an urgent review of the country’s gas storage capacity after a cold snap this month triggered warnings of supply shortages and gas prices spiked to their highest in at least a decade. Operators of gas storage sites, industries reliant on gas and developers of new storage projects have been asking for an inquiry since November, following the closure of the Rough site that provided 70 percent of Britain’s gas storage capacity. They met officials from the department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) on Friday but the government declined to open an inquiry, saying market forces would ensure there was enough gas, according to two people who attended the meeting and a third who was briefed on the outcome. The government says it is up to the market to determine whether it makes sense to invest in new gas storage and if there are any supply shortages, prices will rise sufficiently to attract more gas from elsewhere. “There is still a level of complacency in the government that despite recent events the best course of action is to just accept these price shocks,” said Clive Moffatt of consultancy Moffatt Associates, who attended the meeting and represents several storage developers and industry associations. A spokeswoman for BEIS said the March 16 meeting was not in response to any recent events and no inquiry into gas price and supply security was planned.    “We take gas security of supply seriously which is why we regularly and comprehensively test our assumptions and the latest evidence,” she said. The surge in gas prices on March 1 came days after the government, which is under pressure to lower heating bills, introduced a law in parliament that would cap energy costs for 11 million households for up to five years. The price spikes also come at a time of increased focus on the security of imports following tension with one of Europe’s main gas suppliers, Russia, as well as fears Britain’s departure from the European Union could hit gas imports at crunch times. Home power bills have doubled in Britain over the past decade to an average of about 1,150 pounds a year. Wholesale energy prices make up about 40 percent of domestic bills, meaning price rises are likely to affect some consumers. Utility company Centrica (CNA.L) closed Rough in June saying it had become too costly to maintain the 30-year-old offshore site, leaving Britain with storage capacity equivalent to four to five days of winter demand, down from 15 days previously. Natural gas is used to heat about 80 percent of Britain’s homes, fuels as much as half of the country’s electricity generation at times and is vital for several industries such as ceramics and chemicals. Britain’s storage levels, however, are well below most European countries. Germany has the largest capacity with some 24 billion cubic meters, 17 times that of Britain, while other European countries such as Italy keep strategic gas reserves. “For the size of our gas market, we have pitifully low storage levels,” said Trevor Sikorski, analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects. A decade ago, domestic North Sea production provided almost two-thirds of Britain’s gas, meaning storage was less of an issue. But dwindling reserves mean Britain provided less than half of the gas it used in 2017 and that could drop to under 10 percent by 2040, according to National Grid. The Rough closure means when gas demand peaks, or supplies falter, there is no large buffer to ensure all immediate needs can be met, leading to huge spikes in wholesale prices. When National Grid issued a deficit warning on March 1, the wholesale price for gas for immediate delivery TRGBNBPWKD hit 350 pence per therm, up from 63 pence the previous week. Data compiled by Reuters shows the closing price for the contract has averaged 57 pence per therm over the current winter season - the first since Rough closed - more than 20 percent higher than the average price for the 2016-17 winter season. Britain’s National Grid (NG.L), the company that owns the transmission network for electricity and gas and balances supply and demand, argues that storage is no panacea. “You can only withdraw a certain amount of storage in one day, so the day’s demand would never be met by storage alone,” a spokeswoman for National Grid said. She said on any given day, Britain could get gas from its North Sea reserves, from Norway, via pipelines linked to continental Europe, from shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG), or from storage. “It is this mix that enables security of supply,” she said. Operators of existing sites have warned that Britain’s storage capacity could get even tighter in the coming years without government intervention, either to help keep sites operating or to subsidise the construction of new ones. The difference between gas prices in summer and winter has narrowed over the last few years in Britain, making it less profitable to buy gas in the warmer months, store it and sell when temperatures fall and prices rise, operators said. “The economics of the UK’s gas storage sites are challenging, putting a question mark over the remaining sites,” said a spokesman for utility SSE (SSE.L), whose Aldbrough and Hornsea sites provide about 30 percent the remaining capacity. Companies planning new storage sites want the government to determine how much capacity Britain needs to ensure supply and prevent price spikes, and then find ways to maintain it. If the need for a certain level of storage is identified then the government could create something similar to its power capacity auction, which pays electricity generators a subsidy to ensure they have availability when needed, Stag Energy founder and managing director George Grant, said. Stag Energy, a power generation and infrastructure company, is planning to build an 800 million pound underground gas storage site in the Irish Sea, connected to Britain’s gas market. “We are seeking a comprehensive study into gas price security and what the appropriate level of storage for the UK should be,” Grant said. Proponents of greater gas storage have also raised concerns about Britain’s reliance on imports in the light of increased political tensions with Russia following a nerve toxin attack on a former Russian double agent on British soil. Prime Minister Theresa May said last week Britain was looking to countries other than Russia for gas as part of steps being taken by London following the attack.  The energy department says Britain typically receives less than 1 percent of its gas from Russia, which comes via pipelines from Europe. But this year supplies of LNG, which are seen as one of the major sources of supply flexibility in the future, are increasingly coming from Russia. So far this year, two Russian LNG cargoes have unloaded at British terminals for domestic consumption, accounting for about a third of Britain’s LNG imports in 2018. Other gas imports, making up about half of total supply, come via interconnectors with Norway and continental Europe but the latter could be affected by Britain’s departure from the European Union in March 2019. “If there remains frictionless trade with the EU via the interconnectors following Brexit then it diminishes the case for domestic storage, but this isn’t certain,” Thierry Bros, senior research fellow at The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said.  The EU operates a solidarity principle regarding gas which means in the event of a serious crisis member states are expected to help each other maintain supplies. “If there is a crisis, member states could hold on to gas stocks for their own supplies and there would be no obligation to ship to Britain - even if prices are higher,” he said.

2018-03-19,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rosneft (ROSN.MM) doubled its fourth-quarter net income to 100 billion rubles ($1.74 billion) after it resolved a row with Sistema (AFKS.MM), the Russian energy company said on Monday.  The net income met analysts’ forecasts. Sistema agreed to pay 100 billion rubles to Rosneft as part of an out-of-court settlement over oil producer Bashneft (BANE.MM). Rosneft said the deal added 48 billion rubles to its 2017 net income. Sistema said this month that it had completed all payments to Rosneft. Rosneft’s shares were up by 0.7 percent as of 0906 GMT versus Moscow’s stock market .MCX which was down 0.4 percent. Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has been expanding aggressively, investing billions of dollars in foreign assets. It said on Monday in 2017 it had transferred $2.1 billion to the Iraqi Kurdistan government as prepayments for future oil supplies, and $1 billion to Venezuela’s PDVSA last April as part of an oil supply deal. Moscow-based brokerage Aton said in a note that net debt has not materially changed since the previous financial report, valuing it at 3.509 trillion rubles ($61 billion). “Rosneft is still the most leveraged oil company in Russia, and its deleveraging is perhaps investors’ greatest hope with respect to its investment case,” it said. The company did not report its net debt in the latest report. The most recent estimate published by Rosneft was 2.216 trillion rubles ($38 billion) excluding prepayments to foreign firms as of June 30, 2017. Rosneft has prepayment and long-term supply deals with Vitol [VITOLV.UL], Glencore (GLEN.L), Shell (RDSa.L), Total (TOTF.PA), Eni (ENI.MI), BP (BP.L) and Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL]. It also has similar deals with China. On Monday, Rosneft said its fourth-quarter liquid hydrocarbon production - largest among listed global oil producers -  reached 56.51 million tonnes, raising its full-year output by 7.3 percent to 225.5 million tonnes, or 4.53 million barrels per day. BP (BP.L), which owns a 19.75 percent stake in Rosneft, sources a third of its oil in Russia. Rosneft’s fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose almost 8 percent to 393 billion rubles on revenue of 1.7 trillion rubles, up more than 14 percent.

2018-03-19,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A court in northern Japan on Monday rejected a lawsuit to halt  construction of a nuclear plant, said the company building the facility, Electric Power Development Co (J-Power). The ruling by the Hakodate District Court in Hokkaido prefecture on the Ohma plant will be welcomed by many utilities as they push for a return to nuclear power following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, despite strong opposition from chunks of the public. More than 1,100 residents in Hokkaido, among others, had filed the lawsuit in 2010 to prevent Ohma from starting. The construction of the 1,383-megawatt plant, which will use mixed oxide fuel, a blend of uranium and plutonium recycled from spent nuclear fuel, started in 2008, but work was suspended after Fukushima in 2011. Building resumed in 2012, but has been delayed as the company has to meet new safety requirements imposed after the 2011 disaster, a company spokesman said. The station is about 38-percent complete, he said. J-Power in 2016 pushed back the planned start of operation by two years to 2024/25. “We are doing all we can for the start of operations in the 2024/25 business year,” the spokesman added. The ruling marks the latest judgment on atomic power in the country, with critics of nuclear energy having more success in some other cases. A high court in western Japan sided with residents last December to prevent the restart of a nuclear plant idled for scheduled maintenance, although lower court decisions have usually been turned down on appeal.

2018-03-19,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian authorities urged people to remain alert on Monday as  bushfires that have destroyed dozens of homes, killed cattle and forced hundreds of residents to flee continued to burn out of control in the southeast of the country.  No deaths or serious injuries were reported on Monday but the bushfires have caused extensive damage in rural areas of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), Australia’s two most populous states. More than 100 houses were damaged or destroyed, authorities said. “At this stage (there have been) no lives lost,” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said at a news conference in the small NSW coastal town of Tathra. “It is just a great credit to the firefighters, to the volunteers, the emergency workers - all of the community has pulled together and provided such great support,” he said.  The fires, believed to have been sparked by lightning on Saturday, were fanned by dry, hot winds as temperatures reached 41 degrees Celsius (106 Fahrenheit) on Sunday. Emergency officials said conditions should ease later on Monday but “watch and act” warnings remained in place for five locations. The fire also set off an argument among Australia’s politicians on whether climate change was a contributing factor to the blazes. “You can’t attribute any particular event, whether it’s a flood or fire or a drought ...to climate change. We are the land of droughts and flooding rains, we’re the land of bushfires,” Turnbull said. Authorities said some 69 houses were destroyed and a further 39 were damaged and 30 caravans or cabins were also wiped out in Tathra, where residents fled to the beach on Sunday to avoid the flames as flying embers quickly carried the firefront forward. About 700 residents were evacuated to centres set up at the nearby town of Bega and several schools in affected areas were closed on Monday. NSW Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers earlier told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that five of 22 fires had not yet been contained.  “There’s still a lot of fire around the landscape,” he said, warning that it would still be several days before they were extinguished. About 280 firefighters were battling the blazes, while 22,000 homes were without power in the region after high winds brought down trees, Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley said late on Sunday. Bushfires are a common and deadly threat in Australia’s hot, dry summers, fuelled by highly flammable eucalyptus trees. In January, hundreds of holidaymakers had to be evacuated by boat from the beaches of the Royal National Park south of Sydney when they became trapped by bushfires. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria killed 173 people and injured more than 400.

2018-03-19,"BARCELONA, March 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Demand for water is expected to increase by nearly one-third by 2050 as the planet’s population expands, according to the 2018 World Water Development Report from the United Nations. To provide enough water for drinking, growing crops, generating power and other uses, governments and businesses should work more closely with nature, which controls the water cycle, the report said. Incorporating more green space into cities, conserving wetlands, and farming in ways that keep the soil healthy are examples of the “nature-based solutions” backed by the report. These can also help protect people from floods, drought and other water-linked threats, it said. Here are some facts on water use, and the risks of too much or too little water: * Global water use has increased by a factor of six over the past 100 years, and is growing steadily at a rate of about 1 percent per year spurred by population growth, economic development and changing consumption patterns. * Household water use accounts for about 10 percent of global water withdrawals, and is expected to rise significantly by 2050, particularly in Africa and Asia where domestic demand could more than triple. * Global demand for agricultural and energy production - both of which use water intensively - is expected to increase by about 60 percent and 80 percent respectively by 2025. * Agriculture accounts for about 70 percent of all water use worldwide. Water withdrawals for irrigation have been identified as the main driver of groundwater depletion. * Worldwide, 3.6 billion people, or nearly half the global population, live in areas at risk of being water-scarce for at least one month a year, nearly three-quarters of them in Asia. The number could increase to 4.8 billion-5.7 billion people by 2050. * At about 4,600 cubic kilometres per year, global water withdrawals are now already near maximum sustainable levels. * Since the 1990s, water pollution has worsened in almost all rivers in Africa, Asia and Latin America. * An estimated 80 percent of industrial and municipal wastewater is released to the environment without treatment, resulting in a deterioration of overall water quality with harmful impacts for health and ecosystems. * About 30 percent of the global population live in places routinely hit by either floods or drought. * The number of people at risk from floods is projected to rise from 1.2 billion today to around 1.6 billion in 2050. * Some 1.8 billion people are affected by land degradation, desertification and drought. * Since 1900, an estimated 64-71 percent of the world's natural wetland area has been lost due to human activity.

2018-03-19,"BARCELONA, March 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world should look to nature for better ways to maintain supplies of water, keep it clean, and protect people from droughts and floods, the United Nations said on Monday. As the global population expands and the planet warms, demand for water is rising, while the quality and reliability of our water supply is declining, the 2018 edition of the U.N. World Water Development Report has warned. One response is to invest more in protecting ecosystems that recycle water, such as wetlands and vegetation, and spend less on concrete flood barriers or wastewater treatment plants. Audrey Azoulay, director-general of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which coordinates the report, called for “new solutions” to tackle “emerging challenges to water security caused by population growth and climate change”. “If we do nothing, some five billion people will be living in areas with poor access to water by 2050,” she said in a statement. Demand for water is expected to increase by nearly one-third by 2050, said Gilbert Houngbo, chair of UN-Water, in the report’s foreword. To help manage competing demands for freshwater - whether to quench human thirst, water crops or produce electricity - the report recommended “working with nature, rather than against it” in a bid to make water use more efficient, cost-effective and healthier for people and the environment. “For too long, the world has turned first to human-built, or ‘grey’, infrastructure to improve water management,” wrote Houngbo. “In so doing, it has often brushed aside traditional and indigenous knowledge that embraces greener approaches.” The report outlined the benefits of “nature-based solutions”, which use or mimic natural processes to increase water availability, improve its quality and reduce risks linked to water-related disasters and climate change. Those solutions include changing farming practices so the soil retains more moisture and nutrients, harvesting rainwater, re-charging aquifers, conserving wetlands that capture runoff and decontaminate water, restoring floodplains and turning rooftops into gardens. The report cited estimates that agricultural production could be increased by nearly 20 percent worldwide if greener water management practices were used. Richard Connor, editor-in-chief of the report, said switching to a “conservation agriculture” model could bring high and rapid returns, but achieving it on a large scale would require political will at the national level. “Agriculture internationally remains dominated by industrial (farming), and it can be a little more difficult to influence the private-sector interests that are involved,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But some companies were adopting more sustainable practices, while consumers - mainly in Europe and North America - increasingly prefer organic, locally grown food, he added. Inside cities, the challenge is to capture and filter more water using “green infrastructure” - from water retention ponds to wild spaces that double up for leisure activities. And out of town, in the basins on which cities rely, water users like farmers need to cooperate with municipal authorities to ensure enough clean water for all. New York, for example, has protected its three biggest watersheds since the late 1990s, resulting in an unfiltered water supply that brings savings of more than $300 million per year on water treatment and maintenance costs, the report said. “Grey” infrastructure - such as piped water to slums, dams to control water flow on rivers, or concrete walls to keep out big storm surges and floods - would still be needed, Connor said. Yet while growing amounts are spent on green infrastructure and other nature-based solutions, evidence suggests they account for less than 1 percent of total investment in infrastructure to manage water resources, the report said. Connor pointed to the extra advantages of using natural ways to manage water, including the potential to boost biodiversity, jobs, health and carbon storage. ""If you start to look at these co-benefits that often do not exist with grey infrastructure ... it should tip the investment decisions towards more nature-based solutions,"" he said.

2018-03-19,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 19 (Reuters) - The market narrative consuming crude oil markets currently is the interplay between supply cuts by OPEC and its allies and rising U.S. shale output, with a side helping of Chinese imports driving demand. While there are solid reasons for industry participants to focus on these dynamics, there is also the risk of missing out on other factors that help shape the market. Such a factor is India, which has long flown below the radar of the crude oil market, despite becoming the second-biggest importer in the fast-growing Asian market behind China, and the third-biggest in the world after the United States. India is also a market where there is virtually no direct influence being exerted by U.S. shale oil as the South Asian nation hardly imports any crude from the United States. It also imports a relatively small amount from Russia, the main ally in the agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Countries and other producers to limit output in order to drain excess global inventories, thereby boosting crude prices. But what makes India important is that it’s a major importer of Middle Eastern crudes, and one of the fastest-growing demand centres in the world. And there are currently some worrying trends for Middle Eastern exporters to India, especially for the region’s top shipper, Saudi Arabia. The International Energy Agency (IEA) put India’s crude oil demand at 4.68 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 in its report released last month, and estimated that this year will see demand rise to 4.98 million bpd, an increase of 6.4 percent. The IEA expects total world oil demand to increase by 1.4 million bpd, which makes India’s expected growth of some 300,000 bpd the most significant source of growth for crude producers outside of China’s expected lift in demand of about 380,000 bpd. India has traditionally bought the bulk of its crude oil from the Middle East, which makes sense give the geographic proximity and the decision of India’s refiners to focus on processing heavier grades through complex plants in order to maximise the value of fuels produced. However, despite the overall growth in India’s crude demand in 2017, the volume of imports from the Middle East dropped by 0.5 percent to around 2.75 million bpd, according to data obtained from sources and compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. Saudi Arabia lost its status as India’s biggest oil supplier, with imports from the kingdom dropping 8.9 percent to around 747,900 bpd, the data showed. Other losers from the Middle East included Iran, with a 0.5 percent drop to 470,500 bpd, and the United Arab Emirates with a 16.5 percent slump to 288,500 bpd. The region’s winner in exporting to India was Iraq, which increased 12.2 percent to 885,900 bpd, most likely as a result of Baghdad’s willingness to offer deeper discounts on its heavier grades of crude compared to similar grades from other exporters. If the Middle East overall was surrendering market share in India, the main gainers were two Latin American exporters, with Brazil’s shipments jumping 53 percent to 94,700 bpd and those from Mexico by 15.8 percent to 155,300 bpd. Among smaller suppliers to India, there were some impressive gains from countries such as Egypt, which was up 23.8 percent to 45,200 bpd, Sudan with a gain of 1,157 percent to 21,900 bpd, and Algeria, which rose 125 percent to 47,700 bpd. While many of these increases were off very small volumes, they have the potential to become more important in coming years. If Brazil and Mexico can compete in India, despite a sea voyage of at least four times the distance when compared to cargoes from the Persian Gulf, that should be a worry for Middle East producers. India’s refineries have shown they can be quite flexible in the crude slates they process and it appears that the output cuts instituted by OPEC and its allies is encouraging more diverse sources of supply. The risk for OPEC and its allies is that this sort of market share is hard to recover once the self-imposed production cuts are lifted. And as India shows, the battle is far more than just a simple OPEC and allies versus U.S. shale producers.

2018-03-19,"* Nikkei leads losses in Asia, China stocks more resilient * Investors wait to see how many hikes Fed has in mind * Dollar yet to get much support from higher rates * G20 meets amid U.S./China trade tension, talk of tariffs By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, March 19 (Reuters) - Asian share markets traded mixed on Monday as caution gripped investors in a week in which the Federal Reserve is likely to hike U.S. interest rates and perhaps signal that as many as three more lie in store for the rest of the year. Japan’s Nikkei extended early losses to drop 0.9 percent as exporters were undermined by recent broad-based strength in the yen. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.35 percent, but China managed to eke out some gains. The guarded mood was not confined to Asia, with the June contract for E-Minis futures on the S&P 500 down 0.3 percent and FTSE futures off 0.2 percent. While Wall Street had bounced on Friday, the major indices still ended lower for the week. The Dow lost 1.57 percent, the S&P 1.04 percent and the Nasdaq 1.27 percent. The decline was somewhat surprising given figures from Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed a record $43.3 billion of inflows into equities last week, outpacing bond flows for the first time since 2013. For the year so far, $9.8 billion has gone into tech stocks and $7.3 billion into financials, while $41 billion has flowed into emerging markets and $31 billion into Japan. Whether the cash continues to flow could depend on what the Fed decides on Wednesday. All 104 analysts polled by Reuters expected the Fed would raise rates to between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent on Wednesday. They were less certain on whether the “dot plot” forecasts of committee members will stay at three hikes this year or shift higher. It will also be the first press conference for new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. “Expected is a confident Fed Chair, both with respect to the economy’s strength and the Fed’s approach to policy,” said analysts at Westpac in a note. “While growth forecasts and the distribution of rate projections are likely to drift up, the median Fed funds forecast should remain unchanged at three in 2018 and three more in 2019,” they added. “Gradual and timely are the operative words for policy.” Analysts at JPMorgan, however, see a risk the Fed might not only add one more rate rise for this year but for 2019 as well. “The worst case is the ‘18 and ‘19 dots both move up - the Fed is currently guiding to five hikes in ‘18 and ‘19 combined but under this scenario that would shift to seven hikes,” they warned in a note to clients. “Stocks would probably tolerate one net dot increase over ‘18 and ‘19 but a bump in both years could create problems.” Any nod to four hikes would normally be considered as bullish for the U.S. dollar, yet the currency has shown scant correlation to interest rates in recent months, falling even as policy tightened. Reasons cited by dealers include concerns about the U.S. budget and current account deficits, political chaos at the White House, better growth in competing countries, particularly Europe, and the risk of a U.S.-led trade war. Trade will be top of the agenda at a two-day G20 meeting starting later on Monday in Buenos Aires and any signs of escalating stress between the U.S. and China could make investors in Asia nervous. The cautious mood was evident in demand for the safe-haven Japanese yen which was climbing against a raft of currencies, including the euro and Australian dollar. On Monday, the U.S. dollar was off 0.3 percent at 105.69 yen and not far from its recent trough at 105.24. The dollar was a fraction firmer against a basket of currencies at 90.303, while the euro eased 0.2 percent to $1.2264. The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates was been a burden for non-yielding gold, which slipped 0.8 percent last week. Early Monday, the metal was down at $1,311.20 per ounce. Oil prices eased after ending last week with a solid bounce. Brent futures were down 40 cents at $65.81 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures for April, which expire on Tuesday, dipped 36 cents to $61.98 a barrel.

2018-03-19,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed during a weekend summit in Sydney to establish a regional infrastructure pipeline, Australia’s foreign minister said, as the bloc seeks to balance rising Chinese influence.  The project “will develop a pipeline of high-quality infrastructure projects, to attract private and public investment”, according to a statement from Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop issued on Sunday. Australia, the United States, India and Japan have been seeking to establish a regional alternative to China’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure scheme, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review last month that cited a senior U.S. official. A spokeswoman for Bishop said on Monday the agreement was purely an ASEAN initiative and “not to counter China”. Australia hosted the special ASEAN meeting, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, looking to tighten political and trade ties in a region where Chinese presence is growing stronger.     A joint communique issued by Australia and ASEAN at the end of the meeting called for “self-restraint” in the South China Sea, where aggressive Chinese expansion has irked ASEAN members who also have territorial claims in the busy waterway. “This is a security and stability question in Southeast Asia which will affect all ASEAN countries if it goes wrong,” Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told a news conference shortly after the communique was issued. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road plan is a vehicle for the world’s second-largest economy to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building transport and trade links in more than 60 countries. Xi has promoted the initiative heavily, inviting world leaders to Beijing last May for an inaugural summit at which he pledged $124 billion in funding for the plan, and enshrining it into the ruling Communist Party’s constitution in October.

2018-03-19,"* U.S. rig count rises back to 800 - Baker Hughes * Rising drilling activity points to higher crude production * Middle East tensions prevent further price falls By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday as rising drilling activity in the United States pointed to further increases in output, raising concerns about a return of oversupply. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.02 a barrel at 0145 GMT, down 32 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $65.87 per barrel, down 34 cents, or 0.5 percent. Monday’s price falls in part reversed increases last Friday, which came on the back of concerns over rising tension in the Middle East. “Despite all the bearish U.S. shale supply headlines, oil prices remain firm as... the odds that the U.S. will pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement continue to run very high,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. On a simple supply versus demand basis, however, global oil markets are facing the risk of returning into oversupply after being in a slight deficit for much of last year. U.S. drillers added four oil rigs in the week to March 16, bringing the total count to 800, the weekly Baker Hughes drilling report said on Friday. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 631 rigs were active as energy companies have continued to boost spending since mid-2016 when crude prices began recovering from a two-year crash. Thanks to the high drilling activity, U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has risen by more than a fifth since mid-2016, to 10.38 million barrels per day (bpd), pushing it past top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia produces more, at around 11 million bpd, although U.S. output is expected to overtake Russia’s later this year as well. Soaring U.S. output, as well as rising output in Canada and Brazil, is undermining efforts by the Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to curb supplies and bolster prices. Many analysts expect global oil markets to flip from slight undersupply in 2017 and early this year into oversupply later in 2018.

It will also be the first press conference for new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. “Expected is a confident Fed Chair, both with respect to the economy’s strength and the Fed’s approach to policy,” said analysts at Westpac in a note. “While growth forecasts and the distribution of rate projections are likely to drift up, the median fed funds forecast should remain unchanged at three in 2018 and three more in 2019,” they added. “Gradual and timely are the operative words for policy.” Any nod to four hikes would normally be considered as bullish for the U.S. dollar, yet the currency has shown scant correlation to interest rates in recent months, falling even as policy tightened. Reasons cited by dealers include concerns about the U.S. budget and current account deficits, political chaos at the White House, better growth in competing countries, particularly Europe, and the risk of a U.S.-led trade war. Trade will be top of the agenda at a two-day G20 meeting starting later on Monday in Buenos Aires and any signs of escalating stress between the U.S. and China could make investors in Asia nervous. The cautious mood was evident in demand for the safe-haven Japanese yen which climbed against a raft of currencies last week. On Monday, the dollar was off 0.22 percent at 105.78 yen and not far from its recent trough at 105.24. The dollar was a fraction firmer against a basket of currencies at 90.289, while the euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.2268. The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates was been a burden for non-yielding gold, which slipped 0.8 percent last week. Early Monday, the metal was down at $1,311.20 per ounce. Oil prices eased after ending last week with a solid bounce. Brent futures were down 38 cents at $65.83 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures for April, which expire on Tuesday, dipped 36 cents to $61.98 a barrel.

2018-03-19,"* Financials, consumer staples pull Aussie shares down * Oil price rally boost energy, material stocks * NZ hurt by telecoms By Christina Martin March 19 (Reuters) - Australian shares erased early gains to slip on Monday as  financials and consumer staples dragged the index lower, with broader Asian markets jittery ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting later in the week. The S&P/ASX 200 index inched down 0.2 percent, or 10.6 points, to 5,938.8 by 0112 GMT. The benchmark ended 0.5 percent up on Friday. Investors were cautious in anticipation of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this week, at which the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year. Financial stocks in Australia fell for a fifth straight session, down as much 0.5 percent, with the ‘Big Four’ banks sliding between 0.2 percent and 0.8 percent. Consumer staples also saw stocks slip, with Wesfarmers Ltd being the biggest loser on the sub-index. “Wesfarmers came out on Friday and said they were going to sell off their Coles supermarket division. The stock was up very strongly and it just seems as though it is giving back some of those gains. That would be the major reason why consumer staples are weaker,” said Christopher Conway at the Australian Stock Report. Meanwhile, energy stocks edged as much as 1.5 percent higher, posting their biggest intraday percentage gain in a week. Beach Energy Ltd, Caltex Australia Ltd and Woodside Petroleum Ltd all showed gains ranging from as much as 1.3 percent to 2.5 percent. Materials stocks hit their highest in over a week, up as much as 0.7 percent and on track for a fourth straight session of gains, with index heavyweights BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Ltd jumping 0.8 and 0.9 percent, respectively. Oil prices jumped on Friday, with Brent crude futures hitting their highest in more than two weeks, while U.S. stock prices rose on strong industrial output numbers. “Materials are a bit of a funny one and that is because it has BHP in it of course. BHP has a lot of exposure to oil; it is the biggest oil producer in Australia, bigger than Wooodside and all the other oil-only commodities companies, and we all know it has got a huge weight,” said Conway. “It is BHP’s oil exposure which is giving it a gain and driving the rest of the (materials) sector, overcoming the weakness in iron ore prices.” Materials gained in Australia despite a slide in iron ore and base metal prices. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index inched down 0.2 percent, or 16.56 percent, to 8,460.52, hurt by telecoms and industrials. The biggest drag on the main index was telco Chorus Ltd , which fell as much as over 8 percent, its biggest drop in six months.

2018-03-19,"(Repeats March 16 column without change. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2FFcbQp By John Kemp LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - If the oil market has felt unusually quiet in recent weeks and months, that probably reflects the almost complete lack of sharp daily price movements. While prices have soared by more than 40 percent since the middle of 2017, day-to-day volatility has fallen to its lowest level since 2014, with a relatively smooth and orderly upward adjustment in prices. Short-term volatility has been trending downwards since early 2016 and in January fell to its lowest since August 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2FFcbQp). The 20-day standard deviation of daily price moves expressed at an annualised rate — one common measure of volatility — dropped to only 13 percent in January from 80 percent almost two year earlier. Volatility in early and mid-January was in the bottom fifth percentile for any 20-day period since the start of 1990. The relatively sharp drop in oil prices at the start of February has since pushed volatility slightly higher, at least temporarily, but even that decline was relatively smooth. Volatility is still only in the 28th percentile of the post-1990 distribution and is set to decline again if the market’s more recent calm is sustained. There have been no significantly large daily price movements in Brent, up or down, since June 2017, which was the last time there was a daily move exceeding 2 standard deviations. The last really abnormal price move, exceeding 3 standard deviations and nearing 4, was all the way back in November 2016, when OPEC announced that it had reached agreement on cutting production. French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot noted the average level of volatility in commodity prices, as well as other assets, is itself volatile (“The Variation of Certain Speculative Prices”, Mandelbrot, 1963). Commodity markets alternate between “mild” and “wild” states, characterised by lower and higher levels of volatility respectively (“The (Mis)Behaviour of Markets”, Mandelbrot, 2004). Since OPEC and non-OPEC countries announced their declaration of cooperation in late 2016, the oil market has been in a mild state, and the absence of volatility has been especially pronounced in the past nine months. Strong growth in global oil consumption has been accompanied by large upward revisions in forecast oil production. Global oil inventories have shrunk sharply, but there is broad optimism that future production will grow fast enough to meet demand. Record buying of futures and options linked to petroleum by hedge funds and other money managers has been matched by strong interest in short-selling and hedging from producers. The result is that market liquidity has been very high, with the accumulation of relatively large futures and options positions and heavy turnover inducing only modest price changes. The critical question for traders and investors is whether this relatively suppressed level of volatility will continue. And if so, for how long? The shift from mild to wild usually occurs abruptly and without warning. There isn’t usually a gradual transition from one state to the other. Several risk factors could cause an upsurge in volatility in the next few months, including the unwinding of concentrated hedge fund positions, uncertainty surrounding future growth of U.S. shale production and macroeconomic risks to oil consumption. Volatility could also come from within the market itself, in the form of flash crashes that arise from the positioning of market participants and do not need any external, fundamental trigger. Periods of low volatility tend to breed complacency and excessive risk-taking among traders, which sows the seeds of their own demise. While various risk factors can be identified in the current market, periods of low volatility can persist for a surprisingly long time. The previous period of low volatility extended for more than two years, from mid-2012 to early 2015. The current mild phase has already lasted for almost 15 months, since the start of 2017, but it will not last forever.

2018-03-19,"* Most Asia share markets shade softer in early trading * Investors wait to see if Fed signals 3 or 4 more hikes * Dollar yet to get much support from higher rates By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, March 19 (Reuters) - Asian share markets got off to a hesitant start on Monday for a week in which the Federal Reserve is likely to deliver a hike in U.S. interest rates and perhaps signal that as many as three more lie in store for the rest of the year. Japan’s Nikkei took an early 0.3 percent drop as exporters were hit by recent broad-based gains in the yen. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1 percent, while Australia’s main index edged up 0.1 percent. While Wall Street bounced on Friday, the major indices still ended lower for the week. The Dow lost 1.57 percent, the S&P 1.04 percent and the Nasdaq 1.27 percent. The decline was surprising given figures from Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed a record $43.3 billion inflow into equities last week, outpacing bond flows for the first time since 2013. For the year so far $9.8 billion has gone into tech stocks and $7.3 billion into financials, while $41 billion has flowed into emerging markets and $31 billion into Japan. Whether the cash continues to flow could depend on what the Fed decides on Wednesday. All 104 analysts polled by Reuters expected the Fed would raise rates to between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent on Wednesday. They were less certain on whether the “dot plot” forecasts of committee members will stay at three hikes this year or shift higher.

2018-03-19,"OLKARIA, Kenya, March 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As the semi-nomadic Maasai of Kenya’s Great Rift Valley prepare to lose more land to a geothermal plant, they hope to win a better deal this time, after meeting the Maori in New Zealand. Protests by the Maasai - known for dressing in red blankets and colourful beads - halted construction in 2016 of Kenya’s Olkaria V plant, about 100 km (62 miles) northwest of the capital Nairobi, on ancestral land sacred to community rituals. Although building resumed after negotiations, both sides are keen to improve relations so that the hot water under the soil can help to lift the Maasai community, who farm and herd cattle on the semi-arid land above it, out of poverty. “(The Maori) have conflicts, but they’ve found better ways to solve them,” said Mwangi Sururu, who travelled to down south in November to see how the indigenous New Zealanders kept their culture intact by partnering with energy firms. “They were given a share in the power plants and the areas that were already being used for power production were leased directly from them,” said the Maasai elder, who was one of more than 1,000 people evicted from their Rift Valley land in 2014. Kenya is Africa’s biggest geothermal producer. It aims by 2025 to triple its output of clean electricity made from generating stations that harness natural, underground heat. This will require more geothermal plants. But further encroachment on land claimed by the Maasai could cause conflicts if the process is not managed carefully, said John Maina of the renewable energy department at Kenya’s energy ministry. “Problems arise when the investor doesn’t do thorough community engagement and participation,” Maina told a public forum hosted by the University of Nairobi. “Geothermal projects are very sensitive and people have to be moved because of the nature of the steam ... but this sometimes causes friction with the community.” CROSS-CONTINENTAL The Maasai-Maori exchange was arranged by Power Africa, former U.S. President Barack Obama’s signature Africa energy initiative, which aims to boost access to electricity in a continent where two in three people live without it. The Maasai and the Maori consider geothermal springs as critical to their way of life, offering heat for cooking, a place to treat ailments and a venue for traditional rituals. The Maori said they faced similar threats to their lands but found ways to work with the plant operators. “We are an indigenous community over here, and we’ve had some projects just like the Maasai,” said Desterney Mana Newton, chairman of New Zealand’s Ngati Tahu Tribal Lands Trust, which administers blocks of Maori land used for geothermal projects. “We feel we can learn from each other,” he said by phone. Benefits included taking up shares in companies investing in geothermal plants and monitoring their activities so that the Maori way of life was not affected, said Newton, who was part of the exchange programme. The Maori also received dividends and revenue from annual rates paid for leases on their land, he added. The Maori have one key advantage over the Maasai. Under New Zealand law, they “own the resources mined in their land”, Sururu said, while the Maasai do not have the right to any underground resources, all of which belong to the state. When the Olkaria IV plant was being built, state-run Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) relocated more than 100 families - including Sururu’s - to a 1,700-acre (688-hectare) plot on Kedong Ranch, about 20 km away. The exercise was marred with controversy. An investigation by the World Bank, one of several international lenders, found that evicted families were adversely affected. “People were resettled to land which was less suitable for them than their older habitats,” its 2015 report said. KenGen - the country’s biggest electricity generator - said it has been holding meetings with Maasai leaders every two months since 2014 to address community concerns. “We are trying to find common meeting points,” said Moses Wekesa, KenGen’s business development director, adding that KenGen cannot ignore community concerns because it plans to build at least three more geothermal plants in Olkaria. The East African nation is ramping up electricity production to keep up with growing demand for power and to reduce frequent blackouts. Given the challenges in compensating the Maasai with alternative plots of land, KenGen is vesting its hopes in other approaches, including a bill tabled in parliament last month. It lays out a revenue-sharing regime under which geothermal companies pay up to 2.5 percent of revenue from a site into a fund for a decade, with higher royalties in later years. The national government would take at least 75 percent, with 20 percent for local governments and 5 percent for the local community, the energy bill says. “The revenue-sharing bill will help,” Sururu said. KenGen is already negotiating resettlement with people living on the proposed Olkaria VI site, said Cyrus Karingithi, a resource development manager for the company. “Eventually they will have to move because the plant is something that benefits more than just a few people,” he said, pointing at a sparsely-housed plain beyond the Olkaria IV plant. ""But negotiations have not been completed,"" added Maasai elder Maenga Kisotu. ""(The Maori) have shown us how they live with the energy companies.""
