2019-02-01,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday reported a quarterly profit that topped analysts’ estimates, pushing its shares up as oil and natural gas output rose slightly on a year-over-year basis. The company’s fourth-quarter net income fell to $6 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $8.38 billion a year ago. But earnings excluding the impacts of tax reform and impairments rose to $6.4 billion from $3.73 billion a year ago. Analysts had forecast a $1.08 a share profit excluding one-time items, according to data from Refinitiv. Exxon’s oil equivalent production rose to just over 4 million barrels per day, up from 3.9 million bpd in the same period the year prior. The company said its output in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale basin, rose 90 percent over a year ago. Results for oil and gas production were “especially strong,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones. “It was a good quarter to end the year. I think the focus now will be on improving the cash flow,” he said. Exxon is not planning share buybacks this quarter, though, which makes it the only international oil company “not currently repurchasing shares,” analysts with Simmons Energy said in a client note. The company now expects to spend $30 billion this year, up from about $28 billion it had forecast previously, and analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a client note that the higher spending “takes away from the ‘sizzle’ of the quarter.” CEO Darren Woods said Exxon would sanction liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Mozambique this year. Qatar Petroleum and Exxon are expected to announce plans next week to proceed with the $10 billion Golden Pass LNG Terminal export project in Texas. Pretax earnings in its refining business were $2.7 billion, up $1.70 billion over the same period the year prior.  Exxon earned $1.1 billion more pretax in its upstream business than it did in the fourth quarter of 2017, and said higher natural gas prices were partially offset by lower liquids pricing. Pretax profits in Exxon’s chemicals business were down $191 million on weaker margins, growth-related expenses and higher downtime and maintenance. Woods credited better-than-expected results to the company optimizing its operations across the board, and said it has an advantage because of its ability to tie decisions in the oil field to logistics and refining.  “Irrespective of where we are in the cycle, we’re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,” he said. Woods joined a conference call with analysts this morning for the first time since becoming CEO two years ago. Production declines have been a significant issue in previous quarters for Exxon and it is a “positive sign” that production improved in the fourth quarter, said Muhammed Ghulam, analyst with Raymond James. But he noted the earnings beat was “partially driven by one-time asset sale gains of more than $800 million” from a refinery sale. Exxon shares closed up 3.6 percent at $75.92. They are down about 11 percent in the last year. Exxon is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

2019-02-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department on Friday told staff they are banned from taking part in foreign recruitment programs as the agency seeks to stop China and other countries from illegally acquiring sensitive research in supercomputing and other technologies. Dan Brouillette, the Energy Department’s deputy secretary, said in a memo the agency that recruitment programs sponsored by certain countries “threaten the United States’ economic base by facilitating the unauthorized transfer of technology and intellectual property to foreign governments.” Potential recruits are offered prestigious positions at foreign research institutes, labs and universities, it said. Employees will have to leave the department if they participate in recruitment programs from countries it determines to be “sensitive,” the memo said. The Energy Department oversees a network of 17 national labs that work on sensitive issues including advanced nuclear energy, nuclear weapons and supercomputing, some of which is classified.  The memo, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, did not name specific countries, but successive U.S. administrations, including that of President Donald Trump, have been concerned about China obtaining U.S. intellectual property.  A Department of Energy official said on condition of anonymity that the administration was not specifically targeting China, and that the initiative could help the agency learn more about which foreign programs have been seeking to recruit department employees.   “It gives employees a chance to disclose that information,” the official said. “It’s basically giving them the chance to say, ‘OK I want to be paid by DOE or I want to be paid by this outside, state-funded initiative’.”  Some foreign government-sponsored talent recruitment programs “have taken advantage of America’s openness to collaboration to infiltrate our labs, steal our technology and use our own resources against us,” a DOE press official said.   The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2019-02-01,"NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sunday’s U.S. Super Bowl will score on the clean energy front, with an environmental group and a beer maker for the first time offering to offset greenhouse gas emissions linked to fans’ travel and the host city of Atlanta, organizers said. More than a million people were expected to visit the Southern city and surrounding area for championship game pitting the Los Angeles Rams against the New England Patriots. The environmental non-profit Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and giant beer maker Budweiser said they would purchase clean energy certificates to fuel the party. Clean energy certificates are a way for one company to offset the amount of carbon dioxide it is producing by paying another company to produce less. RMI said it struck a deal with Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport to offset 18,000 metric tons of carbon emissions pegged to fans’ air travel to the game - generating equivalent greenhouse gases of 14,000 cars driven for a year. The clean energy will come from capturing gas produced at two Georgia-based landfills, RMI said. The deal also involved offset energy provider The Good Traveler. Anheuser-Busch, meanwhile, the brewer of Budweiser, said it will donate clean electricity certificates to Atlanta, the amount of which will be calculated following the game. The contributions mark an expansion of an effort already more than a decade old to offset electricity associated with the annual game, said Jack Groh, director of the National Football League’s environmental program. The league previously purchased renewable energy certificates to cover the energy footprint associated with the host stadium, convention center, teams, hotels and other items, he said. Typically, energy use tied to the Super Bowl averages 4,000 megawatts of energy per hour, said Groh, generating greenhouse gasses equivalent to 600 cars driven for a year. Offset certificates have recently cost between $1.50 and $2.50 per megawatt-hour, he said. At Pennsylvania State University, Judd Michael, a professor specializing in sports sustainability, said that given the challenges of developing clean energy infrastructure for the sports event, offsets “may be the best option there is.” “If we can use the Super Bowl to encourage green energy such as solar wind and help to pay for the solar or wind power, either way, that’s a positive for the development of those markets,” he added. Natural gas accounts for just over 40 percent of Georgia’s net electricity generation, according to the state’s government, followed by nuclear energy and coal. Cleaner sources such as hydroelectricity contributed just 8 percent. Burning fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal for energy emits greenhouse gases which cause global warming. The United States, the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, saw its carbon dioxide emissions rise by 3.4 percent last year, according to a preliminary estimate by the Rhodium Group, an independent research organization.

2019-02-01,"(Reuters) - Acting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler, President Donald Trump’s pick to run the agency permanently, held nearly 20 times more meetings with industry representatives than with conservationists during his first two months on the job, according to a copy of his schedule. The industry focus fits neatly with the administration’s efforts to reduce environmental red tape for companies, but could add fuel to criticism from Democrats that Wheeler - who is due to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate in the coming days - is too cozy with the industries he oversees. Wheeler, a longtime Washington insider, took the reins at EPA in July after his predecessor, Scott Pruitt, resigned in a storm of controversy over his high spending on first-class travel, round-the-clock security and office equipment. During his first several weeks on the job, Wheeler met 18 times with industry representatives, including executives from BP, Valero, FedEx Corp, Monsanto, a unit of Bayer, and the American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association, according to the newly released record of his schedule. Wheeler met just once with a non-governmental conservation group, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, according to the schedule, which covers July and August and was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the Sierra Club. EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said Wheeler had met with a “diverse range of stakeholders” and added that Wheeler is “happy to meet with those who actually request meetings.” Pruitt also held the vast majority of his meetings with industry representatives, according to his public schedule.  But in Wheeler, Trump has seen another strong supporter of his deregulatory agenda and advocate for the fossil fuels industry without the constant criticism over alleged ethical violations that plagued Pruitt. Wheeler had worked at the EPA in the 1990s and later in the Senate under Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, from the oil-rich state of Oklahoma and a skeptic of mainstream climate science, before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant. Wheeler has said that he is “not at all ashamed” of his lobbying for the coal company Murray Energy Corp, which he has said focused on securing the pensions of miners.  Wheeler also lobbied for utility Xcel Energy Inc and consulted for biofuels industry group Growth Energy, agricultural merchant and biofuels producer Archer Daniels Midland Co and International Paper Co, according to his public disclosures. During a Senate hearing on his nomination last month, Wheeler said he did not believe climate change was “the greatest crisis” and defended the agency’s moves under Trump to roll back Obama-era measures to fight global warming.

2019-02-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond yields rose and stock markets mostly edged higher on Friday after U.S. employment and manufacturing data underscored a strong economy with little wage inflation, but a gloomy outlook from Amazon.com gave investors pause. U.S. job growth surged in January, with employers hiring the most workers in 11 months, the Labor Department said, pointing to underlying strength in the economy despite an uncertain outlook that has left the Federal Reserve wary about more interest rate hikes this year. The employment report showed a tepid gain in hourly earnings while the ISM “prices paid” index slipped more than expected, the latest data that show a modest U.S. inflationary pace. Prices in the U.S. futures markets indicate traders see no rate hikes ahead. Short-term futures in fact show they remain convinced the U.S. central bank’s next move will be a rate cut rather than a hike. Stocks on Wall Street pared early session gains to close near break-even while European markets closed a bit higher. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose  0.02 percent and emerging market stocks fell 0.03 percent.  Earlier in Europe, the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.21 percent. Amazon.com posted record sales and profit during the holiday season, but its shares fell 5.38 percent after its quarterly sales forecast fell short of Wall Street estimates. The e-commerce giant was easily the biggest drag on the Nasdaq and S&P 500, while consumer discretionary stocks  fell 1.77 percent, the biggest losing sector on the benchmark index. Amazon’s results suggested U.S. consumers may be spending less, a potential sign of a slowing economy, said Cliff Hodge, director of investments at Cornerstone Wealth. “They’ve been in a very strong environment, but you can see things start to slow down a little bit,” Hodge said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.22 points, or 0.26 percent, to 25,063.89. The S&P 500 gained 2.43 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,706.53 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.87 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,263.87. While fourth-quarter results have mostly beaten expectations, there have been 27 negative earnings pre-announcements issued by companies in the S&P 500 for the first quarter, compared with nine positive, Refinitiv data show. The negative-to-positive ratio is now 3.0, which is above the long-term average of 2.7 and above the prior four-quarter average of 1.5, Refinitiv said. The estimated first-quarter earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 companies has declined to 0.7 percent from 5.3 percent on Jan 1, Refinitiv said. The data suggests slower U.S. growth and adds to a growing list of economic readings indicating slowing global growth. The Caixin/Markit index of Chinese manufacturing fell to its lowest since February 2016. Oil prices rose, lifted by signs the United States and China could soon settle their protracted trade dispute, while producer cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan exports helped tighten supply. International Brent crude oil futures settled up $1.91 to $62.75 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose $1.47 to settle at $55.26. The dollar index rose 0.01 percent, with the euro up 0.13 percent to $1.159. The Japanese yen weakened 0.56 percent versus the greenback at 109.48 per dollar. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.2 percent to$1,322.10. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 15/32 in price to push their yield up to 2.6896 percent. “The big news of the week is the tone of the Fed has turned a bit dovish.

2019-02-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 3 percent on Friday on upbeat U.S. jobs data and signs that U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan exports have helped tighten supply, then extending gains after weekly data showed U.S. drillers cut the number of oil rigs. Brent crude oil futures rose $1.91 a barrel, or 3.14 percent, to settle at $62.75 a barrel. The international benchmark notched a weekly gain of about 1.9 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures ended the session at $55.26, up $1.47 a barrel or 2.73 percent and gained about 3 percent on the week.  Prices climbed to session highs after General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm reported that U.S. energy firms cut the number of operating oil rigs for a fourth week in the past five, bringing the count to the lowest in eight months. Last week’s data showed the rig count in January fell the most in a month since April 2016. Oil prices got a boost from Wall Street after surprisingly strong U.S. job growth data fed demand for equities. Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s Petróleos de Venezuela SA this week, keeping tankers stuck at ports. On Friday, the U.S. Treasury Department provided details. “We are beginning to see the impact to crude supplies from the sanctions on Venezuela. It has driven up domestic crude prices, cutting into refiner margins,” Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said. “That, combined with Saudi cuts and Libyan production declines has changed market sentiment as we appear to be moving toward a better balanced supply situation.” Some U.S. refiners have begun reducing crude processing as sanctions have boosted oil costs and as gasoline margins crashed to their lowest in nearly a decade, market sources told Reuters on Thursday. In January, Saudi Arabia pumped 350,000 bpd less than in December, a Reuters survey showed. Financial markets also gained support from comments on Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to resolve a trade standoff. But Trump later warned he could postpone talks if a deal remains elusive.  China’s trade delegation said the latest round of talks with the United States made “important progress”, state news agency Xinhua reported. “Many traders recognize that sense is likely to prevail and a deal will be struck after the summit - although the shape of any deal will continue to drive a jittery market,” Cantor Fitzgerald Europe said in a note. But a survey showed China’s factory activity shrank by the most in almost three years in January, reinforcing fears about fuel demand in the world’s second-largest economy. Analysts believe the oil market will be more balanced in 2019 after supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  Iraq’s oil exports averaged 3.649 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, down slightly from the previous month, the oil ministry said on Friday.

2019-02-01,"(Adds U.S. State Department response) By Marianna Parraga Feb 1 (Reuters) - Six executives from U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum held in a Venezuelan jail without a court hearing for more than a year have asked the U.S. State Department and lawmakers to help win their release, family members and lawyers said. Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Zambrano, Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell and Gustavo Cardenas, all former vice presidents of the Houston-based company and most of them U.S. citizens, along with former Citgo President Jose Pereira were arrested in November 2017 after being called into a meeting at the Caracas office of parent company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA . The executives were accused of embezzlement, being public servants acting in concert with a contractor, money laundering and conspiracy in connection with a never-concluded agreement to refinance Citgo debt. A preliminary court hearing has not yet been held. “They have robbed them of due process and their right to a timely trial,” a group of 13 family members and lawyers said in an open letter to the U.S. government seen by Reuters. “Top U.S. government intervention may be our only chance at releasing the six detainees.” The attorneys did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation. They said they contacted the U.S. State Department, several senators and congressmen before resorting to the media. The U.S. government has not provided any clear indication of progress on the cases, they said. A State Department spokeswoman said on Friday it was unable to comment on the status of private U.S. citizens. “We continue to work closely with international partners to ensure the safety and security of U.S. citizens in Venezuela,” she said in an email. The plea emerged as a battle over Citgo’s fate by Socialist Nicolas Maduro’s government and a group led by the congress head Juan Guaido was sparked by U.S. support for the opposition. Guaido has said he wants to appoint a new board for the company, now in the hands of officials nominated by Maduro. Attorneys for the executives have documents that show debt refinancing negotiations were approved by the PDVSA board. One document viewed by Reuters indicates the board in June 2017 approved the start of negotiations with Apollo Global Management LLC and its unit Frontier Management Group. The deal was never signed. U.S. sanctions imposed in August 2017 scuttled any deal. Apollo and Venezuela’s Attorney General office did not respond to requests for comment. Maduro in 2017 began a corruption crackdown at PDVSA that led to dozens of executives being jailed, including former Citgo and PDVSA President Nelson Martinez. Martinez died in custody in December. Executives “have been forced to sleep with the lights on and experience severe heat, lack of air circulation, constant and untreated sickness, overcrowding, malnutrition, and seeing less than 30 minutes of sunlight per month,” their families wrote. “One of the reasons why I retired from Citgo was Vadell’s detention,” said Charles Alexander, a former Citgo manager whose contact information was provided by the executives’ families. “He has been inappropriately arrested and abused.” (Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Additional reporting by Vivian Sequera in Caracas and Lesley Wroughton in Washington; Editing by Richard Chang)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-citgo-prison/update-1-jailed-citgo-executives-seek-u-s-help-to-win-their-release-idUKL1N1ZW1QJ,01 Feb 2019,"Six executives from U.S. refiner Citgo

U.S. sanctions imposed in August 2017 scuttled any deal. Apollo and Venezuela’s Attorney General office did not respond to requests for comment. Maduro in 2017 began a corruption crackdown at PDVSA that led to dozens of executives being jailed, including former Citgo and PDVSA President Nelson Martinez. Martinez died in custody in December. Executives “have been forced to sleep with the lights on and experience severe heat, lack of air circulation, constant and untreated sickness, overcrowding, malnutrition, and seeing less than 30 minutes of sunlight per month,” their families wrote. “One of the reasons why I retired from Citgo was Vadell’s detention,” said Charles Alexander, a former Citgo manager whose contact information was provided by the executives’ families. “He has been inappropriately arrested and abused.” (Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Additional reporting by Vivian Sequera in Caracas; Editing by Richard Chang)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-citgo-prison/jailed-citgo-executives-ask-the-u-s-to-help-win-their-release-idUKL1N1ZV2LI,01 Feb 2019,"Six executives from U.S. refiner Citgo

2019-02-01,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, two of the world’s largest oil producers, on Friday posted improved quarterly earnings that benefited from double-digit percentage increases in production from the top U.S. shale field. Shares of both companies rose about 3 percent. The two U.S. oil majors missed the first stage of the shale boom in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and have been investing billions of dollars to make up for lost time. They are betting their size and other businesses offer advantages smaller producers cannot duplicate. Combined, the two companies pumped 677,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in the shale field last quarter, close to a fifth of the region’s total oil production, according to figures released on Friday. Exxon said its fourth-quarter Permian production was 300,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, up 93 percent from a year ago and up 12 percent over the third quarter. Chevron’s output in the Permian jumped to 377,000 barrels per day, up 84 percent from the same period a year earlier. “In just two years we have doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs, and more than doubled our production,” Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said on an earnings call. Both companies are tying their shale operations to logistics and refining arms that independents do not have.  “We’re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said on an earnings call, noting the company’s close coupling of pipeline, logistics and oil refining operations to shale. In nine of the previous 10 quarters Exxon’s overall oil and gas output dropped, but its fourth-quarter production edged up to just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 3.9 million in the year-ago period. Production at Exxon, the nation’s largest oil and gas producer, was “very strong,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones.  The Permian, now producing 3.85 million barrels per day, is forecast to generate 5.4 million barrels per day by 2023, greater than any single OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia, according to consultancy IHS Markit. Shale fields’ fast payoff is lifting both companies’ earnings and cash flow. Chevron generated $9.2 billion in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, up from $8.0 billion a year earlier. Its 2019 capital spending budget is going toward projects that can deliver cash within two years, Wirth said.   Exxon, in addition to shale, continues to invest heavily in  major refining, chemical and offshore projects.  That has not sat well with some investors. Its stock is off 13 percent in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. Exxon is the only international oil company “not currently repurchasing shares,” Simmons Energy said in a note. Exxon shares were up 3.03 percent at $75.50 in afternoon trading, and Chevron shares were up 3.04 percent at $118.13. Exxon’s fourth-quarter net income fell to $6 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $8.38 billion a year ago, when results benefited substantially from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impacts of tax reform and asset impairments, earnings rose to $6.4 billion from $3.73 billion a year ago. Chevron reported a quarterly profit of $3.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared with $3.11 billion, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier.

2019-02-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions will sharply limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to but slightly less extensive than those imposed on Iran last year, experts said on Friday after looking at details posted by the Treasury Department. Treasury’s notice makes more explicit that the sanctions restrict foreign entities from doing business with Venezuela using the U.S. financial system or U.S. brokers after April. With most oil transactions conducted in dollars, that is expected to sharply curtail off Venezuela’s efforts to seek buyers around the world. U.S. officials imposed sanctions on state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, this week, seeking to cut off President Nicolas Maduro’s primary source of foreign revenues. Most of the Western Hemisphere has thrown its support behind opposition leader Juan Guaido after Maduro was re-elected in a contest last year widely seen as fraudulent.  “On one hand, the sanctions aren’t as severe as on Iran yet. We don’t ban any country that does business with Venezuela from doing business in the U.S.,” said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy, a Washington D.C. consultancy. “On the other hand, the goal of regime change is explicit and very clear.” Venezuela sells oil to buyers around the world, including India and Europe, and the country has been seeking buyers elsewhere to replace the roughly 500,000 barrels a day it sells to the United States. Even before Friday’s notice, European buyers had pulled back on taking shipments from Venezuela due to concerns about how to make payments. Europe may also join the sanctions, experts have said, further constraining options for transporting the crude.  “If a supplier can do so without using the U.S. financial system, then they are not in breach of anything. But find me any market participant that does not,” said an executive at a major trading house.  Spokespeople for Vitol and Trafigura, two of the largest merchant traders in commodities, both said Friday they will comply with all applicable sanctions.  Few alternative buyers are available for the heavy Venezuelan crude oil that is currently shipped to the United States, said Ed Morse, global head of commodity research at Citi Group.  “It’s just not clear that there’s 500,000 barrels a day of upgrading capacity around the world that is freed up to do that,” Morse said.  The large-scale sanctions froze the assets of PDVSA and also require U.S. firms to pay for oil into accounts controlled by Guaido, the country’s opposition party head and self-proclaimed interim president.  The move is part of the broader effort to force out Maduro, who as head of state has presided over a severe economic crisis that has caused millions to flee the country amid hyperinflation and lack of basic resources. The Treasury’s notice also clarified that holders of PDVSA bonds can only sell that debt to non-U.S. holders, raising concern among some bondholders of the debt, as it limits those who can purchase those bonds. The country’s sovereign debt is not subject to that same restriction. The price on PDVSA’s debt issue due in 2026 traded at 23.75 cents on the dollar on Friday, while the sovereign 2024 issue was at 29.5 cents on the dollar.

2019-02-01,"PARIS (Reuters) - A French court has rejected an urgent request by environmental groups including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth to deny oil and gas major Total permission to proceed with plans to drill off the coast of French Guyana. The environmental groups asked the court in December to suspend Total’s permit to drill five wells in the block over environmental concerns. The court said there was no need for an urgent ruling, which would have come in time to halt the drilling operations. Greenpeace said that although the ruling on the urgent request was disappointing, the group was hopeful that it could still stop the drilling operation by another means.  Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have filed a separate court application to annul Total’s exploration permit in offshore French Guyana, it said, adding that the groups will keep up pressure on the company’s projects in the region. Total welcomed the court’s decision and said the drilling operation was ongoing. “The campaign launched in mid-December will therefore continue with the objective of drilling the exploration wells,” Total said. Drilling offshore Guyana is part of 23 drilling projects Total aims to carry out in 2019 in its biggest oil exploration drive in recent years.   Total said in December that a drilling vessel was on the site to start drilling, and it invited activists to visit the site saying it was taking measures to protect the environment and would not endanger coral reefs in the region.

2019-02-01,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp are expected to announce plans next week to proceed with a $10 billion project that will expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility in Texas, three people familiar with the transaction said.  ConocoPhillips, the third partner in the existing import terminal, plans to sell its 12.4 percent stake and does not plan to participate in the expansion, the people said.  LNG demand is soaring. Worldwide consumption of the fuel is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market.  Golden Pass LNG began as a receiving and regasification facility in Sabine Pass, Texas able to handle up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas imports per day.  However, as U.S. gas production has soared to new records, bolstered by shale production, the demand for export capacity has increased. The potential $10 billion expansion, first announced in 2014, would focus on this new market dynamic.  It is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest some $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas footprint. The most likely buyer for ConocoPhillips’ stake is Exxon Mobil, two of the people said, adding that the existing partners do not want to bring in another participant, as plans for the project are in advanced stages.  Currently, Exxon has a 30 percent stake in the LNG export project, and Qatar Petroleum holds a 70 percent stake. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique.  Exxon expects this year to “sanction” the Golden Pass export terminal and another LNG project in Mozambique, Chief Executive Darren Woods said Friday on a conference call with analysts.  The company has been “working very closely with QP (Qatar Petroleum), our partner in Golden Pass, to advance that investment and look forward to announcing something here in the very near term,” Woods said. Qatar was the world’s largest LNG producer in 2017 and has annual output of 77 million tonnes.  Exxon and ConocoPhillips declined to comment, while Qatar Petroleum could not immediately be reached for comment. ConocoPhillips’ stake sale led to delays in announcing the final decision to proceed with the project, one of the people said. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The move comes as ConocoPhillips hones its focus on international projects.   The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Firms are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year. That’s well above the previous record of about 45 million tonnes in 2005 and triple last year’s 21 million tonnes, Wood Mackenzie’s research director for global gas and LNG, Giles Farrer, said last month. More than 320 million tonnes of LNG was shipped globally in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data. Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country.

2019-02-01,"(Adds rigs in Permian basin) Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil rigs operating to their lowest in eight months as some drillers follow through on plans to spend less on new wells this year. Drillers cut 15 oil rigs in the week to Feb. 1, bringing the total count down to 847, the lowest since May 2018, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That was the fourth time drillers cut rigs in the past five weeks. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian where active units fell by three this week to 481, matching its lowest level since August. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when 765 rigs were active. Energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. In 2019, however, some drillers have said they plan to remove rigs due in part to forecasts for lower crude prices than last year. U.S. crude futures were trading over $55 a barrel on Friday, near their highest in over two months on signs the United States and China could soon settle their trade dispute while producer cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan exports tighten supplies. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $56 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and calendar 2020 .

U.S. shale producer Continental Resources said this week it expects oilfield services costs to remain low in 2019 as companies that provide drilling and completion work continue to face pressure from softer oil prices. U.S. crude production, meanwhile, continued to rise, hitting a new high of 11.9 million barrels per day in November, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said this week. Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday its output in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale oil basin, rose 90 percent over a year ago. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said this week that early indications from the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks point to a 2 percent increase in capital expenditures for drilling and completions in 2019. In total, Cowen said those E&P companies spent about $88.7 billion in 2018. There were 1,045 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and gas rig count will fall from 1,032 in 2018 to 999 in 2019 before rising to 1,087 in 2020.

2019-02-01,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil and natural gas producer Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Friday reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts’ estimates on higher prices and production, sending shares higher in morning  trading. Results for the San Ramon, California, company reflected a 12.5-percent increase in oil and gas production as net output rose to 3.08 million bpd. Prices paid for its crude were $59 a barrel in the quarter, up from $57 a year earlier, the company said. It was “a good beat overall,” said Muhammed Ghulam, an analyst at Raymond James. “Permian production growth remained strong, up 12 percent compared to the prior quarter and 84 percent year over year,” he said.  The Trump administration last month added new sanctions against imports from Venezuela, where Chevron is the last major U.S. oil company with production operations.  Chevron continues to operate in Venezuela and believes it can maintain a “good, stable operation” there, Chief Executive Michael Wirth said Friday on a call with analysts. It has been able to replace Venezuelan crude usually processed at its Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery, he said. Chevron’s fourth-quarter cash flow from operations rose to $9.2 billion from $8 billion a year earlier, reflecting the higher output and expense reduction. Investors have been pushing oil companies to restrain spending and increase returns to shareholders. Wirth forecast oil-equivalent production this year to grow between 4 percent and 7 percent, excluding asset sales.  Chevron reported a profit of $3.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared with $3.11 billion, or $1.64 a share a year earlier. Analysts’ mean forecast was $1.87 a share, according to Refinitiv.  Its operating results compared to the year-ago period were lower because of the impact of U.S. tax reform a year ago. Profit from oil and gas exploration was $3.29 billion compared with $5.29 billion a year earlier; refining profit fell to $256 million compared with $1.2 billion a year ago. The company this week agreed to pay $350 million to buy a refinery in Pasadena, Texas, from Brazilian state oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA), confirming a Reuters report from Monday. The acquisition is intended to process oil flowing from its West Texas shale fields.   Shares were up 4 percent at $118.79 in midday trading, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.

U.S. job growth surged in January, with employers hiring the most workers in 11 months, the Labor Department said, while the U.S. ISM manufacturing index rose more than consensus estimates as its “prices paid” index slipped more than expected. Prices in the U.S. futures markets show traders see no rate hikes ahead, though short-term futures indicate they remain convinced the U.S. central bank’s next move will be a rate cut rather than a hike. Stocks resumed a rally that pushed many equity markets to post their best January in years. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.12 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.21 percent. The strong jobs number and little inflation smacked of a Goldilocks economy that is not overheating or too cold to fall into recession. The Fed may hike one more time in 2019, but after its policy statement on Wednesday urging patience, that would happen only in the second half of the year, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone Financial Inc in New York. “The story being told here is the economy is healthy but inflation continues to face challenges,” he said. “This makes even more a compelling argument for the stock market.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 146.6 points, or 0.59 percent, to 25,146.27. The S&P 500 gained 7.3 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,711.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.17 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,282.91. Exxon Mobil Corp rose 4.01 percent and Chevron Corp jumped 3.12 percent after the oil majors reported better-than-expected quarterly profits, boosting the Dow Jones industrial index. Amazon.com Inc fell 4.35 percent after its quarterly sales forecast fell short of Wall Street estimates, overshadowing its record sales and profit during the holiday season. While fourth-quarter results have mostly beaten expectations, there have been 27 negative earnings preannouncements issued by companies in the S&P 500 index, compared with nine positive, data from Refinitiv shows. The negative to positive ratio is now 3.0, which is above the long-term average of 2.7 and above the prior four-quarter average of 1.5, Refinitiv said. The data suggests slower U.S. growth and adds to a growing list of economic readings indicating slowing global growth. The Caixin/Markit index of Chinese manufacturing fell to its lowest since February 2016. Oil prices rose, lifted by signs the United States and China could soon settle their protracted trade dispute, while producer cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan exports helped tighten supply. International Brent crude oil futures rose $1.18 to $62.02 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures added 96 cents to $54.75. The dollar index fell 0.1 percent, with the euro up 0.24 percent to $1.1472. The Japanese yen eased 0.51 percent versus the greenback at 109.46 per dollar. “The big news of the week is the tone of the Fed has turned a bit dovish. The outlook for a tightening phase has come to an end,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.

2019-02-01,"NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Indian government will increase spending on exploration of coal and lignite by 20 percent in the coming financial year but will slash funding for coal mine safety and conservation, according to the federal budget document released on Friday. India is one of the world’s largest consumers of coal and rising imports of the fuel are adding to a burgeoning trade deficit, prompting the government to invest in developing more domestic resources. In the 2019/20 financial year that begins in April, the government aims to spend 6 billion rupees ($84 million) on exploration of coal and lignite, the document for the 2019/20 budget showed. At the same time, it will cut spending on conservation, safety and related infrastructure development by about a third from last year to 1.35 billion rupees, according to the document. India is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a coal miner, with one miner dying every six days on average in 2017, according to government data, but this will be the second straight year that the government has cut spending on safety. The coal ministry said that coal companies had their own safety budgets. State-run Coal India Ltd has a near monopoly, producing over four-fifths of the country’s coal output. It allocated 8.6 billion rupees for safety-related expenditure for the year ending March 2019, up from 8 billion rupees a year earlier, the ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters. It did not say how much it would allocate for safety-related spending in 2019/20. India scrapped a separate excise duty levied on coal companies, which was used by the federal coal ministry to shore up funds for enhancing safety, after it reformed tax policies in 2017. The coal ministry said it had increased spending for exploration in 2019/20 to develop more coal blocks to increase domestic coal production and minimize imports. “This will also enable (the) release of more coal blocks for auction/allocation,” the ministry said. In 2018, India’s thermal coal imports rose at the fastest pace in four years, according to two industry sources, despite moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to cut imports.

The environmental groups asked the court in December to suspend Total’s permit to drill five wells in the block over environmental concerns. The court said there was no need for an urgent ruling, which would have come in time to halt the drilling operations. Total said in December that a drilling vessel was on the site to start drilling, and it invited activists to visit the site saying it was taking measures to protect the environment and would not endanger coral reefs in the region.

2019-02-01,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - For three decades, California has led the fight to control tailpipe pollution, with countless policies promoting cleaner gasoline, carpooling, public transportation and its signature strategy - the electric vehicle. Californians now buy more than half of all EVs sold in the United States, and the state’s auto-pollution policies have provided a model being adopted around the world. But they’re not working at home, by the state’s own measure. Tailpipe pollution here is going up, not down, despite billions of dollars spent by one of the most environmentally progressive governments on earth. “The strategies that we’ve used up until now just haven’t been effective,” Mary Nichols, the head of the California Air Resources Board, told Reuters. That failure has less to do with energy or environmental policies and more with decades-old urban planning decisions that made California – and especially Los Angeles – a haven for sprawling development of single-family homes and long commutes, according to state officials. California’s struggle bodes poorly for other major U.S. cities with similar sprawl and expensive urban housing – such as Houston, Atlanta, and others that planned their cities around cars - and casts doubt on how quickly the United States can reduce greenhouse gas emissions amid urgent warnings from scientists about climate change. The United States is the world’s second-biggest carbon dioxide emitter behind China, at over 5.1 billion metric tons in 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state’s troubles also hold lessons for massive economies such as China and India that hope to control pollution from vehicles as they rapidly urbanize. Transportation is tied with power generation as America’s leading source of carbon dioxide emissions, at 28 percent, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency – and it takes top billing in California, at about 40 percent.  It makes up a smaller share in the rest of the world, where car ownership is lower but likely to grow. California’s carbon emissions amounted to 429 million metric tons in 2016, the last year for which data is available. That’s the lowest level since 1990 thanks to a shift away from coal-fired electricity towards natural gas, solar and wind.  But its next target - calling for a further 40 percent cut by 2030 - will be out of reach without transformative changes in state residents’ driving habits, CARB said in a report published late last year. As the state struggles to cut its own vehicle pollution, California officials are also fighting an effort by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to weaken national standards for automobile emissions. A spokesman for newly-elected Governor Gavin Newsom, who ran on a promise to continue California’s legacy of climate action, did not return requests for comment. California’s tailpipe emissions have risen 5 percent since 2013, according to CARB data, as population growth, urban sprawl, and a devotion to one’s own car produced longer commutes and choking traffic. The increase came even as the state has finally caught traction in promoting electric and hybrid vehicles, some 1.18 million of which have been sold in the state since 2011, according to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The government last year set a target of 5 million electric vehicles by 2030. But even hitting that goal – by no means assured - won’t be near enough to allow the state to meet its goal for carbon reduction, which would require California drivers to reduce per capita miles travelled by 25 percent, CARB said in its report.  The state has also boosted spending on public transport by about 60 percent over the past decade, according to CARB. But transit options are poorly suited for California’s vast expanses of suburban-style neighbourhoods. “If we keep thinking we are going to overcome a 1950s system overnight, that’s wrong,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the San Diego Association of Governments, the city’s main public planning body. The United States has pledged to cut carbon emissions by between 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris Agreement, an international pact to fight climate change reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015. While President Donald Trump has signalled his intention to pull the United States out of the accord, a group of states led by California wants to ensure the U.S. meets its commitments, which scientists call critical to avoiding the most devastating effects of climate change. But California’s problems - and those of other sprawling U.S. cities - suggest that meeting that goal will be difficult. In Houston, for example, tailpipe emissions have soared 46 percent, posing a major challenge for the city’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Unlike California, Texas has no statewide greenhouse-gas reduction goals, and the state’s love affair with gas-guzzling trucks is only deepening. More than two thirds of new vehicles registered in the Houston area last year were pickup trucks or SUVs, compared to less than half in Los Angeles, according to IHS Markit, a global financial information provider. Electric cars, by comparison, represent just 1 percent of new vehicle sales in Texas, according to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. In California, it was around 7 percent in the first eight months of last year, according to data compiled by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. Transportation emissions have also been rising in other major cities such as Atlanta, Philadelphia, and San Antonio, according to city climate emissions reports from recent years, and have climbed about 21 percent nationwide since 1990, according to the EPA.  Other parts of the world could have an easier time. In Europe, residents of densely populated cities face high fuel taxes, encouraging reduced car travel. Many European cities have seen relatively high levels of electric car adoption. And in China and India, which also have lofty electric vehicle targets, major cities are still being built - with pollution control in mind.  “They are much better able to bake in this kind of planning into their urban designs,” said John German, a senior fellow with the non-profit International Council on Clean Transportation. One example is China’s new zone of Xiongan, a spill-off district to ease overcrowding in Beijing, which is being designed from scratch. In a document published in January, the Chinese government promised to incorporate low-carbon development ideas – such as high-speed commuter rail and efficient land use - into its planning for Xiongan to “create a convenient, safe, green and intelligent transportation system”. China is also seeking to improve fuel standards, ban old cars, and stop diesel trucks from entering certain areas as car ownership surges by about 20 million vehicles per year. California officials, eager to maintain the state’s leadership role on climate action, hope to pave the way for a fix to entrenched urban sprawl.  Los Angeles is mulling a proposal to charge drivers during rush hour and use that money to make public transit free by 2028, according to Metro Chief Executive Phillip Washington. Other options include waiving fees for pooled rides to and from airports and adding safety lanes for scooters and bikes, said Dan Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. CARB Deputy Executive Officer Kurt Karperos said the state is planning talks with municipal governments to discuss controlling emissions through city planning.  Such efforts could include lower-cost housing in urban centers to bring people closer to work, and the elimination of building codes requiring parking spots to encourage more drop-off carpooling, according to experts. “It is a tough problem,” Karperos said.

2019-02-01,"BENGHAZI, Libya, Feb 1 (Reuters) - At least four Libyan soldiers were killed on Friday when forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar fought for hours with a local armed group as they sought to expand south, military officials said. Libya has been in turmoil since the NATO-backed toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with parallel administrations and armed groups carving the nation into swathes of control. Friday’s clashes were the first real resistance the Libyan National Army (LNA) faction faced since arriving in the south two weeks ago from its main eastern stronghold of Benghazi. LNA officials said clashes began when soldiers left the main southern city of Sabha and arrived in the nearby town of Ghudduwah. It backed troops with air strikes on the “terrorists” and “Chadian mercenaries”, the officials said, using a pejorative for Chadian opposition groups active in south Libya. As well as the four LNA fatalities, several of its soldiers were wounded, the officials said. There was no immediate confirmation of the LNA’s version, and it was unclear if there were also casualties on the other side. The LNA spent the last two weeks securing Sabha, which had been nominally under the control of the internationally-recognised government in Tripoli but was in practice run by local groups including tribes. The LNA says its campaign is intended to combat Islamic militants and secure oil facilities in the south, which include El Sharara oilfield, Libya’s biggest. It has been closed since December when tribesmen and state guards seized it. The LNA, whose commander Haftar dominates eastern Libya, is allied to a parallel government in Benghazi that opposes the Tripoli administration.

Asked if U.S. military intervention was imminent — or by Brazil or Colombia or a combination of all three nations — Trump adviser John Bolton told the Hugh Hewitt radio show: “No.” “The president said all options are on the table. But our objective is a peaceful transfer of power,” he said. The Trump administration is seeking to squeeze Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power and had backed opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido amid global jockeying over power in Caracas. U.S. officials have imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA, and Bolton has warned other countries not to deal with Maduro’s government regarding other Venezuelan assets such as gold. A senior official told Reuters that Venezuela soon planned to sell 15 tonnes of gold from central bank vaults to the United Arab Emirates. Bolton responded to the report in a series of tweets on Friday, accusing Maduro of “flying out Venezuelan assets by the plane full” and questioning whether he was “stealing resources” from the Venezuelan people.

2019-02-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - Freezing temperatures across much of the northern United States have caused barely a ripple in natural gas markets showing how plentiful supplies have become thanks to the shale revolution. In a sign of improving resilience, the gas and electricity networks have come through the most recent polar vortex with far less stress on gas supplies and electric generators than during the last major vortex in January 2014. While policymakers in Washington debate whether the increasing interconnectedness of gas and electricity systems poses a risk to reliability, both industries are improving their ability to cope with extreme cold events. Temperatures across the Midwest fell to multi-decade lows this week and daily gas consumption is forecast to have hit record levels on Jan. 31 (“U.S. natgas use hits record during freeze”, Reuters, Feb. 1). Even before the cold snap, gas stocks were 13 percent below the five-year average at the end of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Weekly natural gas storage report”, EIA, Jan. 31). But futures prices for gas delivered in March continued to fall and are now close to their lowest levels for the last four years, well below $3 per million British thermal units. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2BesoaZ) After surging higher between September and November, amid fears about the low level of inventories going into the winter, futures prices have fallen back as traders have become more confident about the supply situation. Gas stocks have remained reasonably comfortable as a result of a relatively mild winter so far and plentiful supplies that have ensured stocks have drawn down more slowly than in previous years for any given level of cold. The winter heating season has now passed the half-way point and, so far, temperatures have been slightly warmer than the long-term average, according to government data. Cumulative population-weighted heating degree days between July 1 and Jan. 30 were 3 percent lower than the long-term average (“Degree day statistics”, U.S. Climate Prediction Center, Jan. 31). This winter has been significantly colder than the exceptionally mild winters of 2015/16 and 2016/17 but about the same as winter 2017/18 and is still warmer than average so far. The current cold snap is expected to be relatively short-lived, with temperatures forecast to rise significantly in the next few days and heating demand expected to fall back below the seasonal norm. The impact on gas stocks and prices of generally mild temperatures has been compounded by much smaller draws on stockpiles for any given level of heating demand this year than in either 2017/18 or 2016/17. The limited drawdown on gas stocks reflects the tremendous surge in production which is easily able to meet growth in domestic demand including from electricity generators. U.S. gas production hit a record 2.70 trillion cubic feet in October and another near-record 2.65 trillion cubic feet in November, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. gas production has been growing at rates of around 13 percent per year, the fastest rate for at least two decades. Production is growing so fast that even with some of the coldest weather in decades supplies have remained adequate with no spike in prices and no forced curtailments by generators or significant loss of load.

2019-02-01,"NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Boeing Co is counting on a new kind of worker to help it reach a long-coveted target of rolling out 14 787 Dreamliners from its factories each month: half human, half robot.  The world’s largest planemaker is equipping mechanics with exoskeletons, similar to ones that allow cameramen to quickly navigate the sidelines of NFL football games, to increase their strength and speed. The high-tech suits also help reduce fatigue on repetitive tasks, such as overhead drilling. “You have the capability of a robot and the capability of a human being melded together,” Christopher Reid, a Boeing associate technical fellow who previously designed NASA spacesuits, told Reuters during a factory tour. The new technology is an example a broader shift in the industry’s focus towards production, as planemakers face the task of making good on a record order boom. After a decade in which Boeing and Airbus generated massive orders fuelled by the rise of China and emerging markets, the main battleground is shifting towards production strategy rather than market share. At twin Dreamliner factories in South Carolina and Washington state, Boeing also plans to soon deploy Bluetooth-enabled ‘smart’ wrenches that signal if machinists apply the correct torque to a nut, and has introduced new self-driving work platforms to shave time off aircraft assembly, according to people familiar with the technologies.  Such technology investments will help the U.S. manufacturer accelerate 787 Dreamliner production to 14 a month from 12. Chief Executive officer Dennis Muilenburg announced the preliminary rate change on Wednesday, and said he expects to complete the production increase in the second quarter. Building the carbon composite Dreamliner at the new rate, first reported by Reuters, is central to Boeing’s efforts to raise profit margins and claw back deferred production costs as it competes with arch-rival Airbus SE in a crowded but lucrative widebody market.  Boeing rolls out a new 787 with a minimum list price of $239 million every 1.75 days. At ‘rate 14,’ that new pace drops to 1.5 days to make a new Dreamliner. At today’s rate, Boeing is reducing the 787 $23 billion (18 billion pounds) in deferred production costs by $16 million per aircraft, Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said. “That number will clearly improve at the new rate.”  Boeing estimates the exoskeletons, which cost about $4,500-$7,000 apiece, have sped up work tasks in test groups of mechanics in South Carolina, though Boeing declined to share data. If trials continue to show improved safety and productivity, Boeing says it wants to deploy them to thousands of workers across the company over the next two years.  In recent weeks, Boeing has also introduced custom-built, self-driving work platforms similar to scaffolds that hug an airframe so mechanics can work as a jetliner pulses along the assembly line. Before, work stations had to be moved with fork lifts. Boeing’s 787 mostly competes against the A350, of which Airbus builds 10 a month. These widebody planes represent hundreds of billions of dollars in sales over 20 years. Both are modernizing their factories. But on widebody jets, Boeing’s higher production rate gives it the advantage to drive down costs across its supply chain and sell more of its pricier Dreamliner variants, like the newest 787-10.  In the fourth quarter, Boeing said its operating margin on commercial aircraft increased to 15.6 percent from 11.6 percent from a year ago, partially driven by higher margins on the 787 Dreamliner widebody. In South Carolina, engineers in a tiny workstation known as an “innovation cell” huddle around computers, 3D printers and a virtual reality system to help mechanics test out new tools without snarling the factory flow. Before the cells, Boeing said workers had no formal place to test out new ideas or complain about niggling problems, leaving them to fester for years in some cases. Boeing said three innovation cells in South Carolina have saved millions of dollars in costs since 2017 with a raft of time-saving tools, such as a 3D-printed curved ruler. The ruler alone cut six hours off the time it took a mechanic to hand-measure all the placards mounted above the seats inside on section of a 787.  In Washington state, it has opened innovation cells at its widebody plant in Everett and its 737 plant in Renton, also set for 2019 rate increase.  The new time-saving technology is aimed to help cut back on the cost of inspections that Boeing says have been made obsolete due to the new digital technology.  “Don’t inspect things twice,” Mark Stockton, engineering director for Boeing South Carolina, told Reuters during the factory tour. “Inspect things once and validate things once.” Boeing said it did not expect that these changes in inspections will result in the loss of jobs. But a union official asked about the strategy warned it carries risks such as higher injury rates, or potentially delayed aircraft deliveries, if last-minute problems are discovered.  “Removing thousands of inspections per airplane will negatively impact the manufacturing process and push defects down line,” IAM 751 spokeswoman Connie Kelliher said by email.

2019-02-01,"* New government formed late Thursday * Foreign donors pledged investment hooked to reform * U.N., World Bank officials say power sector first * Bad infrastructure costing Lebanon a fortune By Angus McDowall BEIRUT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Lebanon’s new government should prioritise electricity reform after having spent months wrangling over the cabinet make-up, World Bank and U.N. officials said on Friday, seeking to address daily blackouts and massive costs to the state. The government was finally formed late on Thursday and Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said Lebanon needed “bold reforms”. It has suffered years of low growth and has one of the world’s biggest public debts compared to the size of its economy. Foreign donors have promised to invest billions of dollars in Lebanon’s weak infrastructure to help get its economy moving, but will not release most of the money without steps to curb the deficit. Hariri’s government should prioritise reforms that Lebanon committed to at a Paris conference last year where donors pledged support, said Philippe Lazzarini, the U.N. resident coordinator in Lebanon. “Making progress on the fight against corruption and reforming the electricity sector will be essential to restore confidence, revitalise the economy and promote growth, stability and employment in the long term,” he added. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday France would “accompany Lebanon on a path of economic and social reforms”, especially through implementing the investment programme agreed at the Paris conference. Saroj Kumar Jha, the World Bank regional director for Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Iran, said electricity was “the area where we want to move in very quickly”, with the bank bringing concessional funding to help reforms. Lebanon’s power stations use expensive heavy fuel, and state utility Electricite du Liban (EDL) cannot afford to provide 24-hour power, leaving consumers to rely on costly private generators. In November, parliament had to approve over $400 million in extra-budgetary spending on fuel to avoid blackouts, adding to Lebanon’s spiralling debt. The sector’s problems put off investors and create “tremendous fiscal pressure on the government”, which sinks large sums in subsidising state-supplied power, Jha said. “I would strongly recommend they prioritise the energy sector engagement,” he added, saying he believed there was consensus on this within the new coalition government. However, London-based Capital Markets senior emerging markets analyst Jason Tuvey said he was sceptical the new government could enact major reforms to free the pledged aid. “Its not clear whether they can actually agree on these measures, so there will be some aid that will continue to be locked up,” he said. Jha wants Lebanon to move ahead with a plan to “corporatise” state power utility EDL and to cut state subsidies of power, while providing a safety net to poorer consumers. The government also needs to ensure it can attract investors for the process of switching from heavy fuel to cheaper gas, and work on its creaking transmission and distribution, Jha said. Lebanon hopes to develop its own gas reserves and is exploring offshore, but in the meantime it wants to use imported liquefied natural gas to fuel new power plants and has issued a tender for temporary import facilities. At the Paris investment conference, Hariri’s last government proposed two independent power projects, each with capacity of 500-600 megawatts and needing investment of about $600 million.

2019-02-01,"TBILISI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Oil and oil-related shipments from Georgia’s Black Sea port of Batumi fell 53.7 percent year on year in January, an official at a KazMunaiGas-operated terminal at the port said on Friday. Shipments fell to 50,246 tonnes from 108,464 tonnes a year earlier and from 51,709 tonnes in December. Shipments of crude oil and refined oil products from Batumi have fallen in recent years. They totalled 1.030 million tonnes in 2018, down from 2.109 million in 2017. There were no shipments of crude oil, gasoline, jet fuel, fuel oil and naphtha in January, the official, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters. Some crude oil was re-routed to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, the official added, while some fuel oil was sent to the port of Taman in Russia and to Georgia’s other Black Sea port, Kulevi. The fall in shipments is partly because Azerbaijan prefers to send its oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline or via its own terminal at Kulevi, rather than from Batumi, which is operated by a Kazakh company. Crude and refined oil products from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are shipped out of Georgia’s Black Sea ports of Batumi, Supsa, Poti and the terminal at Kulevi. Some products are transported across the Caspian Sea in small tankers, unloaded in the Azeri port of Baku and then sent by rail to Georgian ports for export to the Mediterranean.

2019-02-01,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rosneft is seeking further tax relief for its Priobskoye oilfield, Russia’s largest, but the finance ministry considers the request “inexpedient”, a spokeswoman said on Friday. The Russian state budget could lose more than 460 billion roubles (5 billion pounds) over 10 years if the additional tax breaks for the oilfield in West Siberia are approved, the spokeswoman said. “FinMin sees the introduction of (new) benefits as inexpedient as the company already receives some tax benefits on the mineral extraction tax for oil production at Priobskoye,” she said. Production at Priobskoye stands at around 500,000 barrels per day. The RBC daily newspaper reported on Friday that Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, Russia’s most powerful energy executive, has asked President Vladimir Putin for additional tax relief for Priobskoye, saying the oilfield was too depleted. Rosneft declined to comment. In 2017, Rosneft managed to secure tax benefits for its Samotlor oilfield, also in West Siberia, worth 350 billion roubles over 10 years.

Stocks have benefited this week from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which all but abandoned plans for raising interest rates again, and on optimism that a U.S.-China trade deal might be on the cards. But the Caixin/Markit index of Chinese manufacturing fell to its lowest since February 2016, adding to a growing list of economic readings indicating slowing global growth. For an interactive version of the below chart, click here tmsnrt.rs/2Tr5cgO. MSCI’s All Country World Index, which tracks stock markets in 47 countries, came off its highest level since Dec. 4 after its best January gain on record - up 7.79 percent on the month. Futures indicated a timid start to trading on Wall Street . The weak Chinese data also took MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.2 percent, after a 7.2 percent gain in January. The Australian dollar, a barometer of investor sentiment towards China, slid as much as half a percent. China’s offshore yuan was headed for its worst day in over five months. Although European markets opened higher, stock fell as banks reported poor earnings. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.2 percent. Purchasing manager indexes in manufacturing for Italy and Switzerland came in below expectations, although those for Germany, France and the euro zone were in line with forecasts. Equity markets have been relieved by a change of heart at the U.S. Federal Reserve, which signalled this week that its three-year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end as the outlook for the U.S. economy worsens. The Fed held rates steady, discarded its promise of “further gradual increases” in rates and said it would be “patient” before making any further moves. “The Fed decision should not only be supportive of risk markets, but also the weaker dollar backdrop could be extended, which should support EM assets, especially at a time when China is attempting to stimulate growth,” said Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager at UBP. “The market will now turn its attention to the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks as well as the U.S. data.” Jobs data from the United States is due at 1330 GMT. Stocks had also gained after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal. The top U.S. negotiator at the talks reported “substantial progress” in the talks. Beijing’s trade delegation said they made “important progress”, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported. The previously upbeat mood was also chilled somewhat by White House insistence that March 1 was a hard deadline for a deal, failure of which would lead to an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. “Analysts mostly remain deeply sceptical that a genuine trade deal can be done on this time frame,” economists from Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note. “We are less pessimistic since these negotiations are being conducted by senior politicians, not by trade bureaucrats,” they said. “Both sides also have an incentive, and arguably a growing incentive, to get a meaningful deal done.” The optimism supported Wall Street, where the S&P 500 ended Thursday with a gain of 0.86 percent. The Nasdaq jumped 1.37 percent after a near 11 percent rise in Facebook Inc . The Dow slipped 0.06 percent. Over January, the S&P 500 rose 7.9 percent, its best monthly performance since late 2015 and its strongest start to a year since 1987. The Nasdaq gained 9.7 percent in the month and the Dow rose 7.2 percent. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 95.506. The euro was 0.2 percent higher at $1.14650.. The euro weakened when Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann painted an unusually bleak picture of the German economy, saying the slump would last longer than initially thought. Gold prices hovered just short of nine-month highs, supported by the fall in bond yields and expectations for a softer dollar.  Spot gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,321.03 per ounce, having touched a top of $1,326.30. Oil prices were subdued as the China data offset signs major exporters were reducing output. U.S. crude futures were flat at $53.79 per barrel, while Brent rose 0.2 percent to $60.93. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Wayne

2019-02-01,"* Qatar Petroleum, Exxon Mobil to expand Golden Pass LNG project * ConocoPhillips will sell its stake in terminal By Ron Bousso and Jessica Resnick-Ault LONDON/NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp are expected to announce plans next week to proceed with a $10 billion project that will expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility in Texas, three people familiar with the transaction said. ConocoPhillips, the third partner in the existing terminal, plans to sell its 12.4 percent stake in the project and does not plan to participate in the expansion, the people said. LNG demand is soaring. Worldwide consumption of the fuel is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market. The Golden Pass LNG Terminal is a receiving and regasification facility in Sabine Pass, Texas that can handle up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas imports per day to the United States. However, as U.S. gas production has soared to new records, bolstered by shale production, the demand for export capacity has increased. The potential $10 billion expansion, first announced in 2014, would focus on this new market dynamic. It is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest some $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas footprint. The most likely buyer for ConocoPhillips’ stake is Exxon Mobil, two of the people said, adding that the existing partners do not want to bring in another participant, as plans for the project are in advanced stages. Currently, Exxon has a 17.4 percent stake in the project, and Qatar Petroleum holds the 70 percent majority stake. Exxon and Qatar are strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique. Exxon is trying to get a seat at Qatar’s table, and to do so may be willing to make certain concessions, one of the people said. Qatar was the world’s largest LNG producer in 2017 and has annual output of 77 million tonnes. Exxon and ConocoPhillips declined to comment, while Qatar Petroleum could not immediately be reached for comment. ConocoPhillips’ stake sale led to delays in announcing the final decision to proceed with the project, one of the people said. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private. The move comes as ConocoPhillips hones its focus on international projects. The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Firms are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year. That’s well above the previous record of about 45 million tonnes in 2005 and triple last year’s 21 million tonnes, Wood Mackenzie’s research director for global gas and LNG, Giles Farrer, said last month. More than 320 million tonnes of LNG was shipped globally in 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data. Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country.

2019-02-01,"(Repeats for wider distribution) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Feb 1(Reuters) - U.S. metals importers that applied last year for exemptions from tariffs on steel and aluminum are losing hope the Commerce Department will approve their petitions, as the recent government shutdown added to a wait that for some has stretched to eight months without a ruling. Importers, ranging from pipeline giant Kinder Morgan Inc to a steel tube manufacturer Sanitube, have submitted some 64,000 requests to avoid tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum that President Trump ordered last March, according to the latest Commerce Department data obtained by Reuters. The sheer number of requests, a late decision to allow appeals and the 35-day government shutdown that ended last week, have left more than half the petitions without a decision. When the Trump administration evoked a rarely-used national security clause to impose the tariffs, it offered relief to companies that struggled to find home-made substitutes and many importers were optimistic they could secure exemptions. Yet out of the 64,000 requests submitted by hundreds of companies, the administration has so far approved around 14,700 and rejected 5,450, according to Commerce. Around 10,000 have been returned without action due to filing errors, Commerce said. Now, some importers say they have all but given up on relief, assuming higher prices are there to stay, acting as a lasting drag on their business and, more broadly, on the whole economy. Sanitube LLC, a Florida-based supplier of stainless steel tubes for the food and other industries filed two similarly-worded exclusion requests for different sized products last year. One application, for a much larger volume, was denied as “incomplete” and the other was granted. Sanitube President Todd Adams, estimates that denial had cost it hundreds of thousands of dollars. “I’ve basically written it off,” Adams told Reuters. He said he still planned to re-submit a request for relief, but called the quest to overturn the initial rejection “a pet project.” “I’ve moved on,” Adams said. Texas-based Heat Transfer Tubular Products, which makes parts for the oil and gas industry, lost a ruling last year and has not even sought a reconsideration, said Janese Sokulski, vice president of sales. As decisions on requests for relief drag on, companies are passing on as much of the extra cost as they can to consumers, while absorbing the rest. Some foreign suppliers are also covering some of the costs to stay competitive in the U.S. market. While the tariffs helped curb imports and bolster domestic steel industry, they have increased costs for auto, construction, food service and energy companies. The Federal Reserve’s Jan. 16 “Beige Book” snapshot of economic conditions pointed to tariffs as contributing to rising costs in several regions of the United States. Originally, the government said most exemption applications could be processed in about 90 days. But an uproar over the number denied led to an extended review process for contested applications and significantly longer wait times. “I think the Trump Administration’s method is burnout. There is a path towards exemption, but it’s very difficult,” said Lisa Goldenberg, president of wholesale steel distribution firm Delaware Steel Company, which works closely with steel market participants. “They started off saying ‘I’m really important, I’m a critical need, there’s no way this administration, who loves me, is going to hurt me,’” Goldenberg said about the petitioners. “They have totally different language now.” A Commerce spokesman said the expanded review was a “worthwhile addition to the exclusion process,” and that it “welcomed all valid exclusion requests and has dedicated resources to render determinations as expeditiously as possible.” The spokesman added that requests could be processed faster if it had obtained authorization from Congress to allocate more funds to the process. It requested to reallocate $5 million from other parts of Commerce’s budget, but so far has only been allowed to reallocate $3.3 million for the review. For the steel industry, 2018 was a good year. It saw a 2 percent increase in employment, above the 1.8 percent gain for all non-farm jobs, according to U.S. Labor Department data. The latest figures from the American Institute of Steel and Iron also showed U.S. steel shipments up 4.7 percent in the first 11 months of 2018, while imports were down 10.5 percent in January-October. “The overall condition of the industry has improved,” said Tom Gibson, president and chief executive officer of AISI. However, the tariffs have hurt other industries. “A lot of expansions and contracts are on hold. The impacts of pricing have been significant,” said U.S. Representative Jackie Walorski, an Indiana Republican. Some businesses in her district have furloughed workers or canceled expansions due to tariffs. Kinder Morgan, which bought Turkish steel pipe subject to a 50 percent tariff for about half of a $1.75 billion pipeline, still has not received a ruling on its May exemption filing. An exclusion for another energy project proposed by Plains All American Pipeline also remains under review after an initial denial last July. The tariffs are projected to add $40 million to Plains pipeline cost and as much as $80 million to Kinder Morgan’s. “We made a strong case to the Department and hope they resolve the issue quickly,” Kinder Morgan said in an emailed statement. Plains did not respond to a request for comment. In the U.S. shale fields, where oil production is at record levels, prices for so-called tubular goods used in drilling, soared last year, adding to cost pressures in well-drilling and finishing, according to data from consultancy Wood Mackenzie. In one West Texas oilfield, tubular goods prices climbed 31 percent, it said, primarily due to tariffs. In another shale field that stretches across parts of Texas and northern Louisiana, tariffs bumped the cost of drilling a new well by a third to $850,000. “The companies are still lobbying for some concessions, but I think they’re getting pretty weary,” said Scott Forbes, a vice president of research at Wood Mackenzie.

2019-02-01,"LOS ANGELES, Feb 1 (Reuters) - For three decades, California has led the fight to control tailpipe pollution, with countless policies promoting cleaner gasoline, carpooling, public transportation and its signature strategy - the electric vehicle. Californians now buy more than half of all EVs sold in the United States, and the state’s auto-pollution policies have provided a model being adopted around the world. But they’re not working at home, by the state’s own measure. Tailpipe pollution here is going up, not down, despite billions of dollars spent by one of the most environmentally progressive governments on earth. “The strategies that we’ve used up until now just haven’t been effective,” Mary Nichols, the head of the California Air Resources Board, told Reuters. That failure has less to do with energy or environmental policies and more with decades-old urban planning decisions that made California – and especially Los Angeles – a haven for sprawling development of single-family homes and long commutes, according to state officials. California’s struggle bodes poorly for other major U.S. cities with similar sprawl and expensive urban housing – such as Houston, Atlanta, and others that planned their cities around cars - and casts doubt on whether the United States can meet its pledged carbon cuts under an international agreement to fight climate change. The state’s troubles also hold lessons for massive economies including China and India, major carbon emitters that hope to control pollution from vehicles as they rapidly urbanize. Transportation is tied with power generation as America’s leading source of carbon dioxide emissions, at 28 percent, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency – and it takes top billing in California, at about 40 percent. It makes up a smaller share in the rest of the world, where car ownership is lower but likely to grow. California’s carbon emissions amounted to 429 million metric tons in 2016, the last year for which data is available. That’s the lowest level since 1990 thanks to a shift away from coal-fired electricity toward natural gas, solar and wind. But its next target - calling for a further 40 percent cut by 2030 - will be out of reach without transformative changes in state residents’ driving habits, CARB said in a report published late last year. As the state struggles to cut its own vehicle pollution, California officials are also fighting an effort by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to weaken national standards for automobile emissions. A spokesman for newly-elected Governor Gavin Newsom, who ran on a promise to continue California’s legacy of climate action, did not return requests for comment. California’s tailpipe emissions have risen 5 percent since 2013, according to CARB data, as population growth, urban sprawl, and a devotion to one’s own car produced longer commutes and choking traffic. The increase came even as the state has finally caught traction in promoting electric and hybrid vehicles, some 1.18 million of which have been sold in the state since 2011, according to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The government last year set a target of 5 million electric vehicles by 2030. But even hitting that goal – by no means assured - won’t be near enough to allow the state to meet its goal for carbon reduction, which would require California drivers to reduce per capita miles traveled by 25 percent, CARB said in its report. The state has also boosted spending on public transport by about 60 percent over the past decade, according to CARB. But transit options are poorly suited for California’s vast expanses of suburban-style neighborhoods. “If we keep thinking we are going to overcome a 1950s system overnight, that’s wrong,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the San Diego Association of Governments, the city’s main public planning body. The United States has pledged to cut carbon emissions by between 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris Agreement, an international pact to fight climate change reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015. While President Donald Trump has signaled his intention to pull the United States out of the accord, a group of states led by California wants to ensure the U.S. meets its commitments, which scientists call critical to avoiding the most devastating effects of climate change. But California’s problems - and those of other sprawling U.S. cities - suggest that meeting that goal will be difficult. In Houston, for example, tailpipe emissions have soared 46 percent, posing a major challenge for the city’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Unlike California, Texas has no statewide greenhouse-gas reduction goals, and the state’s love affair with gas-guzzling trucks is only deepening. More than two thirds of new vehicles registered in the Houston area last year were pickup trucks or SUVs, compared to less than half in Los Angeles, according to IHS Markit, a global financial information provider. Electric cars, by comparison, represent just 1 percent of new vehicle sales in Texas, according to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. In California, it was around 7 percent in the first eight months of last year, according to data compiled by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. Transportation emissions have also been rising in other major cities such as Atlanta, Philadelphia, and San Antonio, according to city climate emissions reports from recent years, and have climbed about 21 percent nationwide since 1990, according to the EPA. Other parts of the world could have an easier time. In Europe, residents of densely populated cities face high fuel taxes, encouraging reduced car travel. Many European cities have seen relatively high levels of electric car adoption. And in China and India, which also have lofty electric vehicle targets, major cities are still being built - with pollution control in mind. “They are much better able to bake in this kind of planning into their urban designs,” said John German, a senior fellow with the non-profit International Council on Clean Transportation. One example is China’s new zone of Xiongan, a spill-off district to ease overcrowding in Beijing, which is being designed from scratch. In a document published in January, the Chinese government promised to incorporate low-carbon development ideas – such as high-speed commuter rail and efficient land use - into its planning for Xiongan to “create a convenient, safe, green and intelligent transportation system”. China is also seeking to improve fuel standards, ban old cars, and stop diesel trucks from entering certain areas as car ownership surges by about 20 million vehicles per year. California officials, eager to maintain the state’s leadership role on climate action, hope to pave the way for a fix to entrenched urban sprawl. Los Angeles is mulling a proposal to charge drivers during rush hour and use that money to make public transit free by 2028, according to Metro Chief Executive Phillip Washington. Other options include waiving fees for pooled rides to and from airports and adding safety lanes for scooters and bikes, said Dan Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. CARB Deputy Executive Officer Kurt Karperos said the state is planning talks with municipal governments to discuss controlling emissions through city planning. Such efforts could include lower-cost housing in urban centers to bring people closer to work, and the elimination of building codes requiring parking spots to encourage more drop-off carpooling, according to experts. “It is a tough problem,” Karperos said.

2019-02-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan retained dollar-denominated debt issued by Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA in a key emerging market bond index in a monthly rebalancing. Investors have been concerned that JPMorgan could exclude PDVSA from the EMBI Global benchmarks of sovereign and sub-sovereign emerging hard-currency debt after Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on the company on Monday.  “There is no immediate impact on the index status of Venezuela from the set of sanctions and licenses issued on 28 January 2019,” Kumaran Ram and Gloria Kim from JPMorgan’s index team wrote in a note to clients.  “Both Venezuela Republic and PDVSA bonds currently remain eligible for the flagship benchmarks: EMBI Global Diversified, EMBI Global, and EMBI+.” However, a prolonged market disruption in liquidity and pricing would warrant a further review of the company’s index status for potential removal, JPMorgan added.  While there were no explicit rules around sanctions for index membership, any entities finding themselves under such measures would likely be removed from benchmarks on the basis of liquidity, replicability and accessibility, Ram and Kim said. PDVSA has a weight of 0.53 in JPMorgan’s EMBI Global Diversified index while Venezuela Republic bonds were at 0.66 as of earlier this week, according to the index provider. Many asset managers welcomed the move to keep PDVSA in the key index, for now.  “They kept them in, there are no changes on PDVSA, and we are very happy about that,” said one asset manager who declined to be named. “(A change) would have come too quick, the situation is still evolving.” Venezuela - the country with the largest oil reserves in the world - has defaulted on most of its $63 billion of debt as it has spiraled into its worst-ever economic crisis with hyperinflation forecast to reach 10 million percent this year. Since the start of the year, bonds issued by Venezuela and PDVSA have chalked up steady gains amid weeks of protests that saw pressure mount on President Nicolas Maduro.  The debt rallied further after opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president on Jan. 23, received the backing of the United States along with most other countries in the western hemisphere. However, trading in PDVSA bonds almost ground to a halt after Washington imposed a swathe of sanctions, including a ban on U.S. investors from trading in the secondary market, other than divestment. “They were one of the best-performing bonds in January, and as a manager that is hard to overlook,” said Abhishek Kuma, head of emerging markets debt at State Street Global Advisors.  “Venezuela has defied all conventional wisdom for a very long time. As long as the bonds are there in the benchmark you have to consider buying them,” Kumar added. PDVSA’s 2024 issue - previously one of the most heavily traded issues - was indicated at 0.8 cents weaker at 24.53 cents in the dollar. The 2025 sovereign bond showed at around 31.5 cents, according to Refinitiv data. JPMorgan communicates any changes of index constituents to its clients on the last trading day of the month.

The current president of Sinochem Agriculture, Qin Hengde, will be “retained” to oversee Syngenta’s China business, said Andrew McConville, a Syngenta spokesman based in Basel, Switzerland. Qin will replace Syngenta’s Regional Director for China Andrew Guthrie who is retiring at the end of March, said McConville. The move was announced internally on Jan. 24, he said. Reuters has reported since 2016 that Sinochem and ChemChina have been discussing a merger which would be worth well over $100 billion though company executives have denied it. Last July, Chinese financial publication Caixin reported that the companies would merge though a Sinochem spokesman at the time declined to comment. Sinochem’s Chairman Ning Gaoning was recently appointed Chairman of Chemchina, which bought Syngenta in 2017. Former ChemChina chairman and architect of the $43 billion Syngenta acquisition Ren Jianxin retired last year. A spokesman with Sinochem’s agriculture division declined to comment on the matter, but said there is a special task force within Sinochem working on personnel changes. “There’s no change in ownership of operations of Syngenta in China,” said McConville.

2019-02-01,"Feb 1 (Reuters) - The polar vortex that locked the U.S. Midwest in sub-zero weather and led to the deaths of at least 21 people will give way to milder, snow-melting temperatures this weekend. Temperatures should reach the mid 40s to low 50s Fahrenheit through the weekend and Monday, forecasters said, after a record-breaking cold snap that stopped postal service and shuttered schools and businesses. The polar vortex is an icy cap of air that usually swirls over the North Pole. Changing air currents caused it to slip down through Canada and into the U.S. Midwest this week. “The cold air isn’t pushing off anywhere, it’s just sort of evaporating,” said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “So we’re going from 21 below zero (Fahrenheit) in Chicago Thursday morning to near 50 above on Monday,” he said. “It’ll feel like a heat wave.” Temperatures in the Upper Midwest will reach well above zero F (minus 18 C) on Friday, with highs making it into the teens and low 20s. By Saturday, highs will be in the 30s and even low 40s. The central Plains will be in the low 60s, nearly 20 to 25 degrees above normal, the weather service said. More than 40 cold-temperature records were broken Thursday, the coldest morning since the polar vortex moved in late on Tuesday. The mass of arctic air had clung to a swath of the U.S. from Iowa and the Dakotas across the Great Lakes region and into Maine for days. The coldest recorded temperature was minus 56 in Cotton, Minnesota, on Thursday, the weather service said. Officials across multiple states linked numerous deaths to the frigid air. The death toll rose after at least nine more people in Chicago were reported to have died from cold-related injuries, according to Stathis Poulakidas, a doctor at the city’s John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital. But on Friday, Amtrak train services that were halted since Wednesday in Chicago’s hub will resume, as will U.S. Postal service halted or limited in six Midwest states. And while thousands of flights were canceled and delayed, mostly out of Chicago, the flight-tracking site FlightAware reported cancellations were down to just over 750 and delays just over 130.

2019-02-01,"* Hongqiao to resume production from units shut until Jan. 31 * Says will take around four months to ramp up * Some 100,000 T of company’s output affected by winter cuts (Adds background) By Tom Daly BEIJING, Feb 1 (Reuters) - China Hongqiao Group, the world’s top aluminium smelter, said on Friday it would gradually restart production from some of its pots after the expiration of some government-mandated output curbs on Jan. 31. The restarts come as Chinese aluminium prices are struggling to rise from two-year lows amid lacklustre domestic demand and other smelters are cutting production to avoid financial losses. Hongqiao will resume output on the smelting units, known as potlines or pots, at its plants in the city of Binzhou in eastern China’s Shandong province and it will take until June to reach full production, the company said in a statement to Reuters. Hongqiao cut production in Binzhou after the provincial government ordered industrial companies to curb output to reduce air pollution during the winter. Some of Hongqiao’s production was covered under restrictions running from mid-November to mid-March, the peak winter heating season in China, but other curbs ran only from Dec. 1 to Jan. 31. Around 100,000 tonnes of actual aluminium production was affected by the winter cuts, said Hongqiao, which has 6.46 million tonnes per year of operational capacity. Analysts had earlier estimated Hongqiao would have to cut up to 550,000 tonnes of annual production — equal to around 183,300 tonnes of output in four months — during the winter, based on a plan issued by the Binzhou government in November. Aluminium prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.3 percent to 13,545 yuan ($2,009.76) a tonne on Friday. The exchange will be closed until Feb. 11 for the Lunar New Year holiday. Hongqiao’s state-run rival, Aluminum Corp of China Ltd , said late on Wednesday it was shutting a 200,000-tonnes-per-year smelter in Shandong due to rising electricity prices.

Stocks have benefited this week from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which all but abandoned plans for further rate hikes, and on optimism that a U.S.-China trade deal might be on the cards. But the Caixin/Markit index of Chinese manufacturing fell to its lowest since February 2016, adding to a growing list of economic readings indicating slowing global growth. For an interactive version of the below chart, click here tmsnrt.rs/2Tr5cgO. MSCI’s All Country World Index, which tracks stock markets in 47 countries, came off its highest level since Dec. 4 after its best January gain on record - up 7.79 percent on the month. The weak Chinese data also took MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.2 percent, though that followed a 7.2 percent gain in January. The Australian dollar, a liquid barometer of investor sentiment towards China, skidded half a percent. The mood was slightly better in Europe, as strong earnings helped offset the Chinese survey. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.2 percent, with most European bourses slightly positive. Purchasing managers indexes in manufacturing for Italy and Switzerland came in below expectations, although those for Germany, France and the euro zone were in line with forecasts. Equity markets have been relieved by a change of heart at the U.S. Federal Reserve, which signalled this week that its three-year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy. As it held interest rates steady, the U.S. central bank also discarded its promises of “further gradual increases” in interest rates and said it would be “patient” before making any further moves. “The Fed (Federal Reserve) decision should not only be supportive of risk markets, but also the weaker dollar backdrop could be extended, which should support EM assets, especially at a time when China is attempting to stimulate growth,” said Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager at UBP. “The market will now turn its attention to the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks as well as the U.S. data.” Jobs data from the United States is due at 1330 GMT. Stocks had also gained after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal as the top U.S. negotiator reported “substantial progress” in the talks. Beijing’s trade delegation said the talks made “important progress”, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported. The previously upbeat mood was also chilled somewhat by White House insistence that March 1 was a hard deadline for a deal, a failure of which would lead to an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. “Analysts mostly remain deeply sceptical that a genuine trade deal can be done on this time frame,” economists from Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note. “We are less pessimistic since these negotiations are being conducted by senior politicians, not by trade bureaucrats,” they added. “Both sides also have an incentive, and arguably a growing incentive, to get a meaningful deal done.” The optimism supported Wall Street with the S&P 500 ending Thursday with a gain of 0.86 percent. The Nasdaq jumped 1.37 percent on the back of a near 11 percent rise in Facebook Inc. The Dow slipped 0.06 percent. Over January, the S&P 500 rose 7.9 percent, its best monthly performance since late 2015 and its strongest start to a year since 1987. The Nasdaq gained 9.7 percent in the month and the Dow rose 7.2 percent. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was flat at 95.581 thanks in part to a pullback in the euro to $1.1453 . The single currency had taken a knock when Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann painted an unusually bleak picture of the German economy, saying the slump will last longer than initially thought. Gold prices hovered just short of nine-month highs supported by the fall in bond yields and expectations for a softer dollar. Spot gold stood at $1,318.41 per ounce, having touched a top of $1,326.30. Oil prices were subdued as the China data offset signs major exporters were reducing output in line with a pact to cut supply.

2019-02-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP has agreed to broaden its disclosure on greenhouse gas emissions to show how it thinks future investments in oil and gas align with U.N.-backed climate goals, it said on Friday.    Following talks with a large group of investors, BP also agreed to back a shareholder resolution on the measures at its annual general meeting (AGM), further evidence of the way the energy industry and investors are engaging on climate issues. The agreement with a group of investors with $32 trillion under management, known as Climate Action 100+, comes weeks after rival Royal Dutch Shell agreed to introduce broad carbon emissions targets linked to executive pay. Unlike other companies, BP has agreed to detail how major future investments in fossil fuels will be consistent with the 2015 Paris agreement to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by the end of the century by phasing out fossil fuels.  It will set out new metrics to measure greenhouse gas emissions from its operations. BP said in a statement it would link carbon targets to the remuneration of 36,000 of its employees, including executive directors. If the resolution is approved at the AGM, BP will introduce these changes into its reporting for 2019 onwards. (GRAPHIC: Carbon emissions from Big Oil - tmsnrt.rs/2RFl5PN)  But the joint agreement revealed a fundamental rift with investors over BP’s statement that its strategy today was in line with the Paris agreement. “Investors remain concerned that the company has not yet demonstrated that its strategy, which includes growth in oil and gas as well as pursuing low carbon businesses, is consistent with the Paris goals,” Climate Action 100+ said in statement.  BP plans to rapidly grow oil and gas production over the next five years thanks to more than a dozen new projects launched in recent years, as well as the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s U.S. shale portfolio last year. “We will be open and transparent about our ambitions and targets as well as our progress against them,” BP Chairman Helge Lund said in a statement. BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley has repeatedly said that while the oil and gas sector needs to play a role in the transition to low carbon energy, it still needs to meet growing demand for fossil fuels, particularly in emerging economies.  “BP is committed to helping solve the dual challenge of providing more energy with fewer emissions. We are determined to advance the energy transition while also growing shareholder value,” Lund said. Investors and analysts have said many oil and gas projects, such as complex and expensive investments in Canada or some deepwater basins, will not be needed in the transition to a low carbon energy. While BP agreed to increase its disclosure around climate, it also rejected another resolution tabled by climate activist group Follow This calling for emission reduction targets for all its operations, including emissions from products it sells to customers, known as Scope 3.         BP announced in April plans to keep carbon emissions flat over the decade to 2025 even as its oil and gas output was set to grow. It also plans to invest up to $500 million per year on renewable energies such as solar, wind and power storage.

2019-02-01,"(Corrects typographical error in paragraph 4) By Roslan Khasawneh SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The first batch of derivative contracts for a cleaner type of marine fuel oil that complies with stricter emissions rules starting in 2020 traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the CME Group said on Friday. A trade for 10 lots of the Singapore free-on-board (FOB) marine fuel with 0.5 percent sulphur content mini futures contract was cleared on Jan. 31, a Singapore-based spokesman for the CME Group said in an e-mail on Friday. The trade was priced at $517 per metric tonne for delivery in December 2019, the spokesman said. The price puts very-low sulphur marine fuel at a premium of about $206 a tonne to December 2019 swaps for 380-centistoke high-sulphur fuel oil with 3.5 percent sulphur content based on its price on Thursday of $311.25, according to data on Refinitiv Eikon. Each lot of the Mini Singapore FOB Marine Fuel Futures contract represents 100 tonnes of the fuel, according to CME data, versus 1,000 tonnes for a typical futures contract. “The size of our standard contract is adequate for cargo traders but shipping and bunkering firms have hedging needs for smaller sizes,” said Nicolas Dupuis, senior director for energy products at CME Group. Under International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules that come into effect from 2020, ships will have to used fuel with a sulphur content of 0.5 percent or less, compared with 3.5 percent now, forcing changes upon global shippers and also oil refiners. With just 11 months left until the new rules take effect, the rise in trade liquidity in physical cargoes and derivatives of the new IMO-compliant fuels is a crucial step towards price discovery for the new lower-sulphur fuel grade. “Even though the IMO rules kick-in in 2020, logistic arrangements need to be in place to handle the 0.5 percent requirement and shippers would want to secure their supply and understand the economic impact of the new specifications,” said Dupuis. The NYMEX in December became the first exchange to list marine fuel futures contracts with 0.5 percent sulphur content for trade on the CME Globex electronic platform. This included 11 marine fuel futures contracts with 0.5 percent sulphur content covering key pricing centres including Singapore in Asia, Rotterdam in Europe and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The contracts are set to clear through CME ClearPort and will be settled against physical marine fuel assessments from price reporting agency S&P Global Platts. On Jan. 31, Platts assessed physical cargoes of FOB Singapore marine fuel with a maximum 0.5 percent sulphur content for loading during the second half of February at $436.05 per tonne, equivalent to a premium of about $43 to 380-centistoke high-sulphur fuel oil quotes, a Singapore-based fuel oil trader said on Friday.

Fortum in June closed a 3.8 billion euro ($4.4 billion) deal to buy around 47 percent of Uniper. Uniper has opposed the transaction, saying the combination makes little sense given the energy group’s heavy exposure to gas and coal-fired power plants while Fortum’s focus is on clean technologies. “Since the closing of the offer, we have increased our shareholding in Uniper in order to further secure Fortum’s voting position in any future Uniper General Meeting,” Fortum’s Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark said in a statement. “At the end of 2018, Fortum held 49.99 percent of Uniper shares and voting rights.”  Fortum’s fourth-quarter comparable operating profit rose 13 percent from a year ago to 333 million euros ($381 million), roughly in line with analysts’ average expectation of 330 million in a Reuters poll. “Fortum’s fourth-quarter results improved, mainly as a result of higher power prices and increased nuclear production, due to improved availability,” Lundmark said.

SSE will sell its 49.9 percent stake in the wind farms but will continue to hold the remaining 50.1 percent majority stake and continue to operate both assets. Greencoat UK Wind, an infrastructure fund managed by Greencoat Capital, is buying the stake in partnership with a large unnamed UK pension fund whose investment is managed by Greencoat. “We are pleased to add two more large wind farm investments to our portfolio, located close to our existing capacity in the Highlands,” said Laurence Fumagalli at Greencoat Capital.  “We continue to see a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities, and our independence and our proven track record in execution and operations makes us an attractive partner for utility vendors looking to recycle capital,” he said.

2019-02-01,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia endured its hottest month on record in January, with sweltering conditions expected to persist through April, the country’s weather bureau said on Friday. The heatwave, which saw temperatures above 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) for several days straight in some areas, was mainly due to a high pressure system off the southeast coast that blocked cooler air from coming in, the Bureau of Meteorology said. A delayed monsoon also kept cooler, moist air coming in from the north, and a warming trend that has pushed Australian temperatures up by more than 1C in the last 100 years also contributed to the heat, said Andrew Watkins, a senior climatologist at the bureau. Scorching weather last month triggered power outages in some areas and sent electricity prices soaring, while bushfires have destroyed homes in the southern island state of Tasmania. “For maximum temperatures, for minimum temperatures and for mean temperatures, it’s not only been our hottest January on record, it’s actually been our hottest month on record, and those records go back to 1910,” Watkins said in a video on the bureau’s website. “Odds are favoring that heat continuing at least through February into March and April,” he said. The mean temperature for January across the country exceeded 30C, the bureau said. The two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, recorded their warmest average, low and high temperatures for January. At the same time, New South Wales suffered one of the driest Januarys on record, while Victoria had less than 20 percent of its average January rainfall. Tasmania, which depends on hydropower, experienced its driest January on record. Western Australia had its driest January since 2005.

The Australian dollar, a liquid barometer of investor sentiment toward China, skidded 0.4 percent after the Caixin/Markit index of manufacturing fell to its lowest since February 2016. That was more downbeat than the official version of the index and inflamed fears for the economy. Investor caution is also mounting ahead of U.S. jobs data later in the session with analysts unsure what impact the government shutdown might have had employment. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent, though that followed a stellar 7.2 percent gain in January. Japan’s Nikkei went flat, while Shanghai blue chips held onto a 0.4 percent gain. Stocks had started firmer after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal as the top U.S. negotiator reported “substantial progress” in the talks. Beijing’s trade delegation said the talks made “important progress” for the current stage, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday. The previously upbeat mood was also chilled somewhat by White House insistence that March 1 was a hard deadline for a deal, a failure of which would lead to an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. “Analysts mostly remain deeply sceptical that a genuine trade deal can be done on this time frame,” noted economists from Commonwealth Bank of Australia in a note. “We are less pessimistic since these negotiations are being conducted by senior politicians, not by trade bureaucrats,” they added. “Both sides also have an incentive, and arguably a growing incentive, to get a meaningful deal done.” The optimism supported Wall Street with the S&P 500 ending Thursday with a gain of 0.86 percent. The Nasdaq jumped 1.37 percent on the back of a near 11 percent rise in Facebook Inc. The Dow slipped 0.06 percent. Over January, the S&P 500 rose 7.9 percent, its best monthly performance since late 2015 and its strongest start to a year since 1987. The Nasdaq gained 9.7 percent in the month and the Dow rose 7.2 percent. FED’S ABOUT-FACE Equity markets have also been relieved by a change of heart at the U.S. Federal Reserve, which this week surprised many by all but abandoning plans for further rate hikes. Investors responded by pricing in a one-in-three chance that interest rates could actually be cut this year. Yields on two-year Treasuries were down 14 basis points on the week so far, which if sustained would be the largest weekly decline since mid-2010. That in turn has been a drag on the U.S. dollar, though it was off its lows on Friday. It was down 0.6 percent so far this week against the yen at 108.82, but found some support around 108.50. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was holding steady at 95.579 thanks in part to a pullback in the euro to $1.1439. The single currency had taken a knock when Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann painted an unusually bleak picture of the German economy, saying the country’s slump will last longer than initially thought. Gold prices hovered just short of nine-month highs supported by the fall in bond yields and expectations for a softer dollar. Spot gold stood at $1,317.66 per ounce, having touched a top of $1,326.30. Oil prices were subdued as the poor China data offset signs major exporters were quickly reducing output in line with a pact to cut supply. U.S. crude futures eased 5 cents to $53.74 per barrel, while Brent rose 3 cents to $60.87.

2019-02-01,"(Reuters) - Tens of millions of Americans braved Arctic-like temperatures on Thursday as low as minus 56 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 49 Celsius) that paralyzed the U.S. Midwest and were blamed for at least 21 deaths. Warmer-than-normal weather was on the way, but that offered little comfort to vulnerable populations such as the homeless and elderly enduring cold that caused frostbite in minutes and made being outside potentially deadly. Officials across multiple states linked numerous deaths to the frigid air. The death toll rose from a previous 12 after at least nine more people in Chicago were reported to have died from cold-related injuries, according to Stathis Poulakidas, a doctor at the city’s John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital.  Poulakidas, a trauma specialist, said the hospital had seen about 25 frostbite victims this week. He said the most severe cases risked having fingers and toes amputated.    Among those believed to have died from the cold was  University of Iowa student Gerard Belz. The eighteen-year-old was found unresponsive on campus early Wednesday morning just a short walk from his dorm, according to university officials. Police told a local television station they believed the cold played a factor in his death. The wind chill at the time officers found Belz was minus 51 F (minus 46 C), according to the National Weather Service.   Homeless and displaced people were particularly at risk, with Chicago and other cities setting up warming shelters. But many toughed it out in camps or vacant buildings. A 60-year-old woman found dead in an abandoned house in Lorain, Ohio, was believed to have died of hypothermia, Lorain County Coroner Stephen Evans said. “There’s just no way if you’re not near a heat source that you can survive for very long out in weather like this,” Evans told the Chronicle-Telegram newspaper. It has been more than 20 years since a similar blast of frigid air covered a swath of the U.S. Midwest and Northeast, according to the National Weather Service. The bitter cold was caused by the mass of air known as the polar vortex drifting south from its usual position over the North Pole.  Homes and businesses used record amounts of natural gas to fight the cold, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. Utilities appealed to consumers to conserve energy to avoid power outages. In Detroit, General Motors Co suspended operations at 11 Michigan plants to cut natural gas consumption. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV canceled a shift on Thursday at two of its plants.    Snow and ice created treacherous travel conditions, with 26 road collisions reported within two hours on Thursday in eastern Iowa’s Johnson County, emergency communications center chief Tom Jones told the Iowa City Press-Citizen. For the second day in a row, the intense cold and windy conditions forced U.S. airlines to cancel more than 2,000 flights. Chicago was hardest hit, with O’Hare International Airport experiencing over 700 cancellations, according to the FlightAware tracking site.   Heavy snow hitting Chicago off the Great Lakes was set to begin winding down on Thursday night, the weather service said. More than 30 record lows were shattered across the Midwest. Cotton, Minnesota, had the lowest national temperature recorded early on Thursday at minus 56 F (minus 48 C), before the weather warmed up, the weather service reported. Temperatures in the Upper Midwest will rebound to well above zero F (minus 18 C) on Friday, with highs making it into the teens and low 20s F. By Saturday, highs will be in the 30s and even low 40s F, while the central Plains will be in the low 60s F, nearly 20 to 25 degrees above normal, the weather service said.

2019-02-01,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union (USW) and Shell Oil Co reached a tentative agreement on Thursday that sources familiar with the deal said would boost pay by 11 percent over three years for 30,000 U.S. refinery, chemical plant and pipeline workers. Workers represented by the USW will receive a 3.5 percent pay raise in each of the first two years of the deal and a 4 percent raise in the final year, the sources said. The agreement between the union and Shell came about nine hours before the current contract was to expire at 12:01 a.m. on Friday. The union entered talks with lead oil company negotiator Shell on Jan. 16 seeking an 8 percent-a-year pay increase for hourly workers. USW-represented refinery workers make about $40 an hour after four years on the job. In 2015, following a sometimes bitter strike at 12 refineries and three chemical plants affecting 7,000 workers, Shell, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and the USW agreed to a 12 percent pay increase over four years. USW International President Leo Gerard praised the union members’ commitment in a statement about the deal. “We reached a tentative agreement because of our members’ solidarity and the industry’s willingness to negotiate a contract that is fair to both parties,” Gerard said. The deal will be combined with local agreements at each plant to form the contract for individual sites. Ratification votes by union members will be conducted locally.  “We believe this agreement respects the needs of our employees, underpins our resolute commitment to safety and ensures the economic health of Shell’s facilities,” company spokesman Ray Fisher said in a statement. The two sides also agreed to keep the company portion of the health insurance premium at 80 percent. Small plants with less 150 union members will add one union health and safety representative under the deal. Also, plants that have not adopted a fatigue reduction standard in earlier contracts, will commit to do so. Fatigue was found by federal investigators to be a factor in the 2005 explosion at BP Plc’s Texas City, Texas, refinery that killed 15 workers and injured 180 other people.   The contract covers 30,000 workers at plants operated by Shell, Marathon Petroleum Corp, BP Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp, Valero Energy Corp, and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp and Delek US Holdings Inc.

2019-02-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency added eight members on Thursday to its scientific advisory board tasked with providing independent input for agency policy, a list that includes at least one vocal climate-change doubter. The EPA said John Christy, an atmospheric science professor at the University of Alabama, was among the new appointees to the advisory body, which now numbers 45 people and includes several appointees from past administrations.  Christy has downplayed the threat of climate change in congressional hearings and media appearances, arguing that scientific models overestimate warming, and that major steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions are not warranted. Those views place him outside the mainstream scientific consensus, including from U.S. federal agencies, that global warming will have devastating consequences if not urgently addressed. But they dovetail with President Donald Trump’s policy of rolling back Obama-era climate-change regulations to free up more drilling and mining. Christy did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Other new appointees include Hugh Barton, a toxicology and risk assessment consultant who formerly worked for pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, and Richard Williams, an economics and benefit-cost analysis consultant who previously worked for the Food and Drug Administration. “In a fair, open, and transparent fashion, EPA reviewed hundreds of qualified applicants nominated for this committee,” acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. They “include experts from a wide variety of scientific disciplines who reflect the geographic diversity needed to represent all 10 EPA regions.” Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, has said he believes climate change is occurring, but told senators at his confirmation hearing earlier this month that he did not see it as an urgent problem. Trump has also repeatedly downplayed the threat of climate change, and announced his intention shortly after taking office  in January 2017 to pull the United States from a global accord to fight it. The science advisory board was created by Congress to serve as a check on EPA policies and research.  The EPA in 2017 barred scientists who have won agency-awarded grants from serving on the panel, a move the administration said was aimed at reducing conflicts of interest, but which environmental groups said would keep qualified scientists out of contention.
