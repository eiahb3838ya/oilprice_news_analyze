2018-08-27,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s new parliament will convene on Sept. 3, according to a decree issued on Monday by President Fuad Masum, preparing the way for lawmakers to elect a new government to start rebuilding the country after a three-year war with Islamic State. Iraqis voted in May in their first parliamentary election since the defeat of Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, but a contentious recount process delayed the announcement of final results until earlier this month. Uncertainty over the make-up of the new government has raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, high unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after the war with Islamic State. “The president has held several substantive talks with all political groups, urging them to finalise their political agreements in order to meet constitutional provisions,” Masum’s office said in a statement. The Federal Supreme Court ratified the election results on Aug. 19 and Masum had 15 days to call the new parliament into session, the first step in a 90-day process outlined in the constitution that will eventually lead to a new government. Lawmakers will elect a parliamentary speaker and two deputies in their first session. They will later elect a new president and task the leader of the largest bloc to form a government as prime minister. The recount delayed the process by three months yet showed little had changed from the initial results, with populist Shi’ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr retaining his lead.

2018-08-27,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's imports of U.S. crude vs Bonny Light, WTI Houston: tmsnrt.rs/2P91K8e By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 27 (Reuters) - One of the side effects of President Donald Trump’s escalating trade dispute with China is that U.S. exports of crude oil to the world’s biggest importer are now viewed through the prism of politics. However, this ignores that buyers and sellers of crude are generally more motivated by profit margins and getting the right grades of oil to maximise the productivity of their plants. While it’s true they can’t disregard politics, and this is especially the case for the state-controlled Chinese majors, it’s worth looking at the economics of the U.S.-China crude trade as well. U.S. crude exports to China appear set to slow dramatically in September, with vessel-tracking data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts showing about 6.12 million barrels, or about 204,000 barrels per day (bpd), scheduled for arrival. This would be down from around 363,000 bpd in August, and would also be the weakest month since March this year. The slowdown in China’s imports of U.S. crude has coincided with the imposition of tit-for-tat trade tariffs and speculation that Beijing would add crude to its list of U.S. products to be hit with import taxes. That hasn’t happened yet, although it would have been understandable for Chinese refiners to be wary of buying from the United States in recent weeks. However, the pricing of the various grades of crude oil also offers an explanation as to why China stocked up on U.S. crude in August, and appears to have shied away in September, and probably October as well. Chinese traders would have been keen to buy West Texas Intermediate (WTI) types of U.S. crude for August delivery, given these cargoes would have been arranged in late May and early June. The discount of front-month WTI crude oil futures to Brent futures CL-LCO1=R widened to $11.39 a barrel on June 6, and traded close to level for around a three-week period from late May to mid-June. This means that Chinese refiners could buy WTI at a substantial discount to Brent in the paper market, which would encourage them to take physical cargoes from the U.S. Gulf. In the physical market the difference between oil linked to WTI and oil linked to Brent wasn’t quite as stark, but was nonetheless in favour of the U.S. grades. Nigerian Bonny Light BON-E, a crude oil similar to, and priced against Brent, was trading at $81.17 a barrel on May 22. At the same time, WTI delivered at the Magellan East Houston terminal, as assessed by Argus Media, was at $76.40, a discount of $4.77 a barrel. This level of discount is enough to offset the slightly higher freight cost of shipping to China from the U.S. Gulf as opposed to the west coast of Africa. However, by the time September cargoes for China would have been arranged, the numbers had moved in the other direction, with Bonny Light trading at $73.52 a barrel on June 25, putting it at a discount of $1.47 to WTI Houston. This would have made buying West African light crudes more attractive than cargoes from the United States. While the Chinese refiners may have been under some political pressure to cut back on buying U.S. crude, it was probably something they didn’t feel the need to push back on, given the profits weren’t working anyway. The current pricing isn’t particularly supportive of Chinese buying of U.S. cargoes, with Bonny Light at a slight $1.11 a barrel premium over WTI Houston. For refiners prepared to offset physical trades in the paper market, the discount of WTI futures to Brent contracts was at $7.05 a barrel on Aug. 24, widening from $4.82 at the end of July. However, putting the paper and physical pricing together suggests that U.S. crude is currently not a compelling purchase for Chinese refiners, compared to similar grades from other producers, such as those in West Africa. While the trade spat between Washington and Beijing could worsen to the point where U.S. crude exports to China are rendered completely uncompetitive, in the meantime it probably pays to looks at the underlying pricing to help judge the likelihood of whether exports will rise or fall.

2018-08-27,"* New plan instead looks to add gas, wind, solar capacity * Nuclear expansion had been mooted under Zuma * Rosatom had been seen as frontrunner for nuclear project (Adds background) By Patricia Aruo PRETORIA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - South Africa has cancelled plans to add 9,600 megawatts (MW) of nuclear power by 2030 and will instead aim to add more capacity in natural gas, wind and other energy sources, the energy minister announced on Monday. Africa’s only nuclear power has an installed capacity of 1,860 MW but plans under the government of former President Jacob Zuma to have six times that output by 2030 hit hurdles over cost and other issues. There are now “no plans to increase nuclear until 2030,” Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said while releasing the government’s new Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The plan also showed that electricity demand on the grid has been declining. Russian state-owned firm Rosatom was seen as a frontrunner to build the additional nuclear capacity. Several meetings between Zuma and Russian President Vladimir Putin led to speculation that Rosatom had secured the deal before the launch of the public tender. South Africa’s government and Rosatom denied this claim. But soon after taking over from Zuma in February, President Cyril Ramaphosa put the nuclear expansion on the back burner saying the plan was too expensive. In July, Ramaphosa said Putin had raised the subject of a nuclear deal at a private meeting with him at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg but that he had told him that Pretoria could not sign such a deal for now. Radebe on Monday instead outlined expansion plans targeting other energy sources. He said the plan calls for additional capacity of 8,100 MW from wind and 8,100 MW from gas, 5,670 MW from photovoltaic panels, 2,500 MW from hydro and 1,000 MW from coal by 2030. Public comment on the plan is invited for 60 days before final cabinet approval, he said.

Known as Baosteel, the Shanghai-based steel giant posted net income of 10.01 billion yuan ($1.46 billion) in the first half of 2018, compared to 6.17 billion yuan a year ago, according to a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Net income over April-June doubled to 5 billion yuan from 2.38 billion yuan in the same period last year, according to Reuters calculation based on the Baosteel statement as the company did not give a breakdown for quarterly results. Strong earnings followed stable steel prices in the world’s No.1 steelmaking country. Average Shanghai rebar prices in the first half this year reached a record level of 3,458.4 yuan a tonne, up more than 30 percent from prior year. Average profit margins at Chinese steel mills reached over 1,100 yuan a tonne in June, just below the peak level in November last year. Baosteel’s results also came after months-long production restrictions at steel mills in northern China as local authorities strive to cut harmful emissions from heavy industry in order to meet the politically significant air quality targets set by central government. In the first six months, Baosteel churned out 23.96 million tonnes of steel products. The company also said it had cut 3.12 billion yuan of cost in the first half of this year, outstripping its target 2018 target of reducing 1.8 billion yuan. After merging with Wuhan Iron and Steel Co last year as part of Beijing’s effort to streamline the industry, Baosteel said it aimed to cut a total of 10 billion yuan in 2018-2020 from production, sales and financial sectors. “China’s steel supply and demand is expected to be stable in the second half this year ... However the market remains at risk from weak infrastructure investment, new steel capacity and rising trade protectionism,” Baosteel said. Washington and Beijing have been on a months-long tit-for-tat tariffs actions, with 25 percent import tariffs on steel products from both side. Last week, officials from the two countries ended talks with no major breakthrough as their trade war escalated with another round of duelling tariffs on $16 billion worth of each country’s goods. In 2017, Baosteel exported 3.84 million tonnes of steel products, with 10.1 percent flowing into America. “Baosteel will keep a stable scale of output and sales ... and will speed up diversifying steel products from Zhanjiang steel base, while keep cutting costs in the whole company,” the company said. Baosteel said in a separate statement it will invest 18.85 billion yuan to invest a blast furnace project at its Zhanjiang base with 3.6 million tonnes of annual capacity.

2018-08-27,"ADDIS ABABA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Ethiopia has ousted state-run Metals and Engineering Corporation (METEC) from a $4 billion dam project on the River Nile due to numerous delays in completing the project. The Grand Renaissance Dam is the centrepiece of Ethiopia’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said at the weekend that the government had cancelled the contract of METEC, which is run by Ethiopia’s military, and would award it to another company. Italian firm Salini Impregilo remains the main contractor building the dam, while METEC was the contractor for the electromechanical and hydraulic steel structure divisions of the project. The government has touted the 6,000-megawatt dam project, which is 60 percent finished, as a symbol of its economic reforms. “It is a project that was supposed to be completed within five years, but seven or eight years later not a single turbine is operational,” Abiy said during a news conference in Addis Ababa on Saturday. “Salini has even demanded compensation because of the delays. We decided to cancel a contract with METEC and offer companies with experience. Otherwise, it will take even longer,” he said. Abiy has presided over a series of reforms since coming to power in April, releasing political prisoners, relaxing state control of the economy and dramatically improving relations with Ethiopia’s neighbour Eritrea. The government had previously said the dam would be completed within two years, but recently Abiy said it may face a lengthy delay. An official at METEC, who did not wish to be named, said the company first heard of the cancellation on Saturday. “Even now our workers are on the site,” the official said.

2018-08-27,"* Expects 5-10 development plans in next 18 months * Optimism is back, oil firms showing discipline on costs * Norway needs more big oil finds to prolong activity (Adds quotes) By Gwladys Fouche STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Norwegian oil sector is set for a promising three to four years but major discoveries must be made to prolong activity after that, the head of the agency overseeing the country’s oil and gas resources told Reuters. Norway’s leading industry has been on the mend for the past two years after a 2014-2016 downturn during which oil companies slashed investments, projects and jobs. “We are still in the upturn phase (of the cycle). We have many field developments ongoing. We believe the next three-four years are looking very promising,” Bente Nyland said in an interview on the margins of an energy conference. “For the rest of the year and the next, we expect between five and 10 new development plans (to be submitted to authorities),” she said, adding that some 40-45 wells would likely be drilled in 2018 compared with around 30 last year. “Then we will begin to eat into what possibilities we have left. We need to sow more. We hope for a big find that can continue activity,” she added. Norway’s Equinor submitted on Monday the development plan for the second phase of its Johan Sverdrup asset, which could be the last of the giant North Sea oilfields. “It is clear that there aren’t a lot of big developments after that, and that is worrying,” Nyland said. If no big finds are made, Norway must work on making the smaller finds profitable. “We have some 70 finds we think we can develop. Exploration activity has increased so we hope discoveries can be made in the coming years,” she said. Meanwhile, oil firms are conscious of not letting costs inflate at the rate they did between 2011 and 2013, which helped precipitate the oil-sector downturn of 2014-2016. “Our impression so far is that the companies are focused and conscious of costs,” she said. Norway’s 2018 oil production is so far coming below the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate’s forecasts due to a couple of unplanned offshore shutdowns, though Nyland cautioned the situation may turn before the end of the year. “Gas production is maintaining itself (against our forecast). Oil production looks somewhat lower (than expected) but the year is not over,” she said. “For 2019, the early prognosis we put in the (Norwegian) national budget shows an upswing in petroleum production, mostly due to gas, which represents nearly half of output,” she said. Oil production should increase somewhat due to developments coming online. “Still, it won’t be a massive rise, it is an uptick,” Nyland added.

A stronger-than-expected German business sentiment survey added to the upbeat mood in Europe, with stock markets in Paris and Frankfurt up about 0.5 percent each . British markets were closed for a public holiday, while U.S. stock futures  pointed to fresh gains on Wall Street. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.1 percent and Japan’s blue-chip Nikkei closed at a 10-week high. That left the MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, at its highest level since Aug. 9. Comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday affirming that the U.S. central bank was sticking with its strategy of gradual rate hikes to protect economic growth sparked a rally in stocks that gathered pace as a new week swung into gear. Helping to brighten the mood, U.S. and Mexican trade negotiators are seen as close to reaching a common position on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The talks will resume on Monday and a positive outcome could ease concerns about an escalation in global trade tensions. “The (NAFTA) talks add to the sense that while the U.S. is still bogged down in its trade conflict with China, it is perhaps more willing to compromise elsewhere such as with Mexico and the EU,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and emerging market research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “It’s decreasing the risk of a global trade war.” A strengthening in the Chinese yuan, one causality of heightened trade tensions, also boosted sentiment. China’s yuan rose to a near 4-week high to the dollar after the central bank revived a “counter-cyclical factor” in its daily fixing to support the currency, halting a record 10-week slide that rattled global markets. The announcement was seen as the latest signal from the People’s Bank of China that is not comfortable with a further yuan depreciation that could spark capital outflows from the cooling economy. Spot yuan opened onshore trade at 6.8080 per dollar and closed domestic trade, at 0830 GMT, at 6.8171, or 19 pips firmer than the previous late night session close. The offshore counterpart rose to a high of 6.7818, its strongest since July 31. A firmer currency helped to lift Chinese shares to two-week highs, with the Shanghai Composite index closing up 1.9 percent. Hong Kong stocks posted their biggest one-day percentage rise in six months. The move raised hopes that a yuan recovery could boost companies with significant dollar-denominated costs, such as airlines. China Southern Airlines gained 4.5 percent and Air China rose 3.25 percent. “China just seems to be stabilising its currency and we’re getting used to that fact now, so we’re not looking at an ever-weaker CNY, which could raise issues,” said Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING. On Friday, the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite hit record highs, following Powell’s comments. The gains cemented the S&P’s longest-running bull market, as defined by some investors. S&P 500 E-mini futures touched a record high of 2,885 during Asia trade, and were last up 0.23 percent. In Europe, data showed German business morale improved by much more than expected in August, suggesting that concerns about a global trade war among company executives in Europe’s largest economy have eased. The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index jumped to 103.8 from 101.7 in July. That added to the upbeat tone in stocks markets but weighed on German bond yields, which rose to their highest level in more than two-weeks at 0.367 percent. “We have low volumes today, but the biggest risks the market were discounting were trade wars, so any reduction in trade war risk such as NAFTA talks or even Trump trying to find bilateral deals with everyone, has pushed U.S. shares to new records and will support markets,” said Angelo Meda, head of equities and a portfolio manager at Banor SIM in Italy. “The global economy is on track, there’s less trade war risk, the only cloud on the horizon is Italy,” Meda added, referring to upcoming budget talks in the weeks ahead. In currency markets, the dollar steadied against its peers. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.1 percent at 95.253. The euro was marginally lower at $1.1608 after going as high as $1.1654, its strongest since Aug. 2, while hopes of progress in U.S./ Mexican NAFTA talks lifted the Mexican peso 0.6 percent to 18.81 per dollar. Oil prices  fell, while gold edged lower as the dollar recovered. Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by Tom

2018-08-27,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Noble Group Ltd (NOBG.SI) won approval from shareholders on Monday for a $3.5 billion debt restructuring plan that should ensure the survival of what was once Asia’s biggest commodity trader. Faced with the prospect of the company’s insolvency, shareholders reluctantly backed a debt-for-equity swap that will leave them owning just 20 percent of the business, while handing majority control to a group of creditors comprised mainly of hedge funds. “It’s obviously a relief to get this out of the way today and to get such a strong support from our shareholders,” Noble Chairman Paul Brough told reporters after the company won approval from 99.6 percent of shareholders voting at Monday’s 90-minute meeting in Singapore. “It’s all about the business now, rather than the restructuring,” Brough said after fielding numerous questions about the restructured firm’s prospects from the shareholders that packed the banquet hall where the meeting was held.  Several small shareholders attending the meeting told Reuters they were angry with Noble’s management as the plan diluted the value of their investments, but said they saw no choice but to support the plan in order to save at least some of their money. “We want to keep the company afloat rather than liquidate it,” said Roger Ong, 49, a driver who invested in Noble shares. Noble, founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who took advantage of a commodities bull run to build it into one of the world’s biggest traders, has had its market value all but wiped out from $6 billion in February 2015. The crisis for the company started that month after Arnaud Vagner, a former employee, published reports anonymously under the name of Iceberg Research that accused Noble of inflating its assets. The upheaval triggered a share price collapse, credit downgrades, writedowns and asset sales. Singapore-listed Noble has always stood by its accounts. GRAPHIC: The Rise & Fall of Noble Group - tmsnrt.rs/2P2OQZm Under the debt-for-equity deal, the company’s debt will be halved and it will get access to $800 million in trade finance and hedging facilities, a lifeline in a sector where profit margins are in the low single digits. In return, Noble will hand over 70 percent of its restructured business to creditors, while existing shareholders’ equity will be reduced to 20 percent and its management will get 10 percent. The company’s shareholders include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, Abu Dhabi-based fund Goldilocks Investment Co Ltd and Eastspring Investments, as well as more than 30,000 retail investors. Brough, a restructuring expert with more than 30 years of experience including the liquidation of Lehman Brothers’ assets in Asia, said Noble would appoint a new chairman and board before the restructured company starts operations in two to three months. Noble seeks to transform itself into an Asian-centric trader mainly dealing with coal, freight and liquefied natural gas. As part of its restructuring plan, the company has already moved its headquarters to London from Hong Kong. Trading in Noble’s shares were halted earlier on Monday pending an announcement. In its glory days, Noble employed hundreds of traders, with ambitions to rival competitors like Glencore (GLEN.L) but it had to sell off prized assets, including its oil and gas units, to rivals Vitol and Mercuria. Noble booked a $4.9 billion loss in 2017, despite a broad commodity market recovery, and then defaulted on its debt in March 2018. Analysts say Noble still faces an uphill battle, with its losses widening to $128 million during the April to June quarter from $72 million in the first quarter. “There’s no evidence so far that the business is turning around,” said Neel Gopalakrishnan, credit strategist at DBS Group. “Funding is the most important driver for this business and if a turnaround doesn’t come, the company may find it difficult to retain funding lines.” Iceberg said Monday’s vote would not stop securities holders from suing the individuals and organizations responsible for Noble’s downturn.

2018-08-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Monday, supported by a strengthening equities market and news that the United States and Mexico agreed to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Brent crude LCOc1 rose 39 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $76.21 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures gained 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, to close at $68.87 a barrel. Last week, WTI posted a 4.3 percent weekly gain while Brent marked a 5.6 percent weekly increase.  Traders said prices pulled back after market intelligence firm Genscape reported that inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI rose by about 764,800 barrels from Aug. 21 through Friday.  The United States and Mexico agreed on Monday to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), putting pressure on Canada to agree to new terms on auto trade and dispute settlement rules to remain part of the three-nation pact. “The trade deal with Mexico is definitely a supportive issue,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Opening those trade barriers up increases growth and increases demand expectations for oil.” Concerns that the countries would fail to strike a bilateral trade agreement had weighed on the oil market on Friday. Crude backed off from that session’s highs on fears that economic growth and demand would be stifled as the countries stumbled on negotiating roadblocks.   U.S. stock markets rallied, with the benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting all-time highs, pulling oil prices up. The equities market and oil futures market at times track closely with one another. Members of an OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee found producers cut their July output by 9 percent more than called for in their output reduction pact, two sources familiar with the matter said. This compared with a compliance level of 120 percent for June and 147 percent for May, meaning participants have been steadily increasing production.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia agreed in June to return to 100 percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in January 2017. This follows months of underproduction by Venezuela and other producers which cut output by 160 percent of the agreed target.  The committee groups representatives from Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Algeria, Venezuela and Oman. Prices have been buoyed in recent weeks by the view that the oil market will tighten when U.S. sanctions targeting OPEC member Iran’s oil exports kick in November. “While the Iranian sanctions issue certainly isn’t new news, suggestions out of the White House that waivers will be restricted appeared to augment last week’s price gains,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. In a phone call to French President Emmanuel Macron, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that Iran wanted the Europeans to give guarantees on banking channels and oil sales as well as in the field of insurance and transportation, according to the state-run Iranian news agency IRNA.

2018-08-27,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - G overnments and corporations are increasingly using legal persecution to portray indigenous activists as criminals and terrorists, putting them at heightened risk of violence, the United Nations said on Monday. Indigenous leaders and campaigners fighting to protect land from development are being stymied and silenced by rising militarization, national security acts and anti-terrorism laws, according to a report submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council. Globally, up to 2.5 billion people live on indigenous and community lands, which make up more than half of all land worldwide, but they legally own just 10 percent, according to rights groups. The U.N. report cited a “drastic increase” in violence against indigenous people actively opposing large-scale projects such as mining, infrastructure, hydroelectric dams and logging. “It’s a new war,” said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, who authored the report. “It’s getting worse because many of the remaining resources in the world are found in indigenous territories,” Tauli-Corpuz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. This month, an indigenous leader was murdered in Brazil, part of a battle over logging in the Amazon. In Guatemala, seven indigenous members of farmers’ organizations advocating for land rights and political participation were killed, it said. Last year, more than 200 activists were killed, the highest since 2002, according British campaign group Global Witness. “In the worst instances, escalating militarization, compounded by historical marginalization, results in indigenous peoples being targeted under national security acts and antiterrorism legislation, putting them in the line of fire, at times literally, by the army and the police,” it said. Governments and corporations are using legal means to designate indigenous people as trespassers subject to eviction, while arrest are made on vague charges or uncorroborated witness testimony, followed by long periods of pretrial detention. Criminal charges have been filed against activists, showing prosecutors and judges colluding with companies and landowners in some cases, it said. In Ethiopia, indigenous land rights defenders have been prosecuted and imprisoned under antiterrorist legislation, it said. There are no tallies of criminal charges filed against indigenous peoples worldwide, but Tauli-Corpuz cited recent upticks in the Philippines, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Kenya, Mexico and Peru. “What disarticulates a community? Arresting its leaders, criminalizing the leaders,” said Dinaman Tuxa, executive coordinator of Brazil’s Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples known as Apib, an umbrella group of advocacy groups.

MSCI’s gauge of stocks in 47 countries across the globe climbed 1 percent, helped by gains in developed markets from the United States to Europe and Asia. The broad index was at its highest level since March 14.

Agreement could ease concerns about an escalation in global trade tensions. Major currencies gained against the U.S. dollar, which has been a safe haven from months of trade tensions. “The (NAFTA) talks add to the sense that while the U.S. is still bogged down in its trade conflict with China, it is perhaps more willing to compromise elsewhere such as with Mexico and the EU,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and emerging market research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “It’s decreasing the risk of a global trade war.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 270.2 points, or 1.05 percent, to 26,060.55, the S&P 500 gained 22.78 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,897.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 76.50 points, or 0.96 percent, to 8,022.48.

2018-08-27,"(Adds Faroe comment) OSLO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil firm DNO on Monday withdrew its request for seats on the board of Faroe Petroleum amid an escalating war of words between the companies. DNO, Faroe’s top shareholder, had asked for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of shareholders to be held to put two of its executives on the board, a move which Faroe had resisted. “DNO ASA withdraws the request ... and notes with deep disappointment Faroe Petroleum’s repeated peremptory and disdainful attitude to such representation for, and therefore greater engagement with, its largest shareholder,” it said. DNO said it had also sought to raise “concerns and dismay” over Faroe’s wider governance culture and shareholder value strategies, and that it would now “consider its position”. Earlier this year, DNO built a 28.23 percent stake in Faroe, prompting speculation about a full takeover, although DNO said it had no intention of launching a full takeover bid. The board of London-listed Faroe has previously argued that adding DNO’s representatives to its board could cause conflicts of interest. “Faroe has noted the DNO statement and welcomes the withdrawal of their EGM request. We continue to maintain an open dialogue with all our major shareholders,” a Faroe spokesperson said on Monday.

These include solar, wind and other renewables assets. Speaking at an oil conference in Norway, Pouyanne said the chief executive of Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Yngve Slyngstad, had encouraged him to make the most of the “magic of electricity”.

2018-08-27,"(Adds no comment from Glencore) ATHENS, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Workers at Hellenic Petroleum on Monday physically prevented suitors eyeing a majority stake in Greece’s biggest oil refiner from entering two of its sites in protest at plans to privatise the utility, a union spokesman said. While privatisations have been a key part of successive bailout agreements Greece has struck since 2010, they have been met with strong political resistance. Greece still has a series of deals to complete under the terms of its latest bailout which ended last week, including the sale of a 50.1 percent stake in Hellenic jointly held by the state and Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holdings. The country’s privatisation agency has shortlisted Anglo-Swiss Glencore Energy and Switzerland’s Vitol Holding for the stake in Hellenic. Glencore was scheduled to visit Hellenic’s refineries in Aspropyrgos and Elefsina, about 12 miles (20 kms) outside Athens, on Monday. However, representatives arriving at the sites failed to gain entry after workers walked off the job for four hours to picket the entrance to the facilities, the union and another source close to the privatisation process said. The union said they planned more work stoppages for Tuesday and next week to protest against the sale. “Workers didn’t let them in because they want to cancel Hellenic Petroleum’s fire-sale”, Panagiotis Ofthalmides, the head of their labour union representing about 2,000 workers, told Reuters. Hellenic is strategically important for the country’s national interests and should remain under state control, Ofthalmides said. Hellenic Petroleum and Greece’s privatisation agency declined to comment on the action. Glencore also declined to comment. Glencore was due to visit Hellenic’s third refinery in Thessaloniki on Tuesday, while its competitor, Vitol, is expected in Athens next week. Ofthalmides said workers will not allow them to enter those sites either. Greece aims to conclude Hellenic’s sale by the middle of next year. A government source said the government has been in talks with the union and that the privatisation will be completed within the agreed timetable. Greece has raised about 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) from state assets since 2010 versus an original target of 50 billion euros, due to red tape, backtracking and opposition by unions. It has made significant progress in recent months and is aiming for sales worth a further 3 billion euros by next year.

2018-08-27,"(Reuters) - An OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee found that oil producers participating in a supply-reduction agreement cut output in July by 9 percent more than called for in their pact, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.  The findings for last month compare with a compliance level of 120 percent for June and 147 percent for May, meaning participants have been steadily increasing production.

2018-08-27,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) is not looking at investing in the U.S. shale oil industry, the company’s chief executive said on Monday. Patrick Pouyanne made the comment when asked whether peer BP’s (BP.L) $10.5 billion acquisition of U.S. shale assets from BHP Billiton BLT.L(BHP.AX) had made the sector more attractive.     “It’s first quite expensive, second we don’t have the human resources. BP had the human resources, BP had already a position, so I can understand their move but it’s not my case,” Pouyanne said on the sidelines of an oil conference. BP’s acquisition of about 500,000 producing acres marked a turning point for the group since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs. Shell (RDSa.L) and Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) have also invested in U.S. shale, but Eni (ENI.MI) and Total have been cautious. U.S. shale veteran and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) Chairman Scott Sheffield rang an optimistic note when asked at the conference about European oil and gas companies investing in U.S. shale. “Eventually I think more and more majors will get there, (because) it’s the fastest-growing region for the next 10 years in the world. And so if you’re not in the Permian ... then you’d better find growth somewhere else,” Sheffield said. He was referring to the Permian basin, which stretches across western Texas and eastern New Mexico.

Iraqis voted in May in their first parliamentary election since the defeat of Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, but a contentious recount process delayed the announcement of final results until earlier this month. Uncertainty over the make-up of the new government has raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, high unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after the war with Islamic State. “The president has held several substantive talks with all political groups, urging them to finalise their political agreements in order to meet constitutional provisions,” Masum’s office said in a statement. The Federal Supreme Court ratified the election results on Aug. 19 and Masum had 15 days to call the new parliament into session, the first step in a 90-day process outlined in the constitution that will eventually lead to a new government. Lawmakers will elect a parliamentary speaker and two deputies in their first session. They will later elect a new president and task the leader of the largest bloc to form a government as prime minister. The recount delayed the process by three months yet showed little had changed from the initial results, with populist Shi’ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr retaining his lead.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 1.1 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index closed 0.9 percent higher. European share markets were set to follow Asia higher, with European spreadbetters expecting Germany’s DAX to gain 45 points to 12,439 and France’s CAC 40 expected to open 22 points higher at 5,454. Adding to the positive mood, U.S. and Mexican trade negotiators appeared close to reaching a common position on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo saying on Sunday that talks have “continued to make progress”. A prospective trade deal with Mexico “takes a little bit of global trade war risk off the table,” said Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING. “Every time there’s a move toward fewer tariffs from the U.S. instead of more, then that should take a little pressure off the U.S. dollar,” he said. In China, shares rose to their highest levels in two weeks. The Shanghai Composite index added 1.7 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 index surged 2.2 percent, after the People’s Bank of China late on Friday revived a “counter-cyclical factor” used to set the midpoint of the daily trading band of the yuan, in a bid to support it. The move raised hopes that a yuan recovery could boost companies with significant dollar-denominated costs, such as airlines. China Southern Airlines gained 4.4 percent and Air China rose 3.7 percent. The yuan hit a two-and-a-half-week high against the U.S. dollar in early trade on Monday as the PBOC set the day’s midpoint at a stronger-than-expected level. At 0554 GMT, the yuan was trading at 6.8137 per dollar, 53 pips stronger than Friday’s onshore close of 6.8190. “China just seems to be stabilising its currency and we’re getting used to that fact now, so we’re not looking at an ever-weaker CNY, which could raise issues,” said Carnell, adding that “it reduces the scope for outflows.” Among other Asian markets, Seoul’s KOSPI index ended up 0.3 percent. On Friday, the S&P500 index and Nasdaq Composite hit record highs, following comments from the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who said a gradual approach to raising rates was best to protect the U.S. economy and job growth. The gains cemented the S&P’s longest-running bull market, as defined by some investors. S&P500 E-mini futures touched a record high of 2,885 on Monday morning in Asia, and were last 0.2 percent higher at 2,883. “Powell’s Jackson Hole speech essentially confirmed the need for further gradual rate hikes and stressed that higher interest rates have served the economy well. However, rate rises remain data-dependent, and other Fed officials reiterated that ‘nothing is predetermined’,” ANZ analysts said in a note on Monday. “The Fed Chair’s reiteration that rate rises would remain gradual gave the green light to ongoing falls in the USD and increases in equities on Friday,” the analysts said. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a Reuters interview last week that he was “not thrilled” with Powell’s rate hike policy. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.8152 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 2.826 percent on Friday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.6286 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.629 percent. Australian shares closed 0.3 percent higher on Monday, after a week of political tumult that installed Scott Morrison as the country’s sixth prime minister in less than 10 years. The dollar fell 0.2 percent against the yen to 111.03 , while the euro was flat on the day at $1.1618. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was flat at 95.143. U.S. crude reversed small losses to edge up to $68.74 per barrel. Brent crude was up 0.07 percent at $75.87 per barrel. Oil prices ended a streak of weekly declines to rise last week on tightening supply, driven by the prospect of lower oil supply from Iran.

Known as Sinopec, the company said in a statement late on Sunday that first-half net income was 41.6 billion yuan ($6.05 billion), up 54 percent from the same period a year earlier. That topped its own forecast of 50 percent profit growth, issued late in July. The company doesn’t give a breakdown for second-quarter results. But according to Reuters calculations based on Sinopec’s first-quarter earnings, April-June net income climbed to 22.8 billion yuan from 18.8 billion yuan in the first three months of the yea, the highest since at least the start of 2013. The stronger earnings came after oil topped $80 a barrel in May for the first time since 2014, boosted by OPEC-led output cuts and falling Venezuelan and Libyan output, as well as by an imminent drop in Iranian exports as U.S. sanctions return. Sinopec’s bumper results also come as state oil refiners have exported record volumes of diesel and gasoline, grabbing a bigger share of the market as smaller, independent refiners struggle with tough new taxes, a government-led environmental crackdown and crippling costs from the higher crude oil. The company’s shares in Hong Kong were up 1.7 percent in early trade at HK$7.65, while the exchange benchmark index was up 1.3 percent. Total revenue in the first six months of the year rose to 1.3 trillion yuan, up 12 percent from a year earlier, amid higher crude prices, rising natural gas production and stronger fuel margins, the statement said. Second-quarter revenue was 679 billion yuan, according to Reuters calculations. Still, Sinopec warned on Sunday processing rates for crude to stay flat in the second half of 2018, amid an oversupply of refined fuels. The company said it will process 121 million tonnes of crude oil in the second half of the year, the same as in the first half, and its domestic fuel sales will be 90.5 million tonnes, compared to 88.45 million tonnes in the first half, it said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. “Sinopec ramped up efforts to sell fuel in domestic market by giving a discount especially for diesel in the second quarter. The discounts have boosted sales volume but hurt revenue,” Eyebright Securities said in a research note last week after the company gave a results forecast. Crude oil production in the first half fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier to 143.6 million barrels while natural gas output was up 5.3 percent from a year earlier to 476.2 billion cubic feet, Sinopec said. Sinopec will produce 146 million barrels of crude oil in the second half of 2018, it said. Refined product sales in the first half were down 2.1 percent from the same period a year earlier. Chinese offshore oil and gas company CNOOC Ltd last week reported its best profits since 2015. China’s largest oil producer PetroChina, will publish their final first-half results on Aug. 30.

2018-08-27,"SINGAPORE, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped slightly on Monday on concerns that a U.S.-China trade dispute will erode global economic growth, although looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil sector kept crude from falling further, traders said. International Brent crude oil futures were at $75.75 per barrel at 0122 GMT, down 7 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 9 cents at $68.63 a barrel. “Falling U.S. rig counts and last week’s decline in U.S. inventories are supporting oil prices amid a protracted U.S.-China trade war that could dampen global growth and weigh on oil demand,” said Stephen Innes, Head of Trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. U.S. energy companies cut nine oil drilling rigs last week, dropping to 860, the biggest reduction since May 2016, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday. “Despite growing concerns about potential oversupply, the markets will continue to get a fillip from U.S. sanctions against Iran,” Innes added. Washington will target Iran’s oil exports with sanctions from November. OPEC-member Iran has exported around 2.5 million barrels per day of crude oil so far this year. Most analysts expect this figure to fall by at least 1 million bpd once sanctions kick in. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-08-27,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Noble Group Ltd (NOBG.SI) faces a key shareholder meeting on Monday as the shrivelled commodity trader races to clinch a last-ditch $3.5 billion debt restructuring deal to stay afloat and put a three-year crisis behind it. Shareholders are being asked to support a debt-for-equity swap that will leave them with just 20 percent of the business. Multiple sources familiar with the matter say the proposal is expected to succeed. The meeting is due to start at 2:30 local time (0630 GMT). Noble, founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who took advantage of a commodities bull run to build it into one of the world’s biggest traders, has seen its market value all but wiped out from $6 billion in Feb 2015. The crisis started in February 2015 after Arnaud Vagner, a former employee, published reports anonymously under the name of Iceberg Research and accused Noble of inflating its assets. The upheaval triggered a share price collapse, credit downgrades, writedowns and asset sales. Noble has always stood by its accounts. Under a debt-for-equity swap agreed with a group of mostly hedge-fund creditors, the company’s debt will be halved and it will get access to trade finance and hedging facilities - vital in a sector where profit margins are in the low single digits. In return, Noble will hand over 70 percent of its restructured business to creditors, while existing shareholders’ equity will be whittled down to 20 percent and its management will get 10 percent. Noble has won the backing of 30 percent of its shareholders, including Elman, its former chairman. The company needs a simple majority of voters in attendance at Monday’s meeting for the debt restructuring to go ahead. Trading in Noble’s shares was halted on Monday pending an announcement by the company. Analysts say the company faces an uphill battle, with its loss widening to $128 million in April-June from $72 million a quarter ago. “There’s no evidence so far that the business is turning around,” said Neel Gopalakrishnan, credit strategist at DBS Group. “Funding is the most important driver for this business and if a turnaround doesn’t come, the company may find it difficult to retain funding lines,” he said. If the vote doesn’t go its way, Noble will seek to implement a similar restructuring to keep it as a going concern but that plan does not provide for shareholders to receive any equity.

2018-08-27,"BARCELONA, Aug 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - I nsufficient cash is hampering a flagship international fund to help poor nations combat climate change, which is not working as fast and efficiently as the urgency of global warming requires, said former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established at U.N. climate talks in 2010 to channel a substantial portion of the $100 billion per year wealthy nations had pledged to mobilise by 2020 for developing-world efforts to curb carbon emissions and weather the impacts of climate change. Ban told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that decisions by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw his country from the 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming, and to walk away from promises on climate finance jeopardised global commitments. “I am deeply concerned that the GCF - while it has been really trying to work - has not been fully funded,” Ban said in an interview from South Korea, where the fund is also based. “With the U.S. pullout of this (Paris) climate agreement, we are not sure whether $100 billion by 2020 will be met,” he added. Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama pledged $3 billion to the GCF, but only $1 billion of that funding has been delivered. Of a total of more than $10 billion committed to the fund, since 2015 it has allocated about $3.5 billion for projects in 78 countries to curb heat-trapping emissions and adapt to more extreme weather and rising seas. But the last meeting of its 24-member board in July was blocked by disputes over policies and governance, meaning no new projects were approved. Ban, who is president of the Global Green Growth Institute, a GCF partner, described that result as “quite unfortunate”. Pressure is growing, including from the U.N. climate change chief, for the GCF to get back to business before major climate talks in Poland in December, to smooth negotiations on a rule book to implement the Paris Agreement. Ban said the fund should focus on getting things done. “It should be more effective; it should be more agile,” he said. “Otherwise if you have to wait many months or years to get the funding, by that time we will miss the opportunity to mitigate and adapt (to climate change).” According to the GCF, 31 projects backed by about $1.4 billion of its funding are now being rolled out - from climate information services to reduce disasters in the Pacific island state of Vanuatu, to producing sustainable argan oil in Morocco. Javier Manzanares, deputy executive director of the fund - whose chief Howard Bamsey resigned abruptly at July’s meeting - described the implementation figures as “stellar”. He conceded the summer meeting was a “setback”, but said he was “confident that the board will find a way to solve these challenging discussions”. At its next meeting in October, Manzanares is hoping projects worth up to $1.3 billion will be approved, and about 15 new agencies accredited to lead work in the field. A process to replenish the fund’s coffers should also be triggered, he said. “I believe there is a very strong commitment (to) making things happen,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Manzanares underscored the urgency of topping up the fund’s finances given its fast-expanding pipeline of projects compared with available money. “We are now dealing with a situation of demand that clearly outstrips supply,” he said. “The difference is so huge that there is a true need to start replenishment.” If all goes well, a pledging meeting for donors could be held late next year, he noted, although it remains unclear whether a target amount will be set. Ban pointed to a climate summit to be hosted by U.N. chief Antonio Guterres in September 2019 as a key moment for governments to outline clearly how they will reach their wider annual goal of $100 billion. ""Otherwise it will be a huge embarrassment for the developed countries not to be able to have a formula and a strong commitment on this,"" Ban said. ""I am sure that they will work on this matter ... I am urging them."" (Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Zoe Tabary.
