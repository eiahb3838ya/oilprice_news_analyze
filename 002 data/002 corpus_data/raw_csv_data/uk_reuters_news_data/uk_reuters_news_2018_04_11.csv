2018-04-11,"WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department watchdog on Wednesday criticized the reassignment of more than two dozen senior staff, saying political appointees shunted the executives into new jobs without leaving a paper trail or informing them beforehand. The inspector general’s report raises fresh questions about the agency’s management under Republican Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The onetime Montana congressman has faced criticism over his travel and as a key player in the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back environmental protections and boost development of federal lands. The investigation into the transfer of 27 of the department’s roughly 227 career executives from June to October 2017 said that it was done without documenting plans or reasons for the job shifts. Meetings by the department’s six-member Executive Resources Board, all political appointees, were done without “minutes, notes, voting or decision records, or other documentation ... other than photographs of poster boards,” the report said. None of the members of the board, then headed by Associate Deputy Secretary James Cason, could say who had ordered the reassignments, it said. Board members did not consult with the executives or their supervisors about their decisions. They instead relied on short biographies submitted to a personnel official after President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, it said. A dozen of the executives interviewed said their job shifts might have been related to previous work assignments, including climate change, energy, or conservation, the report said. Seventeen said they thought they were being shifted because of a conflict with Interior officials or because they were close to retirement. But board members said 18 of the executives were transferred to bring fresh expertise to new areas, the report said. The Interior Department did not respond to a request for comment. The report said that the department had resolved four issues and implemented one solution. The report triggered criticism from Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, who had requested the investigation. The reassignments without following procedures “is one more screw-up at taxpayer expense by the Department of the Interior,” she said in a statement. Zinke has been dogged by the release of details of his use of charter planes and helicopters for travel, as well as receipts showing the department spent more than $130,000 to install doors at his office at a time of proposed budget cuts and fee hikes at national parks.

2018-04-11,"OTTAWA/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to pile pressure on British Columbia’s provincial government to drop its resistance to a pipeline project, but will try to avoid tougher measures that might alienate voters who helped his Liberals win power, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday. Trudeau is racing against time. Kinder Morgan Canada said it would scrap the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to the west coast unless all legal and jurisdictional challenges facing the project are resolved by May 31. The pipeline, which Canada’s oil industry considers crucial, is opposed by British Columbia’s left-leaning New Democratic provincial government. Environmentalists and aboriginal activists are mounting frequent protests and British Columbia police have arrested about 200 people around Trans Mountain facilities since mid-March. Trudeau’s Liberals picked up seats in the province in the last election, but the federal NDP - which opposes the pipeline  - remains a force there. This could make Trudeau’s federal government cautious as it is locked in a rare standoff with a provincial counterpart. British Columbia opposes the expansion, citing fears that the risk of a spill in the Pacific province is too great. Ottawa insists it has jurisdiction over the project and Trudeau is under huge pressure to crack down. For now, he will press the provincial government, pointing to polls showing most Canadians want the expansion to go ahead. “We need to take actions that are focused on the government of British Columbia,” said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. Trudeau will hold more talks with the province as well as Kinder Morgan Canada, the source added. Trudeau must be careful because British Columbia voters and environmentalists gave him strong support that helped bring him to power in 2015. A crackdown could cost him support in both camps ahead of a federal election set for October 2019. Although Ottawa says it is exploring all regulatory, legal and financial alternatives, the source conceded “there aren’t an awful lot of options for the prime minister.” Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau discussed the matter with Alberta Premier Rachel Notley in Toronto on Wednesday and told reporters that Ottawa had yet to make a final decision. “We are working, using all the tools at our disposal, to make sure we move forward in short order to absolutely ensure this project goes forward,” he said, without giving details. “We have to ensure the rule of law in this country works.” Some pipeline supporters have urged Trudeau to declare a national emergency to push through the pipeline, but the source said that idea is “preposterous.” Also off the table for now are calls from opposition members to reduce the payments Ottawa sends to British Columbia to help fund social programs.     “Are they actually suggesting we cut ... health and social transfers to hard-working British Columbians?” said the source. Ottawa and Alberta have talked about investing in the project, though it was unclear how that would lessen British Columbia’s opposition. Some commentators suggest provincial and federal governments underwrite the project by providing insurance, essentially leaving them on the hook if the company decides to walk away.  If pipeline supporters view Trudeau as too soft, they could accuse him of not doing enough to prevent a constitutional crisis and of abandoning the energy industry in Alberta, where the Liberals also picked up extra seats in 2015. “I don’t think it’s a win for him in British Columbia or Alberta under any circumstances,” said pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research. “The problem is that is this open warfare on principle.” ($1 = 1.2571 Canadian dollars) Additional reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto; Editing by Denny Thomas, David Gregorio and Richard Chang",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline-politics/update-1-canadas-trudeau-to-press-british-columbia-to-accept-pipeline-source-idUKL1N1RO2BL,11 Apr 2018,"Canadian Prime

2018-04-11,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - A former Colombian guerrilla insurgent who is trying to become the country’s first leftist president, Gustavo Petro said he would focus on narrowing its yawning gap between rich and poor if elected. The 57-year-old leftist economist, who was mayor of Bogota from 2011 to 2013, ranks second in polls to replace President Juan Manuel Santos and is pledging to change the nation’s economic model, by taxing owners of unproductive land and shifting away from oil and coal. “I want to transform the country. It’s what I have wanted since I was a boy,” Petro said in an interview late on Tuesday. “The core generator of problems in Colombia is inequality.” The election may determine the fate of Colombia’s fragile peace process, which ended five-decades of war with Marxist FARC rebels but angered many by giving their commanders a political voice instead of a jail cell, and highlighted the wealth divide Petro is targeting. Petro’s proposals, which include expanding education, clean energy and a tax overhaul, have spooked some investors who fear he will expropriate land and turn Colombia into another Venezuela, a charge he denied. “We would not be an ally of Venezuela, because Venezuela entered the world of the fossil economy,” he said, referring to Colombia’s crisis-hit socialist neighbour. Petro added that he would gradually eliminate oil, coal and gas and replace it with energy from clean sources like wind and water. Petro will hike taxes on unproductive fertile land, encouraging landowners to sell to the state to pass on to poor farmers. That may upset cattle ranchers, among others.    “A tax cannot be called expropriation; it’s a tax on productive land,” he said. Once a member of the now-defunct M19 rebel group, Petro’s election as Bogota mayor was seen as proof that politics was the way forward for insurgent movements like the FARC, which demobilized last year and formed a political party. But in late 2013 he was removed from his post - the most powerful after the presidency - by the inspector general for mismanagement of garbage collection and banned from holding office for 15 years, a ruling that brought thousands to the streets and was later overturned. Ivan Duque, a protege of right-wing former President Alvaro Uribe, is leading Petro in polls by about 10 points in Colombia,  a country of 50 million that has historically been governed by the right. A father of six, Petro rails against the Colombian traditional political class, accusing it of corruption and enriching itself at the expense of the poor. Petro’s Colombia Humana party won just six seats out of 280 in the recent legislative election, making it tough for him to push radical reforms through congress. He said he would seek alliances with centre, left and other minority parties or call for a change to the constitution through a constituent assembly. He plans to sell bonds to finance the land purchases and move poor farmers - like those who grow coca, the raw material for cocaine - to grow legal crops.     To contain the fiscal deficit, he would promote another tax reform to raise duties on corporate dividends and foreign profits and eliminate tax exemptions for large investors. “An investor is a gambler and the first thing he does is to examine the rules of the game. We want to put the rules of the game on the table, without hidden cards, we want to move from an extractive economy to a productive economy,” he said. A first-round ballot will be held on May 27, but if none of the candidates get more than half the votes, a second round will be held in June.

2018-04-11,"WELLINGTON, April 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Thursday that her government would not grant any new permits for offshore oil and gas exploration. The 22 existing permits would not be affected by the decision and any discoveries from firms holding these licenses could still lead to mining permits of up to 40 years, according to an emailed government statement. “This is a responsible step which provides certainty for businesses and communities that rely on fossil fuels,” Ardern said. “We’re striking the right balance for New Zealand - we’re protecting existing industry, and protecting future generations from climate change.” Ardern’s centre-left Labour-led government, which took the helm in October after almost a decade of centre-right National Party rule, has a support arrangement with the environmentally-focused Green Party. Ardern had campaigned during the election to focus on preventing climate change and vowed that her government would move the country toward having no net carbon emissions by 2050. New Zealand usually holds an annual tender process to award oil and gas exploration permits, largely in the energy-rich northeastern region of Taranaki. But interest has waned in recent years due to lower global oil prices. Only one permit was granted in 2017 compared with 10 in 2013.

2018-04-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks across the globe fell on Wednesday as U.S. President Donald Trump taunted Russia for supporting Syria’s president after a suspected chemical attack on rebels, while oil hit its highest since 2014 after Saudi Arabia said it intercepted a missile over Riyadh. Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria, declaring that missiles “will be coming” despite a warning from Russia that any U.S. missiles fired at Syria over the deadly assault on a rebel enclave near Damascus would be shot down and the launch sites targeted. The animosity kept investors on edge and weighed on risky assets like stocks, while the safe-haven yen rose against the U.S. dollar. “There’s general nervousness about what might happen with any strikes and the potential escalation of tensions with Russia,” said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Boston. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 218.55 points, or 0.9 percent, to 24,189.45, the S&P 500 lost 14.68 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,642.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.66 points, or 0.12 percent, to 7,102.96.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.06 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.49 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve is worried about trade tensions with China, but minutes from the most recent Fed meeting suggest those concerns have not translated into worry about the overall economy - or a more complacent monetary policy. “The minutes were modestly negative,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. “People had been speculating that due to all the turbulence in the market because of geopolitical uncertainties that the Fed might consider pausing or slowing down the interest rate increases.” Oil prices hit their highest in more than three years despite a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories as investors fretted over conflict escalation in the Middle East. [nL3N1RO18E] “A bearish inventory report was quickly negated on word of intercepted rockets over Riyadh, which just adds to the recent spike in geopolitical tensions,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst and commodities futures broker at CHS Hedging LLC. U.S. crude rose 1.89 percent to $66.75 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.89, up 1.2 percent on the day. Oil prices began to climb on Trump’s warning over Syria, then rallied further on a report that Saudi Arabia’s air defence forces intercepted a missile over Riyadh, the capital. The dollar fell against the yen as escalating geopolitical concerns added to lingering worries over U.S. trade policy and domestic scandals swirling around Trump. “It’s a risk-off kind of day,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California, referring to increased geopolitical tensions. “The yen typically is a flight to safety,” Trang noted. The dollar index fell 0.07 percent, with the euro up 0.1 percent to $1.2366.

2018-04-11,"BAKU (Reuters) - Ilham Aliyev won a fourth term as president of Azerbaijan on Wednesday in an election boycotted by major opposition parties, who accused him of authoritarian rule and suppressing political dissent. The former Soviet republic’s huge energy reserves and strategic location on the Caspian Sea make it an important alternative for Europe to Russian oil and gas. “Ilham Aliyev is leading ... He got 86.09 percent of votes,” Mazahir Panahov, the Central Election Commission chairman told a news conference. The partial results were based on the 65 percent of the ballots counted, he said.     “I am grateful to my people for voting for our achievements and success,” Aliyev said on state television, soon after the election commission announced the first results. “People voted for stability, security and development.” The ruling New Azerbaijan Party claimed Aliyev’s victory two of hours after polls closed. “Voters have made the right choice, and this choice is Ilham Aliyev,” said Ali Akhmedov, the party’s senior official. “According to exit polls results, 80 to 85 percent of voters have voted for Aliyev, which means that Ilham Aliyev has won the election,” he said. Dozens of cars honking and carrying the flags of Azerbaijan and Aliyev’s ruling party cruised down Oilman Avenue, a central Baku thoroughfare whose high-priced boutiques have come to symbolise the massive oil revenues enjoyed by the Azeri elite. The election commission said turnout was about 75 percent and there were no complaints about irregularities. Aliyev, 56, and his supporters deny allegations of voter fraud and say dissent has not been suppressed.     Aliyev was first elected in October 2003, two months before the death of his father, Heydar Aliyev, who ruled for 10 years. He cemented his position with two referendums, one in 2009 that scrapped a two-term presidential limit and another in 2016 that extended the presidential term to seven years from five. Aliyev brought forward the date of the vote to April 11 from Oct. 17, a move his allies said was necessary to avoid presidential and parliamentary elections clashing in 2025.     Seven candidates ran, but critics questioned whether they were actual opponents. Monitors, including the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe, were watching the vote. The OSCE monitors will present their observations at a news conference on Thursday. Aliyev has tried to strike a balance between Azerbaijan’s former Soviet master Russia and the West, notably on energy policy. He has benefited from a boom fuelled by oil exports, but a slump in global crude prices in the last three years has weakened the Azeri currency and shrunk the economy.

Prices began to rally as Trump threatened to fire missiles at Syria. Washington and its allies have been considering air strikes following a suspected poison gas attack last weekend.  Oil climbed further as broadcaster Al Arabiya said Saudi Arabia’s air defense forces intercepted a missile over the capital Riyadh. Brent LCOc1 rose $1.02 on the day to settle at $72.06 a barrel, having touched a session high of $73.09. U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose $1.31 to settle at $66.82 a barrel, a 2 percent gain, having traded as high as $67.45. Some major airlines were re-routing flights after Europe’s air traffic control agency urged caution for aircraft flying in the eastern Mediterranean due to possible air strikes on Syria. Trump has criticized Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’,” he wrote in a post on Twitter.  Syria is not a significant oil producer, but any sign of conflict in the region triggers concern about crude flows across the wider Middle East. Reports of missiles in Riyadh exacerbated those worries, on top of existing concerns the United States could renew sanctions against Iran. Commerzbank’s head of commodity research Eugen Weinberg said oil market fundamentals “do not justify the current price, but unfortunately the market is focusing more on the politics and ignoring some of the warning signs, especially the hike in U.S. oil production.” Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would not let another supply glut surface, implying that the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would continue to withhold supply. Not all oil market indicators suggest the price will continue to rally strongly, analysts said. U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels in the week to April 6, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The big build was a surprise after analysts had forecast a decrease of 189,000 barrels.  Despite oil’s price spike after the rocket over Riyadh, the market remains focused on fundamentals, said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. “Market participants will closely watch oil-production profile in the U.S., which is also expected to have a material impact on the outcome of the upcoming OPEC meeting in June,” he said.

2018-04-11,"BOGOTA, April 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indigenous communities that depend on Colombia’s Amazon rainforest for their survival will have more say over their ancestral lands, as Colombia adds 8 million hectares to its protected areas in an effort to stem forest loss. The new measures announced by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos on Tuesday aim to create a buffer zone for the country’s southern Amazon region. Farmers are pushing deeper into forests, cutting down more trees to clear land for cattle-grazing and agriculture. Santos said the protected areas will be marked off in the next two weeks, meaning that “once and for all, we (will) know where we can farm, produce - and from what boundary we will protect all the forests and the entire Amazon”. This brings the total area of protected forests in Colombia to nearly 40 million hectares, Santos said in a speech in the Amazon town of Leticia, flanked by indigenous tribes and Norway’s prime minister and environment minister. Norway, a key financial backer of Colombia’s forest conservation efforts, said the new buffer zone was important to meet Colombia’s goals of zero net deforestation by 2020, and halting the loss of all natural forest by 2030. “It is unprecedented - it has not happened anywhere else, any other place at least that I know,” Ola Elvestuen, Norway’s new minister of climate and environment, said on this week’s visit. Reducing deforestation is crucial in the fight against climate change, Elvestuen added. When forests are degraded or destroyed, the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, with deforestation accounting for 10 to 15 percent of carbon emissions worldwide. Under a decree signed by President Santos, Colombia’s Amazon tribes will be able to decide through their own community councils how to spend government development funds in three provinces. “Indigenous people have traditionally shown themselves to be the best keepers of rainforests,” Elvestuen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. Norway said it would extend an agreement with Colombia by five years to 2025 under which Colombia gets payouts for meeting verified targets to reduce emissions by slowing deforestation. Colombia will receive up to $50 million a year through 2025 under the deal, which could run until 2030, the minister said. The payments are usually distributed to farmers, as well as community and indigenous groups and local environment authorities working on forest protection. Colombia is home to rainforest roughly the size of Germany and England but is struggling to protect it. Deforestation rates in its Amazon region increased by 44 percent from 2015 to 2016. Elvestuen said they could rise again in 2017 and 2018. Swathes of forests are being felled in areas vacated by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as part of a 2016 peace deal signed with the government. As the government tries to regain control of former FARC strongholds, farmers, illegal loggers and organised crime groups involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining are tapping into new places, including in the Amazon, Elvestuen said. Colombia's top court earlier this month told the government to come up with plans within four months to combat rising deforestation in the Amazon.

2018-04-11,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is targeting November 2019 as the start of production for its Model Y sport utility vehicle, with production in China to begin two years later, two sources told Reuters this week, shedding some light on the electric vehicle maker’s next project that could tax its resources and capacity.  Reuters has learned the Silicon Valley company led by Chief Executive Elon Musk is accepting preliminary bids for supplier contracts on the Model Y, a compact crossover companion to the Model 3 sedan. Tesla has given suppliers scant details about the programme and had not provided a production time frame, but has now indicated the vehicle would begin to be built at its Fremont, California, plant in November of next year, the two sources with knowledge of the supply chain said.  Tesla declined to comment. The new Model Y details show that Tesla is pushing ahead on plans to build a new vehicle even as it struggles to produce the Model 3, which launched in July. Despite initially attracting about 500,000 advance orders in the form of refundable deposits, the sedan’s launch has been plagued by delays and manufacturing bottlenecks, postponing Tesla’s anticipated revenue stream and exacerbating a cash crunch for the money-losing company. Earlier this month, Tesla tried to reassure investors, saying its weekly Model 3 output had doubled during the first quarter and that production rates would accelerate through the second quarter to 5,000 units per week, or about 250,000 vehicles per year. Competitive bidding is a crucial early step in the complicated process of automotive manufacturing. After the automaker discloses its plans, suppliers compete based on factors including cost and technology.  Tesla issued to suppliers what is known as a “request for information,” or RFI, which gives a directional view of what will be needed.  With a new car model, automakers normally choose parts suppliers two to two-and-a-half years before the start of production. At about one-and-a-half years away, a November 2019 start date for the Model Y would be considered “aggressive, but possible,” said one of the sources. A shorter timeline is potentially feasible, the source said, as the Model Y will be built on the same platform as the Model 3.  Tesla is known for its aggressive timelines and high risk-tolerance in order to get cars to market quicker. To save time and cost, Tesla made the risky bet to skip a pre-production testing phase for the Model 3 in order to advance straight to production tooling, which is harder to fix if problems arise, as Reuters first reported last year. 1 MILLION MODEL Ys? The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla, which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months. It is spending to build out its Gigafactory battery factory in Nevada, where battery module assembly issues have contributed to Model 3 delays, and also expects to build a factory in China in the near future. Tesla has said it will not need to raise additional funds this year. But Moody’s cited the likelihood of a capital raise of more than $2 billion in its downgrade of the company last month, spurred by concerns about cash reserves and Tesla’s ability to meet production targets. The company burned through $3.4 billion last year. Without giving a time frame, Musk in February told analysts the company would aim for production capacity of 1 million Model Ys per year.  The two sources said suppliers could be estimating an annual production of 500,000 vehicles in the United States, with much lower volume in China, likely in the tens of thousands. Building 500,000 Model Ys per year would be the equivalent of what Musk has planned for total production in Fremont by the end of this year, although the company is nowhere near that volume. Suppliers generally use automakers’ production targets to formulate a good guess on how many vehicles will actually be built, based on the individual automaker’s capability to execute and consumer demand. One of the sources said Tesla’s RFI was light on details compared with other automakers, and did not provide volume estimates for the Model Y.  Musk said in February that capital investments related to the SUV would begin towards the end of 2018. Tesla has said its current factory in Fremont could produce 10,000 vehicles a week - what the company hopes it will build in the Model 3 alone some time in 2018 - without the need for a new building, although some in the industry believe there is not enough room at the plant to support that volume. Any major Model Y programme would likely require a new facility, although low volume of the Model Y could be built on the existing Model 3 line, the sources said.

The fallout from new U.S. sanctions on Moscow have rattled investors and fears of military action were stoked after one of Russia’s ambassadors reiterated it would shoot down any U.S. missiles fired at Syria. Trump, who has criticized Russia for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, shot back in a message on Twitter on Wednesday. “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’,” he wrote in the post. “You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” In response, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a Facebook post that “smart missiles should fly towards terrorists, not towards the lawful government”. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 129.86 points, or 0.53 percent, to 24,278.14, the S&P 500 lost 5.99 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,650.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.66 points, or 0.12 percent, to 7,102.96. Facebook and Netflix helped to pare losses in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Facebook Inc shares were up 1.5 percent as Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg gave a second day of testimony before the U.S. Congress. Netflix shares climbed more than 3 percent following a Goldman Sachs target price increase $60 above Wall Street’s median price target of $300. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.60 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.16 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.14 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.04 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.49 percent. “It feels like there are expectations that the U.S. is going to take some action against Syria,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “The market, I don’t believe, has priced one yet.” Investors’ nerves were rattled just a day after worries eased on a more conciliatory tone on trade between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Meanwhile, oil prices hit their highest in more than three years after Trump’s latest comments despite bearish inventory numbers. U.S. crude rose 2 percent to $66.82 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.07, up 1.45 percent on the day. Oil prices began to climb on Trump’s warning over Syria, then rallied further on a report that Saudi Arabia’s air defense forces intercepted a missile over Riyadh, the capital. The dollar fell against the yen, hitting a two-week low over lingering worries of a trade war with China and domestic scandals swirling around Trump. The dollar index fell 0.08 percent, with the euro up 0.12 percent to $1.2369. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.33 percent versus the greenback at 106.85 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.4183, up 0.08 percent on the day. The Russian ruble slumped as much as 2.5 percent against the dollar and even more versus the euro. In metals, aluminum prices extended their rally to a sixth straight session, hitting an 11-week peak amid persistent worry about shortages after the United States imposed sanctions on Russia’s Rusal. Spot gold added 1.2 percent to $1,355.21 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.00 percent to $1,359.30 an ounce as safe-haven demand sharpened. Palladium, which has also benefited from expectations that sanctions on Russia could hurt supply, rose further after climbing nearly 6 percent in the past two days. Some metals entered the red. The London Metal Exchange and the CME Group said they were taking action to restrict aluminum brands of Rusal, one of the world’s biggest producers, on their exchanges. “There’s a lot of panic and uncertainty. Buyers are scrambling to try to replace where they can, to plug the gap left by not having Russian-origin metal,” said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale in London. U.S. Treasury yields edged higher after slipping on U.S. consumer price data that reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a gradual pace. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.7899 percent, from 2.797 percent late on Tuesday.

2018-04-11,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco on Wednesday signed an initial deal with a consortium of Indian refiners to build a $44 billion refinery and petrochemical project on India’s west coast, as the kingdom moves to secure buyers for its crude in a market awash with oil. Top executives of Aramco and India’s Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals - a joint venture of Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS), Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL.NS) and Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL.NS) - signed a memorandum of understanding to take equal stakes in the project in Maharashtra state.  The project includes a 1.2-million-barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery integrated with petrochemical facilities with a total capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, the officials said on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum. Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, is expanding its footprint globally by signing new downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its existing plants ahead of an initial public offering that is expected later this or next year. Days earlier, state oil giant Aramco sealed refining and petrochemicals deals worth about $20 billion in France and the United States. The Indian plant will be one of the largest refining and petrochemical complexes in the world, built to meet fast-growing fuel and petrochemicals demand in India and elsewhere. “Large as this project may be, it does not by itself satisfy our desire to invest in India ... We see India as a priority for investments and for our crude supplies,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said. “We’re very much interested in retail ... We want to be consumer-facing,” he said.  Saudi Aramco will supply at least 50 percent of the crude to be processed at the planned refinery, he said. Aramco may introduce at a later stage a strategic partner to share its 50 percent stake, Falih said.  “We have somebody in mind and we will announce in due course,” Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said, without elaborating. Saudi petrochemical company SABIC is also keen to invest in a cracker and other facilities in India, Falih said.  Aramco, like other major producers, wants to tap rising demand growth and invest in the world’s third-biggest oil consumer. Last year it opened an office in New Delhi.  India outlined plans in February to expand its refining capacity by 77 percent to about 8.8 million bpd by 2030.  The signing confirmed a Reuters story that ran after representatives of Aramco had met with their Indian counterparts on Tuesday.  During a visit to New Delhi in February, Falih had said Saudi Arabia would sign oil supply deals as part of any agreements to buy stakes in Indian refineries, a strategy it has adopted to expand its market share in Asia and fend off rivals.  Last year, Saudi Arabia pledged billions of dollars of investments in refinery projects in Indonesia and Malaysia that came with long-term crude oil supply deals. The company is further strengthening its refining role in China, one of its biggest oil customers. Aramco has a refinery joint venture with Sinopec and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), and is building a 300,000-bpd refinery with Norinco. “Because of our significant supplies to the Chinese market we are looking at additions,” Nasser said, adding his company hopes to close a deal with CNPC this year to buy a stake in a 260,000-bpd refinery in Yunnan.  Saudi Arabia is competing with Iraq to be India’s top oil supplier. Iraq displaced Saudi Arabia for the first time on an annual basis in 2017, data compiled by Reuters showed.  Nasser said he was not worried by rising supplies from regional rivals to India.

2018-04-11,"ATHENS, April 11 (Reuters) - Greece’s power grid operator has launched an international open tender for a project linking the island of Crete to the mainland grid via undersea cables, the energy ministry said on Wednesday. The project linking Crete to the Peloponnese peninsula is part of a 2 billion euro ($2.5 billion), 10-year investment plan to connect some of Greece’s islands to the mainland. The tender, via an e-auction, will be awarded to “the most economically advantageous offer, based solely on the lowest price”, the ministry said. The Crete link is expected to be completed by 2020 and is budgeted to cost 324 million euros, the ministry said. Crete will also be connected to Athens in a later phase. Power production on Crete, the largest of the Greek islands, is currently provided by three oil-fired plants that must be shut down to comply with a European Union directive. Energy Minister George Stathakis said the project would contribute to the “drastic reduction” of electricity costs, improve Crete’s ecological footprint and lead to 215 million euros in annual savings, mainly through lower service charges. State-controlled grid operator ADMIE was spun off last year from power utility Public Power Corp under Greece’s international bailout.

2018-04-11,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s air defence forces intercepted three ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and other cities on Wednesday by Yemen’s Houthis who have stepped up attacks recently, threatening to escalate a rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Three rockets were shot down above the capital and the southern cities of Jizan and Najran, according to state media and the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen. The Houthis claimed to have targeted the defence ministry in Riyadh and a Saudi Aramco distribution facility in Najran. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The attacks mark the fourth time in five months that missiles have flown over Riyadh, as the Houthis step up efforts to demonstrate they can reach the Saudi capital. Last month, one man was killed in Riyadh by debris after the military shot down a flurry of missiles, the first casualty of the Yemen war in the Saudi capital. Wednesday’s missiles followed the downing of two Houthi drones earlier in the day in Jizan and the nearby Saudi city of Abha, the coalition said. The Houthis said they were targeting an Aramco facility in Jizan, but the company said its facilities there were operating “normally and safely”. The company is building a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Jizan, part of a new economic city on the Red Sea, which is expected to become fully operational in 2019. Aramco was not immediately available to comment on the missiles. The Houthis say their missile attacks on the kingdom are in retaliation for air raids on Yemen by the Western-backed coalition. Their news agency SABA said four people were killed, including a woman and a child, and 10 others wounded in two air strikes on Wednesday in the Razih district of western Saada province. There was no immediate comment from the coalition. Saudi Arabia and an alliance of Muslim states intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to try and push back the Houthis after they drove the internationally-recognised government into exile in Riyadh. The coalition has launched thousands of air strikes in Yemen which have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the three-year-old war, and three out of four Yemenis — 22 million civilians — need relief aid. The coalition accuses the Houthis of being armed and supported by Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny. Arms monitor Conflict Armament Research says it has evidence that the drones used on Wednesday and other Houthi kit were made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction “in contrast to Houthi statements”.

2018-04-11,"BRUSSELS, April 11 (Reuters) - The European Commission is considering an interim CO2 emissions standard for trucks in 2025 to be followed by a stricter one in 2030, an official said on Wednesday ahead of the publication of the bloc’s first ever such targets. Unlike other countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada, the European Union has no limits on CO2 emissions from trucks, which account for a quarter of road transport emissions. “We are looking at several options, one being to have a target in 2025, as we have proposed for cars, another one for 2030,” said Alexandre Paquot, head of the Road Transport Unit at the Commission’s climate department, at an event in Brussels. The Commission is expected to propose its CO2 targets in May, following which the proposal will need to be agreed by EU lawmakers and national governments. The EU wants to curb greenhouse gas emissions from transport as part of a drive to cut emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Cars and vans already face a limit of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km) by 2021 and the Commission last year proposed tougher emissions limits for 2030. Campaign group Transport & Environment, which organised the event, said the Commission ought to take into account research showing new diesel trucks can be 24 percent more fuel efficient by 2025. The industry, which has in the past opposed the idea of introducing CO2 standards for trucks, said it would support a two-step approach. “What we need is a good baseline on which we can start the reduction of CO2 and kind of a two step approach,” said Joachim Drees, CEO of German truckmaker MAN. There should be a certain standard for certain vehicle classes for 2025, and then a more ambitious standard for 2030, he added. Aldo Celasco, Commercial Vehicle Director at European carmakers’ lobby ACEA said a good baseline for the emissions standards could be 2019.

2018-04-11,"* Cash-strapped power firm a headache for Ramaphosa * New management has said balance sheet unsustainable * South African unions oppose privatising Eskom assets By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Reuters) - South Africa’s state power utility Eskom is sounding out possible buyers for its mortgage business, a tender document showed on Wednesday, in what would be the first major privatisation deal under President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa has made revamping state-owned firms like Eskom a top priority as he seeks to reverse years of economic stagnation and mismanagement under his predecessor Jacob Zuma. But he faces a difficult balancing act as talk of selling state assets is anathema to large sections of society including the country’s powerful trade union movement. South Africa is exposed to Eskom via over 200 billion rand ($16.7 billion) of state guarantees, a point ratings agencies regularly cite as a risk to its sovereign rating. Eskom said in a document on a government tender website that it was considering selling all of Eskom Finance Company (EFC), a subsidiary that specialises in mortgage lending to employees. EFC has a loan book worth around 8.7 billion rand ($721 million) and roughly 16,000 customers, documents on the tender website showed. Eskom narrowly avoided a liquidity crunch early this year by securing 20 billion rand in short-term funding from banks but still faces an uncertain future because of weak power demand and falling profits. In February ratings agency S&P Global downgraded Eskom further into “junk” status. Eskom’s new management said its balance sheet was not sustainable after the firm reported a sharp slide in profits in January. The government said as far back as 2015 that it was considering divesting some Eskom assets, but the proposal was vehemently opposed by unions like COSATU, on which Ramaphosa relies for support. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the utility would hold talks with unions about the plans to sell EFC.

2018-04-11,"NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - Ghana will launch its first exploration licensing round in the last quarter of this year offering about six offshore blocks, deputy energy minister Mohamed Amin Adam said. Ghana currently produces 200,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), led by its flagship Jubilee field which produces about 100,000 bpd, he said. The west African nation, which became a significant oil producer in 2010 when it began pumping from the offshore Jubilee field, is keen to unlock its vast oil and gas resources. Adam said global oil majors like BP, Shell and some independent producers have shown interest in acquiring a stake in oil assets in Ghana. “We have asked them to wait for our first bidding round which is scheduled for the last quarter of this year,” Adam told Reuters in New Delhi. He said Ghana would put up another six offshore blocks for auction next year. Drawn to Ghana’s hydrocarbon potential, ExxonMobil Corp recently signed a deal with Ghana to explore for oil in the Deepwater Cape Three Point offshore (DWCTP) oilfield. Exxon is doing due diligence to find a local partner to explore the block, a condition required to operate a field in Ghana, he said. “Once they select the local partner, we are ready to go to parliament for ratification,” he said. He refused to elaborate on the timeline for completing the deal. Aker Energy AS, controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, agreed in February to buy Hess Corporation’s Ghana unit in a $100 million deal, gaining access to a 50 percent stake in the deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block. The block holds an estimated 550 million barrels of oil equivalent in contingent resources and potential for a further 400 million barrels. Adam said Aker may not have to pay capital gains tax on its transaction with Hess as the block is covered by a stability clause. Stability clauses guarantee that the terms of an oil contract stay the same throughout its life. “Some of our contracts are covered by stability clauses ... the contract with Hess was covered under a stability agreement so any transfer of ownership may not require capital gains tax,” he added. However, he cautioned, the question is subject to interpretation by Ghana revenue authorities. He said Italy’s Eni which has stake in two blocks in Ghana wants more blocks in the nation. Ghana wants to be a petroleum hub for west Africa. It has drawn up plans to build four refineries of about 150,000 bpd each in the next 12 years, he said. Ghana’s only oil refinery, the Tema Oil Refinery, processes about 25,000 bpd of oil, far below its capacity. “Very soon we will launch a programme to attract investment into refineries,” he added.

The attack on Wednesday marked the fourth time in five months that missiles have flown over Riyadh, as the Houthis step up efforts to demonstrate they can reach the Saudi capital, and threatens to escalate a regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The coalition has launched thousands of air strikes in Yemen which have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians.

2018-04-11,"PARIS (Reuters) - French state-controlled utility EDF (EDF.PA) will have to inspect more weldings at the nuclear plant it is building in Flamanville, France after flaws were discovered in the weldings of the reactor’s secondary circuit, nuclear regulator ASN said. EDF said on Tuesday that problems with Flamville's weldings were worse than first expected and may impact the cost and startup of the long-delayed project. reut.rs/2INmLSL The utility will comment on the start-up schedule at the end of May, after it has verified all 150 weldings in the secondary circuit that conducts steam from the steam generator to the plant’s turbines.  “The ASN considers that EDF will have to extend its controls to other circuits,” the regulator said in a statement.  The ASN did not specify whether it wanted an inspection of weldings on the primary circuit - which conducts steam from the reactor vessel to the steam generator - or an inspection of all weldings on the entire nuclear plant.  The ASN said that its April 10 inspection of the weldings of Flamanville’s secondary circuit had shown that EDF and reactor builder Framatome had not adequately overseen the verification of the weldings by suppliers at the time of their installation. It said EDF had only discovered the problems with the weldings during an overall pre-launch inspection of the plant in early March.  The reactor is scheduled to load nuclear fuel in December.  Any major further delay to Flamanville’s EPR reactor - the same type EDF is building in Hinkley Point in Britain - could add hundreds of millions of euros to the budget and negatively impact EDF earnings.

2018-04-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Varo Energy cancelled its Amsterdam flotation after seeing how the U.S.-China trade dispute had roiled global markets and negatively affected other European initial public offerings, the company’s chief executive told Reuters on Wednesday.  Varo announced the cancellation on Tuesday afternoon. “After all the optimism earlier in the year, the volatility is being driven by recent discussion around the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies – the U.S. and China – leading to turbulences in the market, which have had an impact on Varo’s planned IPO,” CEO Roger Brown said in an interview.  The European downstream company has refineries and storage assets in Western Europe and is owned by oil trading giant Vitol [VITOLV.UL], U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group (CG.O) and Dutch firm Reggeborgh Invest.  Varo announced its intention to sell 30-40 percent of combined existing shares in March. Banking sources at the time said the firm could be valued at around 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion).  Brown said the investor presentations in December and February had been successful, but then the market became volatile post-ITF (intention to float).  The United States and China have been on the brink of a full-blown trade war since the Trump administration announced in early April a proposed 25 percent tariff on Chinese imports worth about $50 billion. In retaliation, China proposed tariffs on U.S. imports of equal value. But global markets have been on edge since early March, when Washington announced import tariffs on steel and aluminium that took effect on March 23. The move was widely viewed as designed to pressure Beijing to cut excess production capacity. “Looking at a number of recent IPOs that did go ahead in Amsterdam, they all listed at the bottom of their ranges and then yesterday they were trading at or below their offer prices,” he said.  Dutch bank NIBC (NIBC.AS), energy group Alfen (ALFEN.AS) and wholesaler B&S Group (BSGR.AS) were among those that were negatively impacted when they started trading in the second half of March on Amsterdam’s bourse Euronext. Elsewhere in Europe, the stock values of Deutsche Bank unit DWS (DWSG.DE) and Sweden’s Bygghema (BHGF.ST), which listed at the end of March, also suffered. Brown said the company would revisit the possibility of a float but there was no timeframe at the moment. “We’re not in a hurry to list the company ... We will continue to grow through M&A and organic investments,” Brown said.  “The IPO was not affecting the company, it was a secondary offering, shareholders were reducing their stake. It would give us further financing options going forward but there’s nothing urgent at the moment that we can’t do.” Varo has made nine acquisitions since being set up in 2012 and Brown said last month that more were coming. Varo, whose underlying earnings rose to $371 million last year from $328 million in 2016, owns two refineries in Switzerland and Germany, and storage, blending and distribution assets in those two countries, the Benelux nations and France. Meanwhile, privately held Vitol said on Tuesday that it intended to list its African venture Vivo Energy. Sources have previously also said the trader was considering a float of its Australian venture Viva Energy.

ONGC is looking for fields with a minimum 25,000 barrels per day of oil production, he said. ONGC Videsh managing director N K Verma said: “We had a good meeting with Ecuador and we will explore possibility of expanding our footprints in Ecuador. We are already present in Colombia.” Ecuadorean crude is heavy in quality, suitable for processing at complex refineries in Asia and the United States. The OPEC producer needs capital to replace oil reserves, revitalise production and overhaul refineries and terminals. But frequent contract changes have spooked big oil firms in recent years, contributing to an output decline. Separately, Perez said China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) which already has investments in Ecuador’s upstream sector is also interested in downstream projects such as a 300,000 barrels per day oil refinery. The proposed plant will be a complex refinery capable of processing crude of API 14 degrees produced at the Ishpingo, Tambococha and Tiputini (ITT) field located in a national park in the Amazon, he said.

2018-04-11,"DUBAI/NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) is in talks with several partners, including Saudi Aramco, for possible downstream joint ventures abroad, particularly in Asia, industry sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The Abu Dhabi state energy company wants to increase its crude refining capacity by 60 percent and boost petrochemical production. It plans to spend more than 400 billion dirhams ($109 billion) in the next five years, which will include boosting gas output and investing in international downstream activities, the company said in November. ADNOC wants to expand its downstream portfolio in markets where demand for oil is still growing, such as China and India, securing a new outlet for its crude. “As part of ADNOC’s further expansion of our downstream business, we are exploring a number of select international downstream opportunities, especially in growth markets. We will update the market in due course,” an ADNOC spokesman said on Wednesday, declining to comment on specific projects. One source said the opportunities ADNOC could be looking at included a refinery and petrochemical project in India, for which Aramco signed an initial agreement on Wednesday with a consortium of Indian state refiners. The source said talks were at a very early stage and no decision had been taken. It was not clear whether ADNOC would join Aramco on the same project. In March, an executive of Indian Oil Corp said ADNOC was interested in buying a stake in its planned west coast refinery. Top executives from Aramco and India’s Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals - a joint venture of Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp - signed a memorandum of understanding to take equal stakes in the project in Maharashtra state. Aramco may introduce at a later stage a strategic partner to share its 50 percent stake, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday in New Delhi. Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser declined to comment on whether Aramco had been in talks with ADNOC for a partnership in the project. The project includes a 1.2-million-barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery integrated with petrochemical facilities with a total capacity of 18 million tonnes per year. It will be one of the largest refining and petrochemical complexes in the world, built to meet fast-growing fuel and petrochemicals demand in India and elsewhere, and providing a steady outlet for Saudi crude oil.

2018-04-11,"NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - Indian oil company ONGC Videsh is looking at buying a stake in oil fields in Ecuador and may also participate in an upcoming tender for the Intercampos blocks, Ecuador’s oil minister Carlos Perez said on Wednesday. “We will be signing a confidentiality agreement with them (ONGC Videsh) in the following weeks and we will provide them with information in new blocks,” he said on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum. “They are (also) interested in partnerships with companies to take a share in the current production in certain fields over there,” Perez said. ONGC is looking for fields with a minimum 25,000 barrels per day of oil production, he said. Ecuadorean crude is heavy in quality, suitable for processing at complex refineries in Asia and the United States. The OPEC producer needs capital to replace oil reserves, revitalise production and overhaul refineries and terminals. But frequent contract changes have spooked big oil firms in recent years, contributing to an output decline. Separately, Perez said China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) which already has investments in Ecuador’s upstream sector is also interested in downstream projects such as a 300,000 barrels per day oil refinery. The proposed plant will be a complex refinery capable of processing crude of API 14 degrees produced at the Ishpingo, Tambococha and Tiputini (ITT) field located in a national park in the Amazon, he said. ONGC Videsh’s managing director NK Verma declined to comment. CNPC could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by Florence Tan and Promit Mukherjee.

2018-04-11,"* Main European shares slip, Wall Street futures lower * Russia’s rouble and Turkish lira weaken * Oil hits three-year high as unrest sparks stress * Dollar subdued after weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation * Euro near two-week high after ECB Nowotny’s policy comments By Marc Jones LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Financial markets lost ground on Wednesday as heightened tension over Syria and U.S. sanctions drove Russia’s rouble to a two-year low and boosted safety plays at the expense of the dollar. Many of the world’s main stock markets were back in the red after two days of gains. Gold rose for a fourth session, though it was the hammering of Russia’s and also Turkey’s currencies that drew most attention. The rouble slumped as much as 2.5 percent against the dollar and even more versus the euro. Turkey’s lira tumbled to a record low, maintaining its position as one of the world’s worst performers this year. The fallout from new U.S. sanctions on Moscow continued to rattle investors and fears of military action were stoked after one of Russia’s ambassadors reiterated it would shoot down any U.S. missiles fired at Syria. “Get ready Russia,  because they will be coming,” U.S. President Donald Trump then tweeted in his opening flurry of the day. “You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” The World Health Organization said that 43 people had died in Saturday’s attack on Douma from “symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals”, and more than 500 in all had been treated. Some airlines were re-routing flights after Europe’s air traffic control agency warned aircraft flying over the eastern Mediterranean to exercise caution because of possible air strikes against Syria. “We are more neutral today (in terms of risk asset allocation) than we have been at any time over the last two years,” NN Investments Chief Investment Officer Valentijn van Niewenhuijzen said. “For now we are mainly focusing on lowering exposure in Russia and having a more cautious stance from a tactical perspective overall on asset allocation.” The dollar remained near two-week lows as trade war worries with China and domestic scandals also swirled around Trump. Markets were also digesting the first fall in U.S. inflation in 10 months, which will feed into the debate on when the Federal Reserve next raises U.S. interest rates . The dollar index versus a basket of six major peers was down 0.1 percent at 89.472 and within sight of a low of 89.251 set on March 28. Government bonds meanwhile made gains, with European and U.S. yields around the 0.50 and 2.80 percent marks. Any major Cold War style conflict or a full-blown trade battle or would hit the world economy and upset the plans of major central banks to tighten policy - fuelling demand for government bonds. However, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump had both struck conciliatory tones on Tuesday, boosting hopes the door to trade negotiations might open. But one report said early talks had already broken down. “The risk of a full-blown trade war ... poses the most serious risk to continued strong global momentum,” Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said. He said he doubted there would be a major further escalation at this point. Wall Street also looked set for a softer start later with S&P mini futures down 0.7 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 0.8 percent, while in Asia overnight Japan’s Nikkei and Australian stocks both lost 0.4 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI dipped 0.2 percent though China did end higher. Shanghai shares fared better after China’s central bank set out the clearest timetable yet for opening financial services to foreign investors. It will allow offshore companies to enter its trust, financial leasing, auto finance and consumer finance sectors by the end of this year. China watchers said the announcement may further ease trade tensions. But they remained cautious, noting that action had yet to be taken and pointing out that foreign companies still face unofficial barriers in sectors ostensibly already opened up. Back among the major currencies, the yen and euro were both a shade higher at 107 yen and $1.2365 respectively. It was the common currency’s fourth session of gains and it stayed close to two-week high of $1.2378 it had reached overnight after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters it could get rate hikes rolling once its 2.55 trillion-euro bond-buying programme ends this year. The euro has risen about 3 percent this year on expectations the ECB will eventually normalise monetary policy and raise interest rates. “We anticipate further, gradual euro appreciation versus the dollar over the course of 2018,” ANZ’s head of global economics, Brian Martin, wrote. The day’s other eye-catching moves came in commodity markets. Safe-haven gold touched a one-week high of $1,342.64 an ounce. Oil hit its highest in more than three years with Brent crude jumping to a high of nearly $72 a barrel and U.S. crude futures rising 83 cents from their last close to $66.34 a barrel. Syria is not a significant oil producer, but any sign of conflict in the region tends to trigger concern about disruption to crude flows across the wider Middle East, home to some of the world’s biggest producers. There are also concerns that the United States could renew sanctions against Iran, an ally of Syria. “The focus right now is definitely on a possible military strike against Syria,” Commerzbank head of commodity research Eugen Weinberg said.

2018-04-11,"* Long-delayed French offshore wind deals now look expensive * Government wants to renegotiate or cancel wind projects * Industry is up in arms, says will scare foreign investors PARIS, April 11 (Reuters) - The French government will decide on the future of its planned offshore wind parks in the coming days, renewable energy lobby SER said in a statement. Last month, the French senate rejected a government proposal to renegotiate and possibly cancel projects to generate a combined 3,000 megawatts of offshore wind power on six sites on France’s west coast awarded in 2012 and 2014. The government is still looking at ways to reduce the cost of the projects, which have been delayed for years by local resistance and whose prices are now out of line with the market. SER said it expected prime minister Edouard Philippe to decide on the offshore contracts “in a few days”. The prime minister’s office and the environment ministry declined to comment. France awarded tenders in 2012 for a combined offshore capacity of 2,000 MW, representing investment of about 7 billion euros, to two consortia, one led by EDF and one by Spanish utility Iberdrola. It was followed in 2014 by a tender for 1,000 MW, worth some 4 billion euros, won by Engie. Both tenders were awarded with contracts to sell power at around 200 euros per MW for 20 years. But since then, prices for offshore wind power have more than halved and French energy regulator CRE has criticised the high cost of the planned subsidies, which it has estimated at at total of 40.7 billion euros.

Suhail al-Mazroui also told Reuters on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in India that the agreement may not include a provision on cutting or increasing oil output. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014.

The talks have raised the prospect that producers could extend tangible actions to prop up oil prices through supply cuts - or moderate them by pumping more - beyond this year’s expiry of the supply cut agreement. But the minister, asked if the agreement would have such a provision, said it was not yet clear. “No, we need to wait until we agree with everyone what is going to be the charter,” he said. “What form, what shape, we’re not ready to discuss that now.” The minister reiterated that producers aimed to draft the agreement by the end of this year, adding that it wasn’t a target to do this at the next OPEC meeting in June. “I don’t think June is the target. Before the end of the year that’s my hope.” The OPEC-led deal has reduced excess supply and helped boost prices to above $70 a barrel, the highest since 2014. But Mazroui echoed other ministers, such as his Saudi counterpart, in saying investment in new supplies was too low. “We will know what will be the good price when the market is balanced and we have enough investments,” he said. “We need to have more investments coming.” (Editing by Adrian Croft)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-ief-emirates/rpt-interview-uae-says-producers-trying-to-define-structure-for-long-term-alliance-idUKL8N1RO471,11 Apr 2018,"OPEC oil producers and their

2018-04-11,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday played down the possibility of forcing carmakers to make expensive modifications to diesel car exhaust systems, as her new government tries to avoid driving bans in cities with air quality problems. The German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. exhaust tests.  Tackling the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions - known to cause respiratory disease - is one of the most pressing policies facing Merkel’s new coalition between her conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD).   After a cabinet retreat outside Berlin, Merkel made clear she had reservations about carmakers being made to introduce hardware modifications, such as changing filters in exhaust systems. “The benefits and costs must be proportionate. Hardware refits are relatively cost-intensive,” said Merkel. She reiterated she would do everything possible to avoid bans and that she believed in 2-3 years only about 10 cities would have excess levels of NOx, compared with about 70 cities originally. The issue came to a head in February when a court allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel vehicles.  Experts say bans could cut the resale value of up to 15 million diesel vehicles in Europe’s biggest car market. Merkel’s government has been criticized for having cosy ties with the auto industry due to its importance for jobs and exports. France and Britain have said they will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040. Sales of new diesel-powered cars in Germany plunged by a quarter in March, according to the KBA automotive watchdog.  So far, Germany has committed to software upgrades for some 5.3 million diesel cars by the end of the year to reduce emissions by up to 30 percent.  With demand for electric cars growing only slowly, Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer has released the first 20 million euros of 175 million euros ($217 million) in subsidies to fund the purchase of electric vehicles for public infrastructure agencies.  However, critics say all this is too little. Juergen Resch, head of the DUH environmental group, criticized Merkel and her cabinet for being “remotely controlled” by the auto industry.   Merkel, and Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, stressed the auto industry was of crucial importance to Germany. “We want it to be modern and future oriented,” said Merkel. “We also have clear exceptions of the car industry that has clearly made serious mistakes. The customer or taxpayer cannot be made accountable for that. It must be mainly dealt with by the auto industry,” she said. She added there were no plans for a summit with carmakers and that the new government was not keen on pursuing “blue badges” to indicate how clean a car is, seen by critics as a form of driving restriction. “Our focus will rather be on individual measures that spare citizens,” she said. The fallout of the diesel scandal, which has also hit Daimler and BMW, is still evident with VW poised for a management shakeup which will include the departure of Chief Executive Matthias Mueller, say sources.

2018-04-11,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - XPO Logistics Inc unveiled software on Wednesday that allows merchants to track truck and rail cargo in real-time nationwide, technology the third-largest publicly traded U.S. logistics firm hopes will help reduce bottlenecks at its warehouses. The XPO Connect software, first reported by Reuters, is part of a digital renaissance underway in the old-school trucking industry. New technologies have effectively turned semi trucks into locator beacons for shippers who want up-the-minute intelligence on their freight. The XPO online portal lets customers shop around for capacity and track their shipment in real-time, with algorithms capturing disruptions like weather delays and traffic, XPO Chief Information Officer Mario Harik told Reuters ahead of the launch. Greenwich, Connecticut-based XPO is the largest provider of “final-mile” deliveries of heavy goods like Home Depot barbecue grills and Best Buy televisions from warehouses direct to homes in North America. It is the second-largest less-than-truckload operator - truckers that consolidate multiple loads on a single truck. “We wanted to provide visibility across all of our transportation modes backed by data analytics,” Harik said.  About 50 merchants and 500 carriers were testing XPO Connect, Harik said. He declined to name specific customers or say how much money it cost to develop. The software shows XPO’s capacity, not the overall freight market. During one of the tightest freight markets in years, XPO Connect has given shippers an experience similar to a commuter using Uber’s [UBER.UL] app to see available cars, book a ride, and send friends an estimated arrival time down to the minute. Companies like Bain Capital-backed FourKites and Onfleet have already launched similar platforms.  Tracking helps shippers manage capacity fluctuations and reduce warehouse logjams when volumes spike during peak shipping periods, such as the days leading up to Christmas.  Data reliability has improved over the last 10 years, fueled by GPS and beacon technology, said Priya Rajagopalan, Chief Product Officer at FourKites, whose customers include hundreds of truckers and shippers like Schneider National Inc and Kraft Heinz Foods Co [HJHC.UL].  Trucks have become easier to trace due to a new federal regulation requiring truck drivers to record hours on the road using Electronic Logging Devices, some of which are GPS-compatible. “The expectation that we as consumers have a very clear line of sight into exactly when anything we order will arrive, that level of visibility has set the expectation with freight customers,” Rajagopalan said.

2018-04-11,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia should look at U.S. goods or goods produced in Russia by U.S. companies when considering a possible response to new sanctions imposed on Moscow by Washington, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday.  The U.S. sanctions, announced on April 6, target officials and business people around President Vladimir Putin in an aggressive response to alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The sanctions have triggered steep falls in the rouble and some Russian stocks. Speaking before Russia’s lower house of parliament, Medvedev said the new sanctions were an attempt to capture global markets for U.S. companies.      “There are quite a lot of products ... in our markets that we get from the USA,” he said. It’s not just securities... but a whole range of other products which are supplied to our market and produced by American business on the territory of our country.” “Measures in response should be well thought-out, not inflict harm to ourselves, and be appropriate. I do not rule out that... we will have to weigh all aspects of our cooperation with the United States,” Medvedev said. Russia imported $12.5 billion worth of U.S. products in 2017, according to official Russian customs data. That included aircraft, machinery, pharmaceutical and chemical products.   Western companies, including Ford Motor Co, PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola HBC, have also invested billions of dollars since the fall of the Soviet Union to set up local production in Russia. In 2014, Russia banned a wide range of food imports from the Western countries in retaliation for international sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine. No restrictions have ever been applied to goods produced by foreign companies in Russia. However, Russian state regulator hit U.S. fast-food chain McDonald’s Corp. with a string of snap inspections in 2015, prompting it to temporarily shut many of its restaurants, which was widely seen as retaliation for the sanctions.

2018-04-11,"(Adds details) By Sudarshan Varadhan NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp expects to restart production from its Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) project at the start of May after it was shut following an earthquake in February, ExxonMobil LNG Vice President Emma Cochrane said on Wednesday. The $19 billion LNG facility, opened in 2014 in a remote location in one of Asia’s poorest and most politically troubled countries, has been closed since the powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake. The project is considered one of the world’s best-performing LNG operations, despite the challenge of drilling for gas and building a plant and pipeline in the remote Papua New Guinea jungle. Australia’s Oil Search and Santos are Exxon’s main partners in the project. The LNG export terminal may not be able to produce at full capacity at first and will likely ramp up gradually, Cochrane said on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum. “We are hopeful that we will be able to start in the beginning of May. We are actually ahead of schedule,” Cochrane told Reuters. ExxonMobil has said there has not been any indication that the 700 km (435 mile) pipeline that delivers gas to its coastal LNG plant had been damaged by the quake, which flattened villages, killed dozens of people and spoilt water sources. Cochrane also said the company has recertified the reserves in its P’nyang field in Papua New Guinea, and the reserves are higher than it previously thought. “That gives us the potential to expand the facilities in the P’nyang field for the PNG LNG foundation project,” she said. Exxon is likely to take a final investment decision this year on expanding its Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas - a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, Cochrane said. The company intends to expand its facility in Qatar, but “they have still not made a decision on partnering,” Cochrane said. “We very much hope that Exxon Mobil will be a part of that story. But Qatar Petroleum is still considered their partnership choices.” (Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Adrian Croft)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-ief-exxon-mobil/update-1-exxon-expects-papua-new-guinea-lng-project-to-restart-in-may-idUKL3N1RO4CF,11 Apr 2018,"ExxonMobil Corp

2018-04-11,"* Sinopec’s 460,000-bpd Zhenhai refinery plans full shutdown through May * Four independent plants starting planned maintenance * Zhenhai shutdown coincides with Sinopec’s plan to slash May Saudi oil loading (Adds shutdowns at independents, quote) By Chen Aizhu and Meng Meng BEIJING, April 11 (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp will shut down its largest refinery for maintenance throughout May, and at least four independent oil plants have started overhauls this month, curbing China’s crude oil demand. The news comes after Sinopec, China’s largest state refiner, announced big cuts in its Saudi oil imports. Sinopec’s 460,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) Zhenhai Refining and Chemical Company will be shut down from May 1 for 40-day maintenance, in a major overhaul planned once every four years, an industry source briefed on the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. The overhaul at Zhenhai, one of the country’s largest processors of Saudi crude oil, coincides with Sinopec’s decision on Tuesday to slash crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia during the month. Four independent refineries with total processing capacity of 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) - Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical Group Co, Tianhong Chemical, Zhonghai Fine Chemicals and Rizhao Lanqiao Port Chemicals - are currently being shut down, according to Ding Xu, an analyst with Zibo Longzhong Information Group. “Independent plants are battling with lower margins as crude oil prices went up, dampening demand for crude and leading to more maintenance plans,” said Ding. A survey by Longzhong showed the utilisation ratio at 42 independent plants fell to 65 percent this week versus 67 percent in early January, Ding added. A new tax rule that came into effect in March aimed at curbing alleged tax evasions by independents also limited smaller refiners’ appetite for crude, leading to brimming tanks and cargo congestion at Shandong ports late last month. An official with Sinopec’s trading arm Unipec said on Tuesday the refiner planned to cut Saudi crude oil imports loading in May by 40 percent after Saudi Aramco set higher-than-expected official selling prices. One of the reasons cited by a separate company official on Tuesday for the deep cuts was planned refinery maintenances. The official did not elaborate. The Zhenhai plant will also shut down its 1.1 million tonnes-per-year ethylene complex during the same period for overhaul, said the source familiar with the repair works. Sinopec media relation officials were not immediately available for comment.

2018-04-11,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam wants to give its coast guard more flexibility to open fire at sea, amid tension in the busy South China Sea waterway, a draft law released on Wednesday showed. The law, expected to be voted by lawmakers at the end of this year, would allow greater assertiveness in disputed waters by the coast guard, now armed with modern U.S. and Japanese patrol boats, in a policy likely to alarm neighbouring China. China claims almost all the South China Sea, through which about $3 trillion worth of sea-borne trade passes every year. Vietnam and four other countries also say they have rights in the sea, believed to have rich deposits of oil and gas. Vietnam’s coast guard could open fire to “protect sovereignty and sovereign rights in defence and security situations,” said the draft, released on the website of the law making body, the National Assembly.  The coast guard could open fire to warn ships operating illegally in Vietnam’s waters if they did not heed its request to halt illegal activities, it added. Vietnam now allows coast guard officials to open fire only if their lives and safety are threatened, or in the pursuit of offenders and ships at sea who might otherwise escape, or to protect citizens whose lives are at risk. The United States has given Vietnam 12 patrol boats to strengthen the Southeast Asian’s nation maritime surveillance and protection capability. Japan has provided six used patrol boats and promised six new ones. Vietnam is the country most openly at odds over parts of the disputed South China Sea with China, its biggest trade partner with which it has traditional ties through the Communist parties  ruling both single-party countries.  Just last month Vietnam halted an oil drilling project off its southeastern coast by Spanish energy firm Repsol, following pressure from China.

2018-04-11,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Devika  Krishna Kumar NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - The volume of oil sitting in 300 steel tanks in a nine-square-mile radius in Cushing, Oklahoma has long been a key barometer for the health of U.S. crude supply and the nation’s benchmark for daily trading of billions of dollars in the commodity. But those tanks could soon drain to levels near effectively empty, even as U.S. oil production soars past a new record of 10.4 million barrels per day. Oil supplies have fallen before in Cushing for a variety of seasonal or market-driven reasons. But this time, there is no shortage of crude in the market. In fact, U.S. production is straining pipeline and storage capacity. The declining volumes stored at Cushing reflects a more permanent shift, underscoring the hub’s waning influence as the primary measuring stick for the U.S. oil market and the leading barometer of future supply, demand and prices. (For a graphic of falling oil inventories at Cushing, see: tmsnrt.rs/2GRh5GR ) Companies are now spending millions of dollars building infrastructure to facilitate trading and storage elsewhere, such as in Houston and other Gulf Coast ports. That could pave the way for a change in the U.S. benchmark oil price, used to value tens of billions of dollars of crude and futures contracts every day. The current benchmark - called West Texas Intermediate crude, or “WTI” - has been derived from the price of physical oil delivered to Cushing for more than three decades. Traders and major global crude buyers have advocated replacing WTI with a new benchmark futures contract that would reflect the value of crude delivered to the Gulf Coast. The price of oil in Cushing - which bills itself as “the pipeline crossroads of the world” - is used to value crude grades produced around the United States and some oil imported from Canada, Mexico, and South America. Prices at the hub also provide the basis for an average of 1.3 million WTI futures contracts CL-TOT - worth about $82 billion at current prices - that change hands on the CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange every day, making it one of the world’s most actively traded commodities. But as more pipelines are built to take oil from U.S. shale fields to Gulf refineries or for export markets, much of the crude produced in the giant Permian Basin oilfield in Texas and elsewhere no longer passes through Cushing. Instead, producers are increasingly shipping directly to seaports such as Houston, where vessels carry the oil to dozens of countries worldwide. That reflects a major transformation in global crude flows since the United States lifted a four-decade ban on oil exports in late 2015. Some traders and buyers argue the benchmark needs to change to reflect this. Joshua Wade, a crude oil marketer in Oklahoma, sees the benchmark delivery point moving south before long. “That’s the direction it’s moving,” he said. “As opposed to importing, now you’re exporting through the same infrastructure ... The oil capital of the nation is in Houston.” Inventories in Cushing fell to 28.2 million barrels in early March, lowest in more than three years. Analysts say a level of 20 million barrels is effectively empty. That’s because tank design necessitates a minimum volume of crude be kept on hand to maintain the physical integrity of the complex and to allow for blending different crude grades to comply with pipeline specifications. “There has been a major structural shift in crude flows within the U.S.,” said John Coleman, senior research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “I think Cushing is rapidly losing its relevance.” A CENTURY-OLD WAY STATION Cushing got its distinction in the early 1920s when tanks sprung up to store oil en route from Oklahoma and Texas to major metropolitan areas and refineries in the Midwest. In 1983, it became the delivery point for the newly-launched WTI futures contract. Because the U.S. relied on imports - and banned exports - Cushing was key for traders to gauge domestic supply trends. BP’s former head of crude trading, Donald Porteous, earned the nickname “the King of Cushing” because of his deep understanding of supply logistics in the Oklahoma town - a strategy that often earned him more money than BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley. Porteous, now retired, declined to comment for this story. Now, new pipeline projects head straight from west Texas to the Gulf of Mexico, a route well south of Cushing. Lately, Permian Basin prices have declined because pipelines can’t be built fast enough to get crude to the Gulf, even as pipeline firms have added about 600,000 bpd in capacity since late last year, according to data compiled by Reuters. “We’re trying to make sure we’re ahead of the pinch points for producers to bring product to refiners or to export,” Greg Armstrong, chief executive of Plains All American, said at a recent industry conference. Projects in the works could boost outgoing pipeline capacity from the Permian from 2.7 million bpd in March to more than 4.5 million bpd by the end of 2019, according to energy industry information provider Genscape. Meanwhile, the Dakota Access pipeline started shipping oil last year, running out of North Dakota’s Bakken shale region to the Gulf - bypassing Cushing. And Marathon Petroleum is considering reversing its Capline crude line to bring barrels from Illinois to the Gulf. For now, traders watch the price differential between WTI and London-based Brent crude to determine where to ferry shipments globally. But traders say the price of physical trades in Houston is growing more important as a barometer for shippers. Earlier this year, even as the WTI crude discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 narrowed, Houston’s discount to Brent remained steady at about $1.60 a barrel, analysts said, helping buoy export demand. As pipeline capacity to the Gulf has increased, and storage has expanded, demand to park barrels in Cushing has waned, said Carlin Conner, chief executive at SemGroup Corp, which operates about 7.6 million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing. A spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners, which owns about 12 million barrels of Cushing storage, said it will remain important because of its connections to the Gulf and Midwest. Cushing is also connected via pipeline to the Gulf, 500 miles to the south, and can offer cheaper storage than what’s available on the coast, said SemGroup’s Conner. “I believe Cushing’s next chapter,” he said, “is that it’s going to become an offsite Gulf Coast storage center.” Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York

This was despite forecasts of rising oil output from non-OPEC producers, led by the United States, which is expected to be able to meet two-third of global oil demand growth over the next five years, he said. The “growth in the United States alone is not enough to make me feel comfortable that there will be enough production in the future because of two reasons,” Birol said on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum. First, global oil consumption is still growing strongly, gaining 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, driven by petrochemical, industrial and aviation demand, he said. Second, some older, maturing fields are in decline. “Every year we’re losing (the equivalent of) North Sea production, which is 3 million barrels per day,” he said. Investments in oil and gas exploration remain low, Birol also said, even though global oil prices have returned to 2014 levels. “Our expectation for 2018 investment is only 40 percent of what we’ve seen in 2014 before prices collapsed,” Birol said. While efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output has helped drain excess global supplies, the industry remains wary that growing U.S. shale oil production could cap price gains. Another big worry was the halving of Venezuelan oil production since former President Hugo Chavez took office in 1999, Birol said. “We are very worried about Venezuela. As of today, Venezuela’s crude production is half of that when Mr Chavez took office at the end of 1999,” he said. The drop is one of the largest in the “history of oil”, Birol said, adding that the country’s production is expected to decline even further, although it was hard to tell how deep the cuts would go. At the IEF, India’s Energy Minister Dharmendra Pradhan called for “reasonable” oil prices after Brent rose above $71 to hit its highest since late 2014 on Tuesday. India is the world’s third largest oil importer. Birol said: “It’s important for the global economy that we don’t see a price spike. Last year we have seen a very strong, spectacular growth in the gas markets, but this is mainly a result of gas prices being on the low side.” Oil and gas producers should be wary of price spikes because it will lead buyers to find alternatives such as coal and renewables, Birol said.

The move comes as China aims to increase the availability of cleaner fuels and give factories that use the fuel a chance to lock in prices ahead of the winter heating season as the government aims to wean the nation off coal to reduce air pollution. Natural gas shortages this winter caused chaos, cutting off supplies to industrial users and causing big spikes in prices. The pre-sale of the cargoes will be held on the exchange on April 18 for delivery in July and November, the exchange said. An official at CNOOC familiar with the plan said it is the first time the company has agreed to do a forward sale of LNG on the exchange. The cargoes will be delivered from the Ningbo terminal in Zhejiang province, the exchange said. Trading volumes on the Shanghai exchange, which was launched in early 2015 were pretty thin in the first two years, but they picked up late last year ahead of the severe gas crunch this past winter.

Many of Europe and Asia’s stock markets were back in the red after two days of gains, gold was up for a fourth session, though it was the hammering of Russia’s and also Turkey’s currencies that drew most attention. The rouble slumped as much as 2.3 percent against the dollar and almost as much versus the euro, while Turkey’s lira tumbled to a record low to cement its record as one of the world’s worst performers this year. The fallout from biting new U.S. sanctions on Moscow continued to rattle investors and fears of military action were stoked again after one of Russia’s ambassadors reiterated it would shoot down any U.S. missiles fired at Syria. Pan-European air traffic control agency Eurocontrol had warned airlines on Tuesday to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria in next 72 hours. “We are more neutral today (in terms of risk asset allocation) than we have been at any time over the last two years,” NN Investments Chief Investment Officier Valentijn van Niewenhuijzen said. “For now we are mainly focusing on lowering exposure in Russia and having a more cautious stance from a tactical perspective overall on asset allocation.” The dollar languished near two-week lows as the trade war worries and domestic scandals swirling around U.S. President Donald Trump lingered. Markets were also awaiting U.S. inflation data due later that will feed the debate on when the Federal Reserve next raises U.S. interest rates. The dollar index versus a basket of six major peers was down 0.1 percent at 89.472 and within sight of a low of 89.251 set on March 28. Government bonds meanwhile made gains, with European and U.S. yields around the 0.50 and 2.80 percent marks. Any full-blown trade battle would hit the world economy and upset the plans of major central banks to tighten policy - fuelling demand for government bonds. However, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump had both struck conciliatory tones on Tuesday, boosting hopes the door to trade negotiations might open. But one report said early talks had already broken down. “The risk of a full-blown trade war ... poses the most serious risk to continued strong global momentum,” Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said. He said he doubted there would be a major further escalation at this point. Wall Street also looked set for a softer start later with S&P mini futures down 0.5 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 0.3 percent, while in Asia overnight Japan’s Nikkei and Australian stocks both lost 0.4 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI dipped 0.2 percent though China did end higher. Asian shares had fared better after China’s central bank set out the clearest timetable yet for opening the financial services sector to foreign investors. It will allow offshore firms to enter its trust, financial leasing, auto finance and consumer finance sectors by the end of this year. China watchers said the announcement may further ease trade tensions. But they remained cautious, noting that action had yet to be taken and pointing out that foreign companies still face unofficial barriers in sectors ostensibly already opened up. Back among the major currencies, the yen and euro were both a shade higher at 107 yen and $1.2365 respectively. It was the common currency’s fourth session of gains and it stayed close to two-week high of $1.2378 it had scaled overnight after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters it could get rate hikes rolling once its 2.55-trillion euro bond buying programme ends this year. The euro has risen about 3 percent this year on expectations that the ECB would eventually normalise monetary policy and hike interest rates. “We anticipate further, gradual euro appreciation versus the dollar over the course of 2018,” ANZ’s head of global economics Brian Martin wrote. Oil prices slipped meanwhile following the previous day’s sharp rally, although losses were limited as the commodity markets eyed an escalation of Middle East tensions. U.S. crude futures were down 0.3 percent at $65.32 a barrel after surging more than 3 percent on Tuesday on the back of the surge in risk appetite in the broader markets. Brent lost 0.45 percent to $70.73 a barrel after jumping 3.5 percent on Tuesday, when it rose to $71.34, highest since December 2014.

2018-04-11,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A gas pipeline planned to run from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea cannot go ahead without clarity on Ukraine’s role as a transit route for gas, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday, appearing to harden her stance on the scheme.   The project, Nord Stream 2, would double the existing Nord Stream pipeline’s annual capacity of 55 billion cubic metres. Eastern European and Baltic states fear the pipeline could increase reliance on Russian gas and undermine Ukraine’s role as a gas transit route, which provides valuable revenues to a country hit by a conflict with pro-Russian separatists.  According to energy firm Naftogaz expectations, Ukraine will earn around $3 billion in 2018 from transit. Germany, along with other potential beneficiaries of increased supplies in northern Europe, has so far backed the project. “I made very clear that a Nord Stream 2 project is not possible without clarity on the future transit role of Ukraine,” Merkel told a joint news conference in Berlin with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. “So you can see that it is not just an economic issue but there are also political considerations,” she added.  Merkel said she had also discussed the project on the telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. “I also said to President Putin yesterday: it cannot be that through Nord Stream 2, Ukraine has no further importance regarding the transit of gas,” she said. The Ost-Ausschuss, which represents German business interests in Russia, issued a statement after Poroshenko’s visit stressing the importance of the project. Russian gas giant Gazprom’s western partners for the project include Uniper, Wintershall, Shell, OMV and Engie. Nord Steam 2 will respond to growing demand from western Europe by bringing additional gas from northern Siberia via a shorter route and so keeping costs down, the Ausschuss said.  The firms involved have already invested more than 4 billion euros ($5 billion) in the project.  “To change the legal basis with hindsight for political reasons would hurt confidence in legal certainty,” said the Ausschuss.  A spokesman said it was clear Ukraine would remain a transit country for gas.

2018-04-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global shipping fuel costs are likely to rise by a quarter, or $24 billion, in 2020 when new rules limiting sulfur kick in, consultants Wood Mackenzie said on Wednesday.  The ballooning costs will come as the change in regulations forces a portion of the world’s fleet to switch to lower sulfur, but higher cost, fuels such as marine gasoil (MGO) and ultra low sulfur fuel oil.  The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) rules targeting air pollution will cut the maximum amount of sulfur emissions that ships worldwide can burn to 0.5 percent of fuel content by 2020, from 3.5 percent currently.   Ships that install “scrubbers” can continue to burn cheaper high sulfur fuel oil, but the bulk will not install these in time for the shift in 2020.        “Switching to MGO is a more costly solution, and in full compliance, would probably see freight rates increase, perhaps by around $1 a barrel,” said Wood Mackenzie senior research analyst Iain Mowat.  Wood Mackenzie said its “base case” for cost increases is $24 billion in 2020, compared with a total global shipping fuel bill of roughly $100 billion today. However, if no vessels added scrubbers and all ships complied with the rules, the spike could be as high as $60 billion.  The rule change marks a seismic shift for the shipping and refining sectors. The IMO is meeting in London this week to hash out further details on how it will implement the rules and ensure compliance.  Mowat said that while shippers could expect a 20-50 percent return on investment cost for installing scrubbers, the penetration rate for them would be limited by factors including limited access to finance, scrubber manufacturing capacity and dry-dock space. Wood Mackenzie estimates just 2 percent of the global fleet will have scrubbers by 2020.  As a result, Wood Mackenzie said the world’s refiners need to gear up to churn out the lower sulfur fuels that vessels will need, and even the primary spots for refueling ships could shift based on where lower sulfur fuels are available.  “Singapore, for example, could potentially lose some of its market share for bunker fuels to China as shippers look for alternative locations with a surplus of compliant fuels,” Mowat said. “China, with ample MGO supply, is well positioned to attract shippers.” Reporting By Libby George; Editing by Susan Fenton",https://uk.reuters.com/article/shipping-fuel-costs/shipping-fuel-costs-to-spike-25-pct-in-2020-on-sulphur-cap-woodmac-idUKL8N1RN605,11 Apr 2018,"Global shipping fuel costs are

2018-04-11,"BANGKOK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Thai energy companies are on a roll. The national oil and gas champion, a coal miner and power utility, upstart solar and wind companies, virtually all are expanding across Southeast Asia, applying practices and technology developed at home.  Thailand is reaping the benefits of two decades of government energy policies that have supported the sector. Companies are also profiting from oil and gas prices that are recovering from a three-year slump, increasing electricity demand due to economic growth, and renewable technologies that have become competitive against fossil fuels.  Also, while the military junta that has ruled Thailand since mid-2014 has put no stamp of its own on the energy sector, it has targeted infrastructure spending to boost the economy and prioritised investment in hi-tech industries.  Long-standing reform policies have turned Thailand’s state energy company PTT (PTT.BK) into a successful international oil and gas producer, encouraged the development of power producers such as Electricity Generating (EGCO.BK), and fostered the emergence of renewable start-ups like Energy Absolute (EA.BK).  “The power businesses in Thailand have developed expertise in this sector, and are now well placed to support energy development across the region,” said Robert Grant, Asia Pacific head at Canadian-listed SNC-Lavalin (SNC.TO), an engineering and construction firm focused on energy, infrastructure and mining.  The 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) together have a population of more than 600 million people, with a collective gross domestic product (GDP) of nearly $3 trillion, according to research company Statista.  ASEAN’s energy use rose by 60 percent in the last 15 years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which also says the region’s demand could grow another two-thirds by 2040.  Companies aiming to take part in the growth in ASEAN and beyond include B.Grimm Power (BGRIM.BK), a Thai power developer that already has assets in Vietnam and Laos, and Banpu Power (BPP.BK), which is building a coal-fired plant in China.  “You can already see increased activity by Thai investors in the ASEAN region,” Grant said.  The expansion has been reflected in the local stock exchange, with shares of energy companies .SETEN growing nearly 75 percent since the start of 2016, against a broader market .SETI gain of less than half that.  It’s also sparked a rash of listings, with Thai power companies having raised more than $2 billion from initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2016 and 2017.  Thailand’s third-biggest generator, Gulf Energy (GULF.BK), in December held the biggest listing the country has seen in a decade, at more than $700 million.  Gulf has said it expects revenue to grow by 18 percent this year, fuelled in part by a major solar investment in Vietnam. The IPO funds will be used to repay loans and finance new regional power plants, it says.  GRAPHIC: Thai energy company stock market performance - reut.rs/2ILuH71 Government policy “created an ecosystem for growth for Thai energy companies,” said Maria Lapiz, head of institutional research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, with the first reforms coming in the 1990s.  That’s when the government began allowing small power generators (1-90 megawatts) to sell to the national grid. Thailand was also an earlier adopter of natural gas, which now generates about 60 percent of its electricity.  In 2012, Thailand was one of Asia’s first countries to introduce “feed-in” tariffs to give solar developers additional payments on top of normal prices when selling electricity to utilities, channelling investment into the sector.  Similar tariffs have been applied to other renewable power sources, including wind, small-scale hydro, biomass and biogas.  The privatisation of PTT was another big boost to the energy sector. The government now holds a 51 percent stake in PTT, which operates as a private company with less political interference than state rivals like Malaysia’s Petronas [PETR.UL] and Indonesia’s Pertamina [PERTM.UL], both of which remain under full government control.  “PTT was privatised in 2001, which helped drive growth in the energy sector from E&P to refiners and helped in the development of the Thai capital market,” said Lapiz.  The growth trend is clearest in renewables, where Thailand is the first Southeast Asia nation to crack the top 15 solar power generators, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).  GRAPHIC: Top 15 solar power producers by installed capacity (2016) - reut.rs/2IK1Z6a “Thailand started development in renewable power much earlier than regional peers,” said Thidasiri Srisamith, Chief Investment Officer of Kasikorn Asset Management.  Thanks to the early start and good relationships with neighbouring governments, Thailand is “a leader in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, and will continue to expand into these countries,” she said.  Thailand’s largest solar company, Superblock (SUPER.BK), plans to branch out with a $1.8 billion investment into wind farms in Vietnam.  And Thailand’s biggest wind power generator, Wind Energy Holdings, plans to invest in solar, hydro and biomass to back up its capacity, not just locally but also in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Australia.  Even in coal, a sector recently shunned due to public pressure to invest in cleaner energy, Thai firms are growing. Miner Banpu (BANPU.BK) in February reported a more than 250 percent surge in annual profit, partly because of new coal mine investments, including in Indonesia, and power projects in China and Japan.   In oil and gas, PTT - long the global carrier of the Thai exploration and production flag - is developing new assets in the region for the first time in years, with around $4.5 billion in cash on hand to invest at home and overseas.  Not all indicators point to an ongoing boom. Local consumption is stalling due to low population growth and improvements in energy efficiency, while domestic capacity is sufficient to meet basic requirements.  “Going forward, Thai power company growth will depend on the ability to secure capacity and have a steady stream of projects ... which (are) increasingly coming from overseas,” said Kasikorn’s Thidasiri.

2018-04-11,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said on Wednesday that the world’s biggest exporter of oil will not sit by and let another supply glut surface, but also does not want oil prices to rise to “unreasonable levels”. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are seeking a close balance between supply and demand, Khalid al-Falih said, speaking on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, a gathering of oil producers and consumers in New Delhi. Falih also told reporters he was happy with the current state of the oil market.  OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014. They have extended the pact until the end of 2018. “I think a lot of the glut has been cleared,” said Falih. Asked if he was happy with the current market, he replied, “Yes, I am.” Brent crude LCOc1 was trading above $70 (£49.2) a barrel on Wednesday, though easing away from the 2014 highs it matched in the previous session, as escalating Middle East tensions were offset by increasing inventories and production in the United States. OPEC and its partners meet to decide oil policy in June and next week a ministerial panel gathers to review the market. The remarks from Falih suggest big changes in the supply cut agreement look unlikely for now.  Asked if India, a major consumer, would be happy with oil at $80 a barrel, Falih said no specific price was aimed for, and he was concerned about declining output in some producing countries and a lack of investment in new supplies. “There is no such thing as a target price by Saudi Arabia,” he said. “We’re seeing many regions declining. The only way to offset this is for the financial markets to start financing and funding upstream projects.” “I don’t know what is the price that will provide that equilibrium. All we know is in 2018 we’re still not seeing that.” Additional reporting by Florence Tan; Editing by Tom Hogue and Kenneth Maxwell",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-ief-saudi/update-1-saudi-arabia-happy-with-oil-market-wont-let-another-glut-form-idUKL3N1RO31Y,11 Apr 2018,"* Says there is no such thing as a Saudi target price for

2018-04-11,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Concentrations of hazardous ground-level ozone have worsened in northern China despite country-wide efforts to tackle air pollution, according to a study published by Peking University on Tuesday. Stringent winter restrictions on industry, transportation and coal consumption enabled smog-prone northern Chinese regions to meet politically crucial air quality targets for the 2013-2017 period.   But while concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 fell, average daytime ozone levels jumped sharply, according to a study of pollution data in 33 northern cities by Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management and the Center for Statistical Science. Also known as “sunburn for the lungs”, ozone is caused by the interaction of sunlight with nitrogen oxides and the vast amounts of uncontrolled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by burning fossil fuels. Traffic congestion is a major cause.    Ozone is one of six components of China’s official air quality index, along with sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, PM2.5 and larger airborne particles known as PM10.  Ozone rose throughout the region, with concentrations up 40 percent or more in 10 northern cities from 2014 to 2017, the study said. Cuts in other forms of pollution are believed to have contributed to the rise. “Regional declines in the amount of PM2.5 and PM10 have reduced the volume of floating particles and increased the strength of the sunlight required to produce ozone,” the paper said.     A study by Chinese researchers published last year identified ozone as a growing health risk that had caused a rise in deaths from strokes and heart disease. “If you look at the public health impact ... PM2.5 is responsible for more than a million premature deaths per year, whereas ozone is somewhere above 100,000,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, clean air campaigner with environment group Greenpeace.  “But last summer, ozone really spiked and it is deservedly going to get more attention,” he said, adding that China should set targets to cut nitrogen oxide and VOC emissions in its next air quality plan, due to be published later this year.

2018-04-11,"ABOARD THE USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT, South China Sea (Reuters) - In a span of 20 minutes, 20 F-18 fighter jets took off and landed on the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, in a powerful display of military precision and efficiency. The nuclear-powered warship, leading a carrier strike group, was conducting what the U.S. military called routine training in the disputed South China Sea on Tuesday, headed for a port call in the Philippines, a defence treaty ally. The United States is not alone in carrying out naval patrols in the strategic waterway, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate, possibly increasing tensions and risking accidents at sea. “We have seen Chinese ships around us,” Rear Admiral Steve Koehler, the strike group commander, told a small group of reporters on board the three-decade-old carrier.  “They are one of the navies that operate in the South China Sea but I would tell you that we have seen nothing but professional work out of the ships we have encountered.” Navies in the western Pacific, including China and nine Southeast Asian countries, have been working on a code of unexpected encounters (CUES) at sea to avoid conflict. The USS Theodore Roosevelt’s presence in the South China Sea comes days after China’s massive air and naval drills in the area, in what some analysts described as an unusually large display of Beijing’s growing naval might. [nL3N1R92NG] China’s navy on Wednesday also released a warning to other ships on social media that they would be holding drills until Friday in the region south of Sanya city in southwest China’s Hainan province, without giving additional details. China’s growing military presence in the waters has fuelled concern in the West about Beijing’s end game. The United States has criticised China’s apparent militarisation of manmade islands and carried out regular air and naval patrols to assert its right to freedom of navigation in stretches of a sea China claims largely as its own. “This transit in the South China Sea is nothing new in our planning cycle or in a reaction to that. It is probably by happenstance that all that is happening at the same time,” said Koehler, who gave a tour of the carrier to Philippine military officials and watched flight operations aboard the 100,000-tonne warship. “All of the operations that we do in and around the South China Sea or any of the bodies of water we operate in, there is a function of international law and that is ultimately what we want to recognise,” Koehler said. Tension between the United States and China over trade and territory under U.S. President Donald Trump has been stepped up of late, with fear in the region that the South China Sea, vital to global trade, could one day become a battleground between the two rival powers.  Philippine ties with China meanwhile have warmed under President Rodrigo Duterte, who has put aside disputes with Beijing and wants it to play a key role in building and funding urgently needed infrastructure, from highways and ports to railways and power plants. China has long objected to U.S. military operations off its coasts, even in areas Washington insists are free to international passage. “They (China) certainly have the right to exercise off their coast like we do, nor are they necessarily in charge of our transit cycle, but our deployment’s been planned,” Koehler said.  As the crew in colour-coded uniforms raced to service dozens of aircraft taking off and landing, “handlers” in the flight deck control made sure the deck had enough room for jets to manoeuvre and refuel with the help of a “Ouija board”.      The board has all the models of each aircraft, which are marked with squadron name, model, make, and number of personnel. At any given moment, the flight deck is home to dozens of aircraft and helicopters.  “It is a showcase of the capability of the U.S. armed forces,” Philippine army chief Rolando Bautista said of the demonstration. “Since Americans are our friends in one way or another, they can help us deter any threat.” (This version of the story has been refiled to fix typo in the slug) Additional reporting by Christian Shepherd in Beijing; Editing by Martin Petty and Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/southchinasea-usa/refile-update-1-after-chinas-massive-drill-u-s-patrols-disputed-south-china-sea-idUKL3N1RO2JD,11 Apr 2018,"I n a span of 20 minutes, 20 F-18 fighter jets took

2018-04-11,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.1 pct, Nikkei loses 0.4 pct * China stocks up, PBOC to allow foreign banks more business scope * Euro near 2-wk high, buoyant after ECB Nowotny’s policy comments * Crude dips after big rally, Middle East tensions limit losses By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, April 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose modestly on Wednesday but pared early gains as caution again crept into markets over strained U.S-China trade ties and escalating tensions in Syria. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open lower, with Britain’s FTSE seen losing 0.3 percent, Germany’s DAX slipping 0.4 percent and France’s CAC shedding 0.4 percent. Wall Street also looked set for a softer start with S&P mini futures down 0.5 percent. Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump both struck conciliatory tones on Tuesday, which analysts hoped could open the door for negotiations to avert a trade war. But one report said early talks have already broken down. Adding to market jitters, the United States and its Western allies are reportedly discussing possible military action over a suspected poison gas attack in Syria, a move which could provoke a response from Russia. Pan-European air traffic control agency Eurocontrol warned airlines to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria in next 72 hours. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.2 percent higher. It had gained 1.2 percent the previous day on relief that Xi’s speech was businesslike and non-confrontational, but lost some steam on Wednesday on concerns over how long it may take the world’s two biggest economies to hash out a compromise on trade, if one is possible. “The United States and China are still at a phase in which they are attempting to probe the intentions of the other,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “While China showed how far it can go, the markets won’t settle down until the two powers reach an actual agreement. The next focal point is how the United States responds.” Australian stocks were down 0.4 percent and Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.4 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI was 0.2 percent lower. Chinese shares fared better after the country’s central bank set out the clearest timetable yet for opening the financial services sector to foreign investors. It will allow offshore firms to enter its trust, financial leasing, auto finance and consumer finance sectors by the end of this year. China watchers said the announcement may further ease trade tensions. But they remained cautious, however, noting that action speaks louder than words and pointing out that foreign companies have continued to face unofficial barriers even after some sectors were ostensibly opened up. Shanghai stocks rose 0.9 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.8 percent. The Dow advanced 1.8 percent, the S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent and Nasdaq added 2.1 percent overnight after Xi on Tuesday pledged to further open up the economy and promised to cut import tariffs on products including cars. In currencies, the euro was a shade higher at $1.2358 and on its fourth session of gains. The common currency was not far from a two-week high of $1.2378 scaled overnight after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters in an interview that its 2.55-trillion euro bond buying program would be wound down by the end of this year. The euro has risen about 3 percent this year on expectations that the ECB would eventually normalise monetary policy and hike interest rates. “We anticipate further, gradual euro appreciation versus the dollar over the course of 2018. Greatly reduced deflationary risks for the euro area have been fundamental to the stabilisation and recovery of the single currency since the first half of last year,” wrote Brian Martin, head of global economics at ANZ. The dollar dipped 0.15 percent to 107.050 yen. The greenback had gained 0.4 percent overnight when an uptick in risk appetite weakened demand for its Japanese peer, often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 89.573 after shedding 0.3 percent the previous day. Oil prices slipped following the previous days sharp rally, although losses were limited as the commodity markets eyed an escalation of Middle East tensions. U.S. crude futures were down 0.3 percent at $65.32 a barrel after surging more than 3 percent on Tuesday on the back of the surge in risk appetite in the broader markets. Brent lost 0.45 percent to $70.73 a barrel after jumping 3.5 percent on Tuesday, when it rose to $71.34, highest since December 2014. Spot gold touched a one-week high of $1,342.64 an ounce on lingering geopolitical tensions.

2018-04-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The volume of oil sitting in 300 steel tanks in a nine-square-mile radius in Cushing, Oklahoma has long been a key barometer for the health of U.S. crude supply and the nation’s benchmark for daily trading of billions of dollars in the commodity.  But those tanks could soon drain to levels near effectively empty, even as U.S. oil production soars past a new record of 10.4 million barrels per day. Oil supplies have fallen before in Cushing for a variety of seasonal or market-driven reasons. But this time, there is no shortage of crude in the market. In fact, U.S. production is straining pipeline and storage capacity. The declining volumes stored at Cushing reflects a more permanent shift, underscoring the hub’s waning influence as the primary measuring stick for the U.S. oil market and the leading barometer of future supply, demand and prices. (For a graphic of falling oil inventories at Cushing, see: tmsnrt.rs/2GRh5GR ) Companies are now spending millions of dollars building infrastructure to facilitate trading and storage elsewhere, such as in Houston and other Gulf Coast ports. That could pave the way for a change in the U.S. benchmark oil price, used to value tens of billions of dollars of crude and futures contracts every day. The current benchmark - called West Texas Intermediate crude, or “WTI” - has been derived from the price of physical oil delivered to Cushing for more than three decades. Traders and major global crude buyers have advocated replacing WTI with a new benchmark futures contract that would reflect the value of crude delivered to the Gulf Coast. The price of oil in Cushing - which bills itself as “the pipeline crossroads of the world” - is used to value crude grades produced around the United States and some oil imported from Canada, Mexico, and South America. Prices at the hub also provide the basis for an average of 1.3 million WTI futures contracts CL-TOT - worth about $82 billion at current prices - that change hands on the CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange every day, making it one of the world’s most actively traded commodities. But as more pipelines are built to take oil from U.S. shale fields to Gulf refineries or for export markets, much of the crude produced in the giant Permian Basin oilfield in Texas and elsewhere no longer passes through Cushing. Instead, producers are increasingly shipping directly to seaports such as Houston, where vessels carry the oil to dozens of countries worldwide. That reflects a major transformation in global crude flows since the United States lifted a four-decade ban on oil exports in late 2015. Some traders and buyers argue the benchmark needs to change to reflect this. Joshua Wade, a crude oil marketer in Oklahoma, sees the benchmark delivery point moving south before long. “That’s the direction it’s moving,” he said. “As opposed to importing, now you’re exporting through the same infrastructure ... The oil capital of the nation is in Houston.”  Inventories in Cushing fell to 28.2 million barrels in early March, lowest in more than three years.  Analysts say a level of 20 million barrels is effectively empty. That’s because tank design necessitates a minimum volume of crude be kept on hand to maintain the physical integrity of the complex and to allow for blending different crude grades to comply with pipeline specifications.  “There has been a major structural shift in crude flows within the U.S.,” said John Coleman, senior research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “I think Cushing is rapidly losing its relevance.” A CENTURY-OLD WAY STATION Cushing got its distinction in the early 1920s when tanks sprung up to store oil en route from Oklahoma and Texas to major metropolitan areas and refineries in the Midwest.  In 1983, it became the delivery point for the newly-launched WTI futures contract CLc1. Because the U.S. relied on imports - and banned exports - Cushing was key for traders to gauge domestic supply trends. BP’s former head of crude trading, Donald Porteous, earned the nickname “the King of Cushing” because of his deep understanding of supply logistics in the Oklahoma town - a strategy that often earned him more money than BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley. Porteous, now retired, declined to comment for this story. Now, new pipeline projects head straight from west Texas to the Gulf of Mexico, a route well south of Cushing. Lately, Permian Basin prices have declined because pipelines can’t be built fast enough to get crude to the Gulf, even as pipeline firms have added about 600,000 bpd in capacity since late last year, according to data compiled by Reuters.  “We’re trying to make sure we’re ahead of the pinch points for producers to bring product to refiners or to export,” Greg Armstrong, chief executive of Plains All American, said at a recent industry conference.  Projects in the works could boost outgoing pipeline capacity from the Permian from 2.7 million bpd in March to more than 4.5 million bpd by the end of 2019, according to energy industry information provider Genscape. Meanwhile, the Dakota Access pipeline started shipping oil last year, running out of North Dakota’s Bakken shale region to the Gulf - bypassing Cushing. And Marathon Petroleum is considering reversing its Capline crude line to bring barrels from Illinois to the Gulf. For now, traders watch the price differential between WTI and London-based Brent crude to determine where to ferry shipments globally.  But traders say the price of physical trades in Houston is growing more important as a barometer for shippers. Earlier this year, even as the WTI crude discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 narrowed, Houston’s discount to Brent remained steady at about $1.60 a barrel, analysts said, helping buoy export demand. As pipeline capacity to the Gulf has increased, and storage has expanded, demand to park barrels in Cushing has waned, said Carlin Conner, chief executive at SemGroup Corp (SEMG.N), which operates about 7.6 million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing. A spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners, which owns about 12 million barrels of Cushing storage, said it will remain important because of its connections to the Gulf and Midwest.  Cushing is also connected via pipeline to the Gulf, 500 miles to the south, and can offer cheaper storage than what’s available on the coast, said SemGroup’s Conner. “I believe Cushing’s next chapter,” he said, “is that it’s going to become an offsite Gulf Coast storage center.” Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Additional reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; Editing by David Gaffen, Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-record-cushing/analysis-cushings-oil-market-clout-wanes-amid-u-s-export-boom-idUKL4N1QB3SF,11 Apr 2018,"The volume of oil sitting in

Brent crude futures rose to $71.09 per barrel at 0104 GMT, up 7 cents from their last close. Brent surged more than 3 percent on Tuesday to hit its highest level since late 2014, at $71.34 a barrel. U.S. WTI crude futures were at $65.63 a barrel, up 12 from their last settlement. The United States and its allies are considering a strike against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces following a suspected poison gas attack last weekend. Pan-European air traffic control agency Eurocontrol said air-to-ground and/or cruise missiles could be used within the next 72 hours, warning that there was a possibility of intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment. Although Syria itself is not a significant oil producer itself, the wider Middle East is the world’s most important crude exporter and tension in the region tends to put oil markets on edge. Oil markets were also supported by easing concerns over a prolonged trade spat between the United States and China after China’s President Xi Jinping on Tuesday gave a speech with a conciliatory tone. “The relaxation of tensions between the U.S. and China (is) allowing oil traders to exercise their worries over geopolitics,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Not all oil market indicators pointed to ongoing price rises, however. U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.8 million barrels in the week to April 6 to 429.1 million, according to a report by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 189,000 barrels. And the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday that it expects domestic crude oil production in 2019 to rise by more than previously expected, driven largely by growing U.S. shale output. In its monthly short-term energy outlook, the agency forecast that U.S. crude oil output will rise by 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 11.44 million bpd next year. Last month, it expected a 570,000 bpd year-over-year increase to 11.27 million bpd. That will likely make the United states the world’s biggest oil producer by 2019, surpassing Russia which currently pumps out almost 11 million bpd.

2018-04-11,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - Trade tensions between the United States and China are likely to have an adverse impact on global growth even if the threatened tariffs are never imposed. Conflict between the world’s two largest economies is creating significant uncertainty for businesses that threatens their global supply chains and future investment plans. Senior U.S. officials have emphasised the tariffs are only a proposal at this stage and could be averted by a settlement between the two countries. But the disjunction between hardline rhetoric and aggressive tariff proposals on the one hand and reassurance to investors and businesses on the other has whipsawed the financial markets. Equity indices and commodity prices have alternated between selloffs and rallies as traders try to estimate the probability tariffs will be imposed. In reality, the direct economic damage done by tariffs would be fairly small, though the impact on some firms and sectors would be more concentrated. Bilateral trade of around $700 billion between the two countries represents only a small percentage of the gross domestic production of the United States ($19 trillion) and China ($11 trillion). But the threat of tariffs will have a much more damaging and chilling impact on investment decisions that depend on global supply chains - even if the import taxes are never actually imposed. For multinational businesses considering the location of new manufacturing facility, the threat of tariffs is likely to cause at least an additional pause before the project is given the go-ahead. If decisions are delayed, the result will be a slowdown in investment, at least in the short term, with negative implications for growth. U.S. officials have indicated it could take six months or more to reach a final decision on tariffs which implies an extended period of damaging uncertainty. The damage will extend well beyond decisions on the location of new automotive plants and semiconductor factories. Most major construction projects and manufacturing systems depend on raw materials and components that cross international borders at least once and in some cases multiple times. Raw materials, components and finished goods generally have to be ordered many months or even years in advance. Projected costs depend on estimates of the price of items ordered now, but which may not arrive and clear customs until many months in the future, when they could be liable to new tariffs. Every business relying on items from one of the countries engaged in a potential trade war must calculate the risk the items will be unavailable or significantly more expensive and make contingency plans accordingly. DE-GLOBALISATION? Even if a truce is declared in the current trade spat, it has raised major questions about the future direction of trade and investment policies. Since 1947, the broad thrust of international economic policies has been towards greater openness to trade and investment, led by the United States. Successive rounds of trade negotiations have lowered average tariff barriers and tried to control non-tariff barriers on trade and investment to create a more predictable environment for business. Officials conducted eight successful rounds of multinational trade negotiations between 1947 and 1994 under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In addition, there have been several ambitious attempts to liberalise regional trade, notably the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as a dense network of bilateral free trade agreements. Protectionism has never been far from the surface but the broad trend has been in the direction of greater liberalisation. The liberalisation thrust has seemed to run out of momentum in recent years with the failure to conclude a new round of global trade negotiations. The tariff war now threatens to send the process into reverse. Proponents of tariffs have made explicitly clear they want to revive U.S. manufacturing by cutting global supply chains and re-nationalising them. This marks a major change in the direction of the international economic system and could upend corporate strategies that have been based on global supply chain management. The results could leave hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign investments as stranded assets if multinationals are forced to reconfigure their supply networks. The potential for asset stranding and write-downs helps explain why stock markets have reacted so badly to the threat of tariffs even when their direct economic impact would be limited. The threat of a trade war has injected an extra degree of uncertainty that will not necessarily be lifted even if the two sides reach a settlement. It comes at a time when Britain is withdrawing from the European Union and international sanctions are also proliferating and disrupting the operation of supply chains for energy and minerals. And there is no guarantee another tariff war will not break out in future over another issue. Corporate leaders must plan for a world in which greater openness to trade and investment is no longer a given. Trade tensions between the United States and China have revealed the shallowness of political support for the current open trading system let alone further liberalisation. Whatever the merits of the current dispute, the threat of tariffs has injected a significant additional source of uncertainty into the global economy that is likely to inhibit investment and output growth. The tariff war is a sign the post-war project of trade liberalisation is in deep trouble and the impact could linger even if the United States and China can negotiate a truce.

2018-04-11,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.1 pct, Nikkei rises 0.15 pct * Asia stocks buoyed by Wall Street rally * Euro near 2-wk high, buoyant after ECB Nowotny’s policy comments * Crude oil extend gains after rallying more than 3 pct By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, April 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were firm on Wednesday as investors lapped up the positive mood in markets after China’s President Xi Jinping helped ease fears over a U.S.-China trade row, while the euro hovered near two-week highs. In overnight trade, Wall Street rallied strongly, taking the baton from a solid Asian session that was driven by Xi’s speech seen as striking a more conciliatory stance following a week of tit-for-tat tariff threats between Beijing and Washington. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.1 percent. Australian stocks added 0.1 percent and Japan’s Nikkei edged up 0.15 percent. The Dow advanced 1.8 percent, the S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent and Nasdaq added 2.1 percent overnight after Xi on Tuesday pledged to further open up the economy and promised to cut import tariffs on products including cars. “The United States and China are still at a phase in which they are attempting to probe the intentions of the other,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “While China showed how far it can go, the markets won’t settle down until the two powers reach an actual agreement. The next focal point is how the United States responds.” In currencies, the euro was a shade higher at $1.2362 and on its fourth session of gains. The common currency was not far from a two-week high of $1.2378 scaled overnight after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters in an interview that its 2.55-trillion euro bond buying program would be wound down by the end of this year. The euro has risen about 3 percent this year on expectations that the ECB would eventually normalise monetary policy and hike interest rates. The dollar was steady at 107.170 yen after gaining 0.4 percent overnight as an uptick in risk appetite weakened demand for its Japanese peer, often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 89.562 after shedding 0.3 percent the previous day. Crude rose further after rallying overnight on the easing of U.S.-China trade conflict concerns and tensions in the Middle East. U.S. crude futures gained 0.25 percent to $65.67 a barrel after surging more than 3 percent on Tuesday.

2018-04-11,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producers plan to self-finance some of their production even as higher crude prices boost their ability to borrow against reserves, according to a survey of energy companies and financiers on Tuesday.  The survey found 21 percent of producers saying they expect to tap cash flow from operations for capital needs this year, a higher percentage than those who selected debt from banks and equity from private equity firms, at 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively. This was the first year that respondents were asked about self-funding.     “The public companies are having to live by cash flow because that’s what the market is dictating,” said Buddy Clark, a partner at law firm Haynes and Boone, which conducted the survey of 365 producers, oilfield services companies, lenders and advisers. Still, closely held producers can expect lenders during their semi-annual valuations of oil and gas reserves to offer more capital this spring, according to the survey. More borrowing power, from crude prices CLc1 up 23 percent in the last year, can finance greater drilling.  The survey found that more than 80 percent of respondents expect their borrowing base to increase, with most expecting it to rise between 10 percent and 20 percent. A year ago, less than 70 percent of respondents expected their borrowing base to increase 10 percent or more.  “It is a more optimistic survey than the prior year,” said Clark, citing the improved picture for commodity pricing and access to private financing. Clark said more capital is available, primarily from private equity firms and funds. At the same time initial public offerings by producers have declined, saying IPO work at the firm has been below the pace of 2016.  Borrowers also are locking in more of their future production using hedges that insure against price declines. Respondents have locked in between 50 percent and 60 percent of their 2018 production, the survey said.

2018-04-11,"VANCOUVER/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Alberta on Tuesday doubled down on its pledge to financially support a troubled pipeline expansion, saying the province could buy the project outright from Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd as Canada’s federal government reiterated it was “100 percent” behind the build. Texas-based Kinder Morgan said on Sunday it would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline, which extends from Alberta to British Columbia’s coast, unless various legal and jurisdictional challenges could be resolved by May 31. The ultimatum prompted swift responses from Alberta and Ottawa, with both levels of government signaling interest in spending public funds to ensure the project proceeds. Shareholders backed the gamble.  “We are considering a number of financial options to ensure that the Trans Mountain expansion is built, up to and including purchasing the pipeline outright if it was to come to that,” Premier Rachel Notley said in a statement provided to Reuters.     Notley was not immediately available to clarify whether she was referring to both the existing pipeline operations and the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) expansion project or just the latter. She had previously said Alberta could take a stake in the project. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Cabinet held meetings on Tuesday to discuss its options for the controversial project, which is desperately needed by industry but fiercely opposed by the province of British Columbia, along with certain municipalities and aboriginal groups. The issue is a major political challenge for Trudeau, who approved the expansion in 2016. Critics have said he needs to be more forceful with both the West Coast province and protesters who have repeatedly blocked Kinder Morgan work sites.     “We’ve been saying for the last two days we’re prepared to look at many options, and that has not changed,” Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr told reporters in brief remarks following the meeting. “The government is 100 percent behind this pipeline.” Carr had previously said Ottawa was looking at whether to take a stake in the project. But the industry was less enthusiastic. “We need foreign businesses like Kinder to be saying we are an enviable place to do business in, not a place that I had to sell my asset to the government,” said Rafi Tahmazian, a portfolio manager at Canoe Financial. Kinder Morgan Canada said it was consulting with the government and would not comment until those talks are complete. Its shares stabilized on Tuesday, closing up 3.66 percent at C$16.71 after shedding 12.6 percent the day before. Whether or not governments step up with financial backing, the company’s struggles are another black mark for Canada, which used to be a prime destination for foreign investment, said Robert Skinner, executive fellow at The School of Public Policy, University of Calgary. “We used to wear this as a badge of honor - that we were not like the tin-pot regimes around the world where they carry kalashnikov (rifles),” he said. “Canada, ironically, has become a high political risk investment zone for oil and gas.” Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa; Editing by Peter Cooney, Jonathan Oatis and Richard Chang",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline/update-3-alberta-premier-says-willing-to-buy-trans-mountain-pipeline-idUKL1N1RN22U,11 Apr 2018,"Alberta on Tuesday

2018-04-11,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Gale-force winds battered New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, leaving thousands without power on Wednesday morning as authorities urged residents to stay home. Gusts as high as 146 km (90 miles) an hour tore down trees and power lines overnight, leaving more than 100,000 homes and businesses without power and likely taking days to fix, according to electricity distributor Vector.  The country’s national carrier Air New Zealand urged travelers to defer any non-urgent trips as flights were disrupted by the weather.  “Air New Zealand is experiencing significant disruption across its network today as a result of weather conditions and the temporary closure of the Auckland Airport runway last night which required a number of flights to divert to other ports,” the company said in an emailed statement. Roads were littered with debris and some traffic lights were out, prompting authorities to request the more than 1.3 million residents of New Zealand’s commercial capital to stay home if possible. “There is damage across Auckland this morning after last night’s severe storm ... please only travel if you have to,” Auckland City Council said on its website. The storm, which was expected to continue for the next few days, started pummeling the country on Tuesday, bringing unseasonable autumn snow to parts of the South Island and small tornados in the central north island.  Heavy rains and snow were expected to continue for the next few days and the country’s Metservice issued a warning for more severe winds in Auckland, expected to hit on Thursday night.

2018-04-11,"(Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is in advanced settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department and California Air Resources Board over accusations that the company illegally used software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014, a court-appointed adviser said at a hearing on Tuesday. The adviser, Ken Feinberg, disclosed at a federal court hearing in San Francisco that government lawyers and Fiat Chrysler had exchanged and “redlined” documents after lengthy talks that were moving “at a rather swift pace.” A lawyer for Fiat Chrysler, Robert Giuffra, said the company and government lawyers were exchanging drafts of settlement documents. He said he expected a settlement would be reached “probably sometime during the summer.” The Justice Department sent Fiat Chrysler lawyers a Jan. 27 settlement offer that would require the company to offset excess pollution and take steps to prevent future excess emissions, Reuters reported in February. The letter included language that a settlement must include very substantial civil penalties. Lawyers in court did not disclose the potential amount of any fine state and federal governments would want Fiat Chrysler to pay as part of any settlement or if the sides had agreed on that issue. California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols on Monday declined to discuss the amount of any potential civil penalty. The sides have engaged in lengthy settlement talks and have three more rounds of talks planned for later in April and May. Lawyers said a settlement could be reached this summer. Fiat Chrysler and the Justice Department have discussed some consumer-related provisions that could be part of a settlement including warranty and recall provisions. Last July, Fiat Chrysler won approval from federal and California regulators to sell 2017 model year diesel vehicles after it was sued by the Justice Department in May 2017 for excess emissions. To resolve the pollution issue, the company is confident it can use updated emissions software in the 2017 vehicles as the basis of a fix to address agencies’ concerns over 2014-2016 diesel vehicles. The company hopes to complete testing the proposed fix by the end of June. Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving.  The company has denied any wrongdoing, saying there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules. The Justice Department has a separate ongoing criminal investigation into the excess emissions. U.S. Judge Edward Chen set a June 1 hearing to get another update on the talks.
