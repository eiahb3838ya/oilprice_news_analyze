2018-05-03,"(Adds TransCanada response) May 3 (Reuters) - Pressure restrictions on TransCanada Corp’s Keystone oil pipeline were lifted on Tuesday in a letter issued by U.S. pipeline safety regulators, a spokesman for the agency told Reuters on Thursday. It was not immediately clear what current flow rates are, said Darius Kirkwood, a spokesman for the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The company in November shut down its 590,000-barrel-per-day Keystone pipeline, which links Alberta’s oil sands to U.S. refineries, after a spill in South Dakota and was ordered later that month to operate at reduced pressure. Reduced flows on the pipeline had helped draw down inventories in the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub. A return to full capacity on the line is also expected to help relieve a bottleneck in the oil-producing province of Alberta, where increased output has run up against a shortage of pipeline and rail capacity. The restrictions “really did have a minor impact on our throughput and so consequently, I don’t anticipate seeing a tremendous increase in our throughput once it’s lifted, based on some of the changes we’ve made already,” TransCanada’s head of liquids, Paul Miller, said on a conference call last week. A spokesman for Calgary-based TransCanada said the restrictions in place were limited to a small section of the pipeline and had been lifted. “We don’t expect to see significant additional volumes on Keystone,” Matthew John, a spokesman for TransCanada said in an emailed statement on Thursday. As of Dec. 1, pressure restrictions were in place only from the pipeline’s Luverne pump station to Ludden pump station and on the segment that had the leak between Ludden to Ferney pump stations, near Amherst, South Dakota, the PHMSA letter showed. On April 3, TransCanada requested that the remaining pressure restrictions on the pipeline be lifted and PHMSA approved the request effective on Tuesday. “They’ve been moving historical volumes with DRA (drag-reducing agents). Just makes it easier for them to operate now,” one U.S.-based crude trader said.

2018-05-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks cut sharp early losses to end mostly down slightly on Thursday as some disappointing earnings reports offset strong economic data, while bond yields slid after a surprising drop in euro zone inflation data. Investors also were cautious ahead of Friday’s U.S. jobs data for April. The U.S. dollar fell in choppy trading. U.S. economic data provided upbeat news, however. The number of Americans receiving unemployment aid fell to its lowest since 1973, and the U.S. trade deficit narrowed for the first time in seven months. Factory orders for March also rose. Wall Street stocks finished well off their lows of the session, with the Dow and S&P 500 indexes earlier falling below their 200-day moving averages - a key technical level - for the first time since early April. The Dow ended the day slightly higher. On the earnings front, AIG (AIG.N) shares dropped 5.3 percent after the insurer reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, while Cardinal Health (CAH.N) tumbled 21.4 percent after the drug distributor cut its annual earnings forecast. Quarterly U.S. earnings have been strong, but investors said worries are increasing that corporate profits are at a peak, with estimated year-over-year profit growth for S&P 500 companies above 25 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Good news is now bad news,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. “There’s really nothing to hold equity prices up given that background.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 5.17 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 23,930.15, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 5.94 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,629.73 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 12.75 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,088.15. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.70 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.37 percent. A U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived in Beijing on Thursday for talks on tariffs, as Chinese media said the country would stand up to U.S. bullying. Lingering worries over the outlook for U.S. rate hikes added to the day’s cautious tone. A two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting ended Wednesday with no change in rates, as expected, while the U.S. central bank said inflation had “moved close” to its target, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June. The Fed statement was not quite as hawkish as some had expected, though investors said it reaffirmed the outlook for more rate hikes. The U.S. dollar erased all its 2018 losses in the past two weeks on expectations the Fed will continue to raise rates, even as other big central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank, take longer to reduce stimulus. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.07 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.29 percent to $1.1985. Friday’s U.S. employment report for April will be evaluated for further indications of the strength of the labour market and inflation pressures. In Europe, data showed that euro zone inflation fell to 1.2 percent in April. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to be unchanged from 1.3 percent in March. That pushed French FR10YT=RR and German DE10YT=RR 10-year government bond yields to 2-week lows after the data. Benchmark U.S. 10-year government debt yields dropped to two-week lows, while those on two-year Treasury notes fell to a more than one-week trough after hitting a 9-1/2-year peak the previous session. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were last up 5/32 in price to yield 2.9477 percent, from 2.964 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices rose, boosted by OPEC production cuts and the potential for new U.S. sanctions against Iran. Gains were limited by increasing U.S. crude inventories. Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 26 cents to settle at $73.62 a barrel, a 0.35 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 rose 50 cents to settle at $68.43, a 0.74 percent increase. Gold prices gained as the U.S. dollar softened. Spot gold XAU= rose 0.6 percent at $1,312.54 per ounce.

2018-05-03,"MAPUTO,  (Reuters) - - Former Mozambican guerrilla leader Afonso Dhlakama, who was due to run for the presidency next year, died on Thursday aged 65. Dhlakama, who headed the former rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) movement, was found dead in the central town of Gorongosa, a party stronghold, state broadcaster TVM said on Thursday. It gave no details of how he died. President Filipe Nyusi, whose ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) movement fought a long and bitter civil war against Renamo, said Dhlakama’s death marked “a bad time” for Mozambique. “To me is even worse because I was in a full alignment with him to solve the problems of this country,” he said on TVM. Members of Dhlakama’s party have clashed with government forces since he lost a disputed election four years ago. But he was set to run again against Nyusi in 2019.  Dhlakama’s forces and Frelimo fought a long bush war in which around one million people are believed to have died. It was ended in 1992 under a peace accord that gave combatants a blanket amnesty and allowed Renamo to regroup as an opposition party, paving the way for landmark elections two years later. Dhlakama lost every major election he contested against Frelimo, though he topped the vote count in several central and two northern provinces in 2014.

2018-05-03,"CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro scoffed at international criticism of Venezuela’s upcoming May 20 vote in which he is seeking re-election and offered a prize for those who vote with a state-issued card. Venezuela’s mainstream opposition is boycotting the election on the grounds it is rigged in favour of the 55-year-old socialist incumbent. The United States, European Union and various Latin American neighbours have also slammed it as unfair. “So they’re not going to recognise Maduro around the world. What the hell do I care?” Maduro said at an election rally in La Guaira, on the coast outside Caracas, late on Wednesday. “What the hell do I care what Europe and Washington say?” Maduro, who is casting his campaign as a battle against imperialist powers bent on seizing Venezuela’s oil wealth, has only one serious rival: Henri Falcon, 56, a former state governor. Falcon has broken with the opposition coalition’s boycott of the vote, believing anger over an economic crisis will win him votes. OPEC member Venezuela is in a fifth year of punishing recession, inflation is the highest in the world, oil production is at a three-decade low, shortages of food and medicines are widespread and millions are skipping meals. Some polls show Falcon more popular than Maduro, who narrowly won election to replace Hugo Chavez in 2013.  But the opposition abstention campaign, the presence of Maduro loyalists in key institutions - including the election board - and vote-winning power of state welfare programs like housing and food giveaways makes a Falcon victory look a tall order. In his speech, Maduro told supporters that all those who vote showing a government-issued “Fatherland Card,” which is needed to access certain welfare programs, probably would receive “a really good prize.” He did not give details but critics say that, and other pre-election cash and other bonuses via the card, is akin to vote bribery. Voting in Venezuela is secret but state workers say they are constantly pressured to support the government. Falcon, a former soldier, has been largely shunned by Venezuela’s best-known opposition leaders but this week received the support of at least one high-profile leader, Enrique Marquez, who is vice president of A New Time party.  He also has been wooing twice-presidential candidate Henrique Capriles to join his campaign but without success so far. Capriles, and another popular opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez, are both barred from standing in the election. Maduro says Venezuela’s election system is the cleanest in the world. But even the official operator of the voting platform, UK-based Smartmatic, denounced fraud in an election last August.  Little is known about the Argentine company that has replaced it for this month’s election. If Maduro does win re-election, attention will turn immediately to whether he plans to use the political breathing space to deepen an internal purge of rivals, and if the United States will carry out a threat to impose oil sanctions. President Donald Trump’s administration already has imposed some financial and individual sanctions on Maduro’s government, accusing senior officials of rights abuses and corruption. Pro-boycott opposition activists have been stepping up their campaign in recent days with scattered protests around the country. Numbers, however, have been thin - a far cry from the mass anti-Maduro protests of 2017. The mainstream opposition Democratic Unity coalition said Falcon and others participating in the May 20 vote were simply helping Maduro legitimize a farcical process. “We urge all citizens ... to not participate in this fraudulent election and to leave the streets empty in expression of our repudiation of the Maduro regime,” it said in a statement.

2018-05-03,"May 3 (Reuters) - New York’s power grid operator on Thursday forecast that demand for power from the system will decline over the next decade due to efficiency programs and as more homes and businesses generate their own electricity on site. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), the grid operator, projected power demand would decline at a rate of 0.14 percent per year through 2028. Annual electric usage in 2017 fell to its lowest level since 2001, according to the NYISO. In 2017, demand peaked at 29,699 megawatts (MW), which was 7.4 percent below 2016’s peak of 32,075 MW and 12.6 percent below the record peak of 33,956 in 2013. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. At the same time that demand for power from the grid is declining, the NYISO said the state’s generation mix is changing as energy companies build mostly natural gas-fired units downstate and mostly wind farms update, while coal and nuclear plants retire. Since 2000, nearly 3,000 MW of coal-fired generation has retired, leaving just 979 MW in 2018 and those units are expected to shut or be repowered into gas-fired units in 2020 due to state carbon dioxide (CO2) emission restrictions, the NYISO said. The two reactors at Entergy Corp’s 2,069-MW Indian Point nuclear power plant in Westchester County north of New York City will shut in 2020 and 2021 under a deal between the company and the state. The NYISO said the grid will remain reliable after the units shut as new sources of mostly gas-fired generation enter service. The NYISO said it expects about 17,000 MW of renewable generation to enter service over the next decade or so to help meet the state’s goal requiring 50 percent of the energy consumed come from renewable sources by 2030. In 2017, renewable sources of generation, like hydro, wind and solar power, accounted for about 29 percent of the energy produced in the state. With all the changes expected, the NYISO said it will have to use price signals to reward flexible units, like gas plants that can also burn oil, for times when gas or renewable sources of generation may not be available as can happen on the coldest winter days when consumers use most of the available gas to heat their homes and businesses.

2018-05-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, boosted by OPEC production cuts and the potential for new U.S. sanctions against Iran, but gains were limited by growing U.S. crude inventories. Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 26 cents to settle at $73.62 a barrel, a 0.35 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 rose 50 cents to settle at $68.43 a barrel, a 0.74 percent increase. “The price move today is probably based off Iran and the tight oil supply market that we already have,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment manager Tortoise Capital in Leawood, Kansas. “The margin for error right now is just so low in the oil market that you can’t just take supply off the market.” Iran’s foreign minister said U.S. demands to change its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers were unacceptable as a deadline set by President Donald Trump for Europeans to “fix” the deal loomed.      Trump has all but decided to withdraw from the accord by May 12, sources said on Wednesday, though exactly how he will do so remained unclear. Iran re-emerged as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions against Tehran were suspended in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program.    Also supporting prices, North Sea oilfields connected to the Brent oil pipeline have stopped production due to a shutdown at the UK’s Sullom Voe oil terminal, the Brent pipeline operator said, reducing output of the crude. Global oil supply has tightened with production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. The latest Reuters survey showed OPEC pumped around 32 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, slightly below its target of 32.5 million bpd, due largely to plunging output in Venezuela. Russia on Thursday said its own compliance with a global deal with OPEC and other producers to curb output stood at 95.2 percent in April, with its output unchanged at 10.97 million bpd. However, rising U.S. oil supply tempered oil futures gains. On Wednesday, U.S. government data showed a 6.2-million-barrel jump in crude inventories last week. U.S. production also hit a new weekly record of 10.62 million bpd, ahead of top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia and just below No. 1 producer Russia. Inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub climbed by about 152,000 barrels in the week to May 1, according to market intelligence firm Genscape, traders who saw the data said.

2018-05-03,"PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European powers still want to hand Donald Trump next week a plan to save the Iran nuclear deal, but they have also started work on protecting EU-Iranian business ties if the U.S. president makes good on a threat to withdraw, six sources told Reuters. Trump, who says the 2015 accord is a “disaster”, has all but decided to withdraw by May 12, U.S. officials say, and looks set to reject four months of European efforts to address his concerns. But France, Britain and Germany aim to present to the White House a separate political agreement that commits to taking a tougher stance on Iran if they can agree it in time with the U.S. State Department, their American interlocutors.  Several of the sources said they were sceptical the effort would succeed, and all said the Europeans were also working on damage limitation scenarios if it fails. “We have a week to continue talking to the Americans to see if we can find an agreement on the deal,” said a senior European diplomat. “But I don’t think there is any reason to be overly optimistic.” The political agreement, which is a culmination of transatlantic diplomacy, does not include Iran or Russia and China, the other parties to the accord.  It seeks to spell out to Trump that Europe will seek to contain Tehran’s ballistic missile programme, its influence in Syria and Yemen, the terms by which inspectors visit suspect Iranian sites, and “sunset” clauses under which some of its terms expire. While the Europeans and the Americans have narrowed their differences, they are struggling to agree on how to handle a U.S. desire to extend some of the limits on Iran’s nuclear programme, without reopening the July 2015 accord. “We’re trying to find the right formulas that respond to the expectations of the Americans, but at the same time do not go against the deal,” said a second senior European diplomat. “There is a chance of getting an agreement, but even if we have we one, I’m not convinced that it will be enough to stop the U.S. withdrawing,” the diplomat said. In their package for Trump, the Europeans are also grappling with a U.S. desire to make explicit that Iran must give international inspectors access to military sites. The Europeans say this is already implicit in the original deal. “There’s a U.S. view that the inspection provisions aren’t strong enough, which is not a view that is shared by the Europeans,” said a third diplomat involved in the discussions. France’s President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are continuing to lobby Trump, but with the prospect of him changing his mind remote, the focus has shifted to managing the fallout and avoiding a dangerous vacuum. Macron in Washington last week proposed that, irrespective of Trump’s decision, there should be a wider discussion between Iran and the powers behind the original deal, which took 12 years to negotiate, working towards a grand bargain. That would incorporate the existing nuclear deal and the issues currently discussed between Europeans and Americans. But it is hard to see how Iran could be brought back to the table. Tehran says it is abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal and has no intention to renegotiate it. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday rejected any form of renegotiation.  France, Britain and Germany all say they will stay in the deal even if the United States withdraws, and try to protect and foster trade with Iran that has soared since the European Union lifted most of its economic sanctions on Iran. Iran’s exports of mainly fuel and other energy products to the EU in 2016 jumped 344 percent to 5.5 billion euros (£4.8 billion) compared to the previous year, while investment in Iran jumped to more than 20 billion euros. If Trump can’t be persuaded not to withdraw, “the second-best solution is to encourage the Americans to ... keep conditions that enable our companies in non-oil related sectors to continue to trade,” said a French official. The German Economy Ministry said it was waiting for a formal U.S. decision on the Iran deal before deciding whether to stop offering German firms export guarantees for business deals with Tehran. Such guarantees provide state protection for companies doing business abroad when foreign debtors fail to pay. The prospect of trade with Europe would provide the Europeans with a chance to assuage the Iranians, and dissuade them from rash decisions such as leaving the deal or reviving the nuclear activities they agreed to give up. Countermeasures could include a special EU blocking statute developed in the 1990s but never fully used, to shield European firms doing business with Iran from U.S. legal action if Washington reimposes sanctions. But EU plans to keep money flowing to Iran would require the United States to approve non-dollar-denominated export credit facilities and other funding support to help firms enter Iran without fear of American legal ramifications. Two European officials said reviving the blocking statutes would still be mostly a symbolic step to show the Iranians that Europe was committed to the deal. In practice, companies would fear that investing in Iran would harm their commercial interests with the United States. A senior Iranian official agreed. “These are good ideas to show the Europeans are committed to the agreement, but we think that if they have to choose between Iran and the United States, they will choose the America,” said the senior Iranian official.

2018-05-03,"WASHINGTON/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) plans to start preliminary work on its Keystone XL pipeline project in Montana in the fall of 2018 ahead of full construction in 2019, according to a letter from the U.S. State Department to Native American tribes. The letter, dated April 10, and seen by Reuters, states that the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes were being notified of the upcoming work as part of government consultation aimed at minimizing any adverse effect on their historic territory in northeast Montana. The 1,180-mile (1,899 km) Keystone XL pipeline project has been a lightning rod of controversy for a decade, hotly contested by environmentalists but desperately needed by Canadian oil producers who face steeper-than-normal crude price discounts due to transportation bottlenecks. “As you may be aware, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. (Keystone) intends to begin vegetative clearing in preparation for the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline (Project) this fall,” the State Department letter said. TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. is a subsidiary of Calgary-based TransCanada. Sent from the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs within the State Department, the letter added that the work would involve “clearing vegetation to build the construction camps and pipe yards this fall (2018) with pipeline construction to begin next year (2019).” TransCanada has not yet made an official investment decision on the $8 billion pipeline, which would extend from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, though the company has said previously that it expects to start construction in 2019. When asked about the letter on Thursday, TransCanada said: “We are progressing towards a final investment decision. We expect construction to begin in 2019 and we are doing the necessary work to prepare for those activities.” The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter, which also notifies the Montana tribes that they will be consulted on new survey work to be done in the spring and summer of 2018, due to a route change in Nebraska. U.S. President Donald Trump handed TransCanada a federal permit for the pipeline in March, reversing a 2015 refusal by former President Barack Obama. But the line has run into hurdles in Nebraska, where it was approved but not along TransCanada’s preferred route, and the approval is now being appealed. “The question is will they build a pipeline to nowhere?” said Brian Jorde, a lawyer who represents Nebraska landowners fighting the pipeline. “This is an investment risk analysis TransCanada must perform.” Reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington and Julie Gordon in Calgary; Editing by Tom Brown",https://uk.reuters.com/article/transcanada-keystone/transcanada-to-start-work-on-keystone-xl-in-montana-in-fall-2018-letter-idUKL1N1SA1GT,03 May 2018,"TransCanada

2018-05-03,"(Adds fine on Mariner East 2 in 8th paragraph) May 3 (Reuters) - The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) said on Thursday that all five commissioners voted to allow Energy Transfer Partners LP to restart its Sunoco Mariner East 1 natural gas liquids pipeline. The PUC suspended operations on Mariner East on March 7 after sinkholes were discovered near the project. After testing the integrity of the pipeline, ETP filed with the PUC on April 27 to restart the pipe. The PUC’s Bureau of Investigations and Enforcement, which recommended the pipe be shut in March, concurred with ETP’s restart request. “When (Mariner East 1) was shut in as a precautionary measure there were no issues with the pipeline, which has been safely operating for decades. Its continued safe operation has now been verified,” ETP spokeswoman Lisa Dillinger said in an email, noting the company will begin the procedures to restart the pipeline immediately. The shutdown forced shippers, including U.S. gas producers Range Resources Corp and Antero Resources Corp, to find another route for their liquids and is likely causing more ethane to be injected into the region’s natural gas pipelines, according to analysts. Mariner East 1, which started service in the 1930s transporting refined products from the Philadelphia area to western Pennsylvania, was repurposed and expanded to transport propane in 2014 and ethane in 2016 from western Pennsylvania shale fields to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from ETP’s Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia. Separately, ETP is building the $2.5 billion Mariner East 2 pipeline, which will boost total capacity of the Mariner East project from 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 345,000 bpd and open the pipe to suppliers in Ohio and West Virginia. On Thursday, Pennsylvania environmental regulators said they levied a $355,622 penalty on Mariner East 2 for violations of the Clean Streams Law that occurred between May 3, 2017 and Feb. 27, 2018. That penalty is in addition to the $12.6 million penalty levied against the company in February for separate violations. Since May 2017, Mariner East 2 has received 51 notices of violation from Pennsylvania regulators due in part to inadvertent returns or spills. Delays related to those spills, among other things, have pushed the expected startup of Mariner East 2 from the third quarter of 2017 to the end of the second quarter of 2018. Some analysts, however, have said they do not expect Mariner East 2 to enter service until the third quarter. Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Tom Brown and Chizu

2018-05-03,"SOFIA, May 3 (Reuters) - State energy firm Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) said on Thursday it had picked Citigroup as sole global coordinator for its plans to refinance its 500 million euro ($599 million) Eurobond that matures in November. Citigroup and First Financial Brokerage House, a co-manager, would issue a tender offer for BEH’s maturing bond and its 550 million euro Eurobond due in 2021 to help optimise its interest costs, the company said in a statement. The five-year Eurobond due this November has a fixed annual coupon of 4.25 percent and its other, five-year issue due in 2021 carries a fixed annual coupon of 4.875 percent. Its executive director Petyo Ivanov has said the company plans to tap global markets in May or June. BEH, made up of Bulgaria’s biggest state energy firms for natural gas supply and transmission, power generation as well as coal mining, plans to make a dual listing of the new bonds on the Irish and the Bulgarian bourses. Fitch upgraded BEH’s rating in February one notch to BB with a stable outlook, citing improved financial performance and narrowed deficit at its subsidiary NEK, a public supplier of electricity. $1 = 0.8348 euros

2018-05-03,"LONDON, May 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Despite the pristine landscapes brought to mind by successive Lord of the Rings films, New Zealand’s environmental problems are driving interest in impact investing, according to a leading advocate for the growing ethical finance trend. It could cost up to NZ$36 billion ($25 billion) to fulfil, New Zealand’s obligations by 2030 under the Paris climate change agreement, which seeks to limit global temperature rises, said David Woods of a new board to develop impact investing. “If you had to fund that out of the tax base it would be pretty substantial,” said Wood, deputy head of the National Advisory Board (NAB) on impact investing, which was set up last month to steer strategy and governance of the emerging market. “If you look at the infrastructure problems, the environmental problems and the social problems that New Zealand needs to fund in the next 20 years or so, philanthropy and government can’t do it on their own.” Investments that produce social and environmental benefits, as well as a profit, are proving popular worldwide. The $114 billion market is growing by about 18 percent a year, according to the Global Impact Investing Network, a U.S.-based non profit. “I’m one of the people that believes that, by 2020, impact investing will be the normal way, that investors will expect a social or environmental outcome with their money, as well as a financial one,” said Woods, who started out as a banker. His previous role was as head of Oikocredit, a social investor that funds microfinance and fair trade organisations. “Impact investment deals on environment and climate change will attract international private sector institutional investors, so help to share the burden facing the New Zealand taxpayer,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Woods gave the example of the consulting agency Envirostrat, which is exploring whether investors could help to clean up the Waikato, New Zealand’s longest river, which has been polluted by run off from nearby dairy farms. Envirostrat believes that investors will see an opportunity if clean water becomes more valuable because of scarcity. With Woods on board, the NAB will join the 15-member Global Impact Investment Steering Group, an independent organisation set up in 2015 to catalyse the sector, which brings together the worlds of finance, business and philanthropy. It aims to make measurable impact “a deliberate driver in every investment and business decision affecting people and the planet”, it said on its website. Aside from the environment, Woods reeled off a list of other social challenges he believes impact investing could address: affordable housing, child poverty, health issues and education for minorities, in particular in Maori communities.

2018-05-03,"* GRAPHIC: Map of Iran's nuclear facilities tmsnrt.rs/2rhijFf By Francois Murphy VIENNA, May 3 (Reuters) - The landmark 2015 nuclear deal Iran made with major world powers slashed the scope of Tehran’s atomic activities and created what the United Nations nuclear watchdog calls “the world’s most robust verification regime.” But U.S. President Donald Trump, a long-time critic of the deal, has threatened to pull out unless a follow-on agreement is reached to fix what he calls the deal’s “flaws.” Here is what a U.S. withdrawal would likely mean for the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog and its policing of Iran’s nuclear activities. A central aim of the agreement – signed by the United States, Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain - was to ensure Iran would be at least a year away from amassing enough nuclear material for a bomb. The deal made Tehran, among other things, sharply cut the number of centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium, it has in operation and slash its stock of enriched uranium. It also imposes a strict limit on the purity Iran enriches uranium to, far below the level at which it could be used in atom bombs. In signing the deal, Iran also agreed to comprehensive monitoring of its nuclear facilities and related sites by the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency. That includes daily access by inspectors to and continuous monitoring, such as by camera feed, of its two underground enrichment sites at Natanz and Fordow. The deal requires Iran to implement the U.N. nuclear watchdog’s Additional Protocol, which provides inspectors with wide-ranging access to information on Iran’s nuclear activities and the ability to inspect any site it deems necessary to verify that those activities are peaceful. The deal — officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA - requires Iran to grant long-term visas and provide proper working spaces to 130 to 150 designated U.N. nuclear inspectors. No. U.N. inspectors must present to Tehran their reason for wanting to visit a site that Iran has not declared as part of its nuclear programme. The U.N. nuclear watchdog does often conduct snap inspections. The head of the watchdog in March said that since the JCPOA has gone into effect the agency has carried out more than 60 so-called complementary access inspections. Many of those are done at short notice, diplomats familiar with the agency’s work say. The U.N. agency says it has had access to all the sites it has needed to visit and details of inspections are confidential. Iran and the U.N. nuclear watchdog say Iran is implementing its commitments under the deal. If Trump does not renew waivers of U.S. sanctions against Iran by May 12, as he has threatened to, it could unravel the deal by removing one of the main reasons Tehran signed up in the first place. According to the text of the deal, Iran stated that if sanctions were reinstated it “will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part.” The three European signatories and the European Union, which also signed the deal, hope to keep the agreement alive even if the United States pulls out. Iran’s president has warned there would be “severe consequences” if Trump pulled out of the deal. But Iran has also discussed salvaging the deal. If Iran pulled out of the deal completely, it would dramatically reduce the U.N. nuclear watchdog’s ability to monitor the country’s activities. The U.N. agency says its presence in Iran in terms of inspectors’ calendar days doubled to 3,000 in 2017 compared to 2013. It adds that its “verification activities conducted” have increased 152 percent over that time frame, without specifying total numbers. U.N. inspectors would still monitor Iran’s declared nuclear facilities because Tehran is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But, U.N. inspectors would no longer have daily access to the Fordow and Natanz sites, for example, and would have more limited oversight of areas including uranium mining and research without nuclear material. Some Iranian officials have even threatened to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a drastic move that would involve expelling U.N. inspectors altogether as North Korea did in 2009. If Iran did pull out of the deal, the U.N. nuclear watchdog would hope that Tehran would continue to apply the protocol allowing it to retain much of its power to inspect any undeclared site it needs to. There is a precedent for this, even though Iran has not ratified the Additional Protocol since it signed it in 2003: Iran implemented it temporarily from 2003 to 2006.

2018-05-03,"OSLO (Reuters) - Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall is partnering with Geely-owned Volvo Cars to help owners recharge their electric vehicles (EV) at home, the firms said on Thursday. The move comes two weeks after Vattenfall launched plans to become northwestern Europe’s largest operator of EV-charging infrastructure within five years. Volvo Cars’ market share for plug-in hybrid cars in its home market Sweden is now about 18 percent. The carmaker has a target for 50 percent of the cars it sells to be electric by 2025, Volvo Cars said in a joint statement with Vattenfall. “Our strategy going forward is to focus aggressively on electrified cars. A functioning infrastructure for charging is therefore needed both in the community and where our customers live,” said Kristian Elvefors, Volvo Cars’ managing director. About 90 percent of all electric vehicle charging takes place at work or at home, said Vattenfall. Under the partnership, Volvo car owners can visit the carmaker’s website and order a charging box. Vattenfall would  deliver, install and service the unit, a Vattenfall spokeswoman said. Others vying for a share of the charging business include French utility Engie, Germany’s Innogy and ChargePoint, whose owners include BMW, Daimler and Siemens.  Vattenfall’s Finnish rival Fortum has also made several acquisitions to compete in the sector.

2018-05-03,"* World stocks fall, U.S. stocks down more than 1 pct * Oil prices fall * Dollar near flat (Adds early U.S. market activity, changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - World stock indexes fell on Thursday, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve reaffirmed the outlook for more rate hikes, while bond yields slid after a surprising drop in euro zone inflation data. The Dow and benchmark S&P 500 stock indexes fell below key technical levels, with their 200-day moving averages, for the first time since early April, adding to bearish sentiment. MSCI’s gauge of equity markets across the globe shed 0.96 percent. A two-day Fed policy meeting ended with no change in rates on Wednesday, as expected, while the central bank said inflation had “moved close” to its target, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June. Adding to caution, a U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived in Beijing on Thursday for talks on tariffs, as Chinese media said the country would stand up to U.S. bullying. “We weakened (after) the FOMC meeting and it’s a little bit of the same carrying over to today,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “Augmenting it is some worries about trade negotiations with China that are under way and what may come of that.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 336.06 points, or 1.4 percent, to 23,588.92, the S&P 500 lost 35.19 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,600.48 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 94.37 points, or 1.33 percent, to 7,006.53. Some earnings disappointments also weighed on the markets. AIG shares dropped after the insurer reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, while Cardinal Health declined after the drug distributor cut its annual earnings forecast. In Europe, data showed that euro zone inflation fell to 1.2 percent in April, according to the Eurostat flash estimate. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to be unchanged from 1.3 percent in March. That pushed French and German 10-year government bond yields to 2-week lows after the data. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.73 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.929 percent, from 2.964 percent late Wednesday. The Fed statement was not quite as hawkish as some had expected, though sentiment remained bullish given U.S. rates were still clearly heading higher. “The (Fed) statement carried only modest changes in wording, but they were meaningful nonetheless, highlighting that the Fed is optimistic on the outlook and intent on continuing to raise rates at a gradual pace,” said Westpac analyst Elliot Clarke. The U.S. dollar erased all its 2018 losses in the past two weeks on expectations the Fed will continue to raise rates, even as other world central banks, including the European Central Bank, take longer to reduce stimulus. The U.S. dollar was near flat in choppy trading, as investors awaited Friday’s U.S. payrolls data for April. The dollar index rose 0.1 percent, with the euro up 0.05 percent to $1.1956. U.S. crude fell 0.26 percent to $67.75 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.17, down 0.26 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, Karen

2018-05-03,"(Reuters) - Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL) (CNQ.TO), one of Canada’s biggest oil and gas producers, will produce less than expected this spring, it said on Thursday, as transport bottlenecks pressure prices of Canadian heavy crude. Tight capacity on pipelines and rail lines from the province of Alberta early this year led to the biggest discount in four years on Canadian heavy crude compared to U.S. benchmark light oil. The space crunch has since abated, shrinking the discount closer to normal levels. It has, however, hampered shipments to U.S. Gulf of Mexico refiners that depend on heavy crude instead of the U.S. light oil being produced in abundance from shale rock. Calgary-based CNRL forecast production in the current second quarter of 1.054 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, missing analysts’ average estimate of 1.134 million, investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said in a note. Forecast output would still exceed that of a year earlier. “We are in a very strong, enviable position to be able to curtail natural gas and heavy oil volumes when pricing anomalies arise due to Western Canada’s pipeline constraints,” said CNRL President Tim McKay on a conference call. Canadian Natural shares fell 3.9 percent in Toronto to C$44.68. Canadian crude production is expanding even though production costs exceed those in U.S. shale oil basins, but capital spending has declined sharply.  Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) Chief Executive Officer Steve Williams said on Wednesday that company would not make further major investments in Alberta’s oil sands until market access improves. Kinder Morgan Canada (KML.TO) has paused work on its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, citing opposition in British Columbia, and said it would decide by May 31 whether to proceed.   Fellow producer Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO), also struggling with transport constraints, has operated at lower capacity this year. Production limits are also due to downtime at the Horizon mine, where CNRL is carrying out debottlenecking work to raise capacity, Eight Capital said in a note.  The company’s first-quarter profit beat forecasts, boosted by higher overall oil production. CNRL, which operates in Western Canada, the North Sea and offshore West Africa, said overall production rose to 1.12 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the first quarter from 876,907 boepd a year earlier. Net income rose to C$583 million, or 47 Canadian cents per share, from C$245 million, or 22 Canadian cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 71 Canadian cents per share, beating the average forecast of 66 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-05-03,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran’s foreign minister said on Thursday U.S. demands to change its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers were unacceptable as a deadline set by President Donald Trump for Europeans to “fix” the deal loomed. Trump has warned that unless European allies rectify the “terrible flaws” in the international accord by May 12, he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief for the oil-producing  Islamic Republic.  “Iran will not renegotiate what was agreed years ago and has been implemented,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a video message posted on YouTube. Britain, France and Germany remain committed to the accord as is, but now, in efforts to keep Washington in it, want to open talks on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 - when key provisions of the deal expire - and its role in Middle East crises such as Syria and Yemen. A senior adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also warned Europeans on Thursday over “revising” the nuclear deal, under which Iran strictly limited its enrichment of uranium to help allay fears this could be put to producing atomic bomb material, and won major sanctions relief in return. “Even if U.S. allies, especially the Europeans, try to revise the deal..., one of our options will be withdrawing from it,” state television quoted Ali Akbar Velayati as saying. The European signatories to the deal have been trying to persuade Trump to save the pact, reached under his predecessor Barack Obama. They argue it is crucial to forestalling a destabilising Middle East arms race and that Iran has been abiding by its terms, a position also taken by U.S. intelligence assessments and the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency. Zarif said: “Let me make it absolutely clear and once and for all: we will neither outsource our security nor will we renegotiate or add onto a deal we have already implemented in good faith.” Referring to Trump’s past as a property magnate, Zarif added, “To put it in real estate terms, when you buy a house and move your family in, or demolish it to build a skyscraper, you cannot come back two years later and renegotiate the price.”   Defying Western demands, Iran has repeatedly said it has no intention of reducing its imprint in Middle East affairs and its missile capabilities, which it has said are defensive in nature and have nothing to with nuclear activity covered by the deal.  “It now appears that ... some Europeans have been offering more concessions from our pocket,” Zarif said. “This appeasement (of Trump) entails a new deal that would include matters we all decided to exclude at the outset of our negotiations.” Zarif, speaking in English in the YouTube video, said the United States had “consistently violated the nuclear deal, particularly by bullying others to prevent businesses from returning to Iran”. Major European banks and businesses continue to shun the Islamic Republic for fear of falling foul of remaining U.S. sanctions, hampering Iran’s efforts to rebuild foreign trade and lure much-needed foreign investment to its economy.

2018-05-03,"ROME, May 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world map, beamed on a large display screen, shows a stark contrast between Latin America, where dark colours cover most of the continent, and the rest of the world, where there are few. This map’s focus is nations that have laws and policies supporting eco-farming techniques, a practice known as “agroecology”. Fewer than 30 countries worldwide have such laws, and more than half of those that do are in Latin America. But in practice, campaigners told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, some Latin American governments are ignoring these laws and policies, while Brazil is accused of rolling them back. That threatens the environment and, cumulatively, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of farmers, they said. “For the last three years ... we have been losing resources to sustain agroecology policies,” said Maria Noel Salgado, a Uruguayan farmer and coordinator with the Agroecological Movement of Latin America and the Caribbean (MAELA), a network of indigenous people and small-scale farmers and fishermen. “The laws are there but there are no resources. We now have a lot of governments who only believe in the power of markets and biotechnology,” she added, referring to the rise of conservative leaders across the region. Agroecology, as its name implies, shuns chemical inputs. Instead it uses nature-friendly methods such as planting trees on farms and rotating crops to improve the soil and protect against pests. Its proponents say it can provide more nutritious and environmentally-friendly food for a growing world, increase farmers’ earnings and make farms resilient to climate change. “There is growing evidence that these systems keep carbon in the ground, support biodiversity, rebuild soil fertility and sustain yields over time, providing a basis for secure farm livelihoods,” said a 2016 report by the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food). The world map showing Latin America apparently leading the way was the centrepiece at an international meeting on agroecology in early April, organised by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The laws and policies that are now in place in the region are the result of decades of campaigning by farmers and campaigners, Angela Cordeiro, a Brazilian agronomist, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the meeting. “Despite the fact that we have a very strong agribusiness sector in Brazil ... civil society and social movements managed to influence some laws,” Cordeiro said. Ross Mary Borja, director of Ecuador-based charity EkoRural, said her country’s progressive laws were due to pressure: its 2008 constitution, which includes specific rights for nature, was a result of constant campaigning by groups, including hers. Both Brazil and Nicaragua have laws and policies on agroecology and organic production, for example, while El Salvador is considering a similar approach. Brazil, for instance, stipulates that 30 percent of food for its school-feeding programme must come from family farms, which earn a premium if they use agroecology. And in December, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), an intergovernmental grouping of 33 countries, agreed to strengthen policies “that contribute to the development of agroecological family farming”. That said, countries’ implementation of laws that support agroecology and sustainable agriculture has been uneven, said Jean-Francois Le Coq of the French Agricultural Research Centre for Development (CIRAD), a French government agency. Nicaragua has not implemented its agroecology law at the grassroots level, for example, and Costa Rica has only partly implemented its law to promote organic agriculture, said Le Coq, whose organisation in 2017 studied how agroecology is practised in eight Latin American countries. Another problem, campaigners said, is the gap between what is in the law and what happens on the ground. Despite Ecuador’s constitutional protection for nature, for example, its biodiversity is under threat from industrial agriculture, oil exploration, mining and poverty, they said. There are other gaps too, said Stephen Sherwood, Borja’s colleague at EkoRural and an organic farmer. Instead of promoting cheaper and proven solutions - such as using crop residues to improve soil and non-chemical means of pest control - Ecuador’s government offers farmers free synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, he said. Borja said the government’s motives were flawed. “The government thinks small farmers are inefficient so the way to help them is through these (giveaways),” said Borja. Ecuador’s agriculture ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Borja said support for family farmers to follow an agro-ecology path is key given that they produce 60 to 70 percent of food consumed in Ecuador. That holds true elsewhere too: FAO figures show smallholders in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa provide up to 80 percent of the food supply. Meanwhile in Brazil, the national policy on agroecology is in limbo, said Cordeiro, and austerity measures are affecting the Food Acquisition Program, a public procurement programme based on buying produce from local family farmers. A change in government has caused support for agroecology to wane, she added. In a statement Brazil’s ministry of agriculture acknowledged government purchases had suffered budget cuts, but insisted its commitments to agroecology were “concrete”, and said the national policy had been in force since its publication in 2012. Changes in governments, dominance of industrial agriculture and the power of agrochemical businesses play a role in the challenges agroecology is facing in Latin America, but there is hope, said CIRAD’s Le Coq, who is based in Colombia. Although agroecology remains small-scale, many policies are in place, he said, and there is growing recognition it could help to solve the region's environmental and social challenges.

2018-05-03," LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s financial position has stabilised as a result of the increase in oil prices as well as efforts to raise non-oil revenues and trim government spending. But the country probably needs even higher prices and revenues in the next few years to pay for its ambitious transformation programme while maintaining internal stability. The kingdom’s foreign reserves stood at $493 billion at the end of March 2018 and have been basically stable for eight months after declining steadily for nearly three years. The government has introduced a value-added tax and raised other fees and taxes to compensate for the decline in oil revenues during the slump and to diversify the revenue base. Utility prices have been increased and some subsidies have been reduced to ease pressure on the budget and clean up the accounts of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco ahead of its planned share sale. But the biggest contribution to the improvement in the government’s budget and the balance of payments position has come from rising oil prices. (For a chartbook click here: tmsnrt.rs/2rgRG3d) Benchmark Brent prices have risen by about $47 a barrel, or 175 percent, since hitting a cyclical low in January 2016. As prices have risen, the kingdom’s drawdown on foreign reserves has eased and now stabilised, according to data from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (“Monthly Statistical Bulletin”, SAMA, March 2018). The rise in oil revenues has provided much-needed fiscal breathing room and the International Monetary Fund has encouraged the government to slow the pace of tax increases and spending cuts. The government has announced big ambitions to transform the economy by diversifying away from oil and making it less dependent on state spending as part of its “Vision 2030”. In the meantime, however, the kingdom remains reliant on a single commodity to an unusual degree and almost the entire economy is linked to state spending. Commodity exports account for 30-40 percent of GDP and nearly all of this is crude oil, LPG and refined products, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. There was no reduction in the kingdom’s dependence on oil exports between 1995 and 2015 despite repeated pledges about diversification (“State of Commodity Dependence”, UNCTAD, 2017). In turn, oil revenues support an enormous number of government jobs. The kingdom depends far more on public employment than most other countries. Public sector jobs account for nearly 35 percent of all employment and the wage bill alone absorbs 12 percent of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. Real gross domestic product declined by 0.7 percent in 2017, the first annual decrease since 2009, according to the IMF (“Regional economic outlook: Middle East”, IMF, May 2018). The decline was because of a combination of lower oil production and the adverse impact of fiscal austerity on the rest of the economy. The government wants to shift the focus of the economy towards the non-oil private sector, but the transition will require enormous investment, even assuming it is eventually possible. Economic transformation will need hundreds of billions of dollars, and financing can come only from the kingdom’s internal resources, or in the form of foreign loans, equity sales or direct investment. The crown prince’s recent extended tour of the United States and Europe was intended partly as a roadshow to encourage foreign investment and partly to cement government-to-government alliances. But foreign investment on its own is unlikely to be enough, given the scale of the task and lingering concerns about the kingdom’s political direction and business environment. So the country will need to find hundreds of billions of dollars from its own resources to complete the transformation programme and smooth the difficult transition. Official foreign assets amount to almost $500 billion and there are more held in various other government funds. But the kingdom needs to maintain a large cushion of liquid assets to ensure confidence in its fixed exchange rate against the dollar. Asset confiscations from wealthy Saudis and the nationalisation of domestic companies could raise extra funding but risk damaging investor confidence, so the potential for such measures is limited. As a result, the kingdom badly needs to maximise oil revenues now to pay for the transition to a less oil-dependent economy in future. Ironically, the desire to move away from petroleum dependence has made the kingdom even more reliant on oil in the short term. And the urgency of the reform process has turned it into the most hawkish member of OPEC on prices. Revenue requirements explain why the kingdom’s price policy has developed a clear upward tilt and why policymakers want to maintain OPEC production curbs for as long as possible.

2018-05-03,"CARACAS, May 3 (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro scoffed at international criticism of Venezuela’s upcoming May 20 vote in which he is seeking re-election and offered a prize for those who vote with a state-issued card. Venezuela’s mainstream opposition is boycotting the election on the grounds it is rigged in favor of the 55-year-old socialist incumbent. The United States, European Union and various Latin American neighbors have also slammed it as unfair. “So they’re not going to recognize Maduro around the world. What the hell do I care?” Maduro said at an election rally in La Guaira, on the coast outside Caracas, late on Wednesday. “What the hell do I care what Europe and Washington say?” Maduro, who is casting his re-election campaign as a battle against imperialism, has only one serious rival: Henri Falcon, 56, a former state governor. Falcon has broken with the opposition coalition’s boycott of the vote, believing anger at a economic crisis will win him votes. OPEC member Venezuela is in a fifth year of punishing recession, inflation is the highest in the world, oil production is at a three-decade low, shortages of food and medicines are widespread, and millions are skipping meals. Some polls show Falcon more popular than Maduro, who narrowly won election to replace Hugo Chavez in 2013. But the opposition abstention campaign, presence of Maduro loyalists in key institutions including the election board, and vote-winning power of state welfare programs like housing and food giveaways makes a Falcon victory look a tall order. In his speech, Maduro told supporters that all those who vote showing a government-issued “Fatherland Card,” which is needed to access certain welfare programs, probably would receive “a really good prize.” He did not give details but critics say that, and other pre-election cash and other bonuses via the card, is akin to vote bribery. Voting in Venezuela is secret but state workers say they are constantly pressured to support the government. Falcon, a former soldier, has been largely shunned by Venezuela’s best-known opposition leaders but this week received the support of at least one high-profile leader, Enrique Marquez, who is vice president of A New Time party. He also has been wooing twice-presidential candidate Henrique Capriles to join his campaign but without success so far. Capriles, and another popular opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez, are both barred from standing in the election. Maduro says Venezuela’s election system is the cleanest in the world but even the official operator of the voting platform, UK-based Smartmatic, denounced fraud in an election last August. Little is known about the Argentine company that has replaced it for this month’s election. If Maduro does win re-election, attention will turn immediately to whether he plans to use the political breathing space to deepen an internal purge of rivals, and if the United States will carry out a threat to impose oil sanctions. President Donald Trump’s administration already has imposed some financial and individual sanctions on Maduro’s government, accusing senior officials of rights abuses and corruption.

2018-05-03,"BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is pushing ahead with efforts to develop  its $15 billion (11 billion pound) Far East Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project with Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) despite being forced to exit some joint ventures due to Western sanctions. Two months ago Exxon invited companies including China National Petroleum Corporation’s engineering arm to bid for construction contracts by October, sources with knowledge of the matter said.  A final investment decision is due in 2019, they said. The project is being jointly developed with Rosneft using gas from the Sakhalin-1 venture which will be chilled into liquid to underpin the LNG plant’s initial annual output target of 6 million tonnes. Western sanctions forced Exxon to exit some joint ventures with Rosneft in late February, but LNG is not part of the sanctions. The Russian company said the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas production-sharing JV struck in the mid-1990s. “The Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetise Sakhalin-1 gas resources,” Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said. “A liquefied natural gas plant is an option to maximise benefits to the consortium and the Russian state and its citizens,” she added. Exxon-Rosneft have also held discussions about feeding gas from Sakhalin-1 fields into a planned third production unit at an existing LNG plant run by Gazprom (GAZP.MM) on Sakhalin Island, industry sources said. Rosneft was not available for immediate comment. Exxon’s LNG footprint is expanding rapidly with major new projects planned in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and the United States as demand in China and Southeast Asia booms.   Gas accounted for 43 percent of Exxon output last year, according to BMO Capital Markets, a share set to rise as new LNG projects start up. CNPC’s Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corp is preparing to bid for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for Far East LNG’s supporting facilities, such as storage tanks, pipelines and utilities, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.   Chinese engineering companies, banks and shipyards are all muscling into LNG, typically the preserve of Western, Japanese and South Korean players, as government coal-to-gas switching policies make LNG an increasingly strategic fuel.  For example, Chinese investment is pouring into African floating LNG projects, import terminals, tankers and traditional land-based plants such as the $12 billion invested in Russia’s Yamal facility, used to skirt Western sanctions.  Loans in turn drum up business for Chinese engineering firms and shipyards in LNG, and give state-backed companies the upper hand in supply negotiations. It is unclear if Chinese lenders will help finance Far East LNG.  The bid deadline for EPC contractors is September 30, sources said.  A consortium of Japan’s JGC and Texas-headquartered Fluor Corp (FLR.N) will handle the core work of project managing and building the liquefaction trains and other key components, industry sources said.  JGC was not available for immediate comment and Fluor declined to comment.

2018-05-03,"LISBON, May 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Green Climate Fund, set up to help developing countries tackle climate change, could seek to refill its coffers in 2019, a year which is likely to see “a huge amount of attention on climate finance”, said the fund’s executive director. Howard Bamsey, a former Australian diplomat, said the fund could reach the trigger point for its replenishment process later this year if the share of available funds it has allocated for projects reaches 60 percent. The fund began making investment decisions in 2015, with pledges from donor governments of $10.3 billion. But it is expected to receive only about $8 billion of that after U.S. President Donald Trump - a climate change sceptic who plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord - indicated he would not make good on the remaining $2 billion of the $3 billion promised by his predecessor. Bamsey said the fund had not been formally notified it would not receive the full U.S. contribution. But if the money were not available, it would limit what the fund could achieve. “As far as we are concerned, we are waiting for the next step (from Washington),” he said. Climate finance is expected to come under the spotlight next year at U.N talks, which established the Green Climate Fund. Rich countries have promised to raise $100 billion a year in climate finance, from both public and private sources, by 2020 to help developing countries tackle global warming. Poorer nations are seeking reassurances that target will be met. The U.N. chief is also holding a climate summit in 2019 where the subject is likely to be high on the agenda. So far, the Green Climate Fund has agreed to provide about $3.7 billion to finance projects to help developing countries shift to clean energy and adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as more extreme weather and rising seas. Bamsey said a further $2 billion for projects could be approved at meetings this year, bringing the total close to $6 billion and pushing the start button to replenish the fund. The fund’s board, which has 24 members balanced between developed and developing countries, has yet to agree on the process and whether to set a target amount. Bamsey said the fund would likely seek at least $10 billion, and the board could also decide to widen its pool of donors - now limited to governments - to include philanthropists and others that have shown interest in contributing. “I think we’re in a good position for replenishment,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of a conference on energy access in Lisbon. “Our projects are getting better and better, and countries want more and more - and so you’ve got a very good opportunity here where funding can be used extremely well to help solve the climate problem.” Bamsey said he thought the projects being submitted for backing were gradually becoming more in line with the fund’s mandate to be “transformational”. He cited a recently approved project led by the World Bank to develop financial instruments to improve energy efficiency in Brazilian cities, and a longer-standing initiative managed by the Acumen Fund to build markets for off-grid solar in East Africa by investing in small providers. He said the Green Climate Fund had become better known around the world, though not in all sectors. “A lot of the energy community know very little about the Green Climate Fund yet,” he added, saying efforts were being made at the conference to introduce it to renewable energy companies working in Africa and Asia. Bamsey said his team was focused on helping poorer countries improve their ability to tap into different international climate funds. The fragmented nature of climate finance is a problem for many, but the funds are working together to present a more coherent picture to developing-world governments, he said. The aim is to help countries identify the bigger projects needed to meet their national targets to reduce carbon emissions and to become more resilient to climate change effects - and then build those projects, Bamsey said. ""We're still learning and we've got a real long way to go before we're optimal, but I think we are doing much better,"" he said. (Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Laurie Goering.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, traded flat in percentage terms. Europe’s pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.3 percent as the euro held firm. As the Fed policy meeting threw up no surprises with rates left unchanged, the focus shifted back to simmering trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as the ongoing first quarter earnings season. In Europe, earnings disappointments from medical technology company Smith & Nephew and postal services provider Bpost soured the mood as the stocks fell 6.3 percent and 10.5 percent respectively, while German drug and crop chemicals maker Bayer flagged a stronger euro in its update. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 traded flat, with overnight results from Kraft Heinz, Tesla and Spotify in focus. So far it has been a strong earnings season, with the year-on-year blended earnings growth estimate coming in at more than 25 percent in the first quarter for S&P 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, while the equivalent figure for the MSCI EMU index (European Economic and Monetary Union) is 14.6 percent in dollar terms. The negative mood carried over from the Asian trading session, where shares slipped as hopes waned for real progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks, following reports the Trump administration is considering executive action to restrict some Chinese companies’ ability to sell telecoms equipment in the United States. “The risk at the moment is that the increasing uncertainty could create ambiguity in executives’ heads, it makes corporate decision-making more difficult and then (leads to) a decline in investment,” Alastair George, chief investment strategist at Edison Investment Research, said. Edison’s George added that the impact from trade tensions was hypothetical at the moment, though. Talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are due to kick off later on Thursday. However, a breakthrough was viewed as highly unlikely, especially as the U.S. embassy said the delegation would leave as early as Friday evening. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, while South Korean stocks stumbled 0.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index ended 1.3 percent lower, but Chinese shares bucked the trend. The blue chip CSI 300 was up 0.8 percent, but not far from an eight-month low hit in April. The Fed policy meeting ended with no change, as expected, while the central bank expressed confidence a recent rise in inflation to near target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June. “The statement carried only modest changes in wording, but they were meaningful nonetheless, highlighting that the Fed is optimistic on the outlook and intent on continuing to raise rates at a gradual pace,” said Westpac analyst Elliot Clarke. Yet the Fed also emphasised the inflation target was “symmetric”, suggesting it was not inclined to speed up its tightening plans. “The Fed sees little reason to be concerned with inflation marginally above its 2.0 percent target, particularly after such a long period of underperformance,” Clarke said. Westpac, like the market, expects two more hikes this year. The Fed statement was not quite as hawkish as some had wagered on and caused a dip in the dollar, though sentiment remained bullish given U.S. rates were still clearly heading higher while those in Europe and Japan lagged far behind. The euro was last at $1.1974, having hit a 15-week trough at $1.1936 on Wednesday, close to the low for the year at $1.1915. The single currency trimmed gains after Euro zone inflation unexpectedly slipped in April, while Euro zone bond yields hit two-week lows. Germany’s Bund yield fell to 0.55 percent, below six-week highs hit last week. The dollar also scored a three-month peak on the yen at 110.05 overnight, before edging back to 109.400. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was trading at 92.545, after reaching the highest since late December at 92.834. Oil prices retreated with Brent crude futures slipped down to $72.95 a barrel, while U.S. crude was at $67.88. Spot gold was up 0.6 percent at $1,311.74 an ounce.

2018-05-03,"ADEN, May 3 (Reuters) - Qatar has complained about the detention of one of its citizens in Yemen, in an incident that could further exacerbate Doha’s diplomatic rift with its Gulf neighbours. Qatar’s state-linked National Human Rights Committee condemned what it said was the April 21 detention of Mohsen Saleh Saadoun Al-Karbi by a Saudi-led coalition that is fighting in Yemen against the Houthi movement that controls the capital. It said the man was in Yemen visiting relatives there, and was being held without charge by the Saudi-led coalition. Yemeni security sources said Yemen’s own forces arrested the Qatari man on the border with Oman late last month, on suspicion he was an intelligence officer working with the Houthis. The Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen is made up of Arab countries that have ostracised Qatar, which they accuse of supporting terrorism and being too friendly to their rival Iran. Qatar denies those charges. The countries have been fighting in Yemen since 2015 against the Iran-allied Houthis, on behalf of the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. A representative of the Saudi-led military alliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Qatari’s arrest.

2018-05-03,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, May 3 (Reuters) - It may not sound like a lot, but the 18 percent of Rio Tinto shareholders that voted in favour of a resolution that effectively called on the company to do more to address climate change have launched a snowball at the top of a large mountain. The vote at Rio’s May 3 annual general meeting called upon the world’s second-largest mining company to review its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) and other lobby groups. While the vote was easily defeated, it sends a very clear message to natural resource companies that investors are going to be paying more attention to environmental credentials in the future. The 18 percent support was said by the resolution’s lead sponsor, Brynn O’Brien of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, to be the “highest vote ever on a similar issue,” the Sydney Morning Herald reported. It’s also worth noting that among the supporters of the resolution were life assurers such as Aegon and Legal & General, as well as pension funds like the Church of England Pensions Board. Investors such as these make up the backbone of institutional shareholders of companies such as Rio Tinto, and the clear trend in recent years has been toward calling on company boards to be clearer in their commitment to the health of the global environment. For its part Rio defended its climate stance, with new chairman Simon Thompson acknowledging that the company’s exit from coal mining has been partially driven by climate change concerns. But he also said Rio preferred to engage with groups such as the MCA rather than walk out over differences in climate change policies. But as can be seen from BHP’s recent decision to leave the World Coal Association, it’s becoming increasingly hard for mining companies that are trying to nurture progressive public images to remain engaged with groups that promote fossil fuels, and are often sceptical of scientific evidence that burning such fuels contributes to climate change. In some ways, targeting Rio is a tad odd given the company recently completed its exit from coal mining with the $2.25 billion sale in March of its Kestrel mine in Australia’s Queensland state. Rio, unlike BHP, decided that coal was no longer a long-term fit for its portfolio and took advantage of strong prices for the polluting fuel to sell its portfolio of mines. It’s inevitable that companies that remain in coal mining, especially those with listings in developed countries, such as BHP, Glencore and Anglo American, will face rising shareholder pressure. This will make it harder for companies to develop or expand coal mines and related infrastructure facilities, which is the obvious aim of the environmental groups and their supporters. The struggles of Indian conglomerate Adani Enterprises to build its planned Carmichael mine in Queensland and export the coal through its existing Abbot Point terminal is a case in point. Despite having all the necessary government approvals and claimed customers for the coal, Adani has so far been unable to attract financing for the project. In fact, the Carmichael mine looks increasingly unlikely to be developed as political support starts to wane in Australia, with Queensland’s Labor Party-led state government ruling out support and the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which backs the mine, behind in the polls ahead of next year’s likely election. Coal’s difficulties are also amplified by policies in the two major importing nations, China and India. China wants to use less of the fuel in order to improve air quality, and India wants to import less in order to improve its current account balance, however, it’s dreadful pollution may well result in more stringent environmental policies in the future. The irony of the success of anti-coal activism and stricter environmental rules is that coal is likely to become a scarcer commodity. Demand for seaborne supplies is likely to increase in coming years because of investment decisions made in previous years to build coal-fired plants, particularly in Asia. But it’s becoming harder to see coal-exporting countries being able to boost output, given political challenges in top shipper Australia and diversion of exports to local demand in number two exporter Indonesia. Coal prices have responded to this by remaining robust, with the Newcastle Weekly Index, a benchmark for Australian thermal coal, ending at $95.25 a tonne on April 27, the 40th straight week it has been above the $90 level. Perhaps the final irony for coal is that it is dying, but its going to be a profitable death for those who can stick it out to the end.

2018-05-03,"LONDON, May 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Faced with a population boom that has sent carbon emissions soaring and stretched power supplies to breaking point, oil-rich Nigeria is turning to renewable energy in a big way. Africa’s most populous country needs more than 10 times its current electricity output to guarantee supply for its 198 million people - nearly half of whom have no access at all, according to power minister Babatunde Fashola. Campaigners welcome the shift to renewables as an efficient way to bring power to rural communities and help clean up a country with some of the world’s worst urban pollution rates. “Ready access to electricity will reduce youth unemployment and increase productivity,” Ifeoma Malo, Nigeria country director at the global campaign group Power For All, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It will contribute greatly to reducing the carbon footprint of a growing energy demand by the urban population.” Nigeria has set a target of expanding electricity access to 75 percent of the population by 2020 and 90 percent by 2030. It aims to generate 30 percent of its total energy from renewable sources by 2030, Fashola said in a recent speech in London, a major commitment for an economy that depends heavily on fossil fuels. Oil and gas production account for around 35 percent of Nigeria’s gross domestic product and about 90 percent of total exports revenue, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Over the past year, the country has invested more than $20 billion in solar power projects, seeking to boost the capacity of the national grid and reduce reliance on it by building mini-grids in rural areas without mains electricity. Just one in four people in rural Nigeria is connected to the national grid, adding to a trend of outward migration that is piling pressure on Nigeria’s already overburdened cities. Power demand in Nigeria’s largest city Lagos vastly outstrips supply, meaning its 25 million residents must either go without, or rely on expensive, fume-belching generators. In January the country suffered six power outages in just eight days as the national grid repeatedly collapsed under the strain, plunging most of the country into darkness. Urbanisation and rapid population growth will only add to the problem - Nigeria’s population is projected to swell from 198 to 411 million by 2050, and more and more people are moving to its cities. By the start of 2020, demand for energy is forecast to be more than double its early 2018 levels. Nigeria currently has the capacity to produce an estimated 7,000 megawatts (MW) of power, but due to weak infrastructure, gas supply problems and water shortages only about 4,000 MW reaches the national grid, according to Fashola. The government is investing in hydropower, with several projects close to completion. The largest is the Mambilla Power Station in central Nigeria, a $5.79 billion project due to be completed in 2024 with most of the financing coming from Chinese lenders. It will be able to generate 3,050 MW of renewable energy in the rural region, and is scheduled to be completed in 2024. Given the country’s climate though, most of the focus is on generating solar power. A $350 million World Bank loan will be used to build 10,000 solar-powered mini-grids by 2023 in rural areas, bringing power to hospitals, schools and households, said Damilola Ogunbiyi, managing director of the Rural Electrification Agency. One of these projects, Sabon Gari, aims to generate between 1-4 MW of solar energy for 12,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria’s second largest city, Kano, by the end of the year. The chief executive of the energy company behind the project, Rensource, said companies’ energy costs had fallen at least 30 percent since they started using the solar grids. “Up until now, the entire market has been powered by a network of small-scale, dirty, unhealthy generators that are also quite expensive,” Ademola Adesina told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. “We are replacing those generators with a network of solar hybrid systems that are powering the entire market.” Rensource hopes to expand to rural areas, where the World Bank estimates 80 million Nigerians live without electricity. Power For All’s Malo said small-scale projects such as these offered the best chance of bringing power to remote areas. ""The Rural Electrification Agency realises that the traditional, public-sector-led grid extension system will not meet the demands of the growing population,"" he said.

2018-05-03,"(Adds quotes, details) JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Reuters) - South African power utility Eskom, which is grappling with liquidity problems, pledged on Thursday that it would not resort to controlled power blackouts this year despite reports that it was facing coal shortages. Eskom supplies about 95 percent of South Africa’s electricity, predominantly by burning coal. The state-owned utility has been forced to introduce nationwide electricity cuts in the past decade, the latest in 2015, denting economic output. “There will not be load-shedding this year,” said Eskom’s acting Chief Executive, Phakamani Hadebe, referring to forced interruptions to power supply. Hadebe said that six power plants currently had less than the required coal supplies, down from seven recently, and the company has raised 43 billion rand ($3 billion) to run its operations since January. “I can tell you without any shadow of doubt that we are safe,” Hadebe said. “We are confident that we are on the right trajectory.” Eskom appointed a new board of directors in January to resolve a leadership crisis. New President Cyril Ramaphosa in February appointed former finance minister Pravin Gordhan as public enterprises minister, in charge of state companies such as Eskom. The power company was at the heart of corruption scandals surrounding ousted president Jacob Zuma and is regularly cited by ratings agencies as a threat to the country’s creditworthiness.

2018-05-03,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - At BP’s massive Thunder Horse oil platform in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, a dog-sized robot called Maggie uses magnetic tracks to creep along pipes connecting the giant oil facility to the sea floor. Before MaggHD, dubbed “Maggie” by BP, the dangerous inspection job was reserved for highly paid specialist technicians who did their jobs while rappelling along the platform. The energy industry has turned to robots and drones to cut costs and improve safety in some of the world’s tougher working environments. Drones inspect gear high up on floating rigs. Robots crawl underwater to test subsea equipment for microscopic metal cracks. Remotely operated mini submarines can replace divers. Big oil producers such as BP and Statoil are racing to create the oilfields of the future, where smart devices replace workers. They have the potential to cut costs, save lives, and reduce the scope for human error. “This is going to change the way oil and gas does business,” Carri Lockhart, senior vice president of offshore at Statoil USA, said in an interview earlier this year, referring to the  push towards autonomous gear and facilities.  Maggie belongs to a group of devices known as magnetic crawlers, which can move across rigs, platforms, and pipelines above and below water using ultrasonic test devices and high-definition cameras. They can cost $60,000 (44,104 pounds) apiece. BP, the largest operator in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, piloted Maggie on its Thunder Horse platform last year and expects to roll out similar crawlers across all its Gulf of Mexico platforms in coming years.  BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and was the largest accidental release of oil into U.S. marine waters, underscored the dangers of offshore work.   BP wants the robots “to remove individuals from being in unsafe environments. The efficiencies we gain by collecting data this way are significant. The safety factor is obvious,” said Dave Truch, a technology director in BP’s Digital Innovation Organization. Drones and crawlers can do inspections in about half the time of rope access technicians, while placing fewer workers in harm’s way, executives at BP said this week. Other gadgets can reduce the need for shutdowns, which are sometimes necessary for safe inspection of equipment by humans. Drones can conduct inspections of flaring equipment, which burn off dangerous gases at oil and gas production facilities, without requiring a shutdown. Those shutdowns could last anywhere from five to 20 days, said Iain Gault, a business development manager at Stork, an energy maintenance unit of Fluor Corp. “We still can’t do the physical work with a drone or crawler, but the efficiency is gained by only putting people in the field when needed,” said Gault, who started his career in oil and gas as a rope access technician, rappelling along the sides of oil structures in the North Sea, nearly 30 years ago. The technology can be a “hard sell,” because of the high upfront cost, he added, estimating crawler rentals run between $600 to $1,000 per day, excluding the cost of an operating technician. Hiring technicians for drones is even more costly because they require pilot’s licenses, he added.  Companies that provide the inspection specialists for offshore equipment say they are not worried about losing out to robots and gadgets. “It is not a threat to jobs, but they change. We have to adapt,” said Ryan King, a technical sales representative for Oceaneering International, an offshore services and equipment provider. “We’re at a point now where big data is helping optimise inspection programs, so we don’t have to send guys into the field,” King said. Drones and crawlers may be a stepping stone. Norwegian oil producer Statoil is eying an unmanned, remotely operated production concept. Noble Drilling and General Electric Co this year launched a partnership to produce a fully digitised drilling vessel, work the companies said paves the way for an autonomous drilling fleet. “We have the technology. It’s just a matter of getting these projects executed. We’re not there yet on unmanned platforms for deepwater, but it’s coming,” said Statoil’s Lockhart.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, traded flat in percentage terms. Europe’s pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent as the euro held firm. As the Fed policy meeting threw up no surprises with rates left unchanged, the focus shifted back to simmering trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as the ongoing first quarter earnings season. In Europe, earnings disappointments from medical technology company Smith & Nephew and postal services provider Bpost soured the mood as the stocks fell 5.9 percent and 10.9 percent respectively, while German drug and crop chemicals maker Bayer flagged a stronger euro in its update. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 crept 0.3 percent higher, with overnight results from Kraft Heinz, Tesla and Spotify in focus. So far it has been a strong earnings season, with the year-on-year blended earnings growth estimate coming in at more than 25 percent in the first quarter for S&P 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, while the equivalent figure for the MSCI EMU index (European Economic and Monetary Union) is 14.6 percent in dollar terms. The negative mood carried over from the Asian trading session, where shares slipped as hopes waned for real progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks, following reports the Trump administration is considering executive action to restrict some Chinese companies’ ability to sell telecoms equipment in the United States. “The risk at the moment is that the increasing uncertainty could create ambiguity in executives’ heads, it makes corporate decision-making more difficult and then (leads to) a decline in investment,” Alastair George, chief investment strategist at Edison Investment Research, said. Edison’s George added that the impact from trade tensions was hypothetical at the moment, though. Talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are due to kick off later on Thursday. However, a breakthrough was viewed as highly unlikely, especially as the U.S. embassy said the delegation would leave as early as Friday evening. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, while South Korean stocks stumbled 0.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index ended 1.3 percent lower, but Chinese shares bucked the trend. The blue chip CSI 300 was up 0.8 percent, but not far from an eight-month low hit in April. The Fed policy meeting ended with no change, as expected, while the central bank expressed confidence a recent rise in inflation to near target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June. “The statement carried only modest changes in wording, but they were meaningful nonetheless, highlighting that the Fed is optimistic on the outlook and intent on continuing to raise rates at a gradual pace,” said Westpac analyst Elliot Clarke. Yet the Fed also emphasised the inflation target was “symmetric”, suggesting it was not inclined to speed up its tightening plans. “The Fed sees little reason to be concerned with inflation marginally above its 2.0 percent target, particularly after such a long period of underperformance,” Clarke said. Westpac, like the market, expects two more hikes this year. The Fed statement was not quite as hawkish as some had wagered on and caused a dip in the dollar, though sentiment remained bullish given U.S. rates were still clearly heading higher while those in Europe and Japan lagged far behind. The euro was last at $1.1972 having hit a 15-week trough at $1.1936 on Wednesday, uncomfortably close to the low for the year at $1.1915. The euro trimmed gains after Euro zone inflation unexpectedly slipped in April. The dollar also scored a three-month peak on the yen at 110.05 overnight, before edging back to 109.63. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was trading at 92.569, after reaching the highest since late December at 92.834. In the Treasury market, yields dipped slightly as a quarterly refunding programme of $73 billion came in short of expectations, reducing the pressure on prices from the torrent of supply. Oil prices inched higher with Brent crude futures up at $73.46 a barrel, while U.S. crude was at $68.08. Spot gold was up 0.4 percent at $1,310.48 an ounce.

2018-05-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - A reactor at EDF Energy’s (EDF.PA) Hunterston B nuclear power plant in Scotland will remain offline for additional safety checks after cracks were found in its core, Britain’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said. Ageing reactors generate just over 20 percent of Britain’s power but almost half of this capacity, including Hunterston, is due to go offline by 2025, prompting the government to plan new plants. ONR was informed in March about keyway root cracks found during planned inspections of graphite bricks in the core of Reactor 3 at Hunterston. Graphite bricks ensure reactors can be cooled and thousands of them are used in reactor cores.  “Inspections confirmed the expected presence of new keyway root cracks in the reactor core and also identified these happening at a slightly higher rate than modelled,” EDF Energy said in a statement. The reactor has been offline since March and was due to come back online this month, but EDF Energy has extended the outage until later this year. “While Hunterston B Reactor 3 could return to operation from the current outage, it will remain offline while the company works with the regulator to ensure that the longer term safety case reflects the findings of the recent inspections and includes the results obtained from other analysis and modelling,” it said. Hunterston B in North Ayrshire, Scotland, has been generating electricity since 1976. Last year, it produced enough electricity for 1.8 million homes. In 2015, EDF Energy said routine inspections had revealed cracks in part of the graphite core at a Hunterston B nuclear reactor. It said three of 6,000 bricks had cracked, something that had been expected to begin happening at that point in the power station’s life. Two of EDF Energy’s nuclear power plants in Britain - Heysham 1 and Hartlepool - were offline for months in 2014 for inspections after a crack was found on a boiler spine at Heysham 1. In Belgium, the regulator ordered production to be stopped at two nuclear reactors in 2012 after finding indications of tiny cracks in core tanks. The cracks turned out to be particles of hydrogen that were trapped inside the tanks when they were made by a Dutch company in the early 1980s. EDF said it expects Hunterston B’s Reactor 3 to return to service “before the end of 2018”. EDF Energy’s outage website shows an expected return date of Oct. 4.  Its Reactor 3 and Reactor 4 are both Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors. The outage will reduce its 2018 output by 3 terawatt hours, the company said. EDF Energy said the operation of its other UK reactors was not affected.

2018-05-03,"DUBAI, May 3 (Reuters) - Gulf markets were trading mixed on Thursday, but some selective buying was seen in stocks on the back of strong earnings, such as in Saudi Arabian Mining Co (Ma’aden) and Saudi Arabia’s biggest lender National Commercial Bank (NCB). The decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged also provided some floor to the market, although there were fewer drivers for blue-chip stocks to go higher following recent gains. Ma’aden shares rose almost 3 percent in early trade after it said its first-quarter net profit had more than doubled on higher sales and increased average realised prices of products. The company posted a net profit of 638 million Saudi riyals ($170.12 million) versus an average estimate of 372 million riyals, based on three analysts. Shares of NCB were up 0.2 percent after it reported on Wednesday a 10.5 percent rise in first-quarter net profit, above analysts’ forecasts as bad debt charges fell and fees rose. The Saudi index was flat in morning trade as valuation concerns kept some of the blue chip stocks subdued. Saudi Basic Industries was down 0.4 percent. The Saudi index has eased off from a more than two-year high hit last week and consolidating at current levels, while Dubai is stabilising after being weighed down by property stocks due to the emirate’s weak real estate market. Shares of Emaar Properties were up 0.5 percent in early trade, although Dubai’s benchmark index was flat. “Local markets need a major catalyst to get it moving again and if things don’t change soon then we are probably moving into a very slow month into Ramadan and summer season,” said Marie Salem, director of capital markets at FFA Dubai. In Qatar the benchmark index fell 1 percent in early trade, weighed by blue chips. Industries Qatar was down 0.6 pct and Qatar National dropped 1.3 percent. Both stocks have seen double-digit gains this year following decisions to increase foreign ownership limits to 49 percent from 25 percent. The higher ceilings are aimed at lifting stocks’ weight in emerging market indexes.

2018-05-03,"LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - A nuclear reactor at EDF Energy’s Hunterston B power plant in Scotland will remain offline for additional checks on cracks found in bricks in the reactor core, Britain’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said. In March, ONR was informed that additional keyway root cracks had been found during recent planned inspections of the graphite bricks that make up the reactor’s core The reactor has been offline since March and was due to come back online this month but EDF Energy has extended the outage until later this year, pending further assessment of the most recently identified keyway root cracks. “Inspections confirmed the expected presence of new keyway root cracks in the reactor core and also identified these happening at a slightly higher rate than modelled,” EDF Energy said in a statement. “EDF Energy has decided that, while Hunterston B Reactor 3 could return to operation from the current outage, it will remain offline while the company works with the regulator to ensure that the longer term safety case reflects the findings of the recent inspections and includes the results obtained from other analysis and modelling,” it added. Hunterston B in North Ayrshire, Scotland, has been generating electricity since 1976. Last year, it produced enough electricity for 1.8 million homes. It has two Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors. These are called Reactor 3 (Turbine Generator 7) and Reactor 4 (Turbine Generator 8). Reactors 1 and 2 are on the Hunterston A site and are being decommissioned. During the time it is offline, EDF might carry out additional planned routine maintenance. It expects the reactor to return to service “before the end of 2018”. EDF Energy’s outage website is showing an expected return date of Oct. 4. The extended outage will result in a reduction of its 2018 nuclear output of 3 terrawatt hours, the company said. The operation of EDF Energy’s remaining nuclear reactors in Britain is not affected. EDF Energy will need ONR’s permission to restart the reactor, and ONR will assess the adequacy of EDF’s safety case for the longer-term operation of the reactor, the regulator said.

2018-05-03,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has ordered three northern cities to stop approving new projects that would add to air pollution after they failed to meet air quality targets this past winter. The mayors of Handan in Hebei province and Jincheng and Yangquan in Shanxi province were given the orders after being summoned to a meeting at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in Beijing on Thursday to account for their actions during a recent campaign against smog. The meeting came after the cities failed to meet targets to cut levels of hazardous, breathable particles known as PM2.5 over the October 2017 to March 2018 period. Reuters was the first foreign media organization allowed to attend such a meeting, the ministry said.  “We will continue to fight against air pollution in the name of dignity and as our mission,” said Handan’s mayor, Wang Litong, who sat with the other mayors facing a line of eight environmental officials in a crowded meeting hall at the ministry. China launched a campaign last October to reduce average concentrations of PM2.5 by between 10-25 percent in 28 northern cities in an effort hit 2013-2017 air quality targets.   However, though Handan was ordered to reduce traffic, cut industrial output and curb coal use in a bid to cut PM2.5 by 20 percent over the period, it only achieved an average reduction of 15.7 percent.  Handan, a major steel- and chemical-producing city, also saw average PM2.5 concentrations increase 4.9 percent to 86 micrograms per cubic meter in 2017, with one district experiencing a 19.7 percent rise. Wang, the Handan mayor, said in a prepared speech that the city would make big sacrifices to tackle pollution.  “We will cut off our own hands to wage the last-ditch battle,” he said. He said the city planned to close another 300,000 tonnes of steelmaking capacity, 1.1 million tonnes of coal-producing capacity and 268 megawatts of coal-fired power by August. He said three officials have been fired and 14 given warnings.     The three cities have been ordered to come up with a detailed plan to “rectify” the situation, which they must submit to the environment ministry within 20 days, said Liu Changgen, a ministry official.  The major of Jincheng, Liu Feng, said the major coal and gas city would “rather sacrifice GDP growth” in order to curb air pollution, noting that Jincheng’s gross domestic product fell 9 percent as a result of production curbs in the first quarter, while fixed-asset investment slumped 41 percent. After struggling for years to force growth-obsessed local governments to toe the line, China’s beefed-up environment ministry now has the authority to hold officials to account for failing to comply with pollution policies.  The war on pollution is now a key performance indicator that could determine an official’s promotion prospects, and local authorities said last year that senior officials could even face dismissal if they failed to meet the winter targets. China has already held more than 2,000 local government officials to account after they were found to have violated environmental rules during extensive nationwide inspections ordered by Beijing beginning in 2016.  However, while hundreds of officials were given official reprimands, only a handful were actually fired or prosecuted.

2018-05-03," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - It may not sound like a lot, but the 18 percent of Rio Tinto shareholders that voted in favour of a resolution that effectively called on the company to do more to address climate change have launched a snowball at the top of a large mountain. The vote at Rio’s May 3 annual general meeting called upon the world’s second-largest mining company to review its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) and other lobby groups. While the vote was easily defeated, it sends a very clear message to natural resource companies that investors are going to be paying more attention to environmental credentials in the future. The 18 percent support was said by the resolution’s lead sponsor, Brynn O’Brien of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, to be the “highest vote ever on a similar issue,” the Sydney Morning Herald reported. It’s also worth noting that among the supporters of the resolution were life assurers such as Aegon and Legal & General, as well as pension funds like the Church of England Pensions Board. Investors such as these make up the backbone of institutional shareholders of companies such as Rio Tinto, and the clear trend in recent years has been toward calling on company boards to be clearer in their commitment to the health of the global environment. For its part Rio defended its climate stance, with new chairman Simon Thompson acknowledging that the company’s exit from coal mining has been partially driven by climate change concerns. But he also said Rio preferred to engage with groups such as the MCA rather than walk out over differences in climate change policies. But as can be seen from BHP’s recent decision to leave the World Coal Association, it’s becoming increasingly hard for mining companies that are trying to nurture progressive public images to remain engaged with groups that promote fossil fuels, and are often sceptical of scientific evidence that burning such fuels contributes to climate change. In some ways, targeting Rio is a tad odd given the company recently completed its exit from coal mining with the $2.25 billion sale in March of its Kestrel mine in Australia’s Queensland state. Rio, unlike BHP, decided that coal was no longer a long-term fit for its portfolio and took advantage of strong prices for the polluting fuel to sell its portfolio of mines. It’s inevitable that companies that remain in coal mining, especially those with listings in developed countries, such as BHP, Glencore and Anglo American, will face rising shareholder pressure. This will make it harder for companies to develop or expand coal mines and related infrastructure facilities, which is the obvious aim of the environmental groups and their supporters. The struggles of Indian conglomerate Adani Enterprises to build its planned Carmichael mine in Queensland and export the coal through its existing Abbot Point terminal is a case in point. Despite having all the necessary government approvals and claimed customers for the coal, Adani has so far been unable to attract financing for the project. In fact, the Carmichael mine looks increasingly unlikely to be developed as political support starts to wane in Australia, with Queensland’s Labor Party-led state government ruling out support and the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which backs the mine, behind in the polls ahead of next year’s likely election. Coal’s difficulties are also amplified by policies in the two major importing nations, China and India. China wants to use less of the fuel in order to improve air quality, and India wants to import less in order to improve its current account balance, however, it’s dreadful pollution may well result in more stringent environmental policies in the future. The irony of the success of anti-coal activism and stricter environmental rules is that coal is likely to become a scarcer commodity. Demand for seaborne supplies is likely to increase in coming years because of investment decisions made in previous years to build coal-fired plants, particularly in Asia. But it’s becoming harder to see coal-exporting countries being able to boost output, given political challenges in top shipper Australia and diversion of exports to local demand in number two exporter Indonesia. Coal prices have responded to this by remaining robust, with the Newcastle Weekly Index, a benchmark for Australian thermal coal, ending at $95.25 a tonne on April 27, the 40th straight week it has been above the $90 level. Perhaps the final irony for coal is that it is dying, but its going to be a profitable death for those who can stick it out to the end.

2018-05-03,"* Most Asia share markets slip before Sino-US trade discussions * Dollar just off multi-month highs as Fed stays the course * Oil prices ease as inventories swell, Iran decision looms By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 3 (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped on Thursday as hopes waned for real progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks, while the U.S. dollar consolidated recent bumper gains after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed the outlook for more rate hikes. Souring the mood were reports the Trump administration is considering executive action to restrict some Chinese companies’ ability to sell telecoms equipment in the United States. Talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are due to kick off later on Thursday. However, a breakthrough was viewed as highly unlikely, especially as the U.S. embassy said their delegation would leave as early as Friday evening. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, while South Korean stocks eased 0.4 percent. Chinese blue chips lost 0.1 percent to be not far from an eight-month low hit in April. Japan’s Nikkei was closed for a holiday, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 barely budged. Wall Street had wobbled on Wednesday as the threat of U.S. restrictions on Chinese telecom companies fuelled investor concerns about worsening trade relations. The Dow ended down 0.72 percent. The S&P 500 also lost 0.72 percent and the Nasdaq 0.42 percent. The Fed policy meeting ended with no change, as expected, while the central bank expressed confidence a recent rise in inflation to near target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June. “The statement carried only modest changes in wording, but they were meaningful nonetheless, highlighting that the Fed is optimistic on the outlook and intent on continuing to raise rates at a gradual pace,” said Westpac analyst Elliot Clarke. Yet the Fed also emphasised the inflation target was “symmetric”, suggesting it was not inclined to speed up its tightening plans. “The Fed sees little reason to be concerned with inflation marginally above its 2.0 percent target, particularly after such a long period of underperformance,” Clarke said. Westpac, like the market, expects two more hikes this year. The Fed statement was not quite as hawkish as some had wagered on and caused a dip in the dollar, though sentiment remained bullish given U.S. rates were still clearly heading higher while those in Europe and Japan lagged far behind. The euro was last at $1.1979 having hit a 15-week trough at $1.1936 on Wednesday, uncomfortably close to the low for the year at $1.1915. The dollar also scored a three-month peak on the yen at 110.05 overnight, before edging back to 109.66. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was trading at 92.542, after reaching the highest since late December at 92.834. In the Treasury market, yields dipped slightly as a quarterly refunding programme of $73 billion came in short of expectations, reducing the pressure on prices from the torrent of supply. Oil prices slipped on swelling U.S. crude inventories and as investors remained cautious ahead of the May 12 deadline for the U.S. to ratify the Iran nuclear deal.

2018-05-03,"(Reuters) - Australian gas producer Santos Ltd (STO.AX) said on Thursday it expects to complete talks with suitor Harbour Energy within a few weeks, as the U.S. private equity-backed firm finalizes due diligence on its $10.4 billion takeover offer. Chairman Keith Spence said there was no certainty that the Harbour proposal, Santos’ fourth unsolicited bid since August 2017, would lead to a binding offer that would win the support of the board. “I expect the due diligence and engagement process will be concluded within a few weeks,” Spence told the company’s annual general meeting. Harbour Energy approached Santos in April with a takeover offer of $4.98 a share, which at the time was worth A$6.50. Thanks to a rise in the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar in recent weeks, the proposed bid is now worth A$6.64.  Santos on Thursday also said it would sell its non-core Asian assets to London-listed Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR.L) for $221 million, and said it plans to restart paying dividends if business trends and oil price gains are sustained.           Under the Ophir Energy deal, the firm will exit Vietnam,  Malaysia and Bangladesh. Funds from the sale will be used to help pay down debt, which stood at $2.5 billion at the end of March.    Santos said its share of production from the assets being sold in first quarter of 2018 was 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent. The company said it expects to meet its target to reduce debt to $2 billion early in the second half of 2018, more than a year ahead of plan, which should help it revive its dividend. “If the performance of the business continues on this trend and current oil price levels are sustained, the Board will look to restore dividends based on 2018 financial results,” Spence told shareholders.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $67.65 per barrel at 0004 GMT. Brent crude oil futures were at $73.04 per barrel, down 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. Prices were pulled down by a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showing U.S. crude inventories jumped by 6.2 million barrels to 435.96 million barrels C-STK-T-EIA in the week to April 27, marking a 2018 high. “The (EIA) report showed a much larger than expected crude build for last week as well as an unexpected build in gasoline inventories,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. U.S. oil production also hit a fresh record of 10.62 million barrels per day (bpd), a jump of more than a quarter since mid-2016. The United States now produces more crude oil than top exporter and OPEC-kingpin Saudi Arabia. Only Russia currently pumps more oil, at around 11 million bpd.

2018-05-03,"ULAANBAATAR, May 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With about 100 sheep and goats, Jugder Samdan makes just enough to scrape by as a nomadic herder in Mongolia, basking in the sun as he watches over his animals, but he worries about the future. Samdan has seen major changes during his 70 plus years on the vast semi-arid grassland, or steppe, in central Mongolia’s Arkhangai province, with shifts in politics and society impacting one of the world’s last remaining nomadic cultures. But what most concerns Samdan and fellow herders is climate change, as droughts, harsh winters, and over-grazing threaten traditional livelihoods and drives younger people to the over-crowded capital, fuelling pollution, crime and mental illness. “Everybody moves to the city,” Samdan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation wrapped in a felt jacket outside his ger, a traditional white, circular herder’s tent or yurt made of felt. “There are too many people there.” About one quarter of Mongolians still live a traditional nomadic life in the Central Asian country sandwiched between Russia and China which has four times the land mass of Germany but is thinly-populated with about three million people. But life is changing fast and about 68,000 herders a year have moved to the city since 2001, according to Ulaanbaatar’s Deputy Mayor Batbayasgalan Jantsan, setting up sprawling informal ger districts lacking facilities like water and power. The population of Ulaanbaatar has almost doubled in the last 10 years to 1.4 million people, according to the Mongolian National Statistics Office, with about 55 percent of the city’s population - or 750,000 people - living in ger districts. “That’s almost an entire province,” said Jantsan in an interview in his office in central Ulaanbaatar, a city shrouded in a dense smog during winter months due to air pollution. As winter temperatures can drop below minus 30 Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), ger dwellers burn raw coal to stay warm, driving pollution levels eight to 14 times higher than global guidelines, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Air pollution is estimated by the WHO to cause more than 4,000 deaths a year in Mongolia and is now one of the nation’s most challenging issues, with the burning of coal accounting for 80 percent of air pollution from November to April. “It’s a threat to national security,” said Jantsan. Bazarragchaa Altantsetseg, a land use specialist at land consultancy Vector Maps LLC, said dwellings were traditionally designed to move in Mongolia and it was not after Soviet control in 1921 that fixed properties became more prevalent. The Russians also had a major impact on herding. The state owned the nation’s herd and grazing land, with herders paid a wage for working in collective farms. The herd wsa kept at about 25 million in line with land capacity assessments. But that changed after Mongolia became a parliamentary democracy in 1990 and privatisation followed, prompting a surge in numbers with the herd hitting 56 million in 2015, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). “Since 1990 everything was chaos ... everyone wanted to have the land ... and animals,” Altantsetseg said. Some herders have welcomed the new post-Soviet system. “The conditions are fair for everyone. Compared to the previous regime you can work hard to have a better life, you can grow your herd and get a car,” Samdan said. But the dramatic increase in the herd has brought problems of over-grazing exacerbated by desertification, as witnessed by Samdan’s daughter Altantsetseg Jugdur, aged in her 30s. “When I was a child ... you couldn’t see the animals in the grass. Now look at what we have. Only dust and soil,” she said. Herders’ accounts of climate change are backed by data with a 2014 report from Japan’s Ministry of the Environment stating Mongolia’s annual mean temperature rose by 2.14 percent between 1940 and 2008 with drier weather leading to more dust storms. The report also highlighted an increasing frequency of cold and snow damage from so-called dzuds since the early 1990s - the name for a severe winter that comes after a summer drought. “If there is grass beneath the snow then the animals will survive. When there is no grass beneath the snow then it is dzud,” explained herder Altangerel Dolgor. Mongolia’s recent winter killed more than 700,000 livestock left weak after a drought last year, the highest toll since 2011, according to the country’s statistics bureau. The steppe around Tuvshruulekh is littered with animals that have frozen to death. Stray dogs and groups of vultures dot the landscape scavenging the frozen carcasses. Samdan said he can read the signs of climate change around him. Lizards are appearing for the first time while some plants are disappearing, including those used in traditional medicines. “Before we used to have a leaf which we would boil and drink for stomach problems. Now I can’t find it anymore,” he said. But it is not just the damage to livestock and the land concerning herders but social changes. Bayarmaa Vanchindorj, deputy director of the National Mental Health Centre, said there has been rising numbers of cases of addiction, depression, trafficking and sexual abuse of children. Thousands of Mongolians protested in front of parliament in Ulaanbaatar in March to demand more action to prevent child abuse after the widely-reported rape of a young boy. “Mongolians for many centuries roamed unlimited spaces of their own free will. So I think urbanisation took its toll on people’s minds,” she said. Narantuya Nijir is one example. She lost all her livestock in a 2010 dzud and now lives in a ger in her landlord’s yard at the edge of Ulaanbaatar where the city meets the open pasture. “It’s quite difficult living in someone else’s yard. Even when they don’t give us a hard time we worry a lot,” she said. Up the road lives Samdan’s son Chudur with his young family. He has adapted to city life better, having bought a small plot of land where he has just built a small house, in the process learning the skills to start a small double-glazing business. Back on the steppe Samdan concedes herding is a tough life but his pleas for young people to stay go unheeded. His 16-year-old grandson Tsendmandakh Altantsetseg has no romantic view of the traditional nomadic life. “Nature is changing. The grasslands are turning into deserts. Rivers and streams are disappearing,” he said. “I’m planning to go to university in the city after I graduate. I’ll follow my profession, work in the city and build a life there.” (Reporting by Max Baring, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mongolia-climatechange-herders/feature-urban-nomads-mongolian-herders-battle-new-future-as-leave-the-land-for-the-city-idUKL8N1S757R,03 May 2018,"ULAANBAATAR, May 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With about
