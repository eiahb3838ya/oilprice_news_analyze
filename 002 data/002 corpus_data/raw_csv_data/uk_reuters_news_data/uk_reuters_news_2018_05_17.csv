2018-05-17,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Finding roughnecks remains a challenge for oil drillers as rising crude prices increase demand for their services, oilfield executives said on Thursday at a conference in Houston. Oilfield service suppliers cut tens of thousands of workers following the 2014 oil-price collapse, and skilled employees have moved to other industries or are no longer interested. A worker shortage is helping drive up service costs for oil producers, especially in the hottest shale fields.   “Recruitment and staffing is a big challenge. We’re aggressively focused on recruiting people,” said Kevin Neveu, chief executive at Precision Drilling Corp (PD.TO). The Calgary, Alberta-based company added about 2,000 workers last year.  U.S. oil prices CLc1 have rebounded to over $70 a barrel from lows of around $26 a barrel in 2016, aided by rising global demand and supply cuts from OPEC-member countries and other exporters. That has spurred a rush to drill new wells in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and the Bakken Shale of North Dakota.  In Texas, the unemployment rate was 4 percent in March, near its historic low, versus 4.6 percent a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  “I was quite shocked at how fast we ran out of people from our recall list,” said Mike Nuss, an executive vice president at driller Ensign Energy Services Inc.  “We’ve had to scramble and resurrect our training,” he said in an interview at the International Association of Drilling Contractors’ conference. A study led last year by the University of Houston found 25 percent of dismissed workers had moved to another industry and 55 percent were considering it.  While drillers hustle to secure more workers, they also need  employees with high-tech skills. Noble Corp (NE.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N), for example, recently announced plans for a fully digitized drilling vessel.  “We’re moving to an era where the machines do the work. They run the analysis and they ultimately do the learning,” said Bob Newhouse, CEO of Newhouse Consultants, which advises oil and gas companies. “We’ve got to have the right people who can look at the data, look at the information and make the right decisions.” Although Precision Drilling fielded thousands of resumes last year, Neveu said he worries younger workers may shun the industry due to its boom-and-bust reputation.  “A big take-away for us is making our industry attractive for the next generation of people working on rigs,” he said.

2018-05-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took steps on Thursday to roll back and delay Obama-era rules aimed at improving safety at chemical plants, which had come in response to a 2013 explosion at a fertilizer plant in Texas that killed 15 people. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt introduced a proposal to rescind the measures, saying it would save the industry tens of millions of dollars a year and “better address potential security risks.”  “The rule proposes to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens, address the concerns of stakeholders and emergency responders on the ground, and save Americans roughly $88 million a year,” Pruitt said in a statement. The proposal would also delay some of the compliance dates of the Obama-era amendments and cancel certain provisions that address accident prevention. It was the latest in a string of Trump administration proposals aimed at rolling back environmental regulations put in place by former Democratic President Barack Obama, which industry groups have said added to their regulatory burdens. In January 2017, before Republican President Donald Trump took office, the EPA introduced several changes to companies’ risk management plans they submit to the agency, including requiring more analysis of safety technology, third-party audits and incident investigation analyses and stricter emergency preparedness requirements. Last February, the EPA received a petition from a coalition of chemical and energy industry groups, including the American Chemistry Council and American Petroleum Institute, to delay and reconsider the Obama-era amendments. The explosion at the West Texas fertilizer plant killed 15 people, including 12 firefighters. Scores of others were injured and more than 500 homes were damaged in the blast, with total damaged estimated at more than $100 million.  The source of the explosion was ammonium nitrate stored in a wooden container at the plant, investigators said. The EPA press release announcing the proposed changes to the Obama administration amendments, included a statement from the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  “The Obama Administration would have imposed significant new costs on industry without identifying or quantifying the safety benefits to be achieved through new requirements,” the lobby group’s president, Eric Byer, said.  The United Steelworkers union said in a statement on Thursday it strongly opposed the proposed rollbacks. “USW members work in dangerous facilities that house huge quantities of hazardous chemicals. We are strongly opposed to this deregulation that endangers workers and their communities,” the group said. The proposed rule will be open to public comment for 60 days  and a public hearing on the rule is scheduled for June 14.

2018-05-17,"TORONTO/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau on Thursday highlighted the country’s pension funds as possible investors in Kinder Morgan Inc’s (KMI.N) pipeline expansion, but industry sources were skeptical about attracting new investors. Morneau on Wednesday raised the prospect of foreign funding, saying “plenty of investors would be interested” if Kinder Morgan Canada (KML.TO) walked away from the project. “We have very sophisticated Canadian pension funds and institutional investors that have a high level of understanding of how you embark on infrastructure projects and a great deal of experience around the world in bringing those projects to completion,” Morneau told Reuters in an interview. Morneau declined to say whether the government was in active discussions with potential investors. Kinder Morgan has set a May 31 deadline for Ottawa to provide assurances it can proceed with the expansion that will more than double the capacity of its Trans Mountain line from Alberta to British Columbia. British Columbia, through which most of the pipeline runs, opposes it on environmental grounds. The issue could spark one of the biggest crises for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal government approved the expansion. Trudeau says oil producers are losing C$15 billion ($11.7 billion) a year because pipeline bottlenecks mean they cannot get crude to export markets. Morneau said the government is intervening because of the “exceptional” circumstances around the project. In a separate interview, Mark Machin, chief executive of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, said the pension fund manager, the country’s biggest, could consider the project. “If it’s an opportunity that has decent returns then we’ll look at it,” Machin said, adding the government’s pledge to protect investors against political risk was helpful. A Canadian energy industry source who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter said Morneau’s comments about potential new investors were puzzling.  U.S. companies are likely more focused on easing pipeline bottlenecks south of the border and are not interested in taking on the Trans Mountain project, which faces fierce opposition, the source said. Hundreds of people have been arrested in Burnaby, the British Columbia port where the pipeline ends. “It doesn’t matter who the owner is; even if it’s the federal government, you’re not getting the grandma off the picket line in Burnaby,” said the source. A Calgary, Alberta-based oil trader said Morneau’s assurances struck the wrong chord. “I don’t want the government involved in owning or funding a pipeline. Two governments from now, who knows what they would do with it? Just the wrong message to the industry, really.” Kinder Morgan Canada already operates the Trans Mountain pipeline and it is unclear whether it would welcome a rival taking over the expansion. An option might be to let an overseas company to step in, but foreign investment in Canada’s energy sector could be a sensitive issue. Andrew Botterill, national oil and gas leader at Deloitte, which advises energy companies, said investors think Canadian pipelines and other resource projects generally face high political risk. “That’s the type of risk that makes it very difficult for companies to come in and invest in Canada, when they’re looking globally for stability,” he said. A source with deep ties to the natural resources sector who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter suggested Canada’s recently created Infrastructure Bank might be the best way to invest. The agency is open for business but has yet to facilitate financing for any project. Morneau and the Infrastructure Bank declined to comment on whether it could be involved.

2018-05-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose on Thursday to their highest level in about seven years, extending this week’s bond market selloff and pushing the U.S. dollar to a four-month peak against the yen. Oil prices topped $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014 before pulling back. Wall Street’s main stock indexes slipped, wobbling amid trade jitters as the United States and China hold talks. European stock markets climbed and Britain’s FTSE 100 notched a record closing high.  The rising U.S. Treasury yields have been a driver across financial markets this week and come as data shows a strong U.S. economy that could indicate firming inflation The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield rose above 3.1 percent, continuing a surge from earlier in the week.      “I think it’s the same thing we have had really for the past couple of weeks: The inflation trade is being put on,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. The rise in bond rates, the dollar and oil “is being driven by the same backdrop, which is the U.S. economy is hitting on all cylinders,” Todd added. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 54.95 points, or 0.22 percent, to 24,713.98, the S&P 500 lost 2.33 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,720.13, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.82 points, or 0.21 percent, to 7,382.47. The major indexes for the month of May so far are all up more than 2 percent. The rise in yields “has added a little bit of volatility in markets, no question. But I don’t think it would be enough to derail the recent move in stocks,” said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. Shares of retailer Walmart Inc and network gear maker Cisco System Inc fell after both companies reported quarterly results, weighing on indexes. Energy shares rose 1.3 percent on the higher oil prices. U.S. President Donald Trump said that China and other countries had become “very spoiled” on trade, as U.S. and Chinese officials hold high-level talks in Washington on trade ties. “I think this trade mess is certainly affecting the mood and uncertainty, and it seems to me the market is negative because this whole trade debate with tariffs,” said Jim Bell, president of Bell Investment Advisors in Oakland, California.  Strong oil prices helped Britain’s top share index, the FTSE 100, seal its highest ever closing level as it climbed 0.7 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stock index rose 0.62 percent, while Italy’s benchmark index bounced 0.3 percent following heavy losses on Wednesday on concerns that a new government could relax fiscal discipline.     MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.01 percent. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose, extending this week’s bond market selloff, as traders and investors have not reached a consensus on whether it was time to buy or if the market was vulnerable to more selling. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 5/32 in price to yield 3.1131 percent, from 3.095 percent late on Wednesday. “The market is trying to figure where the bottom is. At this point, it is not clear,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed income with D.A. Davidson in Seattle. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.1 percent. The Japanese yen was flat versus the U.S. currency at 110.79 per dollar. Concerns that Iranian exports could fall because of renewed U.S. sanctions, reducing supply in an already tightening market, drove oil above $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014. Brent settled up 2 cents at $79.30 a barrel, after rising as high as $80.50. U.S. crude settled flat at $71.49 a barrel.

2018-05-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries about rising oil prices have begun to creep into U.S. retailers’ earnings calls, and investors are raising concerns that those costs may slow discretionary spending among Americans and push down the performance of the retailers’ shares. Oil prices climbed on Thursday to their highest levels since November 2014, with brent crude touching $80 (£59.2) per barrel and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) surpassing $71 per barrel. [O/R] Retailers have begun to address the possible impact of oil’s rise on their businesses. In a media call after its quarterly report on Thursday, Walmart Inc (WMT.N) said some consumers may be feeling pressure from higher gas prices, though demand remained strong. Walmart and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) also have pointed to increased transportation costs stemming from more expensive fuel and a shortage of drivers, factors that have put pressure on their margins. Walmart’s lower margins sent its shares falling 1.9 percent on Thursday. Though consumer sentiment remains strong for now, several investors said, oil prices could threaten consumer spending if they continue to rise, offsetting the positive effects of 2017’s U.S. tax overhaul. “The year-over-year numbers now are pretty dramatic in terms of the price of oil, so it is going to continuously feed in over the next few months, and people are going to notice,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston. Several investors pointed to $80 per barrel for U.S. WTI  crude as the threshold that could dampen consumer spending. “I think another $10 would put the issue into sharper perspective for more people,” said John Carey, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. But the effects of more expensive oil may vary from retailer to retailer. “A store like Walmart will feel it before a store like Macy’s,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago, because Macy’s attracts comparatively more wealthy customers. Macy’s Inc (M.N) shares jumped 10.8 percent on Wednesday after the department store reported robust same-store sales growth in its first-quarter results. Discount retailers such as Dollar General Corp (DG.N) may also be among the first to feel a pinch from rising oil as budget-conscious shoppers cut back on spending, Kinahan said. But if oil continues to climb, those stores, along with Walmart, may eventually see benefits as higher-income consumers tighten their belts and look for deals, he added. Indeed, other investors said, some retailers may show resilience as oil takes up more of consumers’ budgets. “You have to look at each company individually,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. “I continue to think that consumer discretionary companies with pricing power should fare pretty well.” Reporting by April Joyner; Additional reporting by Nandita Bose, Chuck Mikolajczak and Sinéad Carew in New York; Editing by Will Dunham",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-oil/as-oil-rises-warnings-emerge-from-u-s-retailers-idUKL2N1SO1W0,17 May 2018,"Worries about rising oil prices

2018-05-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed above $80 a barrel on Thursday for the first time since November 2014, before retreating on a stronger dollar and climbing U.S. output to end unchanged.     A rapid slide in oil supply from Venezuela, concern that U.S. sanctions will disrupt exports from Iran, and falling global inventories have all combined to push oil prices up nearly 20 percent in 2018.  The U.S. dollar hit its highest level in four months against the yen JPY= as yields on benchmark U.S. government bonds hit a seven-year high. A stronger dollar .DXY makes oil more expensive for importing nations such as those in Asia, which are facing a trillion dollar bill for their imports this year as demand in the continent reaches a record high. Brent crude futures LCOc1 reached an intraday high of $80.50 a barrel, but later gave up most gains to settle up 2 cents at $79.30 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled unchanged at $71.49, after earlier also hitting their highest since November 2014 at $72.30 a barrel. Global inventories of crude and fuel have dropped sharply in recent months owing to robust demand and OPEC-led production cuts.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC global producers, that have curbed output since the start of 2017, will next meet to discuss supply policy in Vienna in June.  However, Venezuela’s economic crisis, and the prospect of additional U.S. sanctions following its May 20 elections could hit the market further. “I expect that Venezuelan production will continue to decline and the upcoming elections hold the spectre of the U.S. imposing additional sanctions on Venezuela that may hasten the loss of supply,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, a consultancy in Houston. He said Iranian oil sales could plunge by 300,000 to 500,000 bpd in the next six weeks as well, after U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision this month to withdraw from an international nuclear deal with Iran and revive sanctions that could limit crude exports from OPEC’s third-largest producer. Record domestic oil output and exports have capped the rally in the United States, and led to a rising premium for Brent above WTI, which traded at $8.20 a barrel on Thursday, the widest spread since April 2015. <0#WTCLc1-LCOc1> U.S. crude output has soared 27 percent in the last two years to a record 10.72 million barrels per day, putting it within reach of top producer Russia’s 11 million bpd. That has not been enough to stop oil prices rallying, energy ministers of OPEC’s largest producer Saudi Arabia and its neighbor and fellow OPEC member United Arab Emirates to note that the market remains well supplied. The two ministers, in a joint statement, blamed volatility in prices on international political tensions. They plan to meet their Russian counterpart in Saint Petersburg in a week to discuss the oil market. Global oil inventories were expected to drop further as the peak demand summer driving season nears, offsetting increases in U.S. shale output, Bernstein analysts said. Several banks have in recent days raised their oil price forecasts, citing tighter supplies and strong demand. Further supporting prices, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) said it was halting crude exports from a major Nigerian pipeline. On the flip side, high oil prices would hurt consumption, the International Energy Agency warned on Wednesday as it lowered its global oil demand growth forecast for 2018 to 1.4 million bpd from 1.5 million bpd. [EIA/S] The IEA said global oil demand would average 99.2 million bpd in 2018. U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said consumption would cross 100 million bpd during the peak summer period.

2018-05-17,"SINGAPORE/MUMBAI/MANILA (Reuters) - The cost of Asia’s growing thirst for oil will surpass $1 trillion (£740.2 billion) this year, about twice as much as in 2015 and 2016, as oil prices touch $80 per barrel and continental demand hits a record. Oil prices have risen nearly 20 percent since January and topped $80 per barrel in intraday trading on Thursday LCOc1 for the first time since 2014. [O/R]  With the U.S. dollar .DXY - in which most oil is traded - strengthening, concerns are rising about the size of the hit to economies from higher energy prices, especially in import-reliant Asia. Surging costs could feed inflation and hurt both consumers and companies.  “Asia is most vulnerable to an oil price spike,” Canadian investment bank RBC Capital Markets warned in a note this month, after oil prices hit their highest since November 2014.  Asia-Pacific consumes more than 35 percent of the 100 million barrels of oil the world uses each day, according to industry data, and its share is steadily rising. Asia is also the world’s smallest oil-producing region, accounting for less than 10 percent of output.  (Graphic: reut.rs/2wLchCf) U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said this week that diesel use contributes 10-20 percent to cash costs for miners, while oil contributes from 4 percent to 50 percent to the cost of power generation, depending on a company’s or country’s fuel mix.  “A rising oil price therefore shifts the entire cost curve higher,” it said. China is by far Asia’s - and the world’s - biggest importer of oil, ordering 9.6 million barrels per day in April. That’s almost 10 percent of global consumption.  At current prices, this amounts to a Chinese oil import bill of $768 million per day, $23 billion per month - a whopping $280 billion a year.  Other Asian countries are even more exposed to rising oil prices. Most damage will be done to countries like India and Vietnam, which not only rely heavily on imports, but also where national wealth is not yet large enough to absorb sudden increases in fuel costs.  “Poorer countries with limited borrowing capacity may face financing difficulty amid higher import bills,” RBC said. Unless fuel is heavily subsidized, households and businesses in poorer countries are also more vulnerable to rising oil prices than they are in wealthier nations. In developing economies such as India, Vietnam or the Philippines, fuel costs eat up around 8-9 percent of an average person's salary, according to Reuters research and figures from statistics portal Numbeo. That compares to just 1-2 percent in wealthy countries such as Japan or Australia. (Graphic: reut.rs/2wLchCf) The surge in oil prices has a particularly big impact on transport and logistics companies. One such firm in Asia is courier LBC Express Holdings (LBC.PS) in the Philippines.  “LBC has been intently watching the movement of crude oil prices ... What we, at LBC, are preparing for are the effects an oil price increase may have on our carriers: airlines, shipping lines, trucking companies,” its Chief Financial Officer Enrique V. Rey Jr said.  The high oil price “challenges us to improve our own efficiencies to achieve better economies of scale and maintain our margins,” he said.  Some firms say they will pass on any higher costs to consumers. Chryss Alfonsus Damuy, president and chief executive at Philippine firm Chelsea Logistics (CLC.PS), said his firm could be affected by higher oil prices, but “we can pass on the effect to consumer via price adjustments.”  Others said if they burden consumers with higher costs, they will lose clients. Ashish Savla, owner of 50-truck strong Pravin Roadways in Mumbai, India, said diesel accounts for more than half of his company’s expenses, and that it was difficult to pass rising expenses on to customers. “Diesel prices have jumped 16 percent in a year, but I couldn’t raise freight charges by 5 percent. If I charge more, clients will use cheaper railroads,” Savla said. Anil Mittal, who runs a container logistics company and is a member of Bombay Goods Transport Association, said his firm was “already operating at wafer-thin margins” before prices rose.  The “diesel price hike has hit our business hard,” he said. Many small transport firms like his “are struggling to pay back bank loans they took to buy trucks.”  Given the economic costs and its reliance on imports, economists say it is time for Asia to limit its exposure to oil. “It is very important for Asia to reduce its oil dependency and increase its energy efficiency ... to protect itself from future oil shocks,” RBC Capital Markets said.

2018-05-17,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba, May 17 (Reuters) - The Canadian government’s optimism that outside investors would be interested in taking over a Kinder Morgan Canada oil pipeline project if the company pulls out might be misplaced, said energy industry sources and analysts. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Wednesday that Canada was prepared to cover some losses the firm might suffer if the proposed C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) expansion of its Trans Mountain line was delayed and predicted “plenty of investors would be interested” in stepping in if need be. Kinder Morgan Canada has said it will ditch the Trans Mountain expansion by May 31 unless Ottawa dispels the uncertainties over the project, which the provincial government in British Columbia strongly opposes on environmental grounds.

Wall Street’s main stock indexes fell, while European stock markets climbed and Britain’s FTSE 100 notched a record closing high. The focus this week has centered on rising U.S. Treasury yields, as investors point to data reflecting a strong U.S. economy that could indicate firming inflation. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield hovered above 3.1 percent, continuing a surge higher earlier in the week. “I think it’s the same thing we have had really for the past couple of weeks: The inflation trade is being put on,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. Looking at the rise in bond rates, the dollar and oil, Todd said, “all that is being driven by the same backdrop, which is the U.S. economy is hitting on all cylinders.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 117.14 points, or 0.47 percent, to 24,651.79, the S&P 500 lost 10.11 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,712.35 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 43.17 points, or 0.58 percent, to 7,355.12. Shares of retailer Walmart and network gear maker Cisco fell after their respective results, weighing on indexes.  Energy shares rose 0.9 percent, bolstered by higher oil prices. Investors were also watching trade developments between the United States and China, as the two countries launched a second round of talks to try to avert a damaging tariff war. The yield premium investors demand for holding Italian bonds over Germany hit its highest since January, as two anti-establishment Italian parties moved closer to a government deal that would ramp up spending. Italian stocks gained 0.3 percent after selling off sharply on Wednesday when details of a draft coalition document showed plans to ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros ($294.70 billion) in debt. Strong oil prices helped Britain’s top share index, the FTSE 100, seal its highest ever closing level as it climbed 0.7 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stock index rose 0.62 percent, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.15 percent. U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields climbed following a steep bond market selloff earlier in the week. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 3.1094 percent, from 3.095 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.09 percent. The Japanese yen weakened 0.24 percent versus the U.S. currency at 110.68 per dollar. “The near-term picture remains positive for the dollar with Treasury yields showing few signs of topping, a move that makes the buck a more enticing bet to income-seekers,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. Oil prices hit $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014 on concerns that Iranian exports could fall because of renewed U.S. sanctions, reducing supply in an already tightening market. Brent was last at $79.18 per barrel, down 0.13 percent on the day, after rising as high as $80.50. U.S. crude fell 0.34 percent to $71.25. “The geopolitical noise and escalation fears are here to stay,” said Norbert Rücker, head of macro and commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. “Supply concerns are top of mind after the United States left the Iran nuclear deal.” Spot gold added 0.1 percent to $1,290.84 an ounce, after touching a new low for the year during the session.

The company, a unit of Singapore-based petrochemical producer Indorama, is seeking to double annual output of urea fertilizer from 1.4 million tonnes to 2.8 million tonnes, the statement said. Once a net importer of fertilizer, Nigerian production has grown in recent years. In 2017, it exported around 700,000 tonnes of urea to markets in West African as well as North and South America. Indorama Fertilizer’s increased output will target the export market but also seek to boost domestic supply to drive down prices. Nigerian farmers still use much less fertilizer than their global and African peers due to high costs, leading to low crop yields that forced the West African nation to spend around $6 billion on food imports annually. The AfDB financed the building of a Indorama Fertilizer plant via a previous loan in 2013. It went online in 2016.

2018-05-17,"(Reuters) - Most U.S. regions are prepared to meet power and natural gas demand this summer, but shortages are possible in Southern California due to low hydropower and gas supplies and Texas following the retirement of several coal plants, federal energy regulators said in a report on Thursday. In Southern California, staff at the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said lower-than-average hydro generation may create challenges as natural gas-fired generation - the replacement for hydro production shortfalls in past years - may be limited due to reduced gas storage capacity and local pipeline outages in the region. Nationwide, the staff said North American reliability coordinators forecast demand for electricity from the grid would be about the same as last summer due to increased use of demand response programs to reduce usage and distributed energy resources like home solar panels. If the forecasts for warmer than normal weather this summer are correct, the report said gas burned to produce electricity could top 2016’s record high due to the addition of over 16,000 megawatts of new gas-fired generation and low gas prices, making gas a cheaper fuel than coal in many regions. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. The report said energy firms were expected to add over 25,000 MW of mostly gas and renewable generation through the end of the summer. That new capacity will replace much of the roughly 14,000 MW of generation that has retired since May 2017, including about 10,800 MW of coal-fired capacity. But the new plants are not necessarily located where the old plants retired. The shutdown over the past six months of the 1,187-MW Big Brown, 1,980-MW Monticello and 1,282-MW Sandow coal plants in Texas helped cut its reserve margin to 10.92 percent, which is below the grid’s 13.75 percent target. The Texas grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), said it expects to have sufficient operational tools to manage tight reserves and maintain system reliability. Those tools include using a previously mothballed power plant, imports from other regions and consumer conservation and demand response efforts. In California, the grid operator said it also expects to use demand response programs and consumer conservation to mitigate tight supply conditions this summer. Gas supplies in Southern California are expected to remain tight this summer due to limitations on Aliso Canyon, the biggest gas storage field in the state, and gas pipeline outages and reductions.

2018-05-17,"SOFIA (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron ruled out on Thursday any trade war with the United States over its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal as a wave of European companies quit business with Tehran, fearing the global reach of U.S. sanctions.        European Union leaders united behind the 2015 accord, and Brussels announced it would launch a legal process banning EU-based firms from complying with the sanctions that President Donald Trump has reimposed on Iran.  However, corporations face the choice of trading with the biggest economy in the world, the United States, or with Iran, risking sanctions and massive fines as well as losing access to the dominant U.S. financial system.  Even the European Commission’s financial services chief said that using EU powers to ban banks from following the sanctions that Trump announced on May 8 would be of limited use, given the global reach of finance. Macron acknowledged the predicament of firms wanting to trade with Iran or invest there, especially multinationals with close business ties to the United States. But he made clear bigger matters were at stake. “We won’t start a strategic trade war against the U.S. about Iran,” he said on arriving for a second day of a European Union summit in Bulgaria. “We’re not going to take counter-sanctions against U.S. companies, it wouldn’t make sense.” French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) said on Wednesday it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project in Iran unless it secured a waiver from the sanctions. Tehran had repeatedly hailed the project as a symbol of the nuclear accord’s success.  “The French president is not the CEO of Total,” Macron said. “My priority is not trade or finance in Iran. It’s geopolitics, avoiding escalation, doing everything to open up Iran’s economy and society.”  The EU wants to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran  and world powers, which lifted most of the international  sanctions that have badly hurt the Iranian economy in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. But while Europe sees the pact as vital for international security, Trump denounced it as “the worst deal ever” for failing to curb Iran’s separate ballistic missile programme and its influence in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. EU officials say there is no easy way to protect EU firms and banks from the U.S. sanctions that Trump has reimposed and some big names are already heading for the door. As Macron spoke in Sofia, the world’s largest container shipping firm, A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), said it would quit Iran. Still, EU leaders put on a brave face, sticking by the Iran accord despite their weak hand in defying the will of the country that issues the dollar, the dominant currency of international trade. “All European Union member states are still backing this agreement, despite the fact the United States has decided not to, and we will continue talks with the United States,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters at the EU summit. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU executive would launch on Friday the process of activating a “blocking statute” - legislation banning EU companies from complying with U.S. sanctions on Iran and which does not recognise any court rulings that enforce American penalties.  But the EU will have to swim against a strong tide. Soren Skou, chief executive of Danish-based A.P. Moller-Maersk, said his firm would have to accept the sanctions. “With the sanctions the Americans are to impose, you can’t do business in Iran if you also have business in the U.S., and we have that on a large scale,” Skou told Reuters. “I don’t know the exact timing details, but I am certain that we’re also going to shut down.”  Europe’s “blocking statute” has never been used until now and its rules are vague and difficult to enforce.  “The EU blocking regulation could be of limited effectiveness there, given the international nature of banking system and especially the exposure of large systemic banks to U.S. financial system and U.S. dollar transactions,” financial services commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told the European Parliament. Italian steel manufacturer Danieli (DANI.MI) announced it has halted work on finding financial coverage for orders it won in Iran worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion). “With the withdrawal of the U.S. from the treaty the banks are no longer ready to fund Iranian projects for fear of secondary sanctions,” Danieli CEO Alessandro Trivillin said. Finnish mining technology company Outotec (OTE1V.HE) said U.S. sanctions would slow down and complicate its ties with Iran but it was too early to say if it would leave.      Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said Tehran would remain committed to the deal, which China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany also signed, provided those powers ensured Iran was protected from sanctions.

2018-05-17,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia has ordered the evacuation of nearly 5,000 people living along the Cauca river in the northern part of the country after construction problems at a hydroelectric dam prompted fears of massive flooding. Heavy rains have increased water levels in the Cauca, which feeds the Ituango Dam in Antioquia province, the country’s largest-ever hydroelectric project. Problems with filling mechanisms and tunnels at the dam have authorities on high alert. “We are working jointly with all institutions on the worst-case scenario, which is the breaking of the dam, which would provoke a huge flood in down-river municipalities,” said Jorge Londono, the head of Empresas Publicas de Medellin, the public utility company that owns the dam. “That’s a catastrophic scenario,” Londono added. The dam, which has not yet begun power generation, has cost nearly $4 billion to build and is meant to generate 17 percent of Colombia’s electricity needs. A total of 4,985 people from down-river areas were moved to shelters away from the flood zone, the Andean country’s disaster agency said in a statement.  Some 200,000 people live in the 12 towns and populated areas in Antioquia, Bolivar, Cordoba and Sucre provinces that could eventually be affected by possible flooding, authorities said.

2018-05-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Breakfast staple Cream of Wheat and snack brand Pirate’s Booty will soon cost more as B&G Foods Inc (BGS.N) raises list prices for the first time in three years and curbs promotions, the food maker said on Wednesday. Retail hikes of about a dime “across the board” will be in place by the end of May to cover freight costs which soared at the end of 2017, B&G Chief Executive Bob Cantwell said in a presentation at BMO’s Farm to Market conference in New York. An 18 ounce Cream of Wheat Hot Cereal sells for about $4. A 4 ounce bag of Pirate’s Booty Baked Rice and Corn Puffs lists for about $3. B&G, which also sells Green Giant vegetables and Ortega taco shells, last raised prices in January 2015, a company spokesman said in an emailed statement. B&G said in February that freight costs ate into its 2017 income of $217.5 million. Food companies began to signal possible price hikes this year in response to soaring trucking and rail costs. Industry leaders Nestle (NESN.S), Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) have refrained from doing so as the sector reels from changing consumer tastes and pressure from retail customers to keep prices low. “It’s a pretty justifiable increase,” B&G Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Kenneth Romanzi said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. “Many customers demanded paperwork to see. It was pretty simple to show. We hadn’t taken (an increase)” in a few years. The hikes should cover the new freight costs, which are likely to remain high, Romanzi said. Changes in trade promotions have been underway for months and the company does not anticipate any further price increases this year, he added. Costs for making canned goods have also risen due to new tariffs from the Trump Administration on steel and aluminum. Those have largely been tempered by relatively benign inflation in other key commodities costs, he said.

2018-05-17,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany raises U.S. intelligence and military concerns since it would allow Moscow to place new listening and monitoring technology in the Baltic Sea, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday. Sandra Oudkirk, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Diplomacy, said in Berlin that she would meet German officials to voice Washington’s concerns about the subsea project. A consortium of western companies and Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said this week it was starting preparatory work on the project off Germany’s Baltic coast. Oudkirk told reporters that the U.S. Congress had given the president new authorities to impose sanctions against a variety of Russian pipeline projects. Any companies involved in such projects were in “an elevated position of sanctions risk”, she said. However, she added that Washington was focused on using diplomatic means to halt Nord Stream 2, one of several Russian projects to export gas to western Europe via routes avoiding Ukraine, with which Moscow is involved in a series of disputes. Oudkirk said Washington’s objections included past Russian moves to turn off gas supplies to Ukraine and other countries, adding that it perpetuate “vulnerabilities” in Russian-European ties for another 30 to 40 years. The United States also opposes the TurkStream land pipeline that would run through Turkey for the same reasons, she said.  She said the Baltic was a congested, sensitive military area. “When we look at the ability of governments and companies to use infrastructure deployments as a means to convey devices and technologies that can listen and follow and monitor, that is a concern with regard to this particular undersea pipeline project in the Baltic Sea.” “The new project would permit new technologies to be placed along the pipeline route and that is a threat,” she said. Oudkirk rejected speculation that Washington was opposing the pipeline to help U.S. liquefied natural gas exports. The Nord Stream 2 project has said it will tap banks for financing in the fourth quarter of 2018 or early next year. Denmark must still rule whether the pipeline can be built near its coast, and other routine permissioning processes are still under way in Sweden and Russia. Oudkirk said Washington supported a Danish-Polish Baltic Pipe pipeline project because it would diversify sources and routes. The project, to be built by 2022, is Poland’s flagship project aimed at reducing reliance on Russian gas.  Gazprom’s Western partners are energy companies Uniper (UN01.DE), Wintershall BASFGn.DE, Engie (ENGIE.PA), Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI) and Anglo-Dutch group Shell (RDSa.L).

2018-05-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s three largest oil traders are competing to buy the African arm of Brazil’s Petrobras (PETR4.SA) that owns stakes in two major Nigerian offshore oil blocks, industry and banking sources with knowledge of the matter said, after submitting bids earlier this month.  Last November, state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, launched the sale of 100 percent of Petrobras Oil & Gas BV, or Petrobras Africa, as part of the heavily-indebted company’s plan to offload $21 billion in assets through 2018 as it also faces a massive corruption scandal. Petrobras holds half the shares in the company while 40 percent are held by a subsidiary of Grupo BTG Pactual SA and 10 percent by Helios Investment Partners. Bankers have previously estimated the value of the Petrobras venture to be about $2 billion.  The venture has stakes in two offshore blocks that contain two producing fields, the major Agbami field in OML 127, operated by a local Chevron (CVX.N) affiliate and the Akpo field in OML 130 operated by Total SA (TOTF.PA). The sale has attracted the top trading firms which are always on the hunt for long-term crude supplies. Mercuria and BP (BP.L) had also its potential. In early May, three consortiums including the major trading companies submitted bids to buy Petrobras Africa. Vitol bid together with the oil upstream subsidiary of U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus called Delonex and Canadian-listed Africa Oil (AOI.TO), an oil and gas exploration firm that is part of Sweden’s Lundin Group (LUPE.ST).  Glencore (GLEN.L) joined with Nigerian listed firm Seplat (SEPLAT.LG) and French firm Maurel & Prom (MAUP.PA) that is majority-owned by the Indonesian government. Indonesia’s state oil firm Pertamina also backs Maurel & Prom and owns a 20 percent stake in Seplat.  The third bidder was privately-held Famfa Oil together with Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).  Famfa Oil is one of the concessionaires in the operator of the Agbami oil field along with Chevron, Statoil and Petrobras. Chevron holds the majority stake.  Vitol, Glencore, Shell, Africa Oil declined to comment. Maurel, Famfa and Seplat did not respond for requests for comment. Petrobras is expected to make a decision by the end of May. But the sources said that this could slide as there was a still a possibility that the bids might be split between the two oil block stakes. Agbami produces about 240,000 barrels per day (bpd) while the Akpo field in OML 130 produces nearly 130,000 bpd with a second field Egina due to come onstream in the same block later this year.

2018-05-17,"NEW DELHI, May 17 (Reuters) - India, the world’s third largest oil consumer, said on Thursday it had received assurances from the world’s top oil exporter Saudi Arabia it would ensure adequate supplies to keep a lid on soaring oil prices. The statement came as oil prices rose back to $80 per barrel for the first time since 2014 due to rising concerns over disruptions to Iranian oil exports because of new U.S. sanctions and due to plummeting output in Venezuela. India’s Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Twitter that Saudi energy minister Khalid al Falih had assured him Riyadh and other producers would “ensure availability of adequate supplies to offset any potential shortfalls and ensure that prices remain reasonable”. “I expressed my concern about rising prices of crude oil and its negative impact on consumers and the Indian economy and reiterated the need for stable and moderate crude oil prices,” Pradhan said. India is one of the world’s fastest growing energy consumers and its oil use only lags behind the United States and China. OPEC and its ally Russia have cut their output since January 2017 to help reduce excessive global stockpiles. So far OPEC has said it saw no need to ease output restrictions despite global stocks falling to its desired levels and despite consuming nations voicing concerns the price rally might have gone too far and could lead to demand destruction. OPEC member the United Arab Emirates said on Thursday OPEC had bigger issues to consider than the impact of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with Iran such as Venezuela’s collapsing output. U.S. President Donald Trump has also called on OPEC to help cool oil prices saying they were artificially high and that it was “unacceptable”.

2018-05-17,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Moldova, a small, landlocked country in eastern Europe, imports three-quarters of its energy and has seen its energy prices rise by more than half in the past five years. But that could soon change, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which this year will launch an innovative effort to power a Moldovan university with cryptocurrency-funded solar energy.  The initiative with Sun Exchange, a South African solar power marketplace, will allow people to buy solar cells using SolarCoin, a cryptocurrency launched by blockchain start-up ElectriCChain, and then lease them to the Technical University of Moldova, one of the country’s largest universities. The idea is to find new sources of finance to “help buildings go green overnight” - in this instance with rooftop solar panels, said Dumitru Vasilescu, a programme manager with UNDP in Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries. “One of the biggest obstacles to countries investing in renewable energy is a lack of finance, as you often have to wait 10 to 15 years before you get a return on your investment,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But the university will get a full 1 megawatt of energy installed in the summer, he said, as a result of the crowd-funding effort. Owners of the solar cells, in turn, will receive SolarCoins as soon as the university produces energy, earning interest of about 4 percent on their investment, Vasilescu added. Moldova currently has over 10,000 square metres of unused rooftop space on public buildings that could be potentially used for such efforts, he said.        Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralised authority. It has become a key technology in both the public and private sectors, given its ability to record and keep track of assets or transactions without the need for middlemen. Research firm IDC estimates global investment in blockchain will more than double in 2018 to $2.1 billion (1.5 billion pounds) from $945 million last year, most of it for banking. IDC expects “strong, double-digit growth” in the energy space between 2016 and 2021. Kevin Treco, an associate director at the Carbon Trust, an environmental consultancy, said blockchain-based technologies could significantly change energy use in countries striving to decentralise power and boost renewable sources. In Moldova, for example, cryptocurrency-funded renewable energy could reduce the country’s dependence on energy imports such as oil and gas from Russia, Vasilescu said. Darius Nassiry, a senior research associate at the Overseas Development Institute, a British think tank, predicted that most of the growth in cryptocurrency-funded energy would occur in the developing world. “They have faster-growing energy needs… and a more accommodating legal and regulatory environment towards such innovations,” he said by email. But a lack of understanding on how blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies work could slow their take-up in the energy sector, he added. For Abraham Cambridge, the founder and CEO of Sun Exchange, the solar currency exchange system “has all the right incentives in place”. “It reduces the costs of going solar dramatically for the end user and makes it easy for anyone in the world to own a solar cell anywhere in the world and, from it, make a steady source of sunlight-powered income,” he said in a statement. Blockchain is also being used in the energy sector to facilitate carbon trading, with U.S. computing giant IBM announcing this week that it will partner with Veridium Labs, an environmental tech start-up, to turn carbon credits into digital tokens.  If the Moldovan solar currency pilot is successful, UNDP plans to replicate it in neighbouring countries, said Vasilescu, adding that it could “revolutionise the renewable energy market for Eastern Europe and Central Asia”.

2018-05-17,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The British government has offered 2 trillion yen (13.3 billion pounds) in financial support to a unit of Japan’s Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) to build nuclear reactors in Wales, Kyodo News reported on Thursday. Ageing reactors supply more than 20 percent of Britain’s power but almost half of this capacity is due to go offline by 2025, prompting the government to plan new plants. The British government is offering support in loans and other ways to Hitachi unit Horizon Nuclear Power to cover a large proportion of the cost of its Wylfa Newydd project in Wales, Kyodo reported, citing a source close to the matter. A spokesman for Britain’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We don’t recognise these news reports.”  “Discussions are commercially sensitive and ongoing, we have no further details at this time,” he added. Hitachi could decide as early as this week whether to go ahead, Kyodo said. It said the government’s offer was aimed at easing concerns about rising cost expectations, which have increased to 3 trillion yen. A Hitachi spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.  The Kyodo report cited unidentified observers questioning whether the government would be able to carry out the offer, due to parliamentary opposition.  The British government played down a Japanese media report last week which said it would guarantee loans for the construction of the two reactors in Wales.     Britain is seeking new ways to fund nuclear projects after drawing criticism over a deal awarded to France’s EDF (EDF.PA) to build the UK’s first nuclear plant for 20 years, which could cost 30 billion pounds. Hitachi’s Horizon plans to construct at least 5.4 gigawatts of nuclear capacity at two sites in Britain – the first at Wylfa Newydd, and the second at Oldbury-on-Severn in England. Cracks found recently in the core of a reactor at the Hunterston B power station in Scotland have prompted concerns that Britain’s ageing plants will not be able to supply as much power as expected.

2018-05-17,"DUBLIN, May 17 (Reuters) - Flybe expects rising fuel prices, staffing crunches and Britain’s exit from the European Union to mean a challenging period ahead for carriers, the regional airline’s chief executive said. “We have fuel challenges arriving, foreign exchange, we need to be prepared for pilot shortages. It’s a tough environment,” Christine Ourmieres-Widener told Reuters on the sidelines of a CAPA Centre for Aviation summit in Dublin. The price of crude oil has climbed to above $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014, spurred by concerns that Iranian exports could fall due to renewed U.S. sanctions and reduce supply in an already tightening market. Ourmieres-Widener said along with a general tightness in the market for pilots, Flybe was also concerned by a lack of engineering resources in Britain. On Brexit, Flybe would like to see more urgency from the British government in agreeing a deal as it is already selling tickets for the period beyond March 2019, the planned departure date of Britain from the EU, but has inserted a clause saying the flights are dependent on post Brexit flying rights. “We have a list of questions,” Ourmieres-Widener, said, citing aircraft leasing and maintenance certification as among issues. “Uncertainty is never good for business,” she added, saying she had held talks with MPs to impress that on them. Earlier, Irish transport minister Shane Ross said Brexit was an unprecedented challenge for the aviation industry. Ourmieres-Widener said while partnerships could help the airline amidst a tough backdrop, it would only enter partnerships if they offered value to Flybe. Britain’s Stobart Group in March scrapped plans to buy Flybe, saying the regional airline had rejected a bid and it had decided against making a higher offer. Asked whether Flybe would consider another offer, Ourmieres-Widener said it would be a decision for the board. “The role of any board is to look at anything to see what is the best solution for shareholders and the employees,” she said.

2018-05-17,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - European countries are ignoring evidence of Russian interference in their politics and the destabilising effect on the region of policies that will make Europe more reliant on Russian energy, Slovakia’s President Andrej Kiska said on Thursday.   Kiska, who is not a member of any political party, is a pro-Western voice in NATO and euro zone member Slovakia but has limited executive powers. He said this week he would not seek reelection next year. Former prime minister Robert Fico, who was replaced in March by his deputy Peter Pellegrini of the same leftist Smer party that dominates the government, has often spoken against sanctions imposed by the European Union over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.  “We openly speak about Russian spies active in our countries. And many politicians, my country included, turn a blind eye thereto,” Kiska told the Globsec security conference in Bratislava. “We face propaganda and hoaxes attacking our societies, and we do not search for its originators. Because we already know,” he added. Unlike neighbouring Poland and Hungary, Slovakia has avoided clashing with Brussels over the rule of law, but was the only central European country not to expel any Russian diplomats over the March poisoning of a Russian former double agent in Britain.   Britain says Russia poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and ‘80s. Moscow denies any involvement in the attack, which sparked the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War. Russia has also denied accusations of meddling in the U.S. and French presidential elections and launching cyber attacks against the West. Speaking at a conference also attended by Russia’s United Nations envoy Vassily Nebenzia, Kiska described the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, preparatory works for which are set to begin off the German coast, as selfish and harmful to EU stability. An initiative of Russia’s Gazprom and five European companies, and with German backing, the gas pipeline on the Baltic seabed will connect Russia directly with Germany, bypassing eastern Europe and limiting flows via Ukraine.  It will double Russia’s gas export capacity to Germany but cost Ukraine valuable revenues while increasing EU reliance on Russian gas. The project would also limit flows through Slovakia. “This project has serious political consequences, it is an example of purely selfish economic interests at the expense of stability and prosperity of our immediate neighbourhood,” the Slovak president added. “We send a signal to Russia about how short-sighted we are in our policies.” Kiska called Russia’s involvement in Syria “shameful” and called for resolute collective action to counter “undemocratic regimes pretending to be peacemakers while waging war not for peace, but for repairing a lost national pride and to regain a place among major world players”.  “And to those who send their troops to steal land of sovereign states,” he added — a reference to the annexation of Crimea, which prompted the United States and EU to impose sanctions on Russia.

2018-05-17,"HANOI (Reuters) - Rosneft Vietnam BV, a unit of Russian state oil firm Rosneft, is concerned that its recent drilling in an area of the South China Sea that is claimed by China could upset Beijing, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Wednesday. Rosneft said on Tuesday its Vietnamese unit had started drilling at the LD-3P well, part of the Lan Do “Red Orchid” offshore gas field in Block 06.1, 370 kms (230 miles) southeast of Vietnam. The block is “within the area outlined by China’s nine-dash line,” according to energy consultancy and research firm Wood Mackenzie. When asked about the Reuters report of the drilling, China’s foreign ministry spokesman said that no country, organization, company or individual can, without the permission of the Chinese government, carry out oil and gas exploration or exploitation activities in waters under Chinese jurisdiction. “We urge relevant parties to earnestly respect China’s sovereign and jurisdictional rights and not do anything that could impact bilateral relations or this region’s peace and stability,” the spokesman, Lu Kang, told a regular news briefing on Thursday. Vietnam’s foreign ministry said its oil and gas activities are conducted in accordance with the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. “As we have repeatedly asserted, all of Vietnam’s maritime economic activities, including oil and gas activities, have been licensed and carried out in maritime zones entirely under Vietnamese sovereignty and jurisdiction,” ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement in response to a request from Reuters for comment. China’s U-shaped “nine-dash line” marks a vast expanse of the South China Sea that it claims, including large swathes of Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone. Maps of the area indicate the block is around 85 kms (53 miles) inside the contested area. A series of dashes, the line is not continuous making China’s claims often ambiguous. In recent years, though, China has increasingly patrolled and enforced the area, claiming historic rights to the resources and features within it. In March, Vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby “Red Emperor” block following pressure from China, sources told Reuters. That block is licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol, which has asked Vietnam to pay compensation over the issue. Rosneft had no consultations with the Kremlin on drilling in the South China Sea, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. “As far as we know, the company has already made a statement that it works exactly in line with the obtained licenses,” Peskov told a regular conference call with reporters. Fearing repercussions and pressure from China, Rosneft Vietnam had wanted to begin drilling with as little attention as possible, despite the statement by its parent company on Tuesday, the sources said. On Thursday, its parent company said its drilling in the block was within Vietnam’s territorial waters, and in accordance with Vietnamese legislation. To view a graphic on Drilling in contested waters, click: tmsnrt.rs/2wPREom Both Rosneft and Russia’s Gazprom have significant development projects in Vietnamese waters that fall within the area claimed by China, said Ian Storey, a regional security expert at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. “Although Russian diplomats have privately expressed concerns to their U.S. counterparts that China may one day put pressure on Moscow to terminate those projects, so far Beijing has refrained from doing so because of the ever-closer strategic partnership between the two countries,” said Storey. “It would be a serious blow to the burgeoning Sino-Russian entente if Beijing asked Moscow to end its energy projects in Vietnam.” China has become Russia’s top destination for exports, largely because Russia is the largest supplier of oil and gas to China, mainly through pipelines.  The drilling in the “Red Orchid” gas field within the block will be undertaken using the “Hakuryu-5” equipment made by Japanese company Japan Drilling Co., Ltd, Rosneft said in that statement. The Hakuryu-5 arrived in the disputed area on May 6, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon ship tracking data and was still recorded as being inside the block late on Wednesday.  The drilling is significant for Vietnam, which has been struggling to maintain its crude oil and gas output amid already declining production from its key fields and the continuing pressure from China in the disputed waters.  Vietnam already gets about 30 percent of its gas needs from block 06.1 because of oil and gas operations that were first established there more than 15 years ago. The block is operated by Rosneft and jointly owned by India’s ONGC , Rosneft, and PetroVietnam. It lies just south of blocks 05.3 and 05.2, where in 2007 British Petroleum suspended work following a threat of “economic consequences” from China, according to a September, 2007 U.S. State Department cable leaked by WikiLeaks. In April, Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam said that maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities this year. Hanoi and Beijing have long been embroiled in disputes over the maritime boundary, which is a politically sensitive issue in Vietnam.  Police in the central province of Khanh Hoa have launched an investigation into a group of Chinese tourists who were pictured in a local airport wearing T-shirts printed with a map showing the “nine-dash line”, state media reported on Wednesday. Airport authorities asked the tourists, who arrived at Cam Ranh Airport on Sunday, to take off their T-shirts after going through customs, the Van Hoa (Culture) newspaper reported.

2018-05-17,"KAMPALA, May 17 (Reuters) - China will help Uganda build and operate nuclear power plants under a deal signed last week. Uganda has some uranium deposits and President Yoweri Museveni has said his government was keen to exploit them for potential nuclear energy development. Eight potential sites have been identified in the country’s central, southwest and northern regions that could potentially host nuclear power plants, the government said on Thursday. It signed a deal with Russia last year to cooperate on nuclear power. China is already a major investor in Ugandan infrastructure projects and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) signed a memorandum of understanding on May 11 to help Uganda build capacity “in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes”, Uganda’s energy ministry said in a statement issued on Thursday. Uganda’s energy needs are expected to jump in the coming years as it prepares to start producing crude oil in 2020 from fields in its west where reserves of 6.5 billion barrels were discovered in 2006. Co-operation between CNNC and Uganda will involve the development of nuclear power infrastructure including the design, construction and operation of nuclear power plants.

2018-05-17,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2wUWBvY By John Kemp LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices are now in the top half of the cycle, with benchmark Brent on Thursday trading above $80 per barrel for the first time since November 2014. In real terms, prices averaged $75 per barrel over the course of the last full cycle, which lasted from December 1998 to January 2016. The recent rise in prices sends a strong signal about the need for more production and slower growth in oil consumption. In the next few months, the narrative will increasingly turn to boosting supply and restraining demand in order to stabilise inventories and return the market to balance. Between 2014 and 2017, oil market “rebalancing” meant restricting production, stimulating demand and cutting excess inventories. For the rest of 2018 and 2019, rebalancing will mean precisely the opposite. The oil industry has always been subject to deep and prolonged cycles of boom and bust, and there is no reason to think the next few years will be any different. (tmsnrt.rs/2wUWBvY) Cyclical behaviour is the single most important distinguishing characteristic of oil markets and prices, and is deeply rooted in the industry’s structure. The price cycle is driven by the low responsiveness of production and consumption to small changes in prices, at least in the short term. The behaviour of many oil producers and consumers exhibits a strong backward-looking component, so decisions tend to be based on where prices have been recently rather than where they are likely to go. But most importantly, the oil markets are a complex adaptive system which is subject to multiple feedback mechanisms operating at different speeds and timescales. The price cycle is driven by the interaction of positive feedback mechanisms (which magnify shocks) and negative feedback mechanisms (which dampen them). In the short run, positive feedback mechanisms are more influential and tend to push the market even further away from balance following an initial disturbance. In the medium and long term, however, negative feedback mechanisms dominate and will eventually force production and consumption back into alignment. Negative feedback mechanisms are familiar to economists as Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” and in the long run they exert a powerful influence on the oil market. But the existence of positive feedback mechanisms can cause a lot of volatility in the short term and tends to cause oil prices to oscillate rather than converge on a steady equilibrium value. In the next few months, positive feedback will tend to push oil prices even higher by boosting demand further and capping supply growth. Rising oil revenues will drive faster economic growth in oil-producing countries, increasing their domestic fuel consumption and tightening the oil market even more. Rising oil prices and production will also increase the oil industry’s internal fuel consumption for drilling, refining, transportation and all along the supply chain. At the same time, rising oil prices and output tend to be associated with tightening markets and increasing costs for everything from labour and raw materials to engineering and service contracts. Resource-owning governments will also tend to take the opportunity to push for higher tax and royalty rates to capture more of the windfall from higher prices. And as prices rise, oil producers will be able to achieve their revenue targets by holding output unchanged rather than increasing it. For all these reasons, oil production will tend to respond slowly to an increase in prices in the short term, while consumption will remain more buoyant than expected, intensifying the upward pressure on prices. In the medium term, however, negative feedback mechanisms become progressively more important and will eventually push the market back towards balance. Higher oil prices will boost corporate cash flows and improve the availability of equity and debt financing for oil producers. In time, that will boost exploration and production spending and eventually output. Most of the initial production gains will come from expansions of existing fields and projects, which tend to be faster, cheaper and lower-risk, before firms turn to developing more ambitious and risky new sources of supply. On the demand side, high prices will eventually promote renewed interest in fuel economy as well as operational/behavioural changes intended to cut fuel consumption. High prices will push energy conservation back up the agenda for corporations and governments and renew interest in switching to cheaper non-oil sources of energy. Rising prices will probably spur interest in buying smaller and more fuel-efficient cars as well as electric vehicles and trucks, trains and ships running on liquefied natural gas/compressed natural gas. Higher prices will also restrain demand by slowing economic growth in consuming countries, at least at the margin. All these supply- and demand-side responses take time to have an impact, but the higher prices rise and the longer they are expected to stay high, the more significant the eventual response. The period of very high prices between 2011 and the first half of 2014 stimulated record increases in oil production as well as restraining consumption growth, and created the conditions for the subsequent slump. That slump created the conditions for the current recovery by restraining production growth in the United States and other non-OPEC countries as well as stimulating demand. Voluntary production restraints by OPEC and some other oil-exporting countries, coupled with the involuntary collapse in production from Venezuela, accelerated a recovery that was starting to happen anyway. Now the market is embarking on the next stage of the cycle, with high and rising prices beginning to stimulate an increase in production, restrain fuel use, and eventually create conditions for the next downturn.

2018-05-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government announced measures on Thursday to speed up planning applications to support development of the country’s shale gas industry. Increasing reliance on imported gas as Britain’s domestic North Sea output declines is one of the driving forces behind government support for hydraulic fracturing, which involves extracting gas obtained from rocks broken up or fractured with water and chemicals at high pressure. However, it is impossible to know exactly how much shale gas might be underground - and, more importantly, how much can be extracted - until fracking has started in earnest. Commercial production of shale gas in Britain is not expected for two years and developers complain that progress has been slowed by protests and regulatory processes. Recent decisions on shale exploration remain disappointingly  slow, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, Greg Clark, said in a written statement to Parliament. The government, therefore, will introduce measures to streamline and improve the regulation process for shale gas planning applications so decisions are made more quickly. Shale gas developers say it can take up to three years to obtain permission to drill a test well in Britain, compared with only a month in the United States. The government will also launch a new 1.6 million pound  ($2.2 million) shale support fund over the next two years to build capacity and expertise in local authorities dealing with shale planning applications and set up a shale environmental regulator. The government also said it will open a consultation on whether exploration wells will be allowed to be drilled without the need for a planning application. The possibility of this has angered some environmental groups opposed to fracking because of concerns about potential seismic activity, water contamination and other issues. “The government’s plans pervert the planning process and could make England’s landscape a wild west for whatever cowboy wants to start drilling and digging up our countryside,” said Rose Dickinson, campaigner at Friends of the Earth. However, shale gas developers such as IGas,  Cuadrilla and Ineos, welcomed the measures, particularly those to speed up the planning process. “Our planning permission to drill and test just four shale gas exploratory wells in Lancashire was granted after a lengthy and costly three-year process. These timelines must improve if the country is to benefit from its own, much needed, indigenous source of gas,” Cuadrilla said in a statement. The Scottish government outlawed fracking last year after a public consultation found overwhelming opposition to it.

2018-05-17,"(Adds detail, background) By Alexander Cornwell DUBAI, May 17 (Reuters) - Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE), one of the world’s largest aircraft lessors, is in talks to buy 400 jetliners from Airbus and Boeing and is prepared to expand its fleet through acquisition if talks fall through, its CEO told Reuters. The move comes months after a leading U.S. airline investor orchestrated a record deal last November for a group of airlines to buy more than 400 planes from Airbus as economists project strong growth for air travel. Government-controlled DAE is interested in buying single-aisle Airbus A320neo-family and Boeing 737 MAX planes after its acquisition last year of Dublin-based lessor AWAS, DAE Chief Executive Firoz Tarapore said on Thursday. Any deal would not necessarily be evenly split between the two planemakers, Tarapore said, adding that DAE was “nowhere near where we thought we would be” in finalising an order. “We are not happy with the price,” he said in an interview at DAE’s offices in Dubai’s financial district. An order for 400 single-aisle jets would be worth more than $40 billion at list prices, though discounts are common for large orders. Boeing declined to comment and Airbus did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. A huge deal would give DAE a long-term pipeline of directly ordered aircraft on par with its rivals, though it may have to wait several years for deliveries to start because manufactures are heavily sold out. Tarapore told Reuters last June that DAE was considering a “large order” for more than 23 new aircraft, with deliveries to start from 2019. DAE would look at other options to acquire new aircraft if it does not reach an agreement with Airbus or Boeing, which Tarapore said could include acquiring a rival to gain access to its order book for aircraft. DAE jetted into the top tier of aircraft lessors last year when it acquired Dublin-based AWAS, the industry’s tenth-biggest firm at the time. The acquisition tripled DAE’s portfolio to about 400 owned and managed aircraft worth over $14 billion. DAE is “operating very smoothly”, Tarapore said, adding that the integration of AWAS was completed in February. In the meantime, DAE is considering issuing a $500 million sukuk this year or in 2019 and a conventional dollar bond in the fourth quarter of this year, Tarapore said. The bond issues are not dependent on finalising an aircraft order, he added. DAE intends to be a repeat, benchmark issuer in the U.S. debt market, he told Reuters in October 2017. A benchmark issue conventionally means upwards of $500 million. DAE raised $2.3 billion in the United States through a senior bond issue in 2017 to finance the AWAS deal.

2018-05-17,"(Adds named item code) * Oil breaks $80 for the first time since late 2014 * Dollar hits highest since Jan vs the yen, steadies vs euro * Government borrowing costs grind higher * Wall Street set for subdued open * Turkey’s lira slides again as EM markets show strains By Marc Jones LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - The dollar took a breather at a five-month high on Thursday, though government borrowing costs continued to grind upwards as oil prices hit their highest since 2014 at $80 a barrel. Ten-year U.S. government Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, neared a 7-year high of 3.1 percent as more expensive oil pointed to faster inflation and followed some upbeat U.S. retail sales numbers. Europe’s FX traders saw little movement in the six-currency dollar index but euro/dollar failed to keep above above $1.18 and dollar/yen hit its highest level since late January at 110.70. “The big turnaround was the Japanese yen, there is clearly big time (U.S. vs Japan) rate sensitivity there,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy. “The correlation (between moves in yields and yen) is likely to be one-to-one almost, and without any risk appetite meltdown that should continue.” World and European shares did creep higher but Wall Street futures prices were pointing to a modestly lower start for New York’s S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq when they reopen later. The other two big macro market spotlights stayed on Italy and Turkey. Turkey’s lira was sliding back towards its recent record lows as concerns persisted about what an expansion of President Tayyip Erdogan’s powers could mean if he wins elections next month as widely expected. It came despite the central bank saying on Wednesday that it would take action against a sell-off in the currency. Benchmark Italian government bonds and stocks sold off again too following reports, subsequently denied, that the prospective Five Star/League coalition government had drafted an economic plan that would seek 250 billion euros of debt forgiveness from the European Central Bank. While few people see that as either a realistic proposal or one that would remain in the coalition’s agenda, the tone of the new government’s stance toward euro zone rules was seen as confrontational and spooked some investors. Markets are now eagerly awaiting the final agreement to see what details remain after a meeting being between the two parties later. Two-year Italian government yields are now back in positive territory for the first time in almost a year – the only other positive yielding two-year euro zone government bond is Greece. “I’m still sceptical on the euro, there is a lot of headline risk,” Saxo bank’s Hardy said, adding the worry for lira was that investors will bolt even before they know Erdogan’s post- election plans. The other major mover was oil which was up at $80 a barrel for first time since late 2014. With the global economy running at a healthy clip demand remains strong, while U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to re-impose sanctions on Iran could potentially cut global supply by a million barrels a day. Brent crude futures were last at $80.01 per barrel, up 0.9 percent from their last close with U.S. WTI crude up almost 70 cents at $72.19. Both are now up almost 30 percent since February and 80 percent since June last year. “The geopolitical noise and escalation fears are here to stay,” said Norbert Rücker, head of macro and commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. “Supply concerns are front of mind after the United States left the Iran nuclear deal.” U.S. bank Morgan Stanley meanwhile raised its Brent price forecast to $90 per barrel by 2020 due to a steady increase in demand. Back in the currency markets, sterling nudged up against both the dollar and the euro after a UK newspaper reported that Prime Minister Theresa May would tell Brussels that Britain was prepared to stay in the European Union’s customs union after a transitional arrangement beyond 2021. Pressure on Mexico’s peso returned though as hopes for a new-look NAFTA trade deal with the U.S. and Canada were pushed back and as the country’s central bank said its systems had been hit by a 300 million pesos ($15.33 million) cyber attack.

2018-05-17,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) missed first-quarter profit expectations on Thursday and warned that political and trade tensions clouded the outlook, sending shares in the world’s biggest container shipper sharply lower. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the three months to March 31 rose 5 percent to $669 million (£496 million) but came in well below the $852 million forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. Chief Executive Soren Skou called the result “unsatisfactory” but said he still expected EBITDA for the year at $4 billion-$5 billion.  Maersk shares fell almost 12 percent after the results to near 18-month lows, although quarterly revenue at $9.3 billion topped analysts’ forecasts of $8.8 billion.  By 1241 GMT the shares were down 8.8 percent at 9,262 Danish crowns. Analysts at Jefferies said disappointment stemmed in part from “relatively sluggish underlying volume growth” of 2.2 percent, short of an expected increase of 3-4 percent. Container freight rates rose 7 percent, but the cost of shipping a container increased 12 percent, partly as a result of higher oil prices, Skou said. Skou in previous quarters played down the risk of a global trade war hurting the group’s business but on Thursday noted “increased uncertainties due to geopolitical risks and trade tensions.” “We have to admit that the Americans have taken a number of initiatives recently that have caught us by surprise,” Skou told Reuters in an interview. “The (trade) situation has become more intense,” he said, adding it would hurt Maersk’s business if trade talks between the United States and China ended in failure. “The whole situation regarding Iran, which is pushing oil prices up, is certainly also not good for our container business,” Skou said. He added that Maersk was winding down its business in Iran following new U.S. sanctions: “I don’t know the timing details exactly, but I am certain that we’re also going to shut down (in Iran).” After a slump in shipping and oil, Maersk is restructuring and divesting its energy businesses - including oil exploration, oil tankers and supply services - to focus on shipping, ports and logistics. Skou said he would implement short-term initiatives to improve profitability and lower unit costs, which would include keeping fleet capacity unchanged in the next 18 months and no orders for new ships for at least 12 months. He said he expected the global fleet supply balance to improve significantly in the second half of the year and in 2019. Rival German container shipping line Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.DE) reported higher first-quarter profits on Monday. Maersk said it still aimed to spin off its oil drilling and oil supply services units before the end of the year.  Reuters reported last week that the company is likely to shelve plans to list the offshore drilling division because of weak market conditions, and extend the timeline to divest the unit beyond its initial target of end-2018. Before Thursday’s results, Maersk shares had already fallen 29 percent from a July 2017 peak when optimism about freight rates and a turnaround in global container shipping began to fade.

2018-05-17,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze urged carmakers to speed up technical refits of diesel cars to improve air quality after the European Commission said on Thursday it was taking the country to court for failing to respect air quality limits. The European Commission has decided to take France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Britain to the EU Court of Justice over the issue. “If we are to survive in court, we need more and faster progress to make the air clean,” Schulze said in a statement. “We need (refits for diesel) as soon as possible and at the expense of carmakers as they caused the problem,” she added. German carmaker Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner. The scandal, also known as Dieselgate, led to a regulatory crackdown that is threatening thousands of jobs as customers increasingly shun diesel-powered cars. Schulze, a member of the centre-left Social Democrats, said the Commission’s decision showed that the government had to change it strategy. “To hope that the problem will be solved by itself - as some apparently do - is now no longer an option,” she warned. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives are more cautious, though, warning that it would not be wise to make the car cover the whole cost of refits as this would weaken their ability to invest in greener technologies. Merkel told lawmakers on Wednesday that the government had a responsibility to tell the industry that it had to restore trust. But she opposed calls to further increase the burden on carmakers to retrofit vehicles that produce excessive emissions. Merkel also called for Europe to support the development of the battery and software technologies needed if electric vehicles become the cars of the future, since otherwise Europe risks losing its manufacturing abilities to Asia and North America.

2018-05-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors have sent shares in European oil exploration and production (E&P) focussed companies like Premier (PMO.L), Tullow (TLW.L), EnQuest (ENQ.L) and Faroe (FPM.L), soaring, and some fund managers say they have not peaked yet. Shares in smaller and mid-cap British oil companies are outperforming the London FTSE blue chip index .FTSE and their larger competitors .SXEP, riding the wave of rising oil prices LCOc1 much higher than oil majors. “The sector has performed quite well, but not as well as it might have done, we’ve only just started the rally,” said Paul Mumford, senior fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, who is invested in Faroe, EnQuest, Tullow, Hurricane Energy (HUR.L) and Cairn Energy (CNE.L) and other smaller E&P groups. “I tend not to do majors. You’re not going to make ten times your money with BP and Shell, whereas with some of the (smaller companies) you will do that. It’s a very interesting undervalued part of the market.” Smaller E&P companies have direct exposure to oil prices, reflected in benchmark Brent futures which have risen by around a quarter towards $80 a barrel in the past three months, levels last seen in late 2014. Morgan Stanley, which sees oil prices rising to $90 a barrel in 2019/20, said in a note this week it was “time to increase E&P exposure”, raising E&Ps’ rating to attractive.  An index of 20 larger European oil and gas companies - most of which include refining and marketing operations known as downstream - rose by around a fifth in the past three months. Meanwhile, pure E&Ps like Premier rose by around 60 percent, Tullow by 50 percent, Faroe by 40 percent and EnQuest by almost 30 percent. An index of smaller oil and gas groups rose by around 35 percent .TRXFLDEUPUOILE.      Low oil prices hit E&Ps harder than so-called integrated oil companies like the majors, whose downstream activities worked as a natural hedge when oil prices slumped starting in 2014. With projects planned at a time of high oil prices, balance sheets came under pressure and debt mushroomed.  “Our sector has been unloved for a long time,” said Nathan Piper, who analyses mid-level oil companies for RBC. “Now they are (loved) - with some of these companies, which people thought would go out of business a couple of years ago, recovering.” When oil prices were low, cost cuts and asset sales were the main way for companies trying to juggle rising debt, operating expenditure and lower revenues. Higher oil prices will allow debt piles to shrink faster - a focus for investors. Barclays said this week that higher oil price assumptions had led it to raise 2018-20 “cash flow and price targets across our coverage group, with debt-levered oil producers benefiting the most. Current positive momentum is encouraging investors to revisit the sector.” Tullow, with debt still at $3.4 billion, announced last month it swung back to profit after three years in the red, and is considering resuming dividend payments frozen in 2015. British-based companies can carry forward tax losses, allowing groups to offset rising revenue in high-price periods against previous years’ losses - a double advantage for oil companies solely or mainly operating in Britain. EnQuest, which is saddled with around $2 billion in debt, had corporate tax losses of over $3 billion at the end of 2017  so it will most likely not pay any material corporate tax on British operations for “the foreseeable future”, a spokesman said. Premier, carrying $2.7 billion in debt, had $4 billion of UK tax losses and allowances to carry forward. It is ramping up its Catcher oil field and looking to expand in Mexico. Premier Chief Executive Tony Durrant told Reuters investors are starting to realise the sector is undervalued and that he sees rising interest from generalist fund managers: “Investor sentiment towards the sector is only just recovering. We were hit very hard on the downturn because we were leveraged. The logic is we’ve got further to go on the way back up. Over the coming weeks you’ll see some disclosable interest from some quite large institutional shareholders.” But some investors are more reserved. Allianz energy analyst Rohan Murphy said he would like to see E&P companies’ valuations underpinned by more mergers and acquisitions and oil futures prices going up to signal the oil price rally has longer to run.

2018-05-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - It has taken 500 days and the sacrifice of almost a billion barrels in lost oil output for the global crude market to eradicate a deep supply surplus, but oil prices have now hit OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia’s desired level of $80 a barrel. Brent crude futures LCOc1 reached an intraday high of $80.18 on Thursday, breaching the $80 a barrel level for the first time since November 2014.  A vast overhang of unwanted crude stocks has now vanished, investors are buying into the oil price rally more than at any time in the last four years and market watchers are beginning to talk again about oil prices returning to $100 per barrel and more. To view a graphic on Global oil supply and demand reach balance, click: reut.rs/2rFZGez Renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran that could seriously hamper the country’s oil exports, along with involuntary output declines in big producers such as Venezuela, Mexico and Angola have contributed to the bounce in the price.  Led by Saudi Arabia, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 of its partners including top producer Russia have cut their crude output by a joint 1.8 million barrels a day since January 2017. The oil price has risen by $50 since hitting a 13-year low of $27 a barrel in January 2016 and has gained 50 percent in the last 12 months alone, reflecting both concern over geopolitics and confidence in a more favourable balance between supply and demand.  The premium of the benchmark Brent crude futures contract LCOc1 is at its largest in years over those for delivery further ahead, reflecting investors’ and traders’ belief that supply will fall short of demand for some time to come.  Saudi Arabia is said to favour an oil price of around $80, or even $100 a barrel, as it gears up to float part of state oil company ARAMCO IPO-ARAM.SE. To view a graphic on Investors prepare for crude oil supply to shrink, click: reut.rs/2rJiKsk But OPEC and its cohorts may end up being victims of their own success. The International Energy Agency on Wednesday warned global demand growth will almost inevitably slow given how much the oil price has risen.  To view a graphic on Non-OPEC supply vs global demand growth in 2018, click: reut.rs/2Imrf71 Meanwhile, the rise in the U.S. dollar .DXY since the start of the year may curb the purchasing power of major importing nations to buy crude, especially since many, such as India and Indonesia, no longer offer drivers such as generous fuel subsidies. OPEC also has a headache in the form of rival supply from outside its club, namely from the United States, which is on course to become the largest producer in the world by the end of this year, with output set to top 11 million bpd.  OPEC’s supply cuts have been swamped by the increase in U.S. output, led by production from shale fields and this, along with the higher price, has made the major forecasting agencies — the IEA, OPEC itself and the U.S. Energy Information Administration — far more cautious.

2018-05-17,"(Adds details, background, quotes) By Alexander Cornwell DUBAI, May 17 (Reuters) - Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, one of the world’s largest aircraft lessors, is in talks to buy 400 jetliners from Airbus and Boeing and is prepared to expand its fleet through acquisition if talks fall through, its chief executive told Reuters on Thursday. The move comes months after a leading U.S. airline investor orchestrated a record deal last November for a group of airlines to buy over 400 planes from Airbus as economists project strong growth for air travel. Dubai government-controlled DAE is interested in buying single-aisle Airbus A320neo-family and Boeing 737 MAX planes following its acquisition last year of Dublin-based lessor AWAS, DAE Chief Executive Firoz Tarapore said. Any deal would not necessarily be evenly split between the two planemakers, Tarapore said, adding DAE was “nowhere near where we thought we would be” in finalising an order. “We are not happy with the price,” he said in an interview at DAE’s offices in Dubai’s financial district. A 400 single-aisle jet order would be worth over $40 billion at list prices, though discounts are common for large orders. Boeing declined to comment and Airbus did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Both manufactures are sold out for several years and freeing up production slots would be difficult for a large order. Tarapore told Reuters in June 2017 that DAE was considering a “large order” for more than 23 new aircraft with deliveries to start from 2019. DAE would look at other options to acquire new aircraft if it does not reach an agreement with Airbus or Boeing, which Tarapore said could include acquiring a rival in order to get access to its order book for aircraft. DAE jetted into the top tier of aircraft lessors last year when it acquired Dublin-based AWAS, the industry’s tenth biggest firm at the time. The acquisition tripled DAE’s portfolio to around 400 aircraft worth over $14 billion.

2018-05-17,"MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Reuters) - Oil firms that have won drilling rights during Mexico’s landmark energy reforms have made little progress on developing about two-thirds of the projects because of the nation’s tangled regulatory regime, according to company executives and government data. Mexico has auctioned off more than 100 contracts to foreign and local companies since President Enrique Pena Nieto started opening the nation’s oil fields to foreign investment in 2013. A new oil regulatory framework, much of it adapted from existing rules, has kept most of that oil in the ground, the data show. That’s delaying potential benefits to Mexico and could make the reforms that much easier to unwind if voters elect an anti-reform candidate for president when Pena Nieto leaves office at the end of November. Securing approvals is a “cumbersome and arduous process resulting in a significant choke point for drilling wells,” said Craig Steinke, chief executive of Renaissance Oil Corp, which has five projects in Mexico, three of them stalled in permitting. It takes three days to get needed drilling permits for a well in Alberta, Canada, compared to the more than a year in Mexico, Steinke said. Through the life of a project, oil firms are required to submit more than 250 separate documents to about a dozen government agencies overseeing offshore and onshore developments. Before Mexico’s energy reforms, state-owned oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, was the sole operator and largely regulated itself. The opening of development rights to private firms ushered in a new regulator, known as ASEA, operating under a presidential appointee with sweeping powers - but also a legacy of bureaucratic constraints. ASEA, Mexico’s safety, energy and environment regulator, must decide on about 100 permits for each project, according to Marco Cota, a former head of exploration and production for the energy ministry who now advises oil companies on regulatory compliance. Many of the agency’s industrial safety regulations were inherited from the environment ministry and duplicate paperwork required by other agencies, he said. ASEA Director Carlos de Regules, a former Pemex official, conceded in an interview that the agency’s decision-making has been too slow. He said he is working to cut permit reviews to 120 days by September - compared to the current process that can stretch nearly a year-and-a-half. “The regulatory framework is very complicated, and it forces us to take more time than in principle should be necessary to evaluate a project,” he said of rules in place since the energy reform laws were enacted. “We are obligated to ask seven times for the same paperwork.” Evaluations can take about six months for environmental impacts and three months for a final drilling permit, just two of the approvals required before work can begin on a new well. Companies also must show they have insurance policies and industrial safety and environmental protection plans approved and in place for each project. The latter requires companies to submit reams of supplemental documents such as safety manuals. The delays stem in large part from the fact that ASEA is adapting and interpreting laws originally written for general environmental protections and were not specific to the energy industry, said Layla Vargas, who works with oil companies to meet government regulations. “What they’ve had to do is half-improvise” to fit the energy sector, said Cota. Staffing shortages are another major bottleneck. The regulator has 465 employees who handle approvals for more than 25,000 project applications since the 2015 oil-market opening, ranging from retail gas stations to multi-million dollar drilling projects. Permits for a service station can take as much as seven months to approve, according to the agency. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which promotes economic development, last fall called for ASEA to have more “institutional agility and autonomy” in its evaluation of Mexico’s energy regulators. ASEA’s administrative complexity is the biggest challenge to getting oil and gas projects underway, said Renaissance Oil’s Steinke and other oil company executives. So far, ASEA has signed off on insurance policies for 37 of 107 oil and gas contracts awarded. The companies’ management system, a custom plan for mitigating risks in 18 environmental, health and safety areas, has been authorized for 51 projects. Approvals for both are needed before drilling can begin. To date, 107 exploration and production projects won at auction by international oil firms including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are in various stages of regulatory process. The numbers of approvals “are not great,” said a senior executive at an oil major who oversees contracts in Mexico, speaking on condition of anonymity. At least one oil company said it has not had problems with unreasonable delays. “We’ve had a good experience in Mexico,” said Felipe Arbalaez, BP plc’s president for Latin America. The regulators have “given us approvals at the appropriate time,” he added, referring to the British company’s shallow water Hokchi project, which is run by its Argentine unit Pan American Energy. But John Padilla, a Bogota-based oil consultant with IPD Latin America, said oil companies who bet big on the Mexican opening are increasingly concerned about the political and regulatory risks. “No one’s jumping ship,” he said. “But when you have billions of dollars of investment at stake, you can be damn sure that every board out there around the globe that has investments in Mexico is going to be paying close attention to this.” (Additional reporting by Marianna Parraga in Houston; Editing by Gary McWilliams and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-regulation/mexicos-landmark-energy-reforms-are-mired-in-regulatory-delays-idUKL1N1SE24M,17 May 2018,"Oil firms that have won

2018-05-17,"* Kazakhstan raised objections to revenue share in 2016 * Former Soviet state expects one-off payment * Minister sees compromise on profit share calculation By Mariya Gordeyeva ASTANA, May 17 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan aims to settle its profit-sharing dispute with energy majors developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field within a month, the energy minister said on Thursday. The former Soviet republic expects a large one-off payment from the companies and a higher share of future revenues from the development of one of the Central Asian nation’s biggest hydrocarbon fields, Kanat Bozumbayev told Reuters. Kazakhstan said in 2016 it disagreed with how the consortium led by Italy’s Eni and BG, which has since been taken over by Anglo-Dutch firm Shell, calculated the parties’ shares in the income from the Karachaganak field. Settling the dispute which according to Lukoil, another partner in the project, involved a $1.6 billion claim, could pave way for expanding the project at Karachaganak and secure higher revenue for the Kazakh government. “The talks are in the final stage. There are optimistic expectations that they will be concluded within a month,” the minister said in an interview. “We have agreed the key principles, (but) there are technical nuances.” Foreign firms are developing Karachaganak under a production sharing agreement that allows them to recover some costs before sharing a part of the remaining revenue with the state. But arguments about what costs are eligible for recovery can become tricky and technical. Bozumbayev said that Kazakhstan was seeking “compensation for the past years”, saying the figure was “more than hundreds of millions of dollars” without naming a precise number. He said Kazakhstan had also “demanded that they change the way” profit share for the parties was calculated in future. “We can say we have almost agreed the sum of the compensation, and reached a compromise on the calculation method. Some of our demands are being met, roughly a half of them,” the minister said. Bozumbayev said there could also be other forms of compensation, such as a long-term loan for constructing an oil refinery and supplies of oil and gas for the domestic market. In addition, he said there could be other investment commitments. Eni and Shell each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, while Kazakhstan’s KazMunayGaz owns 10 percent, U.S. Chevron Corp has 18 percent and Russia’s Lukoil owns 13.5 percent. Karachaganak produced 4.2 million tonnes of gas condensate, a product marketed the same way as oil, in January-April, 0.7 percent less than in the same period of 2017.

By James Pearson HANOI, May 17 (Reuters) - Rosneft Vietnam BV, a unit of Russian state oil firm Rosneft, is concerned that its recent drilling in an area of the South China Sea that is claimed by China could upset Beijing, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Wednesday. Rosneft said on Tuesday its Vietnamese unit had started drilling at the LD-3P well, part of the Lan Do “Red Orchid” offshore gas field in Block 06.1, 370 kms (230 miles) southeast of Vietnam. The block is “within the area outlined by China’s nine-dash line,” according to energy consultancy and research firm Wood Mackenzie. When asked about the Reuters report of the drilling, China’s foreign ministry spokesman said that no country, organisation, company or individual can, without the permission of the Chinese government, carry out oil and gas exploration or exploitation activities in waters under Chinese jurisdiction. “We urge relevant parties to earnestly respect China’s sovereign and jurisdictional rights and not do anything that could impact bilateral relations or this region’s peace and stability,” the spokesman, Lu Kang, told a regular news briefing on Thursday. China’s U-shaped “nine-dash line” marks a vast expanse of the South China Sea that it claims, including large swathes of Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone. Maps of the area indicate the block is around 85 kms (53 miles) inside the contested area. A series of dashes, the line is not continuous making China’s claims often ambiguous. In recent years, though, China has increasingly patrolled and enforced the area, claiming historic rights to the resources and features within it. In March, Vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby “Red Emperor” block following pressure from China, sources told Reuters. That block is licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol , which has asked Vietnam to pay compensation over the issue. The Vietnamese foreign ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment. Rosneft had no consultations with the Kremlin on drilling in the South China Sea, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. “As far as we know, the company has already made a statement that it works exactly in line with the obtained licenses,” Peskov told a regular conference call with reporters. Fearing repercussions and pressure from China, Rosneft Vietnam had wanted to begin drilling with as little attention as possible, despite the statement by its parent company on Tuesday, the sources said. On Thursday, its parent company said its drilling in the block was within Vietnam’s territorial waters, and in accordance with Vietnamese legislation. Both Rosneft and Russia’s Gazprom have significant development projects in Vietnamese waters that fall within the area claimed by China, said Ian Storey, a regional security expert at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. “Although Russian diplomats have privately expressed concerns to their U.S. counterparts that China may one day put pressure on Moscow to terminate those projects, so far Beijing has refrained from doing so because of the ever-closer strategic partnership between the two countries,” said Storey. “It would be a serious blow to the burgeoning Sino-Russian entente if Beijing asked Moscow to end its energy projects in Vietnam.” China has become Russia’s top destination for exports, largely because Russia is the largest supplier of oil and gas to China, mainly through pipelines. The drilling in the “Red Orchid” gas field within the block will be undertaken using the “Hakuryu-5” equipment made by Japanese company Japan Drilling Co., Ltd, Rosneft said in that statement. The Hakuryu-5 arrived in the disputed area on May 6, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon ship tracking data and was still recorded as being inside the block late on Wednesday. The drilling is significant for Vietnam, which has been struggling to maintain its crude oil and gas output amid already declining production from its key fields and the continuing pressure from China in the disputed waters. Vietnam already gets about 30 percent of its gas needs from block 06.1 because of oil and gas operations established there as long as 15 years ago. It lies just south of blocks 05.3 and 05.2, where in 2007 British Petroleum suspended work following a threat of “economic consequences” from China, according to a September, 2007 U.S. State Department cable leaked by WikiLeaks. In April, Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam said that maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities this year. Hanoi and Beijing have long been embroiled in disputes over the maritime boundary, which is a politically sensitive issue in Vietnam. Police in the central province of Khanh Hoa have launched an investigation into a group of Chinese tourists who were pictured in a local airport wearing T-shirts printed with a map showing the “nine-dash line”, state media reported on Wednesday. Airport authorities asked the tourists, who arrived at Cam Ranh Airport on Sunday, to take off their T-shirts after going through customs, the Van Hoa (Culture) newspaper reported.

2018-05-17,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - New large trucks in the European Union will have to emit at least 30 percent less CO2 by 2030 than in 2019 under the bloc’s first ever CO2 standards for trucks proposed on Thursday that the industry said were “far too aggressive”. The EU currently has no limits on the CO2 produced by trucks, which account for a quarter of all road transport emissions while making up just 5 percent of vehicles on the road. Countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada have already set targets to reduce truck CO2 emissions. The European Commission has proposed an interim CO2 reduction target of 15 percent by 2025 for all large trucks compared to 2019 levels. By 2030 trucks will have to emit at least 30 percent less CO2 than in 2019. Europe’s auto lobby ACEA said the reduction levels proposed were “far too aggressive”. “It would seem as though the Commission has simply taken the exact CO2 reduction levels it already proposed for cars and vans, and applied them directly to heavy-duty vehicles, without fully recognising the fundamental differences between these vehicle segments,” Erik Jonnaert, ACEA Secretary General, said. ACEA had lobbied for a 16 percent tail-pipe CO2 reduction between 2019 and 2030, with an intermediate target of 7 percent in 2025. Large trucks account for around 65-70 percent of all CO2 emissions from heavy-duty vehicles in the EU, which also include smaller trucks, buses and coaches. The Commission will conduct a review in 2022 to extend the standards to other types of heavy-duty vehicles and determine their target for 2030. The EU by 2030 wants to cut emissions across all sectors of the economy by at least 40 percent versus 1990 levels. Thursday’s proposal follows new draft rules on CO2 standards for cars. “All sectors must contribute to meet our climate commitments under the Paris Agreement,” said Miguel Arias Canete, EU Commissioner for climate action and energy. “That’s why, for the first time ever, we are proposing EU standards to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles.” Environmental campaign group Transport & Environment (T&E) said the proposed targets fell short of what was needed to hit the EU’s own climate goals. Some EU countries and hauliers had called for a 2025 target of at least 24 percent and a 2030 target of 34-45 percent. Stef Cornelis, cleaner trucks officer with T&E, said the proposed standards mean “a lot of cost-effective clean technologies won’t be fitted to new trucks, which will result in truckers and the climate missing out on big savings.” The Commission expects its targets to save around 54 million tonnes of CO2 from 2020 to 2030, equivalent to the total annual emissions of Sweden. The proposal will need to be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament before becoming law. The Commission also proposed an action plan for the production of battery cells for electric cars as part of its drive to slash transport emissions. Europe lags behind countries such as China, South Korea and Japan in the production of batteries for electric vehicles and the European car industry has warned that the rush to electric cars would hand even more business to those countries. The Commission’s measures include support for securing access to the raw materials needed to build batteries, developing the necessary skills for the manufacturing processes and investment in research and innovation for electro-mobility.

2018-05-17,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) on Thursday joined a growing list of companies preparing to call a halt to doing business with Iran, casting doubts on whether European leaders can keep alive a nuclear deal with Tehran. Maersk’s move comes a day after French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) and other European companies signalled they could exit Iran ahead of a reimposition of sanctions following the United States’ decision to pull out of the Iran accord. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that the European Union must protect European Union companies doing business with Iran from U.S. sanctions.     But Macron, joining EU leaders for a summit in Bulgaria, also said he recognised that big companies would want to protect their own interests. “International companies with interests in many countries make their own choices according to their own interests. They should continue to have this freedom,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran means European countries that have since invested in the country will be at risk once new sanctions come into effect. Maersk Chief Executive Soren Skou said: “With the sanctions the Americans are to impose, you can’t do business in Iran if you also have business in the U.S., and we have that on a large scale.” “I don’t know the exact timing details, but I am certain that we’re also going to shut down (in Iran),” Skou told Reuters in an interview following Maersk’s first-quarter earnings. MSC, the world’s second biggest container shipping group after Maersk, said on Wednesday it would stop taking new booking for Iran.   Other companies which have warned they would wind down business in Iran following reinstated sanctions include German insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE), Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Danish oil product tanker operator Maersk Tankers, previously owned by the Maersk conglomerate.    Maersk’s Skou said higher oil prices which followed the U.S. withdrawal were hitting its container shipping business because of higher bunker fuel prices.   Oil prices hit their highest level since November 2014 on Thursday, with Brent crude creeping ever closer to $80 per barrel.

2018-05-17,"LAGOS, May 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Africa is sometimes better known for its vulnerability to climate change than its action on the problem – but a set of African cities intend to change that. Eight cities – from Accra to Dar es Salaam – pledged this week to deliver their share of emissions cuts needed to meet Paris Agreement targets to limit climate change. That means achieving “zero carbon” city economies by 2050 - with climate changing emissions eliminated, or dramatically reduced and any small remaining emissions offset by other green actions. “We cannot ignore the implications of what will befall us if we do not act now,” said Mohammed Adjei Sowah, the mayor of Accra, Ghana’s capital, at a planning meeting in Nigeria on urban climate action in Africa. Pursuing development in the way it’s traditionally been done is no longer feasible, he said in Lagos at the launch of the emissions cutting push. Achieving the aim will require significant work. According to the World Bank, of the top 10 big world cities with the lowest climate-changing emissions, only one – Johannesburg – is in Africa. Under the new commitments, cities will work to reduce emissions from things such as transport, buildings, energy production and waste management – an effort some have already started. The city of Tshwane (formerly Pretoria) in South Africa, for instance, has carried out an inventory of its emissions, to better understand which areas need the most urgent work. The city’s mayor also has for four years organised the African Capital Cities Sustainability Forum, which led to the creation of a sustainability unit in Tshwane’s mayoral office. “We started this climate action trajectory in 2013, putting together the carbon emission inventory and vulnerability assessment, out of which we then started to take action based on the data”, Sello Mphaga, head of the Tshwane mayor’s sustainability unit. The city’s emissions come from “three main sectors – energy, waste management and transport. From the study, we see how much each sector is emitting and that assists us in planning to reduce or act upon these emissions,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of the Lagos meeting. Besides Accra, Tshwane and Dar es Salaam, other African cities that have signed the new pledge include Addis Ababa, Lagos, Dakar, Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg. Two other cities – Nairobi and Abidjan – are expected to submit their plans to take part soon, said Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities alliance, a global network of cities tackling climate change. To try to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, cities signed on to the new African effort commit to reduce their carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Sowah, of Accra, said he believes it is possible to dramatically cut urban African emissions, particularly as more African cities become aware of the impact of worsening climate extremes, from recurring droughts and floods to failed crops and more migration. But African cities will need to hold the line on emissions even as their populations grow substantially in coming decades. The World Bank projects that 70 percent of the world’s population could live in cities by 2050, and Africa is expected to account for half of the world’s population growth by 2050. here Lagos, for instance, struggles with heavy pollution from its infamous traffic jams, while its population of 21 million produces large volumes of waste. Nigeria is also home to Onitsha, which the World Health Organization in 2016 named as a city with some of the world’s worst air pollution, and Port Harcourt, an oil port that is often blanketed in soot. In a country where power failures are a regular problem, many households regularly use polluting diesel generators to produce power. Nigeria in 2015 signed the Paris Agreement – which aims to hold global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius – under pressure from activists for cleaner energy and sustainability groups, who have said better incentives and penalties are needed to drive effective green action. But the transition to lower emissions will require capital, officials warned. “Each sector – like agriculture, power, transport – has its own strategies to encourage cleaner energy rather than use of fossil fuels. But these solutions are capital intensive,” warned Ikenna Ofoegbu of the German Heinrich Boll Foundation. “For instance, it is cheaper for international oil companies (IOCs) to flare (natural) gas than recycling it because there is no extensive infrastructure and it is hard to find a market for people to buy flared gas,” he said. Legislation in Nigeria also favours electrical distribution companies that rely on fossil fuels over mini-grid operators using solar panels, Ofoegbu said. That’s in part because powerful elites own the traditional distribution companies and regularly lobby to keep the existing system in place, he said. For instance, a mini-grid operator who wants to generate more than a megawatt of clean power has to do so at least 10 km away from distribution lines, he said. Solar panels also can be expensive to import. Nigeria has no customs duty on renewable energy devices but the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), of which it is a member, stipulates a 5 percent customs duty on some types of devices, Ofeogbu said. If better incentives for clean energy were put in place, “more people will pack up their generators and get solar panels”, Ofoegbu said. “But people need to be able to afford it and one of the biggest issues is the cost of import duty.” To achieve its emissions goals, Nigeria also needs to look at things like tree planting – perhaps requiring that a tree be planted for each one cut – and encouraging the use of clean cooking stoves to cut firewood use, he said. But, Sowah added, significant political willpower will be needed to enforce any policy changes made. Reporting by Eromo Egbejule ; editing by Laurie Goering and

Ten-year U.S. government Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, neared a 7-year high of 3.12 percent as higher oil pointed to higher inflation and followed Wednesday’s upbeat U.S. retail sales numbers. Europe’s FX traders nursed dollar index positions after its latest surge, but euro/dollar was struggling to keep a foothold back above $1.18 and dollar/yen hit its highest level since late January at 110.57. “The big turnaround was the Japanese yen, there is clearly big time (U.S. vs Japan) rate sensitivity there,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy. “The correlation (between moves in yields and yen) is likely to one-to-one almost, and without any risk appetite meltdown that should continue.” World and European shares did creep higher but other two big macro market spotlights stayed on Italy and Turkey. Turkey’s lira was on the slide again as concerns persisted about what an expansion of President Tayyip Erdogan’s powers could mean if he wins elections in the country next month as widely expected. It came despite the central bank saying on Wednesday that it would take action against a sell-off in the currency. Benchmark Italian government bond yields nudged higher after a 16 basis point jump on Wednesday following reports, subsequently denied, that the prospective Five Star/League coalition government had drafted an economic plan that would seek 250 billion euros of debt forgiveness from the European Central Bank. While few people see that as either a realistic proposal or one that would remain in the coalition’s agenda, the tone of the new government’s stance toward euro zone rules was seen as confrontational and spooked some investors. Markets are now eagerly awaiting the final agreement to see what details remain. Two-year Italian government yields are now back in positive territory for the first time in almost a year – the only other positive yielding two-year euro zone government bond is Greece. “I’m still sceptical on the euro, there is a lot of headline risk,” Saxo bank’s Hardy said, adding the worry for lira was that investors will bolt even before they know Erdogan’s post- election plans. The other major mover was oil which was nearing the $80 a barrel threshold for first time since late 2014. With the global economy running at healthy clip demand remains strong, while U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to re-impose sanctions on Iran could soon cut global supply by a million barrels a day. Brent crude futures were last at $79.47 per barrel, up 0.12 percent from their last close, while U.S. crude was at $71.67 a barrel, up 18 cents. Both are now up almost 30 percent since February and 80 percent since June last year. ANZ bank said on Thursday that Brent was “now threatening to break through $80 per barrel ... (as) geopolitical risks continue to support prices, (and as) an unexpected fall in inventories in the U.S. got investors excited.” U.S. bank Morgan Stanley meanwhile raised its Brent price forecast to $90 per barrel by 2020 due to a steady increase in demand. Back in the currency markets, sterling rallied against both the dollar and the euro after a UK newspaper reported that Prime Minister Theresa May would tell Brussels that Britain was prepared to stay in the European Union’s customs union after a transitional arrangement beyond 2021. Pressure on Mexico’s peso returned as hopes for a new-look NAFTA trade deal with the U.S. and Canada were pushed back and as the country’s central bank said its systems had been hit by a 300 million pesos ($15.33 million) cyber attack.

Moller-Maersk, followed the French oil major in saying it would quit Iran, denting EU efforts to save the nuclear accord with Tehran and protect European companies doing business with the Islamic Republic. “International companies with interests in many countries make their own choices according to their own interests. They should continue to have this freedom,” he said on arriving for a second day of EU leaders’ talks in the Bulgarian capital. “But what is important is that companies, and especially medium-sized companies which are perhaps less exposed to other markets, American or others, can make this choice freely.” The EU wants to salvage the Iran nuclear deal, which offers the Islamic Republic relief from economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme and Europe sees as an important element of international security. However, EU officials say there is no easy way to protect EU firms from U.S. sanctions and that it will take time for the bloc to devise what will likely be a complex mix of national and EU-level measures. Ignoring European support for the nuclear pact, U.S. President Donald Trump branded the agreement as “the worst deal ever” and announced on May 8 the United States was pulling out. Total on Wednesday said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project unless it secured a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Tehran had repeatedly hailed the project as a symbol of the nuclear accord’s success. CEO Soren Skou told Reuters on Thursday that A.P. Moller-Maersk was following suit. “With the sanctions the Americans are to impose, you can’t do business in Iran if you also have business in the U.S., and we have that on a large scale,” Skou told Reuters in an interview following the firm’s first-quarter report. “I don’t know the exact timing details, but I am certain that we’re also going to shut down (in Iran),” Skou said. Finnish mining technology company Outotec said U.S. sanctions would slow down and complicate its ties with Iran but it was too early to say if it would leave. Macron, voicing understanding for big companies anxious to protect their U.S. sales, said France backed proposals by the European Commission to protect and compensate European companies that might be hit by U.S. sanctions for trading with Iran. They are all but certain to fall short of the type of firm guarantees that the Iranian authorities have been seeking. President Hassan Rouhani has said Iran would remain committed to the deal, which China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany also signed, provided those powers ensured Iran was protected from sanctions.

Rosneft said on Tuesday its Vietnamese unit had started drilling at the LD-3P well, part of the Lan Do “Red Orchid” offshore gas field in Block 06.1, 370 kms (230 miles) southeast of Vietnam. The block is “within the area outlined by China’s nine-dash line,” according to energy consultancy and research firm Wood Mackenzie. When asked about the Reuters report of the drilling, China’s foreign ministry spokesman said that no country, organisation, company or individual can, without the permission of the Chinese government, carry out oil and gas exploration or exploitation activities in waters under Chinese jurisdiction. “We urge relevant parties to earnestly respect China’s soverign and jurisdictional rights and not do anything that could impact bilateral relations or this region’s peace and stability,” the spokesman, Lu Kang, told a regular news briefing on Thursday. China’s U-shaped “nine-dash line” marks a vast expanses of the South China Sea that it claims, including large swathes of Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone. Maps of the area indicate the block is around 85 kms (53 miles) inside the contested area. A series of dashes, the line is not continuous making China’s claims often ambiguous. In recent years, though, China has increasingly patrolled and enforced the area, claiming historic rights to the resources and features within it. In March, Vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby “Red Emperor” block following pressure from China, sources told Reuters. That block is licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol , which has asked Vietnam to pay compensation over the issue. The Vietnamese foreign ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment. Russia’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Fearing repercussions and pressure from China, Rosneft Vietnam had wanted to begin drilling with as little attention as possible, despite the statement by its parent company on Tuesday, the sources said. On Thursday, its parent company said its drilling in the block was within Vietnam’s territorial waters, and in accordance with Vietnamese legislation. Both Rosneft and Russia’s Gazprom have significant development projects in Vietnamese waters that fall within the area claimed by China, said Ian Storey, a region security expert at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. “Although Russian diplomats have privately expressed concerns to their U.S. counterparts that China may one day put pressure on Moscow to terminate those projects, so far Beijing has refrained from doing so because of the ever-closer strategic partnership between the two countries,” said Storey. “It would be a serious blow to the burgeoning Sino-Russian entente if Beijing asked Moscow to end its energy projects in Vietnam.” China has become Russia’s top destination for exports, largely because Russia is the largest supplier of oil and gas to China, mainly through pipelines. The drilling in the “Red Orchid” gas field within the block will be undertaken using the “Hakuryu-5” equipment made by Japanese company Japan Drilling Co., Ltd, Rosneft said in that statement. The Hakuryu-5 arrived in the disputed area on May 6, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon ship tracking data and was still recorded as being inside the block late on Wednesday. The drilling is significant for Vietnam, which has been struggling to maintain its crude oil and gas output amid already declining production from its key fields and the continuing pressure from China in the disputed waters. In April, Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam said that maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities this year. Hanoi and Beijing have long been embroiled in disputes over the maritime boundary, which is a politically sensitive issue in Vietnam. Police in the central province of Khanh Hoa have launched an investigation into a group of Chinese tourists who were pictured in a local airport wearing T-shirts printed with a map showing the “nine-dash line”, state media reported on Wednesday. Airport authorities asked the tourists, who arrived at Cam Ranh Airport on Sunday, to take off their T-shirts after going through customs, the Van Hoa (Culture) newspaper reported.

2018-05-17,"* U.S. 10-year debt yield touches fresh 7-year highs * Oil nears $80 a barrel * Dollar rally pauses, Euro edges up from 5-month low * MSCI’s gauge of world shares creeps up * Italian bond yields grind higher amid political strife By Marc Jones LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - The dollar took a breather at a five-month high on Thursday, though government borrowing costs continued to grind upwards as oil prices hit their highest since 2014 at almost $80 a barrel. Ten-year U.S. government Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, neared a 7-year high of 3.12 percent as higher oil pointed to higher inflation and followed Wednesday’s upbeat U.S. retail sales numbers. Europe’s FX traders nursed dollar index positions after its latest surge, but euro/dollar was struggling to keep a foothold back above $1.18 and dollar/yen hit its highest level since late January at 110.57. “The big turnaround was the Japanese yen, there is clearly big time (U.S. vs Japan) rate sensitivity there,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy. “The correlation (between moves in yields and yen) is likely to one-to-one almost, and without any risk appetite meltdown that should continue.” World and European shares did creep higher but other two big macro market spotlights stayed on Italy and Turkey. Turkey’s lira was on the slide again as concerns persisted about what an expansion of President Tayyip Erdogan’s powers could mean if he wins elections in the country next month as widely expected. It came despite the central bank saying on Wednesday that it would take action against a sell-off in the currency. Benchmark Italian government bond yields nudged higher after a 16 basis point jump on Wednesday following reports, subsequently denied, that the prospective Five Star/League coalition government had drafted an economic plan that would seek 250 billion euros of debt forgiveness from the European Central Bank. While few people see that as either a realistic proposal or one that would remain in the coalition’s agenda, the tone of the new government’s stance toward euro zone rules was seen as confrontational and spooked some investors. Markets are now eagerly awaiting the final agreement to see what details remain. Two-year Italian government yields are now back in positive territory for the first time in almost a year – the only other positive yielding two-year euro zone government bond is Greece. “I’m still sceptical on the euro, there is a lot of headline risk,” Saxo bank’s Hardy said, adding the worry for lira was that investors will bolt even before they know Erdogan’s post- election plans. The other major mover was oil which was nearing the $80 a barrel threshold for first time since late 2014. With the global economy running at healthy clip demand remains strong, while U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to re-impose sanctions on Iran could soon cut global supply by a million barrels a day. Brent crude futures were last at $79.47 per barrel, up 0.12 percent from their last close, while U.S. crude was at $71.67 a barrel, up 18 cents. Both are now up almost 30 percent since February and 80 percent since June last year. ANZ bank said on Thursday that Brent was “now threatening to break through $80 per barrel ... (as) geopolitical risks continue to support prices, (and as) an unexpected fall in inventories in the U.S. got investors excited.” U.S. bank Morgan Stanley meanwhile raised its Brent price forecast to $90 per barrel by 2020 due to a steady increase in demand. Back in the currency markets, sterling rallied against both the dollar and the euro after a UK newspaper reported that Prime Minister Theresa May would tell Brussels that Britain was prepared to stay in the European Union’s customs union after a transitional arrangement beyond 2021. Pressure on Mexico’s peso returned as hopes for a new-look NAFTA trade deal with the U.S. and Canada were pushed back and as the country’s central bank said its systems had been hit by a 300 million pesos ($15.33 million) cyber attack.

2018-05-17,"* Terminal likely to be ready in 2 months - company official * Commissioning cargo is for mid-June - source * Chinese companies setting up LNG terminals to meet demand surge (Adds details) By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, May 17 (Reuters) - Chinese gas distributor ENN is seeking a commissioning cargo for the country’s first privately owned liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal, three industry sources said on Thursday. The cargo is for delivery in the middle of June, one of the sources said. ENN’s Zhoushan terminal in China’s eastern Zhejiang region, with a capacity of 3 million tonnes per year, will likely start operations in two months, a senior company official told Reuters, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media. “We are aiming to (start) the terminal in the second half of the year and are in the final stages now,” the source said. ENN has signed long-term deals including sales and purchase agreements with Chevron Corp and Australia’s Origin Energy and also has an agreement to buy LNG from Total . The deals total about 1.5 million tonnes per year of LNG. China overtook South Korea as the world’s second-largest LNG importer in 2017 with imports of 38 million tonnes, 46 percent higher than the year before. The imports soared after the government ordered millions of homes to switch to natural gas and electric heating from coal to counter rising air pollution. To meet the higher demand and to reduce their dependence on supply from state-owned companies, Chinese companies are building their own LNG terminals to import the fuel directly. Guangzhou Gas Group, a local government-backed gas distributor and a major supplier to Guangzhou province, plans to build a 2 million-tonnes-per-year receiving terminal at the port of Nansha by 2020. State-run Sinopec Corp operates three LNG receiving terminals at the ports of Qingdao, Beihai and Tianjin, each with a import capacity of 3 million tonnes per year. Since the first LNG terminal in Guangdong province opened in 2006, China’s state-owned companies now operate over 50 million tonnes of annual import capacity.

2018-05-17,"NEW DELHI, May 17 (Reuters) - State-run thermal power plants in India’s coastal states have again begun buying overseas coal due to domestic coal shortages, government and utility officials said, in a setback for the country’s long-term plans to eliminate imports. After no significant imports in 2017, government utilities in the states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have ordered several cargoes of coal since the beginning of this year, two officials said. Andhra Pradesh, a state on India’s east coast, has imported 200,000 tonnes of coal so far this year and could import as much as 1 million tonnes in 2018, said Ajay Jain, a senior official in the state energy department. “Coal has been a real problem. If we had depended only on coal, it would have been a disaster,” Jain said. Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp, a government utility in the southwestern India state, has imported about 1.4 million tonnes of coal this year, after going a year without imports starting at the end of 2016, according to Vikram Kapoor, the chairman of the utility. An increase in coal imports by state-owned power utilities undermines a pledge by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to cut thermal coal imports to zero by March 2018. But state-owned Coal India Ltd, the world’s second-biggest coal miner by production, is grappling with a shortage of trains to carry the fuel from its mines to the country’s power plants. Both Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are waiting for the wind energy season to start in June, when they expect dependence on coal to ease, Jain and Kapoor both said. Domestic logistic bottlenecks, regulatory changes and surging power demand will likely increase 2018 thermal coal imports after two years of declines, Reuters reported in February. Imports rose over 15 percent in the first quarter of 2018. State-run utilities could add up to 5 million tonnes to India’s coal imports in 2018 because of the Coal India shortages, a senior executive from Adani Enterprises, India’s biggest coal trader told Reuters in February. India imported 144.5 million tonnes of coal in 2017, according to data provided by American Fuels & Natural Resources, a Dubai-based coal trader. Imports would be a boost for international miners such as Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, Australia’s Whitehaven Coal or global commodity merchant Glencore. Maharashtra, a western coastal state, has floated a tender for procuring 1 million tonnes of coal to augment its existing stock and meet growing power demand, a senior official at Maharashtra State Power Generation Co, the state utility, said on Tuesday. Gujarat, Maharashtra’s northwestern neighbour, plans to ramp up imports by 400,000 tonnes this year, according to a senior state government official. Karnataka, another southern state, has resisted imports so far. But that might change, according to Kumar Naik, the managing director of state utility Karnataka Power Corp. Two of Karnataka’s three major thermal power plants had almost run out of coal stockpiles, according to government data on May 14. $1 = 68.0800 Indian rupees

2018-05-17,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At the International Energy Forum in Delhi in April, the world’s top oil producer Saudi Aramco inked a preliminary deal to partner with a consortium of Indian players to build a $44 billion refinery and petrochemical project on India’s west coast. The huge project was touted as a gamechanger for both parties - offering India steady fuel supplies and meeting Saudi Arabia’s need to secure regular buyers for its oil. Despite the obvious benefits, though, the prospects for the plan - in the works since 2015 - are growing dimmer by the day. Thousands of farmers oppose the refinery and are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood. “We earn enough to fulfil our needs and we do not want to surrender our lands for a refinery at any cost,” says Sandesh Desai, standing amid his fruit-laden mango orchard in Nanar, a village in Ratnagiri district, some 400 km (250 miles) south of Mumbai. Land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural India, where a majority of the population depends on farming for their livelihood. In 2008, for example, India’s Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) had to shelve plans for a car factory in an eastern state after facing widespread protests from farmers. And while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to ease land acquisition rules to jumpstart delayed projects worth tens of billions of dollars, the government has faced resistance to amending populist laws enacted by his predecessors.  Like Desai, a majority of the farmers from 14 villages around Ratnagiri that need to be relocated for the refinery project firmly oppose the plan, a state government official told Reuters. Opposition politicians and even a local ally of Modi’s Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) support the farmer movement, complicating matters further for the government ahead of state and general elections in 2019. The state government, which is responsible for acquiring the land for the project, has so far failed to secure even one acre of the roughly 15,000 acres needed for the refinery, Maharashtra Industries Minister Subhash Desai told Reuters. “The state is not going to acquire land as a majority of the farmers are against the plan,” said Desai, the minister, who is a member of the Shiv Sena, a regional party allied with the BJP in the Maharashtra state government. Under land acquisition rules at least 70 percent of the land owners need to provide consent for a project, he said. Still, some believe that the opponents are only objecting to get better compensation packages for their land. “Eventually all stakeholders will give their consent, but it will take time,” said Ajay Singh Sengar, who heads a rival forum that supports the refinery project. A local government official in the area said he thought many farmers would agree to a deal once a compensation package was announced.      The Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPL), which is running the project, says the 1.2-million-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing. But farmers say they have sufficient work in their orchards and fields.  “We don’t have enough people to maintain our mango orchards. That’s why every year we employ migrant labour from Nepal,” says Arvind Samant, the secretary of a farmers’ and fishermen’s group that was created to organise opposition to the project. Samant says instead of a refinery the government should bring agro-processing plants or other industries that suit local needs. RRPL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp (IOC) (IOC.NS), Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL.NS) and Bharat Petroleum (BPCL.NS), said suggestions the refinery would hurt the environment were baseless. It says it will continue to cultivate mangoes and cashews on some 4,500 acres of land around the project. Despite the opposition, RRPL is hopeful the project will proceed. “Some people misguided farmers and created fear. We’re now trying to answer each and every doubt,” said Anil Nagwekar, a spokesman for the RRPL, adding RRPL was struggling to convince farmers as they refused to even discuss the plan with the company. Hundreds of people have joined non-violent protests, blocking surveyors from even measuring land needed for the site, said Omkar Prabhudesai, who heads the local group opposing the project.   “There is no point in listening to the company’s views. We have already decided not to give our land,” said Prabhudesai.  The refinery, announced in 2015, was to be commissioned by 2022, but delays in land acquisition mean the deadline is likely to be pushed back. “Ideally the state government should have acquired land by now and the work for the project should have started. The delay could impact deadlines,” said RRPL’s Nagwekar. Saudi Aramco declined to comment, while India’s oil ministry did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment. Even if the government wanted to implement the project, it would not start any land acquisition process before elections in 2019, conceded a senior state government official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. “Sensing political mileage every political party is opposing the project. For the next one year there won’t be any progress,” the official said. Workers of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), a regional party, vandalised offices of RRPL in Mumbai in April.  An MNS spokesman confirmed reports of the incident and said the party was strongly opposed to the refinery plan. Parties like the Indian National Congress, and the Nationalist Congress Party also oppose the plan. Still, some officials remain hopeful.       Building a large project such as this in India was possible, but could take years, said IOC’s head of refineries Rama Gopal. “We conceived the Paradip refinery project in 1994,” he said, referring to a plant it runs on the east coast. “But for various reasons the project got delayed and it was finally only commissioned in 2014.”  Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav and Nidhi Verma; Editing by Euan Rocha and Alex Richardson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-refinery-protests/land-acquisition-woes-thwart-indias-mega-refinery-plan-with-saudi-aramco-idUKL1N1S80XK,17 May 2018,"At the International

2018-05-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - New rules coming into force from 2020 to curb pollution produced by the world’s ships are worrying everyone from OPEC oil producers to bunker fuel sellers and shipping companies. The regulations will slash emissions of sulfur, which is blamed for causing respiratory diseases and is a component of acid rain that damages vegetation and wildlife. But the energy and shipping industries are ill-prepared, say analysts, with refiners likely to struggle to meet higher demand for cleaner fuel and few ships fitted with equipment to reduce sulfur emissions. This raises the risk of a chaotic shift when the new rules are implemented, alongside more volatility in the oil market. “The reality is that the industry has already passed the date beyond the smooth transition,” Neil Atkinson, head of the oil industry and market division at the International Energy Agency (IEA), said in April. The rules, drawn up by the U.N. International Maritime Organization (IMO), will ban ships using fuel with a sulfur content higher than 0.5 percent, compared to 3.5 percent now, unless a vessel has equipment to clean up its sulfur emissions. Any vessels failing to comply will face fines, could find their insurance stops being valid and might be declared “unseaworthy” which would bar them from sailing. The global shipping fleet now consumes about 4 million barrels per day (bpd) of high sulfur fuel oil, but about 3 million bpd of that demand will “disappear overnight”, according to the average market forecast calculated by Norway’s SEB Bank. Most demand is expected to shift to marine gasoil, a lower sulfur distillate fuel. Morgan Stanley predicts this will generate at least 1.5 million bpd in extra demand for distillate in the next three years, pushing up total distillate demand growth for the period to 3.2 million bpd. That, in turn, will drive up prices. Gasoil now trades at a premium of about $250 a ton to fuel oil, but the forward curve forecasts this will balloon to $380 per ton by early 2020.  Thomson Reuters Research estimates fuel accounts for about half a ship’s daily operating cost. Based on average fuel consumption of 20 to 80 tonnes a day (MT/day), a ship using cleaner fuel faces extra daily expenses of about $6,000 to $20,000. For example, a VLCC, one of the biggest oil tankers at sea, will pay 25 percent more for its fuel, or an extra $500,000 on top of normal bill of $2 million, for a typical 25-day voyage from the Middle East to Japan. Shipowners can install kit called a “scrubber” that strips out sulfur emissions and allowing them to use the dirtier fuel oil. Some ships already have them. Global trading firm Trafigura has ordered scrubbers for its fleet of 32 ships. But the equipment alone can cost $1 million to $6 million, according to manufacturer Wartsila, putting it out of reach of many operators. By 2020, about 2,000 ships could have scrubbers, according to Wartsila, SEB Bank and industry analyst AlphaTanker. But AlphaTankers’ Andrew Wilson called this a “drop in the ocean”, given there are about 90,000 vessels in the global fleet, of which about 60,000 ply international routes. Based on the limited number of manufacturers and time constraints on facilities to install scrubbers, AlphaTanker estimates no more than 500 ships could be fitted each year. Wartsila puts the figure closer to 300. So it would take more than 100 years to fit the global fleet. Many vessels may try to dodge the new rules, unable to afford the cost of scrubbers and reluctant to pay the premium for cleaner fuel. But how much of the industry will cheat is open to debate, with estimates ranging from 10 to 40 percent. The IMO says it will ban ships that do not have scrubbers from carrying any fuel oil, making it easier to catch cheaters. Oil major BP expects 10 percent of ships could cheat, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects a figure of about 30 percent when the rules launch in 2020. Consultant Citac says industry polls indicate cheating could be in a range of 25 to 40 percent. The global refining industry needs to process an extra 2.5 million bpd of crude to make distillates for cleaner fuel, says Robert Herman, refining executive at Phillips 66. Some refiners have invested in cutting sulfur in their output, but fitting hydrocracker or coker unit so that a refinery produces more distillates with lower sulfur content while reducing fuel oil output can cost about $1 billion, analysts say. Small refineries, unable to afford the upgrade, may find they are churning out fuel oil without finding buyers. A KBC consultancy survey showed 40 percent of Middle Eastern and European refineries are not prepared. European plants, which tend to be less complex than those in other regions, produce more fuel oil and may face the biggest challenge. Morgan Stanley says refineries of Spain’s Repsol (REP.MC), Turkey’s Tupras, India’s Reliance (RELI.NS) and U.S. independent Valero (VLO.N) are among the best prepared because they already produce high middle distillate and low high-sulfur fuel oil. The simplest way for refineries to produce fuel with less sulfur is to buy and process crude that contains less sulfur, a shift that could change demand for different oil grades and lead to greater oil market volatility. For example, processing Iraq’s Basra Heavy grade with high sulfur content produces as much as 50 percent fuel oil, while using light, sweet North Sea crude with less sulfur produces about 12 percent fuel oil. “There will be a bidding war for sweet crude,” said Stephen George, chief economist with KBC Advanced Technologies. This could hike the price of sweeter crudes, including several grades used to make dated Brent, the benchmark for three quarters of the world’s oil. Meanwhile, the cost of refining “sour” crudes with more sulfur, such as those from Venezuela, Mexico and Ecuador, “could be more than its value,” he said. Energy firms and shippers may face a squeeze on margins. But, ultimately, extra costs are likely to fall on consumers of everything from household appliances to gasoline that are shipped around the world. Roughly 90 percent of world trade is by sea. Wood Mackenzie estimates that global shipping fuel costs are likely to rise by a quarter, or $24 billion, in 2020. Others estimate extra costs for container shipping alone will be $35 billion to $40 billion. In addition, a surge in distillate demand by shippers could push up prices of other products, such as jet fuel and diesel. “It’s going to make moving anything more expensive,” said AlphaTanker’s Wilson.

2018-05-17,"* Crude oil prices rise by 20 pct this year, to almost $80/b * Asia is world’s biggest oil consumer but smallest producer * Banks warn rising oil prices will drive up costs across economy * Poor countries are most affected by rising oil prices (Adds quote from courier company LBC Express) By Henning Gloystein, Rajendra Jadhav and Neil Jerome Morales SINGAPORE/MUMBAI/MANILA, May 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices are poised to break through $80 per barrel and Asia’s  demand is at a record, pushing the cost of the region’s thirst for crude to $1 trillion this year, about twice what it was during the market lull of 2015/2016. Oil prices have gained 20 percent since January to just shy of $80 per barrel, a level not seen since 2014. With the U.S. dollar - in which virtually all oil is traded - also growing stronger, concerns are rising that economies will take a hit, especially in import-reliant Asia. Surging costs could have an inflationary effect that will hurt both consumers and companies. “Asia is most vulnerable to an oil price spike,” Canadian investment bank RBC Capital Markets warned in a note this month, after oil prices hit their highest since November 2014. Asia-Pacific consumes more than 35 percent of the 100 million barrels of oil the world uses each day, according to industry data, with the region’s global share steadily rising. Asia is also the world’s smallest oil producing region, accounting for less than 10 percent of output. (Graphic: reut.rs/2wLchCf) U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said this week that diesel use contributes 10-20 percent to cash costs for miners, while oil contributes from 4 percent to 50 percent to the cost of power generation, depending on a company’s or country’s fuel mix. “A rising oil price therefore shifts the entire cost curve higher,” it said. China is by far Asia’s - and the world’s - biggest importer of oil, ordering 9.6 million barrels per day in April. That’s almost 10 percent of global consumption. At current prices, this amounts to a Chinese oil import bill of $768 million per day, $23 billion per month - a whopping $280 billion a year. Other Asian countries are even more exposed to rising oil prices. Most damage will be done to countries like India and Vietnam, which not only rely heavily on imports, but also where national wealth is not yet large enough to absorb sudden increases in fuel costs. “Poorer countries with limited borrowing capacity may face financing difficulty amid higher import bills,” RBC said. Unless fuel is heavily subsidized, households and businesses in poorer countries are also more vulnerable to rising oil prices than they are in wealthier nations. In developing economies like India, Vietnam or the Philippines, fuel costs eat up around 8-9 percent of an average person's salary, according to Reuters research and figures from statistics portal Numbeo. That compares to just 1-2 percent in wealthy countries like Japan or Australia. (Graphic: reut.rs/2wLchCf) The surge in oil prices has a particularly big impact on transport and logistics companies. One such firm in Asia is courier LBC Express Holdings in the Philippines. “LBC has been intently watching the movement of crude oil prices ... What we, at LBC, are preparing for are the effects an oil price increase may have on our carriers: airlines, shipping lines, trucking companies,” its Chief Financial Officer Enrique V. Rey Jr said. The high oil price “challenges us to improve our own efficiencies to achieve better economies of scale and maintain our margins,” he said. Some firms say they will pass on any higher costs to consumers. Chryss Alfonsus Damuy, President and Chief Executive at Philippine firm Chelsea Logistics, said his firm could be affected by higher oil prices, but “we can pass on the effect to consumer via price adjustments.” Others said if they burden consumers with higher costs, they will lose clients. Ashish Savla, owner of 50-truck strong Pravin Roadways in Mumbai, India, said diesel accounts for more than half of his company’s expenses, and that it was difficult to pass rising expenses on to customers. “Diesel prices have jumped 16 percent in a year, but I couldn’t raise freight charges by 5 percent. If I charge more, clients will use cheaper railroads,” Savla said. Anil Mittal, who runs a container logistics company and is a member of Bombay Goods Transport Association, said his firm was “already operating at wafer-thin margins” before prices rose. The “diesel price hike has hit our business hard,” he said. Many small transport firms like his “are struggling to pay back bank loans they took to buy trucks.” Given the economic costs and its reliance on imports, economists say it is time for Asia to limit its exposure to oil. “It is very important for Asia to reduce its oil dependency and increase its energy efficiency ... to protect itself from future oil shocks,” RBC Capital Markets said.

2018-05-17,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s oil imports from Iran surged to 640,000 barrels per day (bpd) in April, its highest level since October 2016, according to data from shipping and industry sources, as refiners raised purchases ahead of looming U.S. sanctions against Tehran. Overall, India imported 4.51 million bpd in April, 2.5 percent higher than a year ago, the data showed. India’s Iranian imports rose by 49 percent from March and were 20 percent higher than a year ago, the data showed. The country is the Iran’s second-biggest buyer of crude after China. State refiners have raised their imports after Iran agreed to steep shipping discounts. Iran exported a total 2.6 million bpd of crude in April, a record since the lifting of sanctions in January 2016, according to the news service for the country’s oil ministry.      Going forward, however, Iran’s oil exports are expected to fall. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in May announced the withdrawal from a 2015 agreement between the United States, Iran and other world powers to limit Iran’s nuclear program. The United States intends to renew economic sanctions against Iran, including on the petroleum sector. India’s Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on May 12 that it is too early to say how the sanctions will impact India. In the first four months of 2018, India imported 552,000 bpd from Iran, about 2 percent less than a year ago, the data from the sources showed. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with media. India’s 2018 Iran oil purchases fell because of lower intake by state refiners in the March quarter. New Delhi imported 16 percent less oil from Iran during the  2017/18 financial year as state-refiners reduced purchases after a row over development rights for an Iranian natural gas fields. Iran remained the third-biggest oil supplier to India last month followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the data showed. Venezuela replaced Nigeria as the fourth-biggest supplier as the South American nation pushed more barrels in India and curtailed supplies to the U.S. India received about 397,200 bpd of oil from Venezuela in April, the highest since September, up about 46.8 percent from a year ago, the data showed.

The source, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media, said the shipment would come by late-September, although it could be sent a month or more earlier. A spokesman for Inpex, Japan’s top oil and gas producer, said the company could not give a schedule for the first cargo. The around $40 billion Ichthys project has seen multiple delays and cost overruns of billions of dollars due to technical difficulties. It was originally slated to start in 2016. The commissioning LNG cargo from Ichthys will be exported to Inpex’s Naoetsu LNG terminal in Japan, according to the first source and a second one also familiar with the matter. Inpex has said the Ichthys project will start-up this month with gas production set to begin by the end of May. Project holders in Ichthys are seeking five liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes for delivery into Japan and Taiwan over July to September to replace LNG they will not be able to supply from Ichthys due to delays in its start-up, two traders told Reuters. That is to fulfil contractual commitments to buyers such as Taiwan’s state-owned CPC Corp and the world’s top LNG buyer JERA Co, a fuel joint venture of Tokyo Electric and Chubu Electric, one of the traders said. The Inpex spokesman declined to comment, citing a confidentiality agreement with customers. “They have indicated their interest just to a few companies, so the requirement is not firm yet,” the trader said, adding that offers were due by Thursday. At full operation, Ichthys is expected to produce 8.9 million tonnes of LNG a year, along with about 1.7 million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas and about 100,000 barrels per day of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil. Inpex holds 62.245 percent of Ichthys, France’s Total 30 percent, with the rest spread amongst Taiwan’s CPC Corp and Japanese utilities Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Kansai Electric, JERA Corp and Toho Gas .

Spreadbetters see Britain’s FTSE opening 4 points lower, while Germany’s DAX is expected to rise 13 points and France’s CAC is seen gaining 10 points. In equity markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.7 percent. Losses in Asian share markets, however, were limited after U.S. equities advanced on Wednesday, led by retail and technology shares, even as a rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to an almost seven-year high suggested more competition for equities. “In general, Asian equities are buffered from rising U.S. yields by the constructive tone of the U.S.-China trade talks as well as strong earnings numbers,” said Heng Koon How, head of markets strategy for UOB in Singapore. The United States and China start trade talks on Thursday intended to avert a damaging tariff war, with the White House’s harshest China critic relegated to a supporting role, senior Trump administration officials said on Wednesday. Shares of Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd rose 5.1 percent in Hong Kong, having opened the day up 7 percent after it reported first-quarter results on Wednesday that were better than expected. In currency markets, the euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.1822 , after having set a five-month low of $1.1763 on Wednesday. Worries about political risks had jolted Italian markets and pressured the euro on Wednesday following reports that Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and anti-immigrant League may ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros of debt as the parties worked to draft a coalition programme. That was enough to spook Italian markets, even though the League’s economic spokesman told Reuters that debt cancellation was never in an official draft of a government programme. . The two populist parties have been holding talks aimed at forming a coalition government and ending 10 weeks of stalemate following an inconclusive election on March 4. In bond markets, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield set a fresh seven-year high of 3.108 percent in Asian trade on Thursday. It last stood near 3.104 percent. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries have risen above 3.10 percent this week for the firs time since July 2011, continuing to weigh on stocks as investors considered whether U.S. government bonds might be more attractive than riskier equities. The rise in U.S. bond yields have helped buoy the dollar, which has gained 1.5 percent against a basket of six major currencies so far in May. “If the market continues to trade off U.S. yields and diverging economic data between the U.S. and EU, it’s hard to argue against the current direction in yields or the dollar,” Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said in a note. “On the U.S. economic data front, the consumer remains the economy’s backbone, and if this robust trend in the retail space continues to build, factor in a bit of wage growth pressure and the U.S. dollar will continue to move higher on the back of higher yields,” Innes added. U.S. bond yields have risen after data this week showed a solid rise in U.S. retail sales, suggesting the U.S. economy is on a stronger footing in the second quarter. The dollar index eased 0.2 percent to 93.226. On Wednesday it touched a five-month high of 93.632. Oil prices firmed on Thursday, with Brent crude creeping ever closer to $80 per barrel, a level not seen since November 2014, as supplies tighten while demand remains strong.

Rosneft said on Tuesday its Vietnamese unit had started drilling at the LD-3P well, part of the Lan Do “Red Orchid” offshore gas field in Block 06.1, 370 kms (230 miles) southeast of Vietnam. The block is “within the area outlined by China’s nine-dash line,” according to energy consultancy and research firm Wood Mackenzie. China’s U-shaped “nine-dash line” marks a vast expanses of the South China Sea that it claims, including large swathes of Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone. Maps of the area indicate the block is around 85 kms (53 miles) inside the contested area. A series of dashes, the line is not continuous making China’s claims often ambiguous. In recent years, though, China has increasingly patrolled and enforced the area, claiming historic rights to the resources and features within it. In March, Vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby “Red Emperor” block following pressure from China, sources told Reuters. That block is licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol , which has asked Vietnam to pay compensation over the issue. The Vietnamese foreign ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment. China’s foreign ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment late on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Rosneft declined to comment. Fearing repercussions and pressure from China, Rosneft Vietnam had wanted to begin drilling with as little attention as possible, despite the statement by its parent company on Tuesday, the sources said. The drilling in the “Red Orchid” gas field within the block will be undertaken using the “Hakuryu-5” equipment made by Japanese company Japan Drilling Co., Ltd, Rosneft said in that statement. The Hakuryu-5 arrived in the disputed area on May 6, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon ship tracking data and was still recorded as being inside the block late on Wednesday. The drilling is significant for Vietnam, which has been struggling to maintain its crude oil and gas output amid already declining production from its key fields and the continuing pressure from China in the disputed waters. In April, Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam said that maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities this year. Hanoi and Beijing have long been embroiled in disputes over the maritime boundary, which is a politically sensitive issue in Vietnam. Police in the central province of Khanh Hoa have launched an investigation into a group of Chinese tourists who were pictured in a local airport wearing T-shirts printed with a map showing the “nine-dash line”, state media reported on Wednesday. Airport authorities asked the tourists, who arrived at Cam Ranh Airport on Sunday, to take off their T-shirts after going through customs, the Van Hoa (Culture) newspaper reported.

The rises in U.S. bond yields have helped buoy the dollar, which has gained 1.5 percent against a basket of six major currencies so far in May. “If the market continues to trade off U.S. yields and diverging economic data between the U.S. and EU, it’s hard to argue against the current direction in yields or the dollar,” Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said in a note. “On the U.S. economic data front, the consumer remains the economy’s backbone, and if this robust trend in the retail space continues to build, factor in a bit of wage growth pressure and the U.S. dollar will continue to move higher on the back of higher yields,” Innes added. U.S. bond yields have risen after data this week showed a solid rise in U.S. retail sales, suggesting the U.S. economy is on a stronger footing in the second quarter. The dollar index eased 0.2 percent to 93.187. On Wednesday it touched a five-month high of 93.632. Oil prices firmed on Thursday, with Brent crude creeping ever closer to $80 per barrel, a level not seen since November 2014, as supplies tighten while demand remains strong. Brent crude futures gained 0.2 percent to $79.40 a barrel. Reporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore

2018-05-17,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. investment fund Harbour Energy formalised its $10.36 billion bid for Australia’s Santos Ltd (STO.AX) on Thursday but failed to sweeten its offer, dashing hopes of a higher price and sending the oil and gas producer’s shares lower. A successful bid would mark the biggest takeover of an Australian oil and gas producer, but Adelaide-based Santos has indicated the company may be worth more because of recent gains in the oil price. Santos shares dipped 2 percent to sit below the offer price, with analysts suggesting the company may reject the bid as too low. The broader market was down 0.3 percent. “With only two weeks since the AGM where the (Santos) Chairman implied this offer was not sufficient, we would anticipate the board recommending to reject,” Macquarie analysts said in a client note. Santos said it would consider the offer, which had the same U.S. dollar value as a previous indicative bid from Harbour, and urged shareholders to take no action. Harbour declined to comment. The bid would give Harbour access to a recently revived company with a low cost of oil production and stakes in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Asia-Pacific, where demand is soaring. While Harbour did not change the value of its formal offer, Santos said it had now specified it would pay cash to shareholders other than China’s ENN Ecological Holdings (600803.SS) and Hony Capital, which together own 15.1 percent of the company. ENN and Hony would be able to roll their existing Santos shares into a new Harbour investment vehicle and get shares in that new entity, Santos said. The initial Harbour offer was valued at about A$6.50, based on the foreign exchange at the time, but oil prices have risen about 17 percent since then, leading some analysts to say Harbour would need to raise its offer to A$7.00 a share to succeed. Santos shares were trading at A$6.20 on Thursday. Santos opened its books to Harbour in April after the private equity-backed firm returned with its fourth proposed offer since August.

2018-05-17,"* Rosneft announces drilling in Vietnam’s Block 06.1 on Tuesday * Block is in area outlined by China’s nine-dash line-consultant * That line lays claim to much of the South China Sea * Vietnam previously halted project by Repsol in a nearby block * Rosneft Vietnam did not want publicity for drilling-sources By James Pearson HANOI, May 17 (Reuters) - Rosneft Vietnam BV, a unit of Russian state oil firm Rosneft, is concerned that its recent drilling in an area of the South China Sea that is claimed by China could upset Beijing, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Wednesday. Rosneft said on Tuesday its Vietnamese unit had started drilling at the LD-3P well, part of the Lan Do “Red Orchid” offshore gas field in Block 06.1, 370 kms (230 miles) southeast of Vietnam. The block is “within the area outlined by China’s nine-dash line,” according to energy consultancy and research firm Wood Mackenzie. China’s U-shaped “nine-dash line” marks a vast expanses of the South China Sea that it claims, including large swathes of Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone. Maps of the area indicate the block is around 85 kms (53 miles) inside the contested area. A series of dashes, the line is not continuous making China’s claims often ambiguous. In recent years, though, China has increasingly patrolled and enforced the area, claiming historic rights to the resources and features within it. In March, Vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby “Red Emperor” block following pressure from China, sources told Reuters. That block is licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol , which has asked Vietnam to pay compensation over the issue. The Vietnamese foreign ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment. China’s foreign ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment late on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Rosneft declined to comment. Fearing repercussions and pressure from China, Rosneft Vietnam had wanted to begin drilling with as little attention as possible, despite the statement by its parent company on Tuesday, the sources said. The drilling in the “Red Orchid” gas field within the block will be undertaken using the “Hakuryu-5” equipment made by Japanese company Japan Drilling Co., Ltd, Rosneft said in that statement. The Hakuryu-5 arrived in the disputed area on May 6, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon ship tracking data and was still recorded as being inside the block late on Wednesday. The drilling is significant for Vietnam, which has been struggling to maintain its crude oil and gas output amid already declining production from its key fields and the continuing pressure from China in the disputed waters. In April, Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam said that maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities this year. Hanoi and Beijing have long been embroiled in disputes over the maritime boundary, which is a politically sensitive issue in Vietnam. Police in the central province of Khanh Hoa have launched an investigation into a group of Chinese tourists who were pictured in a local airport wearing T-shirts printed with a map showing the “nine-dash line”, state media reported on Wednesday. Airport authorities asked the tourists, who arrived at Cam Ranh Airport on Sunday, to take off their T-shirts after going through customs, the Van Hoa (Culture) newspaper reported.

In equity markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed, while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.4 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.4 percent. Worries about political risks had jolted Italian markets and pressured the euro following reports that Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and anti-immigrant League may ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros of debt as the parties worked to draft a coalition programme. The two populist parties have held six days of talks aimed at putting together a coalition government and ending 10 weeks of stalemate following an inconclusive election on March 4. The common currency edged up 0.l percent to $1.1814 in early Asian trade, after having set a five-month low of $1.1763 on Wednesday. Italian stocks tumbled 2.3 percent while Italy’s 10-year bond yield jumped nearly 19 basis points to 2.13 percent . Wall Street’s main stock indexes rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.4 percent, while the Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark set a record high. U.S. equities advanced on Wednesday even as a rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to their highest levels in nearly seven years suggested more competition for equities. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit 3.10 percent on Wednesday for the first time since July 2011, continuing to weigh on stocks as investors consider whether U.S. government bonds pose a more attractive option to riskier equities. Wednesday’s yield increase followed Tuesday’s bond market selloff spurred by data showing a solid rise in retail sales that suggested the U.S. economy is on a stronger footing in the second quarter. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to as high as 3.104 percent in early Asian trade on Thursday, matching the near seven-year high set on Wednesday. The rises in U.S. bond yields have helped buoy the dollar, which has gained 1.6 percent against a basket of six major currencies so far in May. “If the market continues to trade off U.S. yields and diverging economic data between the U.S. and EU, it’s hard to argue against the current direction in yields or the dollar,” Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said in a note. “On the U.S. economic data front, the consumer remains the economy’s backbone, and if this robust trend in the retail space continues to build, factor in a bit of wage growth pressure and the U.S. dollar will continue to move higher on the back of higher yields,” Innes added.

2018-05-17,"* Drop in U.S. inventories pushes up WTI crude * OPEC cuts, looming U.S. sanctions against Iran lift Brent * But surging U.S. production could meet fall in OPEC supplies By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Thursday, with Brent crude creeping ever closer to $80 per barrel, a level it has not seen since November 2014, as supplies tighten while demand remains strong. Brent crude futures were at $79.32 per barrel at 0027 GMT, up 4 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $71.68 a barrel, up 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement. ANZ bank said on Thursday that Brent was “now threatening to break through $80 per barrel ... (as) geopolitical risks continue to support prices, (and) an unexpected fall in inventories in the U.S. got investors excited yesterday.” U.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA dropped by 1.4 million barrels in the week to May 11, to 432.34 million barrels. ANZ said the falling U.S. inventories were “raising concerns of tight markets heading into the U.S. driving season,” during which demand typically rises. Looking beyond seasonal changes, U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said it had raised its Brent price forecast to $90 per barrel by 2020, due to a steady increase in demand. Not all pointed to a tighter market, however. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday that it had lowered its global oil demand growth forecast for 2018 from 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to 1.4 million bpd. The IEA said global oil demand would average 99.2 million bpd in 2018. And although supplies currently only stand at 98 million bpd due to supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the IEA said that “strong non-OPEC growth ... will grow by 1.87 million bpd in 2018.” Leading production increases is the United States, where crude output C-OUT-T-EIA has soared by 27 percent in the last two years, to a record 10.72 million bpd. That puts the United States within reach of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd. As a result of its surging production, U.S. crude is increasingly appearing on global markets as exports. Commodity brokerage Marex Spectron said that the surge in U.S. supplies was a “strongly price-bearish development.” It said the economic outlook was also “firmly bearish” as “short-term credit conditions have worsened which ... hasn’t been priced correctly by the market”. The brokerage also said that U.S. energy intensity “continues to decrease which is never good news for the future consumption of oil”.

2018-05-17,"SIDI IFNI, Morocco, May 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - G rowing up on Mount Boutmezguida in southwest Morocco on the edge of the Sahara desert, Khadija Ghouate never imagined that the fog enveloping the nearby peaks would change her life. For hours every day and often before sunrise, Ghouate and other women from nearby villages would walk 5 km (3 miles) to fetch water from open wells, with girls pulled out of school to help and at risk of violence on the lonely treks. But with groundwater levels dropping due to overuse, drought and climate change, the challenge to get enough water daily was becoming harder, and almost half of people in the local area sold up and quit rural life after generations for the city. As the future of the traditional Berber region by Mount Boutmezguida floundered, a mathematician whose family came from the area had a eureka moment gleaned from living overseas - using fog to make water. Now Ghouate’s village is connected to the world’s largest functioning fog collection project, alleviating the need to collect water that fell mainly on women, and with state-of-the-art equipment setting an example for other projects globally. “You always had to go to the wells, always be there, mornings, evenings,” said Ghouate, a mother-of-three, as she prepared lunch for her family, showing off the tap in her home. “But now water has arrived in our house. I like fog a lot. The project, running since 2015 after nine years of surveys and tests, was founded by the Moroccan non-government organisation Dar Si Hmad, which works to promote and preserve local culture, history, and heritage. It was the brainchild of mathematician and businessman Aissa Derhem whose parents were originally from Mount Boutmezguida where the slopes are covered in mist on average 130 days a year. Derhem first came across fog collection when he learnt of one of the world’s first projects - in Chile’s Atacama Desert - while he living in Canada in the 1980s studying for his PhD. But it was not until visiting his parents’ village years later that he realised the mountainous location, situated at the edge of the Sahara and about 35 km (22 miles) from the Atlantic Ocean, was perfect for fog. Mist accumulates in coastal areas where a cold sea current, an anticyclone and a land obstacle, such as a mountain range, combine. “When the sea water evaporates, the anticyclone ... stops it from becoming rain, and when it hits the mountain, that’s where it can be gathered,” Derhem told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, looking out from the top of Mount Boutmezguida besides a small building used as a fog observatory and tool deposit. “If we look at the planet, we see this happening in all tropical regions ... In Chile and Peru in Latin America. The Kalahari desert in Africa. In Western Australia. Around the Thar desert in India and in California,” he listed as examples. Developed in South America in the 1980s, fog collection projects have since spread globally to countries including Guatemala, Ghana, Eritrea, Nepal and the United States. In Morocco, Dar Si Hmad has built a system of nets stretching about 870 square metres - about 4.5 tennis courts. These nets are hung between two poles and when wind pushes the fog through the mesh, water droplets are trapped, condense and fall into a container at the bottom of the unit with pipes connecting the water to reservoirs. Derhem hopes the success of the Mount Boutmezguida scheme can help other areas in West Africa and in North Africa - where the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says fresh water resources are among the world’s lowest. Studies show climate change impacting water patterns globally and Derhem said in Morocco levels have dropped to about 500 cubic metres a person a year from about 1,500 cubic metres a person in the 1960s on calculations based on government figures. The principles behind fog collection are simple, and throughout nature examples exist of creatures capturing moisture from the air in the most arid conditions, ranging from beetles in the Namib Desert to lizards in the Australian outback. But creating a water collection project on a large scale comes with challenges, as the research and development, as well as the infrastructure and technology involved in expanding and developing fog collection projects, can be costly. The project at Mount Boutmezguida, however, has been a trailblazer for other projects due to its equipment, according to its founders. The original nets used were insufficiently resistant to the high winds and tore but a partnership with the German non-profit WaterFoundation allowed Dar Si Hmad to develop a stronger net. The CloudFisher was described by the WaterFoundation as the first maintance-free fog collector that can withstand wind speeds of up 120 kph with flexible troughs following the movement of the net in the wind. Now collected water is filtered and combined with underground water before being distributed to villages on the grid with homes paying for water through a pre-paid system. The initial pilot project served five villages. At present, the 870 square metres of nets installed reach about 140 families - 14 villages - while a second set of nets is being built. “Fog is like aeroplanes at the start. At the beginning they were only little toys but, with some effort, things have changed ... but it needs investment,” said Derhem. “Along the coast, there is three times as much fog as there is available on Mount Boutmezguida. The government spends millions for water desalination processes. This is something that is worth exploring.” For with dry wells comes anxiety and risk but also the unravelling of traditional livelihoods and communities. Mohamed Zabour, president of the local municipality, said more than 60 percent of the inhabitants of the region live without running water in their homes. Between 2004 and 2014, 2,000 of the 5,000 local residents moved to cities. “Our region is rich but it needs infrastructure. And water is one of the priorities,” said Zabour. “If we don’t find a solution in the next 10 years, it’s going to be a catastrophe ... It’s going to be like a desert. Empty.” For Ghouate, the fog scheme has improved village life. “When we were kids, we didn’t even know what it meant to need water  ... Now there is less rain and if I still had to go to the wells, I wouldn’t find much water now,” she said. ""Everything is about water, everything. I don't have to worry about it anymore.""
