2019-01-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Weak Chinese and European economic data weighed on stocks around the world and boosted safe-haven Treasuries and the Japanese yen on Wednesday, though Wall Street shares edged higher as investors took advantage of cheaper shares to ring in the new year. Chinese factory activity contracted for the first time in more than two years, according to a private survey. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro zone also reached its lowest level since February 2016, and France’s PMI fell in December for the first time in two years. Concerns about the flagging global economy contributed to U.S. stocks posting a loss in 2018 for the first time in a decade. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped as much as 1.6 percent on the data, but later moved higher in choppy trading and ended up 0.13 percent. Bank and energy shares, which have been especially hard-hit in recent sell-offs, were among the biggest gainers. But while cyclical stocks rose, defensive shares fell. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta, said that divergence was likely driven by investors’ seeking to rebalance their portfolios by looking for undervalued stocks “It’s a normal shifting in position, regardless of the data today,” Lerner said. “We’re seeing a ‘January effect’ on areas of the market that have sold hard.” Energy shares also benefited from a jump in oil prices, which climbed as U.S. stocks recovered.

2019-01-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent in choppy trading on Wednesday, supported by a slight recovery on Wall Street, even as concerns remained about weakening global economic growth which could hurt demand for oil.  Brent crude LCOc1 futures gained $1.11, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $54.91 a barrel, after trading between $52.51 and $56.56.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 ended $1.13, or 2.5 percent, higher at $46.54 a barrel, after hitting a session low at $44.35 and high at $47.78. Oil futures were buoyed by U.S. equity markets as major stock indices pared earlier losses. [.N] Crude futures have recently tracked stocks on Wall Street, which in 2018 recorded its worst year in a decade. However, manufacturing data from China earlier added to ongoing concerns about a slowing global economy and increased output out of countries like Russia.  China’s factory activity contracted for the first time in more than two years in December, highlighting the challenges facing Beijing as it seeks to end a bruising trade war with Washington. “We still view some slippage in the Chinese economy as a significant bearish consideration given the fact that they had become the largest crude importer in the world,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note Euro zone manufacturing data also proved disappointing, as activity barely expanded at the end of 2018, according to a survey. Worries about an economic slowdown and excess supply dragged down oil prices from multi-year highs reached in October 2018. Crude futures ended 2018 down for the first year since 2015, with WTI slumping 25 percent and Brent tumbling 21 percent.  Russian production hit a post-Soviet record in 2018, figures showed on Wednesday. Other data showed U.S. output reached a record in October and Iraq boosted oil exports in December. Surging shale output has helped make the United States the world’s biggest oil producer, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Oil production has been at or near record highs in all three countries.   Signs of rising production illustrate the challenge facing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, which are seeking to prop up the market with a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day. However, the energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, an OPEC member, said on Tuesday he remained optimistic about achieving a market balance in the first quarter.

Bank and energy shares, which have been especially hard-hit in recent sell-offs, were among the biggest gainers. Energy shares also benefited from a jump in oil prices, which climbed as U.S. stocks recovered. “We’re at levels that are really, really oversold, and that’s where bounces really come from,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W.

2019-01-02,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Twenty-eight bodies have been recovered from the debris of an apartment block in Russia that partially collapsed in an apparent explosion, while 13 people remained unaccounted for, the regional emergencies ministry said on Wednesday. The blast, initially thought to have been caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk in the early hours on Monday, 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow. A baby boy was found alive on Tuesday after 35 hours spent in freezing cold in the rubble, in what emergency officials described as a miracle. The emergencies ministry said more than 900 people were carrying out the search and rescue operation at the site. It said six people have been rescued. The reason behind the collapse of the apartment block is still being investigated, the Investigative Committee, which probes into major cries, said on its website.  It said no trace of explosives materials had been found so far on the site. The initial reports put a possible gas leak behind the collapse. There have been several similar incidents in the country in recent years due to ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations about gas usage. In a separate incident in the same street late on Tuesday, three people died when a minibus became engulfed in flames, TASS news agency reported citing the local government office.  Video footage purporting to show the incident, posted on social media sites, shows a burning vehicle and some bangs are heard. A police spokesman declined to comment when contacted by phone.

2019-01-02,"* China factory activity contracts, stoking economic fears * U.S. shares open lower, European stocks fall * German and U.S. bonds rally; safe-haven yen, gold rise (Updates to U.S. markets open, changes byline, dateline, previous LONDON) By April Joyner NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Stocks around the world treaded water to ring in the new year while safe-haven assets including bonds, gold and the Japanese yen rallied on Wednesday as Chinese and European economic data bolstered concerns of a slowdown in global growth. In the United States, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped as much as 1 percent after data showed Chinese factory activity contracting for the first time in more than two years, though the index pared losses later in the session. The data intensified fears that the global economy may be flagging, which contributed to U.S. stocks posting a loss in 2018 for the first time in a decade. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro zone also reached its lowest level since February 2016, and France’s PMI fell in December for the first time in two years. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell as much as 1.7 percent but recovered most of its losses and ended down 0.13 percent. Though U.S. economic data has been relatively strong compared to data from China and Europe, several economic indicators have not been released recently because of the partial U.S. government shutdown. That has left a void of positive data, said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. Investors moved into bonds as a result. Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes hit an 11-month low. Earlier, 10-year German Bund yields slumped to 20-month lows in their biggest one-day fall in two years. Other safe-haven assets benefited as well, with gold reaching six-month highs and the Japanese yen hitting a seven-month high against the dollar. “It’s a global flight to safety,” Pursche said. “Given the global macro insecurity out there, people are in risk-off mode.” Yet there was an encouraging sign for investors as U.S. and European stocks bounced off the day’s lows, he added. “I wouldn’t be entirely surprised if we ended up flat or even up at the end of market,” Pursche said, referring to the S&P 500. “Sentiment is driving the market, and sentiment can change quickly.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 23,304.67, the S&P 500 lost 1.41 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,505.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.97 points, or 0.15 percent, to 6,645.25. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.38 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.6717 percent, from 2.691 percent late on Monday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.7 percent as the euro and sterling fell. Bucking the risk-off trend, oil prices rose as U.S. stocks pared losses. Brent crude futures rose $2.38 to $56.18 a barrel, a 4.4 percent gain.

2019-01-02,"BRASILIA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Brazil’s new President Jair Bolsonaro set to work quickly on Wednesday, with his administration issuing decrees affecting the economy, agriculture and society, while forging closer political ties with the United States. Bolsonaro, a former army captain and seven-term congressman, won elections in October and was sworn in on Tuesday as Brazil’s first far-right president since a military dictatorship gave way to civilian rule in 1985. Fulfilling a campaign promise to his staunch supporters in the farm sector, Bolsonaro decreed that indigenous land claims, a source of bloody clashes on Brazil’s agricultural frontier, would be decided by the Agriculture Ministry. The gift to the powerful agribusiness sector enraged environmentalists already worried by Bolsonaro’s plans to loosen protections of the Amazon rainforest and remove Brazil’s support for the Paris Agreement on climate change. The new president was elected on a platform to clean up Brazilian politics, and he put the country’s top anti-corruption figure, Sergio Moro, in charge of a Justice Ministry beefed up to fight graft and battle organized crime. Moro, a former federal judge who spearheaded the “Car Wash” corruption trials that put former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and other high-profile politicians in jail, said on Wednesday he would help usher in a new era of law-and-order. “The top mission given to me by the president was clear: end impunity for corruption cases and combat organized crime to reduce violent crimes,” Moro said after being sworn in. The administration would propose an ambitious anti-crime bill to Congress next month that would stiffen prison sentences, Moro said. Bolsonaro met this week with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, President Donald Trump’s envoy to Tuesday’s presidential inauguration, who said the United States and Brazil will jointly defend democratic values in the region. “We have an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes,” Pompeo said on Wednesday after discussing Venezuela with Brazil’s new Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, who was picked by Bolsonaro for his admiration of Trump’s conservative nationalism. Bolsonaro’s rise to power culminates a swing to conservative rule in Latin America that has isolated leftist-ruled countries such as Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. While Bolsonaro surprised Brazil’s political establishment by surging to victory over a leftist coalition led by Lula’s Workers Party, he takes office with the lowest approval rating of any new Brazilian president, according to a Datafolha poll Tuesday. That suggests he will have an uphill battle to enact his agenda of austerity measures to bring down an unsustainable budget deficit of about 180 billion reais ($47.31 billion) that has investors worried. Markets, however, are optimistic that Bolsonaro’s economic team, led by former investment banker Paulo Guedes, will succeed in passing reforms needed to reduce the deficit and restore confidence and growth to a slow-moving economy. One of Bolsonaro’s first steps was to decree a less-than-expected increase to the minimum wage for this year, to 998 reais ($260) a month from 954 reais. The real currency strengthened 1 percent by midday Wednesday and the Sao Paulo Bovespa stock index rose 2 percent. Preferred shares in the country’s largest utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA jumped over 10 pct after new Energy & Mines Minister Bento Albuquerque said the company would be partially privatized. Doing even better was gun manufacturer Forjas Taurus SA whose shares rose 27 percent to 5.1 reais on Bolsonaro’s plan to ease gun controls, to help Brazilians arm themselves in self defense against crime. In his inauguration address on Tuesday, Bolsonaro said his election had freed Latin America’s largest nation from “socialism and political correctness.” ($1 = 3.8048 reais) Reporting by Ricardo Brito, Lisandra Paraguassú, Mary

2019-01-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - Fear became the dominant sentiment in 2018, especially in the second half of the year, as growing pessimism about the future gripped policymakers, business leaders, investors and journalists. Those best able to articulate, amplify and exploit concerns about the economy, migration, security and the impact of technology proved the most influential. Fear can be a powerful motivating force but it is not a particularly creative one. “Fear is the mind-killer, fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration,” Frank Herbert wrote in his 1965 novel “Dune”. Risk-taking and willingness to invest under conditions of uncertainty are critical to sustaining output, growing the economy and raising real incomes. “If human nature felt no temptation to take a chance, no satisfaction (profit apart) in constructing a factory, a railway, a mine or a farm, there might not be much investment merely as a result of cold calculation,” John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1936’s “General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money”. As fear drives the global economy towards a slowdown or outright recession, politicians, business leaders, investors, journalists and voters will have to find reasons to become more optimistic if the threatened slump is to be averted, or at least not prolonged. The rising influence of China and its shifting balance of power with the United States was one particular area of concern in 2018. By the end of the year, the two countries were embroiled in a wide-ranging conflict covering trade, intellectual property, foreign investment, technology transfer and espionage, as well as an accelerating arms race. Strategic competition intensified globally, from the Pacific and Indian Oceans to Africa, Latin America, Central Asia and Europe, as well as in multilateral institutions including the IMF, World Bank, APEC and WTO. The two superpowers appeared to be heading towards a new cold war in which the globalised economy of the 1990s and 2000s would be sundered into separate and competing economic, diplomatic and military blocs. A proliferation of tariffs and non-tariff barriers intended to protect national and economic security was born from worries about the impact of international trade on domestic manufacturing industries and employment. Policymakers as well as academics stipulated that trade should be fair as well as free, with optimism about the benefits of globalisation countered by renewed calls to strengthen the nation-state. Concerns grew about income inequality, poor productivity and rural areas of advanced economies left-behind by economic and social changes. By the end of the year, commentators as well as politicians were invoking nationalism, patriotism and a bigger role for democratic governments as part of a broad backlash against unaccountable multilateralism. Technology became something to be feared for its negative impact on existing industries rather than a positive force for productivity and social and economic change. Journalists and politicians focused on the disruptive effect of internet platforms, social media, data collection and artificial intelligence on incumbent businesses and workers, now also including white-collar professionals. Social media was blamed for intensifying political polarisation and spreading propaganda rather than hailed as an agent for reform and democratisation, with growing calls for government regulation of various platforms. China’s leading technology exporters ZTE and Huawei bore the brunt of a backlash as the worries about technology intersected concerns about the security of global supply chains. Cyber-espionage, surveillance and hacking by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States among others, along with private security companies and criminal organisations, added to the jittery mood. The Middle East became less rather than more stable in 2018, with an intensifying dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, tensions between Qatar and its neighbours, and the ongoing war in Yemen. The U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed sweeping sanctions on the country, ratcheting up tensions and leaving the future of the accord unclear. Previous optimism about Saudi Arabia’s modernisation programme was quashed by concerns about the country’s leadership following the detention of domestic critics and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In Europe, inconclusive Brexit negotiations dominated the political outlook, along with violent protests in France and the ebbing political authority of Germany’s long-time leader Angela Merkel. Italy elected an avowedly populist government determined to confront the EU while there were concerns about judicial independence, press freedom and authoritarianism in parts of eastern Europe. Voters continued to desert moderate centre-right and centre-left politicians to back parties and movements with more radical agendas, leading to fears about the EU’s future direction, stability and cohesion. Meanwhile, the United States and its European allies continued to complain about Russia’s military intervention in Syria and Ukraine, along with its missile programmes and cyber activities. Given the unpredictable environment, and the prospect of rising interest rates, it should come as no surprise that major equity markets and commodity prices fell sharply towards the end of the year. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2AtMMVh) The U.S. S&P 500 equity index posted its worst 12-month performance since February 2016, and before that Sept 2009, ending last year 6 percent lower. South Korea’s KOSPI-100 index, which is heavily exposed to world trade, ended down 20 percent in its worst 12-month performance since May 2009. Despite the worries, world trade has held up reasonably well so far, with volumes up 3.7 percent in the three months from August to October compared with the same period a year earlier. Growth has moderated but is not yet showing the sharp slowdown anticipated by global equity markets. However, some forward-looking indicators paint a gloomier picture. In Hong Kong, the world’s busiest air freight hub seen as a leading indicator for world trade, air freight volumes fell 0.2 percent in the September-November period compared with a year earlier, the worst 12-month performance since April 2016. China’s economy also appears to have been slowing since the middle of 2018, squeezed by tighter credit, the tariffs imposed by the United States and an increasingly uncertain outlook for exporters. The country’s manufacturers reported a significant decline in business activity in December, with the composite purchasing managers’ index falling to just 49.4, its lowest level since February 2016 and below the 50.0 threshold dividing economic expansion from contraction. Mirroring the slide in global equity markets, Brent crude futures ended the year almost 20 percent lower, the worst 12-month performance since June 2016, and the calendar spread remains in a small but significant contango. Most traders expect the oil market to remain modestly oversupplied in 2019, as worries about the impact of a slowing economy on consumption outweigh the impact of production cuts by OPEC and its allies.

2019-01-02,"OSLO (Reuters) - Almost a third of new cars sold in Norway last year were pure electric, a new world record as the country strives to end sales of fossil-fueled vehicles by 2025. In a bid to cut carbon emissions and air pollution, Norway exempts battery-driven cars from most taxes and offers benefits such as free parking and charging points to hasten a shift from diesel and petrol engines. The independent Norwegian Road Federation (NRF) said on Wednesday that electric cars rose to 31.2 percent of all sales last year, from 20.8 percent in 2017 and just 5.5 percent in 2013, while sales of petrol and diesel cars plunged. “It was a small step closer to the 2025 goal,” by which time Norway’s parliament wants all new cars to be emissions-free, Oeyvind Solberg Thorsen, head of the NRF, told a conference. Still, he cautioned that there was a long way to go since two-thirds of almost 148,000 cars sold in 2018 in Norway were powered by fossil fuel or were hybrids, which have both battery power and an internal combustion engine.  Graphic on electric car sales: tmsnrt.rs/2GR4Qyo The sales figures consolidate Norway’s global lead in electric car sales per capita, part of an attempt by Western Europe’s biggest producer of oil and gas to transform to a greener economy. The International Energy Agency (IEA), using a slightly different yardstick for electric vehicles that includes hybrids that can be plugged in, showed Norway’s share of such cars at 39 percent in 2017, far ahead of second-placed Iceland on 12 percent and Sweden on six percent. By contrast, such electric cars had a 2.2 percent share in China in 2017 and 1.2 percent in the United States, IEA data show.  Erik Andresen, head of Norway’s car importers’ federation, said the boom for electric cars was denting Norway’s tax revenues, raising questions about future reforms to raise cash from the 5.3 million population. Overall, new car sales in Norway fell 6.8 percent in 2018 to 147,929 vehicles, breaking a rising trend in recent years, NRF data showed. Nissan’s (7201.T) upgraded Leaf electric car was the top-selling car in Norway last year, while other top-selling cars overall ranged from small BMWs (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagens (VOWG_p.DE) to full-size sedans and electric sport utility vehicles by Tesla (TSLA.O). Sales of pure electric cars surged 40 percent to 46,092 in 2018 while sales of diesel models fell 28 percent, petrol cars were down 17 percent and hybrids that cannot be plugged in fell 20 percent. The Institute of Transport Economics (ITE), a consultancy, doubted that the 2025 goal for emissions-free new cars could be reached. “Strictly speaking I don’t think it’s possible, primarily because too many people don’t have a private parking space and won’t want to buy a plug-in car if they can’t establish a charging point at home,” ITE economist Lasse Fridstroem said. “We may be able to get to a 75 percent (market share), provided that the tax breaks are maintained,” he added. The Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association (NEVA), a lobby group, predicted a 100 percent market share was feasible. “We know that charging access is a real barrier ... and there’s also a risk that not enough cars become available,” NEVA head Christina Bu said, adding that some customers must wait for a year or more before their electric vehicle is delivered. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Group predicted on Wednesday another year of tepid car sales growth in 2019 on the back of a slow 2018, saying trade protectionism adds uncertainty and major markets such as the United States and China remained sluggish.

2019-01-02,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - New Brazilian Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias sought on Wednesday to defend the farm sector from accusations it has grown at the expense of the environment, saying the country has some of the world’s toughest environmental laws. Sworn in as part of new President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration, Dias used her inauguration speech to promise a streamlining of bureaucracy and increased rule of law in the agricultural sector. In comments to reporters after her speech, she said that a transfer of power over indigenous land right claims to the Agriculture Ministry, outlined in an executive order from Bolsonaro, was a new responsibility for the ministry. However, she indicated that in practice the demarcation of land limits would fall to a council of ministries. The temporary decree, which will expire unless it is ratified within 120 days by Congress, strips power over land claim decisions from indigenous affairs agency FUNAI. “Brazil is a country with extremely advanced environmental legislation and is more than able to preserve its native forests,” Dias said in her speech. “Our country is a model to be followed, never a transgressor to be punished.” She also heaped praise on Brazilian farmers and the technological innovation they have used to boost yields, saying they “instill fear” in competitors. She added that Brazil’s naturally favorable soil and weather conditions are a boon to farmers. “Brazil has grown its production through efficiency gains and practically without increasing [planted] area,” she said.  Dias added that the strength of Brazil’s powerful agricultural sector had generated “unfounded accusations” from international groups, which she did not name.

The U.S. S&P500 and Dow Jones index futures slipped around one percent and Nasdaq futures fell 2 percent, signalling Wall Street would open in the red on the first trading day of the New Year after closing 2018 with the worst annual loss since 2008. Weak manufacturing-activity surveys across Asia were followed by disappointing numbers in the euro zone, sending MSCI’s index of world shares 0.4 percent lower. China in particular was in focus, after factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years. The gloom continued in Europe, where the Purchasing Managers’ Index for the euro zone reached its lowest since February 2016. Future output PMIs were at a six-year low . The data suggests there will be no respite for equities or commodities after the 2018 losses. A pan-European share index recovered some losses to stand 0.6 percent lower. The Paris bourse led losses with a 1.4 percent fall, as France’s PMI fell in December for the first time in two years. “It’s a continuation of the worries over growth. You can see them in the Asian numbers, which all confirm that we have passed peak growth levels,” said Tim Graf, chief macro strategist at State Street Global Advisors. The knock-on effects from China’s slowdown and global trade tensions were rippling across Asia and Europe, he said. “I don’t think the trade story goes away, and Europe, being an open economy, is still vulnerable,” Graf added. Copper, a key gauge of world growth sentiment, fell to 3 1/2-month lows , while Brent crude futures lost almost 1 percent after shedding 19.5 percent last year . Commodity currencies’ losses were led by the Australian dollar. Often used as a proxy for China sentiment, the Aussie fell as much as 0.7 percent to its lowest since February 2016 . There were also renewed fears in Europe over the clean-up of Italy’s banks, with trading in shares of Banca Carige suspended. Carige failed last month to win shareholder backing for a share issue that was part of a rescue plan. An index of Italian bank shares fell 2.5 percent. The stock market rout drove investors into the safety of bonds. Ten-year German Bund yields slumped to 20-month lows of 0.16 percent, their biggest one-day fall in two years. Gold and the yen benefited too. While gold topped six-month highs, the yen extended its rally against the dollar to seven-month highs around 108.9 . It strengthened to 19-month peaks against the euro . “Traditional safe-haven type flows are going into the yen. As we see increased volatility (on world markets), Japanese (investors) are probably repatriating foreign assets,” said Charles St Arnaud, senior investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. However, the dollar edged up 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies, rising half a percent to the euro and 0.8 percent versus sterling. The greenback is under pressure from a fall in U.S. Treasury yields as investors wager the Federal Reserve will not raise rates again. While the Fed itself still projects at least two more hikes, money markets imply a quarter-point cut by mid-2020. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may comment on the outlook when he participates in a discussion on Friday, while manufacturing and jobs data due Thursday and Friday should also shed light. Yields on two-year debt have tumbled to 2.49 percent from 2.977 percent peak in November. Ten-year yields dived to their lowest since last January at 2.647 percent. The spread between two- and 10-year yields has in turn shrunk, narrowing last month to the smallest since 2007 and heading towards an inversion which has portended recessions in the past.

Output from Egina, which is located in waters about 1,600 metres (5,250 ft) deep, is expected to plateau at 200,000 barrels per day of oil, Total said. That rate is equivalent to about 10 percent of Nigeria’s current production. “Egina will significantly boost the group’s production and cashflow from 2019 onwards, and benefit from our strong cost reduction efforts in Nigeria where we have reduced our operating costs by 40 percent over the last four years,” Total’s head of exploration and production, Arnaud Breuillac, said. Total is betting on profitable deepwater oil and gas fields in Sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil and the U.S. Gulf area. In Africa, the company is ramping up deepwater projects in the Republic of Congo and Angola. Total forecasts output from deepwater projects will reach 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020 and account for more than 35 percent of cashflow in coming years, compared with about 15 percent now. Total also said it would take a decision this year on whether to invest in developing the Preowei field, located in the same block as the Egina field. Total has for almost a decade been extracting oil from a third field in the block, Akpo. It holds a 24 percent stake in the block’s lease and is the operator. Its partners are state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp, China’s CNOOC , Brazil’s Petrobras and private Nigerian firm Sapetro. The French company is one of the strongest players in African oil, holding the largest proven reserves on the continent among the world’s top oil companies.

2019-01-02,"MOSCOW, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Eighteen dead bodies have been recovered from the debris of an apartment block in Russia that partially collapsed in an apparent explosion, while 23 people remained unaccounted for, the regional emergencies ministry told Reuters on Wednesday. The blast, initially thought to have been caused by a gas leak, damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk in the early hours on Monday, 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow. A baby boy was found alive on Tuesday after 35 hours spent in freezing cold in the rubble, in what emergency officials described as a miracle. In a separate incident late on Tuesday, three people died on the same street where the building collapsed, when a minibus became engulfed in flames, TASS news agency reported citing the local government office. Video footage purporting to show the incident, posted on social media sites, shows a burning vehicle and some bangs are heard. A police spokesman declined to comment when contacted by phone. The reason behind the collapse of the apartment block is still being investigated, the Investigative Committee, which probes into major cries, said on its website. It said no trace of explosives materials had been found so far on the site. The initial reports put a possible gas leak behind the collapse. There have been several similar incidents in the country in recent years due to ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations about gas usage.

The Ministry of Commerce granted quotas totalling 89.84 million tonnes to 58 companies in its first allowances for 2019, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday. This is down from the 121.32 million tonnes issued in the first batch of allowances for 2018, although the sources said Beijing may increase the overall volume for 2019 in a second batch of quotas later this year. Lower import quotas may signal slowing crude demand growth for the first half of 2019 in China, the world’s largest oil importer and second-largest oil consumer. “The market, in general, does not have a upbeat outlook for imports. I think the drop in quota could likely mean easing growth in China’s crude imports in the first half,” said Zhou Guoxia, a crude oil analyst with consultancy JLC. Private refiners, also known as teapots, received quotas for 70.65 million tonnes of imports, more than 20 percent lower than the first batch of quotas issued last year, according to the documents and Reuters data. This followed lower consumption of the 2018 quotas, said Seng Yick Tee, analyst at Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy. Refiners only used 71 percent of the quotas allocated between January and October 2018, the period that the government used to determine quotas for the first batch of 2019, said Tee. One of the four sources with knowledge of the quotas, who works for a private Chinese refiner, said they received about a third of its annual quota in the first batch and expects to get the remainder in a second batch, which Beijing usually issues around September. Overall though, the start up of new refineries in China in 2019 is expected to raise crude imports to a record, adding 630,000 barrels per day of new demand, 7 percent higher than last year, according to SIA Energy. “We don’t see any major impact on China’s overall crude imports in 2019 as the import growth is mostly contributed by mega petrochemical refiners and national oil companies’ refineries,” SIA Energy’s Tee said. Dalian Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Petrochemical, which are starting up new refineries in 2019, have each received quotas of 4 million tonnes, according to the documents reviewed by Reuters. Dragon Aromatics, a petrochemical producer based in Fujian province, has also received import quota of 600,000 tonnes as it resumes operations at its condensate splitter, the sources said.

A survey of 32 economists and analysts forecasts the North Sea Brent crude oil benchmark will average $69.13 per barrel in 2019, more than $5 lower than last month’s projection. Brent has averaged $71.76 in 2018. “The first half of 2019 will be dominated by concerns about oversupply,” said Ashley Petersen of Stratas Advisors. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia, known collectively as OPEC+, agreed earlier this month to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to try to drain global crude inventories and support prices. But the cuts are not due to take place until January and prices have fallen more than 15 percent since the announcement. “The market had largely priced in renewed production cuts from OPEC. As a result, we expect prices to sink if OPEC or Russia diverge from their production quotas notably,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “We expect the cuts to be renewed in April, when the deal comes up for review, as higher output from the U.S. and weakening global demand require continued restraint.” Oil prices have fallen more than 40 percent from multi-year highs reached in early October on concerns about the impact of a trade dispute between the United States and China on global economic growth and demand for oil. Another potential headwind next year is slowing consumption. Many analysts project demand growth of a little over 1 million bpd in 2019, compared with an increase of 1.54 million bpd in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, U.S. shale oil output growth is expected to remain robust, adding to supply. The United States this year surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s biggest oil producer, with overall U.S. crude production climbing to a record 11.7 million bpd. “We expect U.S. (companies) will increase shale oil production continuously over the next year,” said Adrià Morron Salmeron, economist at CaixaBank Research. The Reuters poll forecast U.S. light crude would average $61.05 per barrel in 2019, versus $67.45 projected in the previous poll. It has averaged $64.98 in 2018. Analysts believe the end of U.S. sanctions waivers on Iran’s oil exports will put extra pressure on oil prices.

European shares were knocked lower and Wall Street equity futures fell two percent, after U.S. equities closed 2018 with the worst losses since the 2008 global crisis. MSCI’s index of world shares dropped 0.4 percent as weak manufacturing-activity surveys across Asia were followed by disappointing numbers in the euro zone. China in particular saw factory activity contracting for the first time in over two years. Mainland Chinese shares fell 1.2 percent and S&P 500 futures gave up early gains. The gloom continued in Europe, where the Purchasing Managers’ Index for the euro zone reached its lowest since February 2016. Future output PMIs were at a six-year low . A pan-European share index tumbled 1.3 percent, led by 2 percent-plus losses in Paris, as France’s PMI fell in December for the first time in two years. “It’s a continuation of the worries over growth.

Commodity-driven currencies lost ground in turn, led by the Australian dollar.

While gold topped six-month highs, the yen extended its rally against the dollar to seven-month highs around 108.9 . It strengthened to a 19-month peak against the euro . The dollar edged up on the euro and sterling but was steady versus a basket of currencies at 96.181. The greenback has been dragged down by a steep fall in Treasury yields in recent weeks — investors wager the U.S. Federal Reserve will not raise rates again, even though the Fed itself is still projecting at least two more hikes. Fed fund futures now imply a quarter-point cut by mid-2020 instead. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will have the chance to comment on the economic outlook when he takes part in a discussion with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke on Friday.

The total surpassed the previous annual record average of 10.98 million bpd set in 2017. Russian oil output reached 555.838 million tonnes last year, against 547 million tonnes in 2017. Reuters uses a barrels-to-tonnes ratio of 7.33 to 1. All the Russian majors increased their oil production last month in yearly terms. Rosneft, the world’s largest listed oil producer by output, raised its oil production by 4.6 percent year-on-year in December, while Lukoil and Surgutneftegaz both increased their output by 2.5 percent. Tatneft’s oil production surged by 9.3 percent last month from a year earlier. Russian oil pipeline exports in December rose to 4.496 million bpd from 4.297 million bpd in November. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last month that the country’s oil production in 2019 may decline to 552 million tonnes after the country signed a global deal to cut output. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other large oil producers including Russia agreed in December to cut their combined crude production by 1.2 million bpd from January to halt a decline in oil prices. Russia agreed as part of the deal to cut its production by 230,000 bpd from 11.41 million bpd touched in October. Oil prices reached their lowest in 1-1/2 years last week and fell more than 20 percent in 2018, depressed in part by rising supplies, mainly from the United States. Novak said last month that oil prices would become more stable in the first half of 2019. The United States became the world’s biggest crude producer in 2018, pumping 11.6 million bpd, more than Saudi Arabia or Russia. Oil production has been at or near record highs in all three countries.

2019-01-02,"ISLAMABAD, Jan 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In a bid to freshen its air and cut planet-warming emissions, the Pakistani port city of Karachi will introduce cleaner-running buses powered by a decidedly “unclean” fuel: cow poo. With funding from the international Green Climate Fund, Karachi will launch a zero-emission Green Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network, with 200 buses fuelled by bio-methane. Locals said the new bus system - due to start operating in 2020 - would help reduce air pollution and street noise, but doubted whether it would have enough buses to resurrect the city’s ailing transport system. “(Karachi’s) public transport system has totally collapsed and most people have to use online taxi-hailing services (and) auto rickshaws,” said commuter Afzal Ahmed, 45, who works as a medical sales representative. After management problems forced the Karachi Transport Corporation to fold some two decades ago, Chinese-imported buses running on compressed natural gas fell into disrepair and were taken off the road, worsening public transport woes, he noted. Malik Amin Aslam, advisor on climate change to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, said the BRT system was the first transport project the Green Climate Fund had approved, and would bring “multiple environmental and economic benefits”. It would not require operating subsidies, he added. The cheap, clean bus network will cater for 320,000 passengers daily, and will reduce planet-warming emissions by 2.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over 30 years, according to project documents. The BRT will consist of a 30-km (18.6-mile) corridor that will benefit 1.5 million residents, adding 25 new bus stations, secure pedestrian crossings, improved sidewalks, cycle lanes and bike-sharing facilities. The Green Climate Fund, set up under U.N. climate talks to provide finance to developing countries to help them grow cleanly and adapt to a warming climate, will provide $49 million for the Karachi project out of a total cost of $583.5 million. The other major funders are the Asian Development Bank and the provincial government of Sindh, where Karachi is located. The BRT system, to be rolled out over four years, will have a fleet of 200 hybrid buses that will run on bio-methane produced from manure excreted by Karachi’s 400,000 milk-producing water buffaloes, and collected by the authorities. The project will prevent about 3,200 tonnes of cow manure entering the ocean daily by converting it into energy and fertiliser at a biogas plant, and will save more than 50,000 gallons of fresh water now used to wash that waste into the bay, Aslam said. Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, CEO of Leadership for Environment and Development (LEAD) Pakistan, a policy think-tank, said calculating the overall impact on the environment was complex, as the buses would be introduced in stages. Pakistan’s authorities often lack maintenance budgets, he noted, highlighting the risk the buses could break down and not be repaired. “Pakistan has a history that it does not utilise donors’ project funding at an optimum level,” he said. But if all goes well, Sheikh said the project, as the country’s first green BRT system, would lay the foundation for “climate-smart urban transportation systems” in other places. It could shake up approaches to public transport among policy makers and planners, serving as a model for other cities, including Lahore, Multan, Peshawar and Faisalabad, he said. Pakistan needs to launch such projects in big cities to discourage personal vehicle use, thereby easing traffic emissions and smog, and improving air quality and public health, Sheikh added. He recommended setting a target for 70 percent of the urban population to use public transport. Another way to ease air pollution would be to import better-quality petroleum fuels for vehicles, he added. “We are importing low-grade fuel, and our refineries have capacity to refine only third-grade fuel,” he said. Ahmad Rafay Alam, an environmental lawyer, said previous BRT projects in Pakistan’s large cities had not focused on environmental sustainability. Planners should start connecting transport systems with wider urban development, Alam said. “We need to introduce transport-oriented urban design by encouraging the use of public transport and discouraging the use of private vehicles to reduce emissions,” he said. Zia Ur Rehman, a Karachi-based journalist covering civic issues, noted that the Sindh provincial government had run less than 50 buses in the city in the last 10 years, while private buses and mini-buses had dwindled from 25,000 to 8,000. One reason is that buses were torched during strikes and at times of political upheaval, he said. The new bus system alone was unlikely to resolve the city's transport problems, but would be “a short-term relief for commuters and also help in reducing... air pollution"", he added.

2019-01-02,"SINGAPORE, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Medco Energi Internasional Tbk PT would boost its valuations and gain access to international assets if its potential takeover of London-listed Ophir Energy occurs, analysts said on Wednesday. Medco confirmed this week that it was in talks with Ophir about a possible cash offer for the oil and gas exploration and production company currently based in Britain. Medco, headquartered in Jakarta, earns the bulk of its revenue from oil and gas operations, mainly in Indonesia. “This will help Medco shape up as an international player. It seems to be pursuing a transaction at the bottom cycle of the oil price to try and offer scope to re-rate its stock,” said William Simadiputra, analyst at DBS Vickers Securities in Jakarta. Founded by oil and gas tycoon Arifin Panigoro, Medco has made sizeable acquisitions in recent years, including leading a $2.6 billion acquisition of the Indonesian unit of Newmont Mining Corp in November 2016. It also operates power plants in Indonesia. DBS Vickers’ Simadiputra said Medco had a strong balance sheet and was capable of funding the potential acquisition, depending on how the deal was structured. Ophir, whose shares fell 48 percent last year, announced in September a $310 million charge on a liquefied natural gas project in Africa and said it would shift its headquarters from London to Asia where it bought assets in 2018. Both Medco and Ophir did not disclose financial details of the potential transaction. Ophir’s shares rose 7.5 percent on Monday to value the company at 251.4 million pounds ($320 million), while Medco is currently valued at 12.2 trillion rupiah ($844 million), according to data from Refinitiv. “This is a bold move by Medco, and if successful would create a Southeast Asian upstream powerhouse,” said Angus Rodger, a research director at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, in a note on Wednesday. He said Ophir’s current output of 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil equivalent combined with Medco’s stated 2018 target of 85,000 bpd of oil equivalent would catapult the firm to seventh largest non-national oil company upstream producer in Southeast Asia. “For Medco a successful acquisition would substantially increase its regional footprint and diversify its mature, Indonesia-heavy portfolio,” said Rodger, adding that Medco would also bulk up its non-Asian exposure by adding growth options in Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea. Under UK takeover rules, PT Medco Energi Global, a fully-owned subsidiary of Medco, has until Jan. 28 to make a firm offer or walk away, Ophir said. $1 = 0.7852 pounds

2019-01-02,"LONDON/ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Rio Tinto (RIO.L) (RIO.AX) and Mongolia have signed a deal for the supply of power to the miner’s giant copper mine extension at Oyu Tolgoi by mid-2023, with both sides saying the framework agreement marked a step forward after a protracted dispute. The Oyu Tolgoi project is central to Rio Tinto’s push to diversify its portfolio away from iron ore, but it has faced a series of challenges as Mongolia’s fragile government wrangles over how to maximise benefits for the country. First production at the $5.3 billion underground expansion located near the southern border with China is scheduled for early next decade, creating one of the world’s biggest copper suppliers.  The construction of a 300 megawatt plant, close to the Tavan Tolgoi coalfields, to supply electricity to the mine will start in 2020 under the new agreement.  The plant is expected to be operational by mid-2023, slightly later than the 2022 date mooted after the government cancelled an earlier power agreement in February. The government of Mongolia owns 34 percent of Oyu Tolgoi with the remainder held by Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ.TO), which in turn is 51 percent owned by Rio Tinto.     In a joint statement with Oyu Tolgoi, the Mongolian government said the agreement was “a significant step towards enhancing the efficiency of the Tavan Tolgoi coal mines,” and to supplying the wider region with domestic power. The statement said the partners would also consider how to incorporate the use of renewable power. Oyu Tolgoi would be the majority owner of the power plant, with funding possibly including third party debt, the statement said, without giving further details.  Analysts welcomed the deal but said the 2023 deadline looked optimistic. “This was the last major hurdle for the underground production,” Badral Bontoi, chief executive of Mongolia-based market intelligence group Cover Mongolia, said.     A Mongolian government spokesman said the agreement was the first step to retain in the country the estimated $150 million Oyu Tolgoi currently pays China for electricity each year, with the figure set to rise when the underground extension comes online. Rio Tinto in July entered agreements with three Chinese contractors on designing a power station to supply Oyu Tolgoi. On Monday, a spokesman declined to comment on the status of those tenders.  Rio Tinto’s shares have fallen by around 5 percent this year and were down 0.9 percent on Monday.

2019-01-02,"(Recasts, adds quotes and background) NEW DELHI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - India’s biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp Ltd said on Wednesday that Iran may still invest in a refinery expansion project at one of its subsidiaries. Indian Oil’s chairman Sanjiv Singh said that Iran has not ruled out participating in the expansion at Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd, a south India-based 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery. Iran’s participation has been questioned after India cut back its Iranian crude oil imports following U.S. sanctions. However, Singh’s comments come a few days after India exempted rupee payments to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for crude oil imports from a withholding tax. The exemption will allow Indian refiners to settle about $1.5 billion of outstanding payments to NIOC through direct rupee payments. It has been expected that these payments could help Iran invest in Indian projects, particularly the Chennai Petroleum Corp expansion. “Iran has always been positive with this (the new rules). I think they should be able to invest,” Singh told Reuters, following a media conference on Wednesday. Chennai Petroleum plans to invest up to 356.98 billion rupees ($5.1 billion) to replace the 20,000 bpd Nagapattinam refinery in Southern Tamil Nadu state with a 180,000 bpd plant. Naftiran Intertrade, the Swiss subsidiary of National Iranian Oil Company, holds a 15.4 per cent stake in Chennai Petroleum, while Indian Oil has about a 52 percent share. Singh said a detailed feasibility report for the expansion has yet to be prepared.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 1.6 percent as a private sector survey showed China manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in 19 months. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for December fell to 49.7, from 50.2 in November, and followed a poor official survey on factory output. “Even more eye-catching was that ‘new orders’ in both PMIs fell from expansion in November to contraction in December,” said analysts at ING. “This confirms our view that the economy is weak and that stimulus needs to arrive quickly.” The Shanghai blue chip index quickly shed 1.2 percent and South Korea fell 1.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was closed for a holiday. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were stripped of early gains to be down 0.8 percent, while FTSE futures dropped 0.6 percent.

2019-01-02,"TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - U.S. border agents launched tear gas into Mexico early on Tuesday to deter a group of migrants that one official called “a violent mob” from crossing over from Tijuana, according to a Reuters witness and the U.S. government.  Clouds of the noxious gas could be seen wafting up from around the fence at the border. One migrant picked up a canister and threw it back into U.S. territory. U.S. officials said the group had attacked agents with projectiles but a Reuters witness did not see any migrants throwing rocks at U.S. agents.   Tijuana has become a flashpoint in the debate over U.S. immigration policy, which has been intensified by the recent deaths of two migrant children in American custody and a partial U.S. government shutdown over U.S. President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion (3.9 billion pounds) in funding for a wall along the border with Mexico. A previous incident in November when U.S. agents fired gas into Mexico to disperse migrants triggered a call from Mexico’s government for an investigation, as well as international condemnation. Mexico Foreign Ministry spokesman Roberto Velasco said the government “regrets the events” at the border. He said Mexico “advocates respect for migrants’ human rights, security and integrity, while calling for respect for laws on both sides of the border.” More than 150 Central American migrants approached an area of the border in Tijuana in the Playas neighbourhood near the beach late on Monday. Migrants said they thought security measures might be relaxed due to the New Year’s holiday.  U.S. security personnel fired tear gas into Mexico after midnight as some migrants prepared to climb a border fence, according to the Reuters witness. During a second attempt, migrants began to pass youths and children over the razor wire along the fencing to the U.S. side. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman called the group “a violent mob” and said they had thrown projectiles at agents who responded with “the minimum force necessary to defend themselves.” “Congress needs to fully fund the border wall,” Waldman said in a statement. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement the gas was aimed upwind of people throwing rocks on the Mexican side who obstructed agents from helping the children being passed over razor wire. The CBP statement said agents had not directly targeted the migrants attempting to cross the fence with tear gas and pepper spray. A Reuters witness documented in one photo where a migrant had been hit by what appeared to be a gas canister. Human rights group Amnesty International’s deputy director of research Justin Mazzola described the use of tear gas against migrants “cruel and inhumane” and called for an independent investigation. “The Trump administration is defying international law and orchestrating a crisis by deliberately turning asylum-seekers away from ports of entry, endangering families who see no choice but to take desperate measures in their search for protection,” he said in a statement. CBP said most of the migrants attempting to cross returned to Mexico while 25 people, including two teenagers, were detained. Thousands of Central American migrants have been camping at shelters in Tijuana since arriving in November after travelling in caravans across Mexico to reach the U.S. border, where many have hoped to request asylum. Mexico’s new leftist president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sought not to antagonize Trump over the U.S. president’s demands for a border wall. He obtained a pledge from the United States to contribute billions of dollars for development in Mexico’s poor south and Central America in order to deter migration. Trump has backed away from his campaign pledge to make Mexico pay for a wall, but just last week he threatened to close the border with Mexico unless he gets the money he wants from U.S. lawmakers for a barrier. The United States has also pushed Mexico to house Central American migrants while they seek U.S. asylum.

2019-01-02,"SINGAPORE, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. oil began 2019 in positive territory on Wednesday, although the general outlook for the year is weak amid soaring U.S. crude supply and concerns of an economic slowdown. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot crude oil futures were trading at $45.86 per barrel at 0024 GMT, up 45 cents, or 1 percent, from their final close in 2018. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. Oil prices ended 2018 with losses for the first time since 2015, after a desultory fourth quarter that saw buyers flee the market over growing worries about a supply glut and mixed signals related to renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. “Oil prices ... registered their first yearly decline in three years on fears of a slowing global economy and concerns of an ongoing supply glut,” said Adeel Minhas, a consultant at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. For the year, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) futures slumped nearly 25 percent, while Brent tumbled nearly 20 percent. The outlook for 2019 is riddled with uncertainty, analysts said, including U.S.-China trade concerns and Brexit, as well as political instability and conflict in the Middle East. A Reuters poll showed oil prices are expected to trade below $70 per barrel in 2019 as surplus production, much of it from the United States, and slowing economic growth undermine efforts led by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut supply and prop up prices.

Fed fund futures have all but priced out any hike for this year and now imply a quarter point cut by mid-2020. The Treasury market also assumes the Fed is done and dusted. Yields on two-year paper have tumbled to 2.49 percent, just barely above the cash rate, from a peak of 2.977 percent in November. Yields on 10-year notes have dived to their lowest since last February at 2.69 percent, making a bullish break of a major chart level at 2.717 percent. The spread between two- and 10-year yields has in turn shrunk to the smallest since 2007, a flattening that has been a portent of recessions in the past. “What is clear is that the global synchronised growth story that propelled risk assets higher has come to the end of its current run,” the Treasury team at OCBC Bank wrote in a note. “Inexorably flattening yield curves and, now, partially inverted U.S. yield curve have poured cold water on further policy normalisation going ahead.” The breakneck drop in yields has been a headwind for the U.S. dollars. Against a basket of currencies it was stuck at 06.108 having fallen for two weeks straight. The euro was firm at $1.1462 and poised for another attack on resistance in the $1.1485/1500 zone, a band that has held since late October. Against the yen, the dollar was last trading at 109.56 and near its lowest since June last year. The pullback in the dollar and the chance of no more U.S. rate hikes has been a boon for gold. The precious metal fetched $1,281.41 an ounce to be close to a six-month peak. Oil prices started with a tentative bounce after a punishing 2018. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI)futures slumped nearly 25 percent last year, while Brent lost 19.5 percent. On Wednesday, U.S. crude futures had nudged up 48 cents to $45.89 a barrel, while Brent was yet to trade.
