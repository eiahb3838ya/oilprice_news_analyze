2018-07-16,"(Adds details on case) By Nate Raymond July 16 (Reuters) - A former official at a Venezuelan state-run electric company pleaded guilty on Monday to U.S. charges that he participated in a scheme to solicit bribes in exchange for helping vendors win favorable treatment from state oil company PDVSA. Luis Carlos De Leon Perez, 42, pleaded guilty in federal court in Houston to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to conspiring to commit money laundering, the U.S. Justice Department said. He became the 12th person to plead guilty as part of a larger investigation by the Justice Department into bribery at Petroleos de Venezuela SA that became public with the arrest of two Venezuelan businessmen in December 2015. The two men were Roberto Rincon, who was president of Tradequip Services & Marine, and Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas, the manager of Vertix Instrumentos. Both pleaded guilty in 2016 to conspiring to pay bribes to secure energy contracts. De Leon is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 24. His lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. De Leon was arrested in October 2017 in Spain and was extradited to the United States after being indicted along with four other former Venezuelan officials on charges they solicited bribes to help vendors win favorable treatment from PDVSA. An indictment said that from 2011 to 2013 the five Venezuelans sought bribes and kickbacks from vendors to help them secure PDVSA contracts and gain priority over other vendors for outstanding invoices during its liquidity crisis. Prosecutors said De Leon was among a group of PDVSA officials and people outside the company with influence at it who solicited bribes from Rincon and Shiera. De Leon worked with those men to then launder the bribe money, prosecutors said. De Leon also sought bribes from the owners of other energy companies and directed some of that money to PDVSA officials in order help those businesses out, prosecutors said. Among the people indicted with De Leon was Cesar David Rincon Godoy, a former general manager at PDVSA’s procurement unit Bariven. He pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Others charged included Nervis Villalobos, a former Venezuelan vice minister of energy; Rafael Reiter, who worked as PDVSA’s head of security and loss prevention; and Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa, who was an assistant to Bariven’s president. Villalobos and Reiter were, like De Leon, arrested in Spain, where they remain pending extradition, the Justice Department said. Isturiz remains at large.

2018-07-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States in certain cases will consider waivers for countries that need more time to wind down imports of oil from Iran as it seeks to avoid disrupting global oil markets while reimposing sanctions against Tehran, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. “We want people to reduce oil purchases to zero, but in certain cases if people can’t do that overnight, we’ll consider exceptions,” Mnuchin told reporters on Friday, clarifying some U.S. officials’ comments that there would be no exemptions. Mnuchin’s comments were embargoed for release on Monday as other U.S. officials were expected to begin talks in India this week on cutbacks in Iranian oil supplies. Mnuchin spoke to reporters while en route from Mexico, where he was part of a high-level U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet Mexico’s next president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.  The Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November, when the United States reimposes sanctions against Tehran. Trump withdrew from the multi-national 2015 Iran nuclear deal against the advice of allies in Europe and elsewhere. A delegation from the U.S. State Department and U.S. Treasury are expected for talks in Delhi this week to discuss Iran sanctions, according to Indian officials. U.S. crude oil exports to India hit a record in June as Indian refiners moved to replace supplies from Iran and Venezuela. Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said India was expected to ask the United States to ensure adequate global oil supplies as Washington presses countries to cut back on Iran oil. “That might include pressure to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which the administration indicated they were considering on Friday,” said Lipow. “To put things in context, if we were to look at Iran in total, it’s exporting roughly 2.2 million barrels a day of sales, of which half is going to both China and India,” he said. “It’s very important for the U.S. to get India on board with the sanctions policy.” Mnuchin said he would meet with counterparts from developed and developing countries during a G20 finance ministers’ meeting in Buenos Aires this week. U.S. sanctions against Iran are likely to be raised in his talks on the sidelines of the event. “We’ve said very specifically, there’s no blanket waivers, there’s no grandfathering,” Mnuchin said. “We want to be very careful in the wind down around the energy markets to make sure that people have the time.” “The State Department has the ability to issue waivers around significant reductions in the oil markets. That’s something that Treasury and State will be doing,” he said. Mnuchin said Washington had made clear to allies that it expects them to enforce the sanctions against Iran, “but if there are specific situations we’re open to listening.” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said over the weekend that Washington had rejected a French request for waivers for its companies operating in Iran, according to Le Figaro. Paris had singled out key areas where it expected either exemptions or extended wind-down periods for French companies, including energy, banking, pharmaceuticals and automotive. The Trump administration has said more than 50 foreign companies have withdrawn their business from Iran since Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the United States, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. Pompeo, also speaking to reporters on Friday, said he had discussed U.S. plans to reimpose sanctions on Iran with “all but one” country. He did not name the country he had not yet consulted. “What they’ve asked us to do is review how we get there and the timeline for that,” he said. “I’m very confident they understand.” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Monday that Iran had filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice in the Hague against unilateral U.S. sanctions. “Today Iran filed a complaint @CIJ_ICJ to hold US accountable for its unlawful re-imposition of unilateral sanctions,” Zarif tweeted. “Iran is committed to the rule of law in the face of US contempt for diplomacy & legal obligations. It’s imperative to counter its habit of violating int’l law.” The court could not be reached for comment. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in remarks carried live on state television on Saturday, said Washington was more isolated than ever over sanctions against Iran, even among its allies. His comments appeared to be trying to ease local concerns fuelled by Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran. The likely return of U.S. economic sanctions has triggered a rapid fall of Iran’s currency and protests by bazaar traders usually loyal to the Islamist rulers. Trump has said he asked Saudi Arabia to raise oil production if needed to ensure global oil supplies and the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies on June 23 to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost, but giving no specific numbers.

2018-07-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The price of oil tumbled more than 4 percent on Monday, putting pressure on energy shares and keeping global stock markets in check, although financial shares rallied after upbeat news from Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.   Oil slumped as Libyan ports reopened and traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other producers. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled down 4.15 percent at $68.06 a barrel, while Brent LCOcv1 settled at 71.84, down 4.63 percent, and touched a three-month low. Concerns over China’s second-quarter economic growth also weighed on oil prices. The country’s economy expanded at a slower pace as Beijing’s efforts to contain debt hurt activity, while June factory output growth weakened to a two-year low. “The GDP missing a little bit psychologically was a warning sign that China is doing OK now, but not quite as strong as expected,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Wall Street’s main indexes ended little changed following strong weeks as investors geared up for a big week of corporate earnings and awaited commentary on the impact of U.S. trade disputes with China and its other trading partners. “It looks as though we’re just taking a bit of a break after a good run last week,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.

2018-07-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped more than 4 percent on Monday, with Brent reaching a three-month low, as Libyan ports reopened and traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other producers. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $3.49 to settle at $71.84 a barrel, a 4.63 percent loss, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $2.95 to settle at $68.06 a barrel, a 4.15 percent loss. Brent’s dive pushed it to a session low of $71.52 during the session, its lowest since mid-April.  Falling prices offset gains late last week caused by supply outages in Libya, a labor dispute in Norway and unrest in Iraq. Russia and other oil producers could raise output by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) or more if shortages hit the market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on Friday. Also weighing on futures were reports the United States could tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would add supply to the market. Concerns over China’s second-quarter GDP growth also was negative for prices during Monday’s session. The country’s economy expanded at a slower pace as Beijing’s efforts to contain debt hurt activity, while June factory output growth weakened to a two-year low in a worrying sign for investment and exporters as a trade war with the United States intensified. “The GDP missing a little bit psychologically was a warning sign that China is doing OK now, but not quite as strong as expected,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Production in Libya remained under threat. While its ports are reopening, output at Libya’s Sharara oilfield was expected to fall by at least 160,000 bpd after two workers were abducted by an unknown group, the National Oil Corporation said on Saturday.  On July 11, the NOC said four export terminals were being reopened after eastern factions handed over the ports, while a lengthy shutdown at El Feel oilfield in the southwest also ended. Two days later, output at the nearby 300,000 bpd Sharara was slashed. In Norway, a strike by offshore oil and gas workers accelerated on Monday when hundreds more walked out in a dispute over pay and pensions after employers failed to respond to union demands for a new offer. Two protesters in Iraq died on Sunday in clashes with security forces in the town of Samawa amid anger in southern cities over public services and corruption. Demonstrations have yet to affect crude production. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday the United States’ aim was to squeeze Iranian oil exports “to zero.” Mnuchin said Washington wanted to avoid disrupting markets and would in some cases consider waivers, but it had been made clear to allies it expects them to enforce sanctions against Iran.  Mnuchin is expected to head to India to discuss sanctions; the country is a prominent importer of Iranian crude, but officials there have said it will reduce those purchases.

2018-07-16,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s trade ministry on Monday recommended imposing a 25 percent duty on imports of solar cells and modules from China for one year to try to counter what it sees as a threat to domestic solar equipment manufacturing. Falling prices of solar cells and modules, over 90 percent of which India imports from China, have triggered a decline in the cost of solar power generation and led Indians increasingly to adopt the technology. India plans to make renewable power account for 40 percent of its total installed capacity by 2030, from 20 percent currently. The proposed safeguard duty, which would apply for two years in total to imports from China and Malaysia, would be reduced in the second year to 20 percent for six months and then 15 percent for six months. The proposed duty is less than the 70 percent recommended by Indian authorities in January. The recommendation, contained in a report published by the ministry and to be submitted to the government for approval, is intended to address a serious threat to the domestic solar manufacturing industry from Chinese imports, the directorate general of trade remedies (DGTR) said in the report. Indian solar cell and module manufacturers said cheap Chinese imports were hurting the domestic industry, while Chinese manufacturers say imports are helping India accelerate its renewable energy adoption program. “Solar module manufacturers are facing tough and unhealthy competition from imported modules,” the report quoted the North India Module Manufacturer Association as saying. The China Chamber of Commerce for Imports and Exports of Machinery and Electronic Products said the “real cause of injury to the domestic industry is aggressive pricing practices of other Indian producers and not imports.” Trade relations between the two Asian nations have thawed recently despite fears of a trade war elsewhere, with the two sides discussing ways to increase Indian sales of farm products and India pushing China to give access to its software service firms. However, the trade deficit has widened to $62.9 billion in China’s favor, an over nine-fold increase over the last decade. India’s share in China’s exports of solar cells and modules rose from about a fifth in the first half of 2016 to two-fifths a year later, the DGTR wrote, adding that China had “started targeting the Indian market more vigorously.” Some Indian solar power generators, like Avaada Ltd, have expressed reservations about the duties. A safeguard duty would put solar projects worth more than 1000 billion Indian rupees ($14.59 billion) under jeopardy, Avaada told DGTR.

2018-07-16,"DAKAR, July 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s plan to drill for oil in national parks could leave thousands of farmers and fishermen who rely on the land in a struggle to survive, rights groups said on Monday. The central African country announced last month that it was taking steps toward declassifying parts of Virunga and Salonga national parks, both recognised as world heritage sites by the United Nations, to allow for oil exploration. The parks, which together cover an area about the size of Switzerland, are among the world’s largest tropical rainforest reserves and home to rare species including forest elephants. Allowing drilling in the parks would cause a loss of biodiversity, release huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and pollute water that thousands of local people use for fishing and farming, according to several rights groups. Congolese state spokesman Lambert Mende told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the government will study the potential impact of oil drilling on local communities before they proceed. The government has previously defended its right to authorise drilling anywhere in the country and said it is mindful of environmental considerations, such as protecting animals and plants, in the two national parks. “There are lake-shore communities, especially in Virunga, that are very dependent on fishing and on the park’s integrity,” said Pete Jones of environmental advocacy group Global Witness. “That really needs to be taken into account and doesn’t seem to be part of the debate that’s happening, which is a shame,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Conservation group World Wildlife Fund (WWF) also said it is concerned about the impact of oil drilling on at least 50,000 people who benefit from the fishing industry in Virunga, and tens of thousands more who farm on the outskirts of the parks. “The risks of pollution are clear and present. The fishing industry would suffer considerably if it gets to that point,” said Juan Seve, WWF country director in Congo. The oil industry would be unlikely to create local jobs since specialists would be brought in from abroad, he added. The U.N.’s cultural agency UNESCO has previously said that oil exploration should not be conducted at world heritage sites.

2018-07-16,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - About 20 Nigerian soldiers are missing after a clash with Boko Haram militants in the northeast of the country, security sources said on Monday, though the military denied reports that some troops could not be found. The confrontation between militants and troops took place on Saturday in the Bama area of Borno, the state worst hit by the jihadist group which has killed more than 30,000 people since 2009 when it launched an insurgency to create an Islamic caliphate.  Three soldiers told Reuters more than 20 were missing.  “We lost some of our soldiers in the attack. It is possible those missing are dead. We haven’t seen about 23 of them now,” said an officer who did not want to be named. Another soldier involved in the clash said the troops were ambushed while conducting a “clearance operation”, adding that “over 20 soldiers have not been seen up till now”. He said five military vehicles were taken.  The militant group carries out suicide bomb attacks in crowded places, such as markets, as well as gun raids and attacks on military bases.  At a news conference on Monday, the military said media reports of the soldiers being missing were untrue.  An army spokesman said suspected Boko Haram militants had tried to seize military vehicles in an attempted attack on troops in Bama but they had been repelled by troops backed by the air force. “About 22 members of Boko Haram terrorists were neutralised while several others escaped with gunshot wounds. Efforts are being intensified by the troops to get the fleeing members of the Boko Haram terrorists,” said a military spokesman.  Boko Haram held territory around the size of Belgium in northeast Nigeria for several months until being pushed off much of that land in early 2015 by Nigeria’s army and troops from neighbouring countries.  Bama, about 60 km (40 miles) southeast of Borno’s state capital Maiduguri, was held by Boko Haram from September 2014 until March 2015. Nigeria’s government has said since December 2015 that Boko Haram has been “technically defeated”. Yet attacks continue in the northeast while another group, an Islamic State ally that split from Boko Haram in 2016, holds territory.

2018-07-16,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - About 200 protesters gathered at the main entrance to Iraq’s Siba natural gas field on Monday, police sources said, following more than a week of unrest over poor services sweeping southern cities amid political uncertainty. Growing anger has put a spotlight on the performance of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who is seeking a second term after a May 12 parliamentary election, which reflected widespread discontent over hardships and corruption. The crumbling oil hub of Basra and others parts of the Shi’ite heartland south have long been neglected, first by Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein and then Shi’ite-led governments after him. Similar protests have occurred in the past. This time the unrest is more widespread and demonstrators have for the first time attacked provincial government headquarters and even buildings belonging to powerful Shi’ite paramilitary groups. Three demonstrators have been killed in clashes with security forces and dozens were wounded. In a rare move, protesters stormed the international airport in Najaf, a holy Shi’ite city, temporarily halting air traffic.  Abadi has announced that his caretaker government would release funds for water, electricity and health services in Basra, once dubbed the “Venice of the Middle East” for its network of canals. Monday’s demonstration has not affected operations at Siba, which is run by Kuwait Energy PLC, Siba officials said. “We have demonstrated near the field to press the company to give us jobs. We are living nearby and watching every day hundreds of workers here sitting jobless and can hardly give food to our children,” said Salim Khasbawi, who is unemployed.  Residents of the southern oil-exporting city of Basra have gathered at the main gate to three major oil fields —  West Qurna 1, West Qurna 2 and Rumaila.  Local officials said demonstrations have not affected crude production in Basra, whose shipments account for more than 95 percent of OPEC producer Iraq’s state revenues. Any disruption could have a severe impact on the country’s limping economy and push up global oil prices. Anger is mounting at a time when politicians are struggling to form a government after the election, which was marred by allegations of fraud that prompted a recount. The political bloc led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr came first in the election after promising to ease poverty, create jobs and fight corruption. There have been no reports of attacks directed against Sadr’s political bloc or followers.  In the past many of the protesters in the south supported Sadr, who made a remarkable comeback in the election after being sidelined for years by Iranian-backed rivals.

In oil markets, concerns about supply disruptions eased and Libyan ports reopened while traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other producers. U.S. crude fell 4.03 percent to $68.15 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.11, down 4.27 percent on the day. Wall Street’s main indexes were little changed following strong weeks as investors geared up for a big week of corporate earnings and awaited commentary on the impact of trade disputes between the United States and its partners. “Trade and trade rhetoric will be a focus of the market,” said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York. “As we get into earnings season in particular we are going to be watching for management teams to discuss their outlooks not only in the numbers but more generally anecdotally how trade could impact their businesses.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.96 points, or 0.04 percent, to 25,028.37, the S&P 500 lost 3.9 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,797.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.30 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,815.68. Major energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell weighed on key indexes. Financials in the U.S. and Europe were higher following Bank of America’s better-than-expected quarterly profit and Deutsche Bank’s upbeat earnings preview. Overall in Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.29 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.15 percent. Investors were watching for any developments from a meeting between the leaders of the United States and Russia. Markets also looked to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s semiannual testimony on the economy and monetary policy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. The dollar fell, having posted its largest weekly gain in a month last Friday, as risk appetite improved, prompting investors to pare back some of their long bets on the greenback. The dollar index fell 0.2 percent, with the euro up 0.17 percent to $1.1705. U.S. Treasury yields held at higher levels as data on domestic retail sales in June reinforced the view that consumer spending is increasing at a solid clip for robust economic growth in the second quarter. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 10/32 in price to yield 2.8674 percent, from 2.831 percent late on Friday. Spot gold dropped 0.2 percent to $1,238.91 an ounce.

2018-07-16,"TUNIS (Reuters) - After a relatively stable spell, Libya’s oil production has see-sawed again because of a standoff at eastern export terminals and the abduction of two workers at the giant Sharara oilfield. Military clashes followed by a political power struggle forced the National Oil Corporation (NOC) to halt exports at Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Zueitina and Hariga terminals in late June and early July, threatening to keep offline as much as 850,000 barrels per day (bpd). The ports were reopened on July 11 and eastern fields gradually resumed operations. A lengthy shutdown at El Feel oilfield in the southwest also ended, but two days later output at the nearby 300,000 bpd Sharara was slashed after two staff were kidnapped. National production had been hovering around 1 million bpd for more than a year and reached 1.28 million bpd in February, with most recent shutdowns resolved in days or weeks.  But the risk of further output shocks will linger while Libya remains politically and militarily divided.  Libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in Africa, and has been a key light, sweet crude supplier.   Around 1970 it produced more than 3 million bpd, and before the NATO-backed uprising in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed seven years ago, it was pumping more than 1.6 million. Last year the NOC outlined plans to raise production to 2.2 million bpd by 2023, but said this would need around $18 billion of investment. Foreign oil companies including Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), Total (TOTF.PA) of France, Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI) and U.S. firms ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Hess (HES.N) have production stakes through joint ventures with the NOC. Since Libya’s 2011 uprising, rival groups have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands.  Power is split between shifting armed factions in the east and west, aligned with competing administrations. They and other groups have cut off production at fields and ports, including a blockade of terminals in Libya’s eastern oil crescent from 2013-2016. Prolonged shutdowns have reduced pressure at wells. As Libya’s revenue fell due to production disruptions and lower oil prices, demands for salaries, local development and jobs that feed into blockades became more widespread. Groups including Islamist militants have attacked and fought over oilfields and ports. Most the storage tanks at two major terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, have been damaged or destroyed. Fields including Mabruk and Ghani remain closed. A lack of funding has been an additional drag on aging infrastructure and regular power outages are a further constraint. International companies have a limited presence onshore, keeping exploration and development programs mostly on hold.       Reasons for shutdowns include economic protests by local groups pushing for cash or the release of jailed fighters, which have affected ports, major fields and parts of the pipeline network. The Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG) whose job is to protect oil installations often hold local agendas and loyalties. Guards shut down the 70,000-bpd El Feel field this year for more than four months.      Security is volatile. Militants including some linked to Islamic State are present in desert areas, and have carried out attacks near facilities or fields in the Sirte basin. Risk is also linked to Libya’s domestic conflict.   In mid-June, a former PFG commander who had led earlier port blockades gathered opponents of eastern-based military chief Khalifa Haftar along with mercenaries to attack Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, held by Haftar’s forces since 2016.  After the assault was repelled, Haftar and his allies said they would take control of most of Libya’s oil through a parallel NOC in the eastern city of Benghazi, complaining that too many of the revenues flowing through the central bank in Tripoli had been passing to their rivals. The standoff was resolved with a promise to look into central bank spending and a sanctions threat against those trying to bypass the internationally recognized NOC.  But the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, which announced the investigation into spending, lacks authority.  Meanwhile U.N.-led efforts to unify eastern and western factions showing little visible progress, and plans for elections this year are uncertain.    Along with Nigeria, Libya has been exempted from OPEC-led production cuts designed to bolster prices. Both have signaled their intention to raise output.

2018-07-16,"(Recasts, updates throughout) By Wilda Asmarini JAKARTA, July 16 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Indonesian electricity utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) denied wrongdoing on Monday after the country’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) searched his house for evidence in a power station graft probe. “This case is in the hands of a consortium, not PLN,” Chief Executive Sofyan Basir told reporters at a news conference, referring to Riau-1 coal fired power station project partners BlackGold and China Huadian Engineering Co., Ltd. (CHEC). “It was nothing to do with us at all,” Basir said, referring to PLN unit PT Pembangkitan Jawa-Bali (PJB), which has a majority stake in the project. The graft was worth 4.8 billion rupiah ($333,000), broadcaster Berita Satu reported. Basir said the investigators had taken documents related to the proposal from his house during the Sunday raid. “It’s normal,” Basir said, referring to KPK investigators who arrived on Monday afternoon to search for evidence in the directors’ offices at PLN headquarters in Jakarta. PLN’s PJB had been in talks for around two years with the consortium, and had yet to reach agreements on power pricing or project operations, he said. “We’ll take a break,” he said referring to the project. “We don’t know yet how long for.” PLN’s management is cooperating with investigators and will obey the law, Basir added. The probe is the latest in a string of high profile graft investigations under President Joko Widodo, who is working to improve the image of Indonesia’s energy sector after a series of scandals implicating government officials. Eni Maulani Saragih, the deputy chief of parliament commission VII, which oversees the energy sector, was arrested by the KPK on Friday and later named as a suspect on allegations she received bribes related to the project, KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah said. The KPK had collected evidence including CCTV recordings and data on laptops, he added. Also named suspect was Johanes Budisutrisno Kotjo, a former consultant for BlackGold Natural Resources Limited. Saragih and Kotjo were both detained by the KPK and could not immediately be reached for comment. BlackGold denied wrongdoing. “The Directors and management were not, and are not involved whatsoever, in the transaction mentioned,” BlackGold Chief Executive Philip Cecil Rickard said in a stock exchange filing, referring to press statements from the KPK. “Negotiations on the Riau-1 Project have been progressing as intended,” Rickard said, adding there had been no impact on the company’s business activities.

2018-07-16,"OSLO (Reuters) - A strike by Norwegian offshore oil and gas workers accelerated on Monday when hundreds more walked out in a dispute over pay and pensions after employers failed to respond to union demands for a new offer. The strike, which began last Tuesday, has had a limited impact on Norway’s oil production so far, but some drillers warned of possible contract cancellations if the dispute goes on for a month or more. A further 900 workers went on strike on Monday, joining almost 700 who walked out last week, and the Safe union said it would consider in the next few days whether to widen the strike to all of its 2,250 members. Safe went ahead with its plan to expand the strike after employers did not respond to its demands for higher wages and pension benefits by a midnight (2200 GMT) Sunday deadline. The expanded strike was not expected to have any immediate extra impact on oil or gas production beyond the closure last week of Shell’s (RDSa.L) Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Norway’s biggest oil producer Equinor (EQNR.OL) said it did not expect its output to be affected “in the short term” due to the escalation of the strike. “More drilling and well operations are affected. We will get delays ... In the short term we do not see any production or milestone consequences,” said Equinor spokesman Eskil Eriksen.  He declined to comment on what the company considered “short term” and what the long-term consequences would be. It is the biggest strike in Norway’s oil sector since 2012, but has involved a relatively small number of workers. Norway’s oil industry directly employed 50,700 workers in 2017, around half of whom worked in production, according to Statistics Norway. There has been no contact between employers and the union since the strike began last Tuesday after Safe rejected a proposed wage and pension deal. Employers, represented by the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, said on Monday that the union “lacked understanding of the economic reality of the Norwegian continental shelf”. “It is ... utterly incomprehensible that Safe is willing to put at risk jobs, the shelf’s attractiveness and competitiveness, and Norway’s reputation as a safe and stable supplier of oil and gas resources,” lead negotiator Jacob Korsgaard said in a statement. Korsgaard told Reuters he did not plan further talks with the union this week, after saying on Saturday that a dispute like this could not go on indefinitely and that employers were considering counter measures. Reidun Ravndal, a member of Safe’s strike committee, said that while 900 additional workers were joining the strike on Monday, it would take some time for the strike to become fully effective because they have to follow safe shutdown procedures. One of the drilling companies affected, Odfjell Drilling (ODLL.OL), warned of financial losses and of contract cancellations if the strike lasts “a long time”. “There will be a financial loss, yes. We have mechanisms in the contracts to compensate, but if it lasts a long time consequences will be serious,” CEO Simen Lieungh told Reuters, without specifying a time span.  “Contracts could be terminated,” he said, mentioning contracts with Equinor and Aker BP (AKERBP.OL). Contract terminations is a concern for other drillers too, according to lead negotiator Jacob Korsgaard. “It is a real concern that increases every day,” he told Reuters. Asked whether the strike could lead to contract cancellations if it were to last more than a month, he said: “Definitely.” Last week Aker BP said a prolonged strike could postpone output from some of the wells it was planning to drill at its Valhall field, which it expected to put in production later in the year.    The employees joining the action work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by Saipem (SPMI.MI), Transocean (RIGN.S), Songa Offshore, Odfjell Drilling (ODLL.OL), Archer (ARCHER.OL) and COSL (601808.SS), among others. Asked whether the strike might be widened to the remaining drilling workers that belong to the union, Ravndal of the Safe union told Reuters: “We will have this discussion in the next few days.” Editing by Alister Doyle/Adrian Croft/Susan Fenton",https://uk.reuters.com/article/norway-oil-wages-strike/update-3-norway-oil-workers-strike-accelerates-drillers-fear-contract-losses-idUKL8N1UC0U6,16 Jul 2018,"* Equinor sees no short-term impact on output

2018-07-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers made few adjustments to their positions in the petroleum complex in the week ending on July 10, as the market remained calm - before oil prices plunged the following day. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by just 6 million barrels in the seven days to July 10. Net length increased for the third week running but the rise was much smaller than in the week ending July 3 (+47 million barrels) or June 26 (+36 million) indicating the recent wave of position-building was largely complete. Portfolio managers cut net long positions in Brent (-10 million barrels) while adding them in NYMEX and ICE WTI (+1 million), U.S. gasoline (+6 million), U.S. heating oil (+5 million) and European gasoil (+4 million). The previous position-building in WTI ran out of steam, with fund managers adding just 1 million barrels of net long positions, compared with 41 million and 75 million in the two prior weeks. While crude contracts continued to come under selling pressure, funds started or continued to add slightly to bullish positions in refined fuels (tmsnrt.rs/2KZZ67a). Net length in European gasoil increased for the first time in seven weeks, while U.S. heating oil and gasoline both saw bullish positions rise for the second week running. The very limited position changes in the week to July 10 suggest most fund managers had completed adjusting their positions after a bout of profit-taking on crude and fuels that began in late April. But Brent positions have declined in 10 out of the last 13 weeks, and with no new buying in WTI, the gentle downward pressure on prices and calendar spreads finally turned into a torrent just one day later. — John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-07-16,"WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) - The United States wants to avoid disrupting global oil markets as it reimposes sanctions against Tehran and in certain cases will consider waivers for countries which need more time to wind down their oil imports from Iran, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. “We want people to reduce oil purchases to zero, but in certain cases if people can’t do that overnight, we’ll consider exceptions,” Mnuchin told reporters on Friday, clarifying some U.S. officials’ comments that there would be no exemptions. Mnuchin’s comments were embargoed for release on Monday. Mnuchin was talking to reporters en route from Mexico where he was part of a high-level U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet Mexico’s next president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November when the United States reimposes sanctions against Tehran, after Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal agreed between Iran and six major powers, against the advice of allies in Europe and elsewhere. Mnuchin said he would meet with counterparts from developed and developing countries on the sidelines of a G20 finance ministers’ meeting in Buenos Aires on July 19-22. U.S. sanctions against Iran are likely to be raised in his talks. “We’ve said very specifically, there’s no blanket waivers, there’s no grandfathering,” Mnuchin said, “We want to be very careful in the wind-down around the energy markets to make sure that people have the time.” He added: “The State Department has the ability to issue waivers around significant reductions in the oil markets, that’s something that Treasury and State will be doing.” Mnuchin said Washington had made clear to allies that it expects them to enforce the sanctions against Iran “but if there are specific situations we’re open to listening.” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said at the weekend that Washington had rejected a French request for waivers for its companies operating in Iran, according to Le Figaro. Paris had singled out key areas where it expected either exemptions or extended wind-down periods for French companies, including energy, banking, pharmaceuticals and automotive. The Trump administration has said there are more than 50 foreign companies that have withdrawn their business from Iran since Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the United States, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. Pompeo, also speaking to reporters on Friday, said he had discussed U.S. plans to reimpose sanctions on Iran with “all but one” country. He did not name the country he had not yet consulted. “What they’ve asked us to do is review how we get there and the timeline for that,” he said, “and so I’m very confident they understand.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, speaking in remarks carried live on state television on Saturday, said Washington was more isolated than ever over sanctions against Iran, even among its allies. His comments appeared to be trying to ease popular concerns fueled by Trump’s decision to withdraw from the deal with Iran on its nuclear program. The likely return of U.S. economic sanctions has triggered a rapid fall of Iran’s currency and protests by bazaar traders usually loyal to the Islamist rulers. Trump has said he asked Saudi Arabia to raise oil production if needed to ensure global oil supplies and the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies on June 23 to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost, but giving no specific numbers.

2018-07-16,"(Adds more detail) By Huw Jones LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - Global regulators have published a framework for “vigilantly” monitoring risks from crypto assets like bitcoin and ether, even though they don’t pose a major risk to financial stability for now. Wild swings in crypto asset prices have prompted central bankers to warn investors they could lose every penny. It is unclear at times which financial rules, if any, apply to the sector or if there is legal authority to regulate it. Start ups have begun issuing new digital currencies via initial coin offerings (ICOs), raising concern among regulators over investor protection. The aim of the new framework is to spot any financial stability risks early enough to take action. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said the framework focuses on how risks from crypto asset markets could spread to other parts of the financial system. “Monitoring the size and growth of crypto-asset markets is critical to understanding the potential size of wealth effects, should valuations fall,” the FSB said in a statement on Monday. “The use of leverage, and financial institution exposures to crypto-asset markets are important metrics of transmission of crypto-asset risks to the broader financial system.” The aim of the new framework is to spot any financial stability risks early enough to take action. But the FSB cautioned that data is still patchy at times in a rapidly developing market that can be fragmented and opaque. It would assess whether the framework will need extra data at a later stage. Moves to formally monitor the sector forms part of a compromise in March between G20 members like France, who wanted more radical action, and other countries who preferred treading lightly for now. The FSB framework also includes trading volumes, pricing, clearing and margining for derivatives linked to crypto assets, such as the bitcoin futures launched by CME Group last December. Crypto assets in general and crypto asset trading platforms do not pose global financial stability risks, but they raise other significant concerns, including consumer and investor protection, market integrity and money laundering/terrorism financing, the FSB said. It said its affiliate, the Basel Committee, which writes bank capital standards, is conducting an “initial stocktake” of banks’ exposures to crypto assets. The committee is also looking at whether regulators are forcing lenders to set aside capital against holdings of crypto assets, and considering whether to rewrite its rules to explicitly require such holdings to be covered.

2018-07-16,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran’s top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has  criticised Saudi Arabia over its management of the haj pilgrimage and called for a fresh investigation into a 2015 crush that killed hundreds, Iranian state TV reported on Monday.     The criticism comes ahead of this year’s haj and amid tension between Tehran and Riyadh over proxy wars in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen in which the two support opposing sides. Riyadh says nearly 800 pilgrims died when two big groups of pilgrims collided at a crossroads in Mina, a few km (miles) east of Mecca, on their way to performing the “Stoning of the Devil” ritual at Jamarat. Counts by countries of repatriated bodies showed over 2,000 people may have died, including more than 400 Iranians. “A fact-finding committee, with Iran’s presence, should be formed to investigate these cruelties. Relevant Iranian authorities should mobilise all legal resources to follow up the tragedy,” Khamenei said in a speech to Iran’s haj organisers.  “The holy lands of Mecca and Mina belong to all Muslims ... it does not belong to rulers of Saudi Arabia,” said Khamenei. The kingdom, Iran’s key regional rival, presents itself as the guardian of Islamic orthodoxy and custodian of its holiest places in Mecca and Medina. Iran boycotted the haj in 2016 amid tensions with Saudi Arabia over the incident. About 90,000 Iranians attended the pilgrimage last year. Iran also boycotted the haj for three years after 402 pilgrims, including 275 Iranians, died in clashes with Saudi security forces at an anti-U.S. and anti-Israel rally in Mecca in 1987. The so-called “deliverance from infidels” rallies are banned by the Saudi authorities. “Haj is the best opportunity to display that religion and politics cannot be separated ... the real haj is a combination of unity and seeking deliverance from infidels,” he said.   Approximately 85,000 Iranians are expected to attend the haj pilgrimage this year in Islam’s holiest city Mecca.  Riyadh severed diplomatic relations in 2016 after Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran following the execution of a Shi’ite cleric in Saudi Arabia in January 2016. Saudi Arabia welcomed President Donald Trump’s decision in May to withdraw the United States from the international nuclear agreement with Iran and to reimpose economic sanctions on its arch-foe Tehran.

2018-07-16,"* European shares rise despite Asian market falls * Corporate earnings outlook, M&A outweigh weaker Chinese data * Crude prices drop as supply concerns ease * Dollar slips as euro pushes past $1.17 * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - European stock markets struggled on Monday as expectations for a flurry of bumper corporate earnings and merger speculation fought with fears about the escalating trade conflict between Beijing and Washington. Data showing China’s economy and factory production growth had slowed sent Asian markets lower at the start of the week, as investors fret an escalating trade battle between China and the United States may soon start to damage the real economy . European shares, which have rallied off three-month lows in July, mostly opened higher although the gains were limited and temporary. Germany’s DAX was the biggest riser, up as much as half a percent before settling up 0.1 percent. France’s CAC 40 traded down 0.27 percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 was 0.14 percent lower. Basic resources and autos were among the worst-performing sectors, as both rely on solid Chinese growth. Merger speculation concerning industrials helped outweigh the Chinese data. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat on the day. “The numbers were not way out of line and slower activity numbers were kind of priced in,” said Ian Williams, a strategist at Peel Hunt. “Despite all the noise around China and Trump, you are going to get a real indication of macroeconomic health much more from company management. I suspect that’s what the focus will be for the next two to three weeks.” Fears of a broader and deeper trade conflict have kept markets edgy for months now, but the selloffs have been short-lived because most investors are confident that the dispute will blow over and that robust global economic growth is here to stay. With dozens of European and U.S. companies reporting their second-quarter numbers this week, investors will be looking for any warnings that the trade battle is hurting corporate projections. JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka said earnings results in both the U.S. and Europe would likely be strong, beating expectations by a good 4-5 percent. He noted that trade headlines might be losing some of the “shock value as many investors now expect further bad news on this front.” The S&P 500 e-mini futures treaded water on Monday, pointing to a flat opening on Wall Street after solid gains on Friday. The Chinese data showed its economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter of 2018, cooling from the 6.8 percent growth registered in each of the previous three quarters. The figures came in line with market forecasts, but new data showing slower-than-expected growth in China’s industrial output pointed to slowing momentum. The data worries investors because it highlights an economy slowing just as trade war headwinds are gathering. “The question is what happens when tariffs spill over into real data. I heard my economist saying that some of the Fed regional reports already point to some worries there,” said ING strategist Benjamin Schroeder. “So this makes the Powell speech important this week, if he makes any comments on how the trade tariffs may affect the U.S. economy,” he said, referring to U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s scheduled testimony to lawmakers on Tuesday. High-grade euro zone government bond yields hovered near recent lows as investors sought out safer assets. Moves in currencies were muted. Both the dollar and the yen, which tend to outperform when trade war worries flare as investors rush to buy assets perceived to be safer, were down on the day, suggesting investors were not too worried about the Chinese data. The euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.1720, recovering some of last week’s losses. China’s yuan weakened following Monday’s data release, but later recovered. In the offshore market it rose 0.3 percent to 6.6899 yuan per dollar. Oil prices extended earlier losses. U.S. crude fell 1.6 percent at $69.88 a barrel, sent lower by easing concerns about supply disruptions. Brent crude fell 1.86 percent at $73.93 per barrel. Gold prices recovered from a seven-month low on the weaker dollar. Emerging market stocks slipped - MSCI’s index fell 0.3 percent - on the softer China data while a tepid dollar boosted currencies.

2018-07-16,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Eight migrants including six children were found dead on Monday after suffocating from petrol fumes while packed into a lorry container on the west Libyan coast, authorities said. Another 90 migrants recovered from the container were in critical condition and had been taken to a local hospital for treatment, the security directorate in the town of Zuwara said in a statement. Zuwara is one of the points along Libya’s western coastline where smugglers and traffickers hold migrants before putting them on boats to try to cross to Europe. The migrants were from various sub-Saharan African and Arab countries, as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh, the statement said. They had been shut inside a refrigerated container designed for transporting meat or fish which was found just outside Zuwara, close to the Mellitah oil and gas complex. Zuwara is about 110km (68 miles) from the capital, Tripoli. “As a result of the length of time they were suffocated, eight of them died including six children, one woman and a young man,” the security directorate said, adding that gallons of petrol had been found in the container. It posted pictures of at least nine plastic jerry cans inside the container, as well as a pile of life-jackets apparently intended for use in a boat crossing. Daytime temperatures in northwest Libya have been in the mid to high 30s Celsius in recent days.  Smugglers and traffickers took advantage of Libya’s lawlessness to send hundreds of thousands of migrants to Italy over the past four years, though flows have slowed since last summer due to an Italian-backed crackdown on smuggling networks.

2018-07-16,"* All out-of-quota sugar to incur 90 pct duties * Move follows several months of losses at local mills * Government action came as a surprise to trade (Adds comment, detail on impact) By Dominique Patton and Hallie Gu BEIJING, July 16 (Reuters) - China will levy extra tariffs on out-of-quota sugar imports from all origins starting from Aug. 1, the Commerce Ministry said on Monday, just over a year after introducing hefty penalties on top growers including Brazil and Thailand. In May last year, the government hit major exporting nations with penalties on sugar shipments after years of lobbying by domestic mills. It still exempted 190 smaller producing countries and regions, mostly in Southeast Asia and South America, like in the Philippines and El Salvador. That list of exempt countries has now been cancelled, the Commerce Ministry said in a Monday statement. “Protective measures will be uniformly applied to all out-of-quota sugar imports,” it said. China allows 1.94 million tonnes of sugar imports a year at a tariff of 15 percent as part of its commitments to the World Trade Organization. Shipments outside of that allowance - out-of-quota imports - are charged a higher tariff and need special permits. Pressured by a large global surplus and rising domestic production, Chinese sugar prices have plunged this year, pushing most producers into the red and threatening China’s efforts to support millions of small farmers in the poor southern region of Guangxi and neighbouring Yunnan province. Industry officials recently called on the government to “tighten” supplies from international markets, amid rising worries that large global stocks would lead to more smuggling into China. Still, China’s move came as a surprise to most traders, who had not expected a rapid response from the government. “We expected them to take action but not so fast,” said a sugar trader with an international trading house based in Shanghai. Chinese white sugar futures touched a low of 4,797 yuan ($717.63) per tonne last week, a level not seen since 2009, and they are currently hovering at a four-year low. Production costs, though, are as much as 6,000 yuan a tonne for many mills, according to the trader with the international house. The new tariffs will have limited benefit to the domestic market this year, said Liu Hande, president of processor and trading company Guangdong Zhongqing Sugar Group Co Ltd. China has already bought up much of the sweetener available from countries that had been on the exempt list, he said, but added that the tariffs should support prices from next year. Out-of-quota imports already incur a 50 percent levy, and the protective measures added an extra 45 percent duty to those imports last year, taking the total to 95 percent. This was set to fall to 90 percent this year and 85 percent next year. Chinese importers sharply cut shipments from top supplier Brazil, after the tariffs were introduced last year. They also boosted shipments from smaller producers, some of which exported to China for the first time. Under the new measures, China could return to buying more from Brazil, said the trader, as it still needs a certain volume of imports to meet demand each year. $1 = 6.6845 Chinese yuan

The accident occurred at the Mindeli mine in Tkibuli, 200 kilometres (124 miles) west of the capital, Tbilisi, the ministry said in a statement.  It added that the accident had been caused by a pressure bump - an explosion caused by thermal pressure. Four men were transferred to a hospital. The government will close the mine until an investigation is complete and it gets the conclusions of international experts. Sixteen miners have died at the mine in different accidents since 2011. The last similar accident occurred in April this year, when six miners were killed and three were injured. “The state can’t allow putting lives and health of its own citizens under threat and therefore we had decided to close the mine,” the government said in a statement.

Financial spreadbetters expect a mixed start in Europe, with Germany’s DAX tipped to open 12 to 13 points higher at 12,562, Paris’s CAC 40 expected to rise 11 points to 5,440, and London’s FTSE 100 seen dropping 10 points to 7,659. China’s economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter of 2018, cooling from the 6.8 percent growth registered in each of the previous three quarters. While the GDP figures were in line with market expectations, the new data also showed slower-than-expected growth in China’s industrial output, pointing to slowing momentum and prompting some analysts to call for stronger government measures to support growth. Taken together, the data show an economy continuing to slow under the influence of a multi-year crackdown on excessive financial risk, even as trade war headwinds gather. But Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura, said China’s underlying economic data appeared to be robust. “I would be incredulous if China’s GDP growth could continue at the level it’s been historically,” he said. “So I think there’s always been an anticipation of some gradual slowdown, but the slowdown of the growth rate is probably less than the market really wants to believe.” He said concerns over the trade war were dragging down markets, with investors spooked by the ratcheting up of trade war tensions. “That’s why I think markets are nervous, because there’s no precedent for this type of behaviour,” he said. After briefly moving higher on early gains in China’s share markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index was 0.8 percent lower in afternoon trade, and the blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.9 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.4 percent, but the China Enterprises Index took a bigger hit, falling 1 percent. Australian shares were down 0.5 percent, and Seoul’s Kospi lost 0.4 percent. Shares in Taiwan were 0.4 percent lower. Japan’s markets are closed Monday for a holiday. The soft China data eroded a boost to sentiment from Friday’s gains on Wall Street, which were underpinned by strong profits from industrial and energy firms and had helped to take investors’ minds off the U.S.-China trade war, temporarily. U.S. stock futures touched a fresh five-month high on Monday. S&P500 e-mini futures, the world’s most liquid equity index futures, rose 0.2 percent in early Asian trade to hit their highest level since Feb. 2, before trimming gains. The dollar was flat against the yen at 112.40, and the euro was just 0.1 percent higher at $1.1697. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, turned down 0.2 percent to 94.603. Major currencies have been in a holding pattern in recent days thanks in part to a lull in the China-U.S. trade skirmish. Investors are still looking to June U.S. retail sales figures, to gauge the state of global growth. China’s yuan weakened past the key 6.7 to the dollar level following Monday’s data release, but later recovered from its losses. The yuan was changing hands at 6.6851 per dollar at around 0550 GMT. The U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated on Friday in its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to the U.S. Congress that it expected “further gradual increases” in interest rates due to “solid” economic growth. ANZ analysts said in a note on Monday that the Fed’s report “yielded few surprises,” but noted that trade tensions continue to weigh on commodity markets and U.S. consumer confidence. U.S. crude dipped 0.5 percent at $70.65 a barrel, weighed by easing concerns about supply disruptions that had pushed prices higher. Brent crude was 0.5 percent lower at $74.94 per barrel. The market is now seen shifting its view toward possible supply increases, despite a Norwegian union for workers on offshore oil and gas drilling rigs widening a six-day drilling strike on Monday. A rising dollar drove gold prices to seven-month lows on Friday, but spot gold was up 0.4 percent on Monday, trading at $1244.76 per ounce.

2018-07-16,"* Daily steel output hit record 2.67 mln T in June * Mills improved efficiency to chase bumper margins * Profit margins at mills can top 1,000 yuan/T -analysts * Mills race to boost output ahead of winter curbs * (Recasts, adds details throughout) By Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason BEIJING, July 16 (Reuters) - China’s steel mills churned out record amounts of the construction material in June as producers rushed to cash in on hefty margins, even as a trade spat between Beijing and Washington intensified. China, which accounts for half the world’s capacity, produced 80.2 million tonnes of crude steel last month, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Friday. That’s just shy of the 81.6 million tonnes the United States produced in the whole of 2017, according to World Steel Association data. June output was below May’s record 81.13 million tonnes, but June has one less day, setting a new daily average production record for a third month in a row at 2.67 million tonnes, according to Reuters’ calculations. “Steel mills were dashing to reap as much of the bumper profits as they could despite environmental checks,” said Richard Lu, analyst at CRU in Beijing. The data may further inflame a bitter Sino-U.S. trade row. The United States and Europe have accused China of exporting its surplus metal cheap, hurting international rivals. China’s steel exports rose last month to 6.94 million tonnes, their highest since July 2017, even after Washington imposed import duties to protect U.S. industries. The production increase also comes as China has shuttered some mills to help curb choking pollution and ramped up environmental inspections, suggesting that newer mills have ramped up operations to cash in on fat margins. China’s steel output in the first half rose 6 percent to 451.2 million tonnes. Steel prices have soared over the past year due to firm demand and on concerns about tightening supplies of metal, used in construction and automotives, as Beijing seeks to close inefficient mills and clamps down on smoke-stack industries to clean the nation’s skies. Lu estimated that mills were earning a profit margin of about 800 yuan ($119.50) per tonne of steel, while analysts at Huatai Futures put profit margins for mills in northern China at over 1,000 yuan a tonne, one of the highest on record. Monthly utilisation rates at mills reached 71.6 percent in June, the highest since October before winter production curbs had taken effect, according to Reuters calculation based on data from Mysteel consultancy. Analysts say it’s not clear if China will continue its record-setting run. Some particularly smoggy cities and provinces are also implementing ad hoc measures to beat bouts of pollution. Last week, top steelmaking city Tangshan ordered mills to cut production for 6 weeks over summer. “Steel output may not necessarily go down even though stricter restrictions are on the way,” said Lu. “Steel mills in Xuzhou city could reopen soon, which will to some extent offset the production curbs in Tangshan.” Producers are also racing to make as much metal as possible before a new round of production curbs are imposed in November ahead of China’s winter, when pollution is at its worst. Last winter, government forced mills and heavy industry in 28 of the most polluted northern cities to shut up to half of their capacity between November and March. More are expected to adopt similar curbs this winter. ($1 = 6.6946 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason; editing by Richard

2018-07-16,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan -0.3 pct * Shanghai Composite -0.5 pct, CSI300 -0.5 pct * China Q2 data shows slowing growth, weaker industrial output By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, July 16 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Monday as new data showed China’s economy slowed slightly in the second quarter, compounded by fears of a full-scale Sino-U.S. trade war looming over markets. Official data showed China’s economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter of 2018, cooling from the 6.8 percent growth registered in each of the previous three quarters. While the GDP figures were in line with market expectations, the new data also showed slower-than-expected growth in China’s industrial output, pointing to slowing momentum and prompting some analysts to call for stronger government measures to support growth. Taken together, the data show an economy continuing to slow under the influence of a multi-year crackdown on excessive financial risk, even as trade war headwinds gather. But Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura, said China’s underlying economic data “appears to be quite robust”. “I would be incredulous if China’s GDP growth could continue at the level it’s been historically. So I think there’s always been an anticipation of some gradual slowdown, but the slowdown of the growth rate is probably less than the market really wants to believe,” he said. He said concerns over the trade war were dragging down markets, with investors spooked by the ratcheting up of trade war tensions. “That’s why I think markets are nervous, because there’s no precedent for this type of behaviour,” he said. After briefly moving higher on early gains in China’s share markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index and the blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down less than 0.1 percent, but the China Enterprises Index took a bigger hit, falling 0.6 percent. Australian shares were down 0.3 percent, and Seoul’s Kospi lost 0.1 percent. Shares in Taiwan were mostly flat. Japan’s markets are closed for a holiday. The soft China data undermined a boost to sentiment from Friday’s gains on Wall Street, which were underpinned by strong profits from industrial and energy firms and helped offset investor concerns over the U.S.-China trade war. U.S. stock futures touched a fresh five-month high on Monday. S&P500 e-mini futures, the world’s most liquid equity index futures, rose 0.2 percent in early Asian trade to hit their highest level since Feb. 2. Around 0335 GMT, S&P500 e-mini futures were up 0.1 percent at 2806.25. The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.48 . The euro was flat on the day at $1.1681, and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was also flat at 94.740. Major currencies have been in a holding pattern in recent days thanks in part to a lull in China-U.S. trade skirmishing. Investors had also been awaiting the China data, and are still looking to June U.S. retail sales figures, to gauge the state of global growth. The U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated on Friday in its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to the U.S. Congress that it expected “further gradual increases” in interest rates due to “solid” economic growth. ANZ analysts said in a note Monday that the Fed’s report “yielded few surprises,” but noted that trade tensions continue to weigh on commodity markets and U.S. consumer confidence. U.S. crude dipped 0.5 percent at $70.69 a barrel, weighed by easing concerns about supply disruptions that had pushed prices higher. Brent crude was 0.5 percent lower at $74.895 per barrel. A rising dollar drove gold prices to seven-month lows on Friday, but spot gold was up 0.2 percent on Monday, trading at $1243.46 per ounce.

2018-07-16,"* State oil majors led refinery run increase * Teapots struggle with higher prices, taxes * June gas output lowest in nine months (Adds comment in fourth paragraph) BEIJING, July 16 (Reuters) - China’s refinery runs rose in June as state-controlled oil majors boosted output of fuel products, offsetting cuts by teapots which carried out annual repairs and curbed operations due to high crude prices, data showed on Monday. Refinery throughput in June rose 8 percent from a year ago to 49.78 million tonnes, or 12.11 million barrels per day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Runs rose 1.5 percent from May on a daily basis. The higher refinery run rate was led by state-owned oil refiners while private refiners reduced their processing as higher oil prices, and the more stringent enforcement of consumption taxes, cut their margins, analysts said. “Teapots cut runs in June due to the less favourable market conditions,” said Zhou Guoxia, crude analyst with JLC. China’s independent refiners, also known as teapots, last month were losing an average of 300 yuan ($44.89) for each tonne of crude oil processed, data provided Zibo Longzong Information Group showed. For the first half of the year, refinery runs were 299.6 million tonnes, up 8.9 percent from a year ago. Natural gas production in June rose 5.6 percent from a year ago to 12.2 billion cubic meters (bcm). That was down 3.3 percent from May and the lowest since September. Output for the first half of the year was 77.5 bcm, up 4.6 percent. June crude oil production fell 2.3 percent from a year ago to 15.85 million tonnes. That was down from 15.97 million tonnes in May. Year-to-date output was 94.09 million tonnes, down 2 percent from a year earlier.

2018-07-16,"* June aluminium production at 2.83 million tonnes * Non-ferrous output at 4.62 million tonnes in June (Adds detail, background) BEIJING, July 16 (Reuters) - China’s aluminium output in June rose 1.6 percent from the previous month to 2.83 million tonnes, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday, as a gradual ramp-up of new smelting capacity raised production. On a daily basis, the world’s top aluminium producer churned out 94,000 tonnes of the metal last month, compared with 90,000 tonnes in May, which had one extra day, according to Reuters calculations based on the data. {nL4N1TG1JK] The daily figure is the highest since June 2017 and the second-highest ever, according to Reuters records based on NBS data on its website. However, the NBS said on Monday that June output was up 0.8 percent year-on-year. The data released in June 2017 preceded orders to close illegal smelting capacity in eastern China’s Shandong province, as well as environmental restrictions on output in the autumn and winter seasons. The NBS may be using a revised figure for its year-ago comparison that has not been updated on its website, which still shows June 2017 output at 2.93 million tonnes, or 97,666 tonnes per day. Shanghai aluminium prices fell by 4.1 percent in June, squeezing smelters’ margins, but a favourable price arbitrage to international markets saw exports rise to 510,000 tonnes, the second-highest figure on record, according to data released on July 13. Jackie Wang, an analyst at CRU in Beijing, said production rose because of the recent launch of new smelting capacity in the Guangxi, Inner Mongolia and Shanxi regions rather than any incentive to export aluminium products. However, the ramp-ups “are much slower than people’s expectations,” she added. In the first six months of the year, China produced 16.47 million tonnes of aluminium, a rise of 1.6 percent from the same period last year, the NBS data showed. Production of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminium, lead, zinc and nickel – rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier to 4.62 million tonnes in June, the highest level since December. Year-to-date output was up 3.1 percent at 26.85 million tonnes. The other non-ferrous metals are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.

2018-07-16,"SEOUL, July 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday as concerns about supply disruptions eased and Libyan ports resumed export activities, while traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other oil producers. Brent crude futures were down 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $75.07 a barrel at 0057 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $70.74 a barrel. Supply outages in Libya and strike action in Norway and Iraq pushed oil prices higher late last week, although prices still ended down for a second straight week. “Crude oil prices fell as fears of supply disruptions eased. News that Libya’s state oil producer had restarted output from a major oil field ignited the selloff earlier in the week,” ANZ Bank said in a note. The market focus shifted towards possible supply increases, even as a Norwegian union for workers on offshore oil and gas drilling rigs stepped up a six-day strike. Russia and other major oil producers may increase output further should supply shortages hit the global oil market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA, said U.S.-China trade tensions “should subside this week and could be a possible plus for oil prices,” but a possible sale of U.S. oil reserves would weigh on prices. “With the Trump administration actively considering tapping into the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it could weigh negatively,” Innes said. The United States holds a reserve of about 660 million barrels, and the Trump administration was considering drawing on the country’s oil reserve, which would increase supply, according to a Bloomberg report. Meanwhile, the number of rigs drilling in the United States remained unchanged at 863 in the week to July 13 as the rate of the growth slowed amid a fall in crude prices.

2018-07-16,"SHANGHAI, July 16 (Reuters) - Asian shares were lower on Monday, brushing off the firmer Wall Street lead as investor caution dominated ahead of the release of key Chinese economic data, which is expected to show signs of a slowdown. But while broader concerns about the U.S.-China trade war continue to temper risk appetite, the absence of any escalation of rhetoric out of Beijing or Washington over the past few days is helping support sentiment, as are strong earnings from industrial firms on Wall Street. China is set to release second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) figures on Monday at 0200 GMT, which, along with June industrial output, are expected to show a modest slowdown in economic growth. A government effort to rein in financial risk and an escalating trade war with the United States are expected to dent China’s economic growth prospects.
