2019-01-12,"GWADAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to set up a $10 billion oil refinery in Pakistan’s deepwater port of Gwadar, the Saudi energy minister said on Saturday, speaking at the Indian Ocean port that is being developed with the help of China. Pakistan wants to attract investment and other financial support to tackle a soaring current account deficit caused partly by rising oil prices. Last year, Saudi Arabia offered Pakistan a $6 billion package that included help to finance crude imports. “Saudi Arabia wants to make Pakistan’s economic development stable through establishing an oil refinery and partnership with Pakistan in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor,” Saudi Energy Khalid al-Falih told reporters in Gwadar. He said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman would visit Pakistan in February to sign the agreement. The minister added that Saudi Arabia would also invest in other sectors. Beijing has pledged $60 billion as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that involves building power stations, major highways, new and upgraded railways and higher capacity ports, to help turn Pakistan into a major overland route linking western China to the world. “With setting up of an oil refinery in Gwadar, Saudi Arabia will become an important partner in CPEC,” Pakistan Petroleum Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said. The Saudi news agency SPA earlier reported that Falih met Pakistan’s petroleum minister and Maritime Affairs Minister Ali Zaidi in Gwadar to discuss cooperation in refining, petrochemicals, mining and renewable energy. It said Falih would finalize arrangements ahead of signing memorandums of understanding. Since the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan came to power in August, Pakistan has secured economic assistance packages from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China. In November, Pakistan extended talks with the International Monetary Fund as it seeks its 13th bailout since the late 1980s to deal with a looming balance of payments crisis. The Pakistani prime minister’s office had said on Thursday that Islamabad expected to sign investment agreements with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in coming weeks.

2019-01-12,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s chief justice will face trial on Monday for allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules, the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) said on Saturday, a month before a presidential election in Africa’s most populous country. Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen is the head of Nigeria’s judiciary, which plays a key role in election matters and has helped resolve disputes in past votes. The conduct tribunal, which tries asset-declaration misdemeanors, said in a statement on Saturday that Onnoghen would face six separate counts, without giving further details. Onnoghen could not be reached for comment. Under Nigerian law, state officials must declare their assets before taking office and after they leave. The court did not say why it had brought the charges against Onnoghen almost two years into his tenure. The Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the ruling party of plotting to destabilize the judiciary ahead of elections by seeking to remove Onnoghen, which could cause a constitutional crisis. Nigerians go to the polls on Feb. 16 to elect a new president in an election where incumbent Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term and is campaigning on his anti-corruption record. In 2016, the tribunal charged the Senate President Bukola Saraki, the country’s third most-powerful politician, for false asset declaration. Saraki was later cleared of wrongdoing.

2019-01-12,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The chief justice of Brazil’s Supreme Court has restored a presidential decree regulating how state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) can carry out an ambitious divestment program meant to reduce the company’s significant debt.  Judge Dias Toffoli’s decision, signed on Friday, overturned an injunction issued by a colleague last month. Toffoli’s ruling should hold until Feb. 27, when the full Supreme Court will hear the case. The December injunction, following a lawsuit filed by the opposition Workers Party, raised doubts about the ability of Petrobras, as the company is known, to carry out the divestments as planned. Petrobras is planning asset sales of $26.9 billion over the next five years, according to a strategic outlook released late last year.

2019-01-12,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The mood at Latin America’s largest wholesale market, the Central de Abastos in Mexico City, has morphed from typically cacophonous and bustling to cloudy and anxious as deliveries and sales grow sluggish amid a days-long fuel shortage. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador late last month launched a sweeping plan to stanch rampant fuel theft, the first major move of his young administration against widespread corruption and organised crime. But the move to close key fuel pipelines that have been tapped by criminals and instead re-route distribution via trucks has prompted hours-long lines at gas stations, while threatening to crimp the economy and damage the president’s popularity if shortages persist. The effects of the crackdown have grown noticeably in the past week. At the Central de Abastos, where 62,000 cars and trucks converge daily to buy and sell fruits, plants and other goods, according to figures provided by the market, vendors say many have been staying home. “Forty to 50 percent of supply has been affected,” said Rafael Perez, 43, the purchasing director for Drinks Depot, a beverages wholesaler. “We are talking about suppliers from [the states of] Hidalgo, Guerrero, Cuernavaca, Puebla and Tlaxcala.”     “Our suppliers’ deliveries have been impacted,” Perez added. “Customers are not coming.”  Avocado vendor Juan Carlos Ximil, 35, said he had seen a drop of about 30 to 40 percent in sales of his stock, which he normally purchases from suppliers outside the capital, including Morelos, Edomex and the avocado-producing state of Michoacan. His customers, modest street-side vendors and grocery stores with limited means of transport, have stayed away too, he said, most likely because fears of long waits to stock up on gasoline, or a shortage itself, would hit hard at their carefully calibrated daily routines. “I feel like, more than a shortage, there is a kind of collective panic,” said Ximil. “If you were used to consuming 200 pesos ($10.45) of gas you go and load up even if you don’t need it, for fear that you’ll run out.” Reporting by Sharay Angulo in Mexico City; Writing by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Delphine Schrank and Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-theft/mexico-citys-massive-wholesale-market-quiets-amid-fuel-shortage-idUKL1N1ZC02Q,12 Jan 2019,"The mood at Latin America's
