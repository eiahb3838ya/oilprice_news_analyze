2018-06-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields jumped and Wall Street reversed earlier gains to close lower on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and signalled that two more hikes could be coming this year.  Ten-year U.S. Treasury note yields hit a one-week high, while two-year note yields rose to a three-week peak after the Fed’s decision to raise its benchmark overnight lending rate a quarter of a percentage point, to a range between 1.75 percent and 2 percent. Policymakers also projected a slightly faster pace of rate increases in the coming months, with two additional hikes expected by the end of this year, compared to one previously. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RJR last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.9774 percent, from 2.957 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RJR last fell 3/32 in price to yield 3.0967 percent, from 3.092 percent Tuesday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, .DOXY fell 0.24 percent, with the euro EURO= up 0.41 percent to $1.1791. “There was some question about the December rate hike and it looks like the Fed is sticking to that plan and I would say this is a very mild negative for risk markets,” said Matthew Forester, chief investment officer at Lockwood Advisors Inc in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  “Each rate hike becomes more difficult for the risk markets and the real economy to digest.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 119.53 points, or 0.47 percent, to 25,201.2, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 11.22 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,775.63 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 8.10 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,695.70. The losses came on a day Wall Street had opened slightly in the black, after a court approved AT&T’s (T.N) $85-billion takeover of Time Warner TWX.N after the closing bell on Tuesday. Time Warner shares jumped 1.73 percent after approval of the AT&T deal, which is expected to trigger other corporate takeovers, and AT&T dropped 2.13 percent. Focus now turns to policy meetings later this week at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.  “The Fed isn’t the biggest player here,” said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. “If the ECB or the Bank of Japan begin tightening it’ll have a bigger impact than the Fed.” Trade tensions are also weighing on markets, as the U.S. prepares to unveil more tariffs on $50 billion (£37.4 billion) worth of Chinese goods. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.09 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.26 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.61 percent. Trade tensions were pressuring the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, which bounced back and forth against the U.S. dollar, last gaining 0.18 percent and 0.22 percent, respectively, versus the greenback.  Oil prices, which had started the day in the red, settled higher after a report by the Energy Information Administration indicated U.S. crude inventories fell more than anticipated last week and gasoline and distillate stocks surprised with declines. U.S. crude CLc1 settled up 0.42 percent, at $66.64 per barrel, while Brent LCOc1 gained 1.13 percent on the day, settling at $76.74. “The demand metrics here are amazing for crude oil and gasoline,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. “Put the exports of crude on top of that, and it’s just a really bullish report.” Italian government bonds were in demand, as well, after Paolo Savona, the country’s new EU Affairs Minister, said the euro was “indispensable.”  The comments by Savona, who has previously expressed hostile views on the euro, followed statements earlier in the week by Italy’s new coalition government that it had no plans to leave the euro zone. In another reminder of the danger of trade disputes, shares in Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp (0763.HK) fell as much as 41.5 percent, wiping $3 billion off its market value, as it resumed trade after agreeing to pay up to $1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government.

2018-06-13,"PARIS (Reuters) - French farmers began lifting a blockade of refineries and fuel depots on Wednesday after unions made progress in talks with the government over competition from cheaper imports, including palm oil. The protests, which blocked 18 sites in France and led to some petrol stations running dry, were triggered by France’s decision to allow oil and gas major Total (TOTF.PA) to use imported palm oil at a biofuel plant, a cheaper alternative to biodiesel made from locally produced oilseed crops. That soured already-fragile relations between the European Union’s biggest farm sector and the government of President Emmanuel Macron. Negotiations between the FNSEA union that called the protest and French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert to resolve the dispute progressed on Wednesday after he sent the union a draft letter in the morning responding to some of their demands.   “We have made breakthroughs and many meetings are lined up (with the minister). We’re going to ask our members to suspend with immediate effect their blockade of the different sites,” Jeremy Decerle, leader of the FNSEA’s young farmers section, told reporters.     Travert called on Total to increase the share of locally grown rapeseed it would use as a feedstock at its La Mede biofuel refinery on the south coast, although he reiterated the government’s refusal to go back on the palm oil authorisation. Total has already committed to use less than 300,000 tonnes of crude palm oil per year at its La Mede biofuel refinery out of a total processing capacity of 650,000 tonnes, and to use 50,000 tonnes of locally grown rapeseed. “We would like Total to go beyond these 50,000 tonnes,” Travert told reporters. “What we are asking the Total group to do is to work with the rapeseed sector to develop supply contracts.” Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne is due to meet President Macron later this week. Junior ecology minister Sebastien Lecornu has also proposed France call for the EU to cap and progressively cut palm oil imports. However, FNSEA chief Christiane Lambert, who had initially refused to end the blockades after late-night talks on Tuesday, warned farmers wanted to see progress on a range of issues, including red tape and taxes. “We’re calling a suspension because we’re talking about issues that can’t be resolved in the blink of an eye,” she told the news conference.  “If we don’t have meetings in the coming weeks over the points that need resolving, we will come back.” Total said it expected the blockade, which had started on Sunday, to be over by Thursday. The group’s French refineries were not impacted by the protests but 145 of its 2,200 petrol stations across the country saw fuel outages, a spokesman said.

2018-06-13,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) was fined one billion euros ($1.18 billion) over diesel emissions cheating in what amounts to one of the highest ever fines imposed by German authorities against a company, public prosecutors said on Wednesday.   The German fine follows a U.S. plea agreement from January 2017 when VW agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve criminal and civil penalties for installing illegal software in diesel engines to cheat strict U.S. anti-pollution tests.  “Following thorough examination, Volkswagen AG accepted the fine and it will not lodge an appeal against it. Volkswagen AG, by doing so, admits its responsibility for the diesel crisis and considers this as a further major step toward the latter being overcome,” it said in a statement. The fine is the latest blow to Germany’s auto industry which cannot seem to catch a break from the diesel emissions crisis. Germany’s government on Monday ordered Daimler to recall nearly 240,000 cars fitted with illicit emissions-control devices, part of a total of 774,000 models affected in Europe as a whole. Munich prosecutors this week widened an emissions cheating probe into VW’s luxury brand Audi to include Chief Executive Rupert Stadler among the suspects accused of fraud and false advertising. The prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig imposed the fine against VW on Wednesday for organizational deficiencies which failed to prevent “impermissible software functions” from being installed in 10.7 million cars between 2007 and 2015. The fine did not address any civil claims or claims by vehicle owners, the prosecutor’s office said in its statement. It does, however, end regulatory offence proceedings against Volkswagen, which the Wolfsburg-based carmaker said would help to settle further administrative proceedings against VW in Europe. VW shares closed 0.1 percent higher at 159.78 euros. VW is far from being out of the woods. The carmaker’s new chief executive, Herbert Diess, and the group’s chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch are still being investigated by Braunschweig prosecutors for suspected market manipulation. Poetsch, also CEO of VW’s majority stakeholder Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE), is separately being investigated by prosecutors in Stuttgart over the same suspicions. “Courts will now hardly be able to dismiss consumer complaints,” said Jan-Eike Andresen of platform MyRight which has mandated U.S. law firm Hausfeld to pursue civil claims. Hausfeld represents aggrieved VW owners and shareholders on both sides of the Atlantic. Wednesday’s fine was not included in the 25.8 billion euros of provisions that VW set aside for the diesel cheating scandal, and would hit earnings, analysts at Evercore ISI said.  Volkswagen said it held a management board meeting to discuss the latest development in its emissions crisis with members of the supervisory board also being informed. Further steps would be taken to overcome the diesel cheating scandal and to restore trust in the company, Diess said. Finance chief Frank Witter will update investors on Aug. 1 on the implications of the fine for the carmaker’s cash position, alongside its second-quarter results, VW said. “Paying out 1 billion euros is extreme painful but in the broader context it isn’t a material number,” Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said, citing VW’s 24.3 billion-euro net cash position after the first quarter.

2018-06-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for major oil companies on Wednesday urged a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit filed by New York City seeking to hold them financially liable for damages caused by global warming. Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron Corp(CVX.N), said at a hearing before U.S. District Judge John Keenan in Manhattan that the lawsuit, filed in January, was an attempt to hold the oil companies liable for carbon emissions all over the world since the industrial revolution. “They’re basically asking the court to recognise a tort that would hold (the oil companies) responsible for the way civilization and humankind have developed over the ages,” Boutrous said. The city sued Chevron, BP Plc(BP.L), ConocoPhillips(COP.N), Exxon Mobil Corp(XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc(RDSa.L) in January, announcing at the same time that it intended to divest fossil fuel investments from its $189 billion (£141.5 billion) public pension funds over the next five years. The city said the companies knew for years that carbon emissions caused global warming, yet they promoted fossil fuels while pushing public relations efforts to discredit science on the risks of climate change. The city said it must spend billions of dollars to safeguard against flooding and other hazards of global warming, and is seeking money damages. Boutrous argued at the hearing that the city was wrong to bring claims under state law because federal law governs carbon emissions. He also argued that a court would be unable to decide the complicated political considerations that go into addressing global warming. “Global warming is a very important issue. It’s a thorny problem,” Boutros said. “Lawsuits are not the way to deal with this.” Matthew Pawa, a lawyer for the city, said the oil companies had contributed to a “public nuisance” under state law, defined as “an unreasonable interference with rights common to the public.” He denied that the lawsuit sought to hold the companies liable for emissions going back centuries, saying the city only claimed they became liable once they knew of fossil fuels’ risks. “The liability would go back as far as the intentionality goes,” he said. Keenan asked both sides’ lawyers whether the city could hold the oil companies liable, given that it used fossil fuels itself. Boutrous agreed that could be an issue, while Pawa said it was not grounds for dismissing the case. The judge did not make a decision at the hearing.

Ten-year notes yielded a one-week high, while two-year note yields rose to a three-week peak after the Fed’s decision to raise its benchmark overnight lending rate a quarter of a percentage point, to a range between 1.75 percent and 2 percent. Policymakers also projected a slightly faster pace of rate increases in the coming months, with two additional hikes expected by the end of this year, compared to one previously. “The labour market has continued to strengthen ... economic activity has been rising at a solid rate,” the Fed’s rate-setting committee said in unanimous statement after the end of a two-day meeting. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.9903 percent, from 2.957 percent late on Tuesday.

2018-06-13,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in May, leading to the biggest annual gain in nearly 6-1/2 years, the latest sign of a gradual building up of inflation pressures. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a second time this year on Wednesday and forecast two more rate hikes. The U.S. central bank noted that overall and underlying inflation measures had moved closer to its 2 percent goal. “The Fed is on the right course with its gradual pace of rate hikes because the inflation heat may yet lead to fire and the risk that monetary policy has to move faster and put the long economic recovery in jeopardy,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.5 percent last month, boosted by a surge in gasoline prices and continued gains in the cost of services, the Labor Department said. The PPI edged up 0.1 percent in April. In the 12 months through May, the PPI increased 3.1 percent, the largest advance since January 2012. Producer prices rose 2.6 percent year-on-year in April.  Economists had forecast the PPI gaining 0.3 percent from the prior month and rising 2.8 percent from a year ago. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services nudged up 0.1 percent last month. The so-called core PPI rose by the same margin in April. In the 12 months through May, the core PPI rose 2.6 percent after advancing 2.5 percent in April. The renewed upward trend in producer prices strengthens expectations that inflation will pick up this year.  The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.8 percent year-on-year in April after a similar gain in March.  New projections from Fed officials on Wednesday indicated that the core PCE price index would slightly run above the 2 percent target. The dollar reversed losses against a basket of currencies following the Fed’s rate decision while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street fell marginally. Regional factory surveys have shown an acceleration in raw material prices this year. So far, manufacturers have not passed on these higher costs to consumers. A worsening worker shortage is expected to push up wages. This together with expensive raw materials will likely squeeze profit margins and probably force businesses to raise prices.  A report on Tuesday showed monthly consumer prices rising moderately in May. In May, prices for goods surged 1.0 percent, accounting for 60 percent of the rise in the PPI. Goods prices were unchanged  in April. In May, they were boosted by a 9.8 percent jump in the price of gasoline. Wholesale gasoline prices slipped 0.4 percent in April.  Prices for steel mill products surged 4.3 percent in May, the largest rise since February 2011, likely reflecting steel and aluminium import tariffs imposed in March by the Trump administration. The cost of these products could rise further after the government this month widened the duties to imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. “The inflation impact of the steel and aluminium tariffs, though likely moderate, will be more visible in the second half of this year,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Wholesale food prices edged up 0.1 percent last month after declining 1.1 percent in April. Excluding food and energy, goods prices increased 0.3 percent, rising by the same margin for a third straight month. The cost of services increased 0.3 percent after nudging up 0.1 percent in April. Services were driven by a 0.9 percent rise in margins for trade services.   The cost of healthcare services ticked up 0.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent in April. Those costs feed into the core PCE price index. Economists said factoring in the PPI and CPI data, they expected the monthly core PCE price index rose 0.2 percent in May, which would push the annual increase to 1.9 percent. “Medical care pricing looked weak in May, but we see firmness in other inputs related to used vehicle prices, airfares, and prices for various financial services,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The Commerce Department will publish May PCE inflation data on June 29.

2018-06-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices turned positive on Wednesday after a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories along with surprise drawdowns in gasoline and distillates indicated strong demand in the world’s top oil consumer.  Earlier in the session, Brent and U.S. crude futures had retreated on concerns about rising production in the United States and expectations that OPEC and other producers could relax voluntary output cuts when they meet on June 22-23 in Vienna. Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 86 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $76.74 a barrel and U.S. crude CLc1 closed 28 cents, 0.4 percent, higher at $66.64 a barrel. Late in the session, crude prices slipped slightly as     the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, a move that was widely expected but still marked a milestone in the U.S. central bank’s shift from policies used to battle the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. Higher interest rates strengthen the dollar, increasing the cost of commodities including oil for buyers using other currencies. U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell 4.1 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, exceeding analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.7 million barrels.[EIA/S] Estimated U.S. gasoline demand hit a record high of 9.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week, the data showed. “The demand metrics here are amazing for crude oil and gasoline,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. “Put the exports of crude on top of that, and it’s just a really bullish report.” U.S. crude production rose to 10.9 million bpd last week, according to the EIA, but Kilduff said the market appeared able to absorb the increase. “It seems like we need almost every barrel of that to keep up with this refining demand.” With output in Russia rising back above 11 million bpd in June and Saudi production climbing to more than 10 million bpd, supplies from all three top producers are increasing.   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers, including Russia, started pumping less in 2017 to reduce a global crude glut. Prices have risen around 60 percent over the last year. “More oil from OPEC plus is the base case,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, analyst at Swedish bank SEB. “Saudi Arabia and Russia have already started to lift production,” he said. “Unofficial sources have said Russia will propose to return production back to the October 2016 (level), i.e. removing the cap altogether over a period of three months.” U.S. President Donald Trump and Iran exchanged sharp words over oil prices, with Trump blaming OPEC for high oil prices and Tehran accusing him of stoking volatility after he withdrew last month from a global nuclear arms deal with Iran. Longer term, the market could tighten as demand increases if OPEC fails to cover supply shortfalls, the International Energy Agency said. [IEA/M] The IEA said it expects global oil demand to grow 1.4 million bpd this year, and in 2019, and will top 100 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2018. “The market will be finely balanced next year, and vulnerable to prices rising higher in the event of further disruption,” the IEA said in its monthly report. Fund manager Pierre Andurand at Andurand Capital was bullish. “Prices will be above $150 in less than two years,” he tweeted.

2018-06-13,"June 13 (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp’s Columbia Gas Transmission (TCO) unit said it was working on a section of the Leach Xpress natural gas pipeline downstream of a pipe blast in West Virginia last week. That work will enable the Stagecoach-Leach Xpress meter in southeast Ohio to return to service, according to a notice to customers late Tuesday. The Stagecoach meter in Monroe County on the Ohio-West Virginia border connects to EQT Midstream Partners LP’s Strike Force South gathering fields in Monroe and Belmont counties in Ohio. Strike Force can also deliver to Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Rover and Enbridge Inc’s Texas Eastern Transmission (Tetco) pipelines. Columbia Gas said all other meters affected by the blast will remain at zero until the pipeline returns to service. The company said did not say when the full pipe would return to service, noting the site of the incident is in the restoration process. Columbia Gas told customers it will provide an update on the status of the pipe on June 18. The shutdown of Leach Xpress forced producers using the line to find other pipes to ship their gas out of the Marcellus and Utica shale regions of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Alternative pipelines include ETP’s Rover, Tallgrass Energy Partners LP’s Rockies Express (REX), EQT Midstream Partners LP’s Equitrans and Enbridge’s Tetco, according to analysts at S&P Global Platts. Columbia Gas, which declared a force majeure after the blast, said the damaged section of pipe could affect movement of about 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd). One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Energy analysts said overall output in the Appalachian region was little changed by the blast as producers, like Range Resources Corp and Southwestern Energy Co, found other pipes. Appalachian output rose from 27.5 bcfd on June 7, the day of the blast, to 27.7 bcfd over the weekend before easing to 27.3 bcfd on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters data. The 1.5-bcfd Leach Xpress in West Virginia and Ohio, which entered full service at the start of this year, transports Marcellus and Utica shale gas to consumers in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast. The 12,000-mile (19,312-km) Columbia pipeline system, which TransCanada acquired in 2016, serves millions of customers from New York to the Gulf of Mexico.

2018-06-13,"WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Iran exchanged sharp words over oil prices on Wednesday, with Trump blaming OPEC for high oil prices and Tehran accusing him of stoking volatility after he withdrew last month from a global nuclear arms deal with Iran.  Trump sparked the latest back-and-forth when he renewed his attack on OPEC in a tweet that said oil prices are too high and that the cartel was “at it again.” Oil prices have risen around 60 percent over the last year after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers, including Russia, started reducing supplies in 2017. The cartel meets June 22-23 in Vienna, and producers are seen as likely to raise production, perhaps before the limits are due to sunset at year-end. Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, fired back at Trump in a statement to Reuters. “You cannot place sanctions on two OPEC founder members and still blame OPEC for oil price volatility,” he said, referring to his country and Venezuela. “This is business, Mr. President - we thought you knew it.”    The oil supply deal is set to continue through the end of 2018, but plans for its continuation were unclear. The calculus changed after Trump announced in May that Washington was pulling out of the 2015 deal that restricted Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the removal of sanctions.  The U.S. move has pressured European and Asian clients to stop importing Iranian oil or doing business with the country. Saudi Arabia, Iran’s rival and OPEC’s largest producer, and Russia, the world’s largest producer and a party to the deal, have already increased supply. Saudi Arabia supported Trump’s decision to exit the Iran nuclear agreement. “I think the Trump tweet makes the Saudis’ job of getting compromise at the OPEC meeting tougher,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Potomac Research in Washington. Saudi production rose to 10.03 million barrels per day (bpd in May, in line with deal quotas, according to OPEC data. Russia’s production was 11.1 million barrels a day in the beginning of June, exceeding its quota, according to sources familiar with the matter. The price of Brent crude peaked in May at $80.50 a barrel, then pulled back, trading on Wednesday near $77 at barrel, partly in anticipation that the deal may end. U.S. crude traded Wednesday near $67 a barrel. “Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!” Trump wrote in his post on Twitter after last raising the issue in April.  The potential for OPEC to boost production has raised concerns about the cartel’s limited spare capacity, which could fall to as low as 2 million bpd. This would make it harder to respond to a supply shock, such as in Venezuela, where output has declined to a 33-year-low due to an economic crisis. “OPEC has the lowest spare capacity ever right now,” said fund manager Pierre Andurand, in a tweeted response to Trump. “There is going to be a real issue,” he wrote, predicting prices above $150 per barrel within two years.  In the United States, gasoline pump prices nationwide have risen to near $3 a gallon during the peak summer travel season, still less than the $4 a gallon during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. Gasoline demand has remained strong, rising to an estimated 9.9 million bpd as of last week, according to U.S. Energy Department data.  Trump sent his tweet hours after returning to Washington from a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Separately, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives was pushing legislation that would subject OPEC to U.S. antitrust law and fight what the group called artificial production controls.  The measure would have to pass the full House and the U.S. Senate before Trump could sign it into law. Past presidents have not supported similar bills when they have been proposed.

2018-06-13,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iranian-backed militia chief Hadi al-Amiri’s decision to choose compromise over confrontation and strike an alliance, aiming to form the next Iraqi government,  has eased tensions after elections marred by fraud allegations. Sadr’s bloc scored a stunning victory in the May 12 parliamentary election by tapping growing public discontent with neighbouring Iran’s sway in Iraq and promising to deliver what past governments have not: jobs, better services and stability. But beneath the surface there were fears that regional power Tehran, which before the vote said it would never let Sadr govern, would sabotage the mercurial cleric and set the stage for a showdown that could turn bloody. In the end, an alliance has emerged of strange bed-fellows: Sadr who portrays himself as a nationalist and Amiri, Iran’s most powerful ally in Iraq whose grouping came second. Their choice of pragmatism has lowered the risk of violence among Iraq’s Shi’ite majority after a costly conflict war with the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State. Sadr is treading cautiously, aware that Iran has manipulated Iraqi politics in its favour in the past and of Tehran’s vast sway in its most important Arab ally. In a 2010 election, Vice President Ayad Allawi’s bloc won the most seats but he was prevented from becoming prime minister, blaming Iranian manoeuvring. “If he (Sadr) insisted on fighting everyone at the same time he would be outmanoeuvred, and the pressure of a re-run of the elections was too much,” said a Western diplomat in Baghdad. Tehran, which has thrived amid Iraqi Shi’ite rivalries in the past by acting as a broker, has its own motivations. Sadr’s alliance with Amiri, announced in the holy Shi’ite city of Najaf to project a sense of unity, gives Tehran more leverage over the formation of Iraq’s next government.  Amiri, who spent two decades fighting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein from Iran and speaks Farsi fluently, is one of the most powerful figures in Iraq.  His Badr Organisation controls the interior ministry and he played a decisive role in the battle against Islamic State.  “Amiri had the momentum behind him especially in this election, this is an opportunity for him,” said Hassan Hassan, senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.    “He is fresh off the field, very popular in some circles.”   Amiri is close to Major General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards who has great influence in Iraq. Soleimani was in Iraq this week, a second Western diplomat in Baghdad said, adding that it is likely that he advised Amiri to ally with Sadr, who recently met Iran’s ambassador. The Iranians have decided they must accept Sadr, the diplomat said, and he will have in turn realised he must work with Amiri to safeguard his victory. Shunning Amiri could make life difficult for Sadr. His foe, former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, is still in the picture despite being forced out of office and widely blamed for Islamic State’s seizure of a third of Iraq. In 2008, Maliki ordered a crackdown on forces loyal to Sadr in the Shi’ite heartland.   According to the first diplomat who recently met Sadr, he  felt pressured and feared his victory was going to vanish. Acting on what Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said were widespread violations, a parliament stacked with lawmakers who failed to retain their seats mandated a nationwide recount.  Some politicians said the election should be repeated. Abadi seemed to lose the most out of the alliance, diplomats and analysts said. Even though he has balanced the interests of Iran and the United States, who compete for influence in Iraq, his bloc has yet to join any coalition.  He may yet win a second term as a compromise candidate, albeit as a much weaker premier, beholden to Sadr and Amiri. Iran does not seem worried about the uncertainty but is under growing pressure to preserve its interests in the Middle East especially in Iraq. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a nuclear deal with Tehran then engaged nuclear state North Korea, increasing Tehran’s isolation.  In Yemen, Houthi forces aligned with Iran face the biggest offensive from a Saudi-led coalition in the three-year conflict, part of a regional proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran. “There is a certain element of pragmatism in Iran on foreign policy,” said Renad Mansour, research fellow at Chatham House in London. “Iran does not want Iraq to collapse but it also does not want Iraq to be too strong. They want a middle ground.” Even if Sadr’s deal with Amiri succeeds, he may have to contend with grievances from members of his own bloc who insist  Tehran would not be allowed to interfere in Iraqi affairs.

The long-running graft case on alleged corruption in Nigeria, revolves around the 2011 purchase by Eni and Shell of Nigeria’s OPL-245 offshore oilfield for about $1.3 billion (974.3 million pounds). The trial began last month, with the next hearing set for June 20.  The appeal was aimed at reversing the trial to the preliminary hearing stage due to what it said were procedural errors, but the court decided the appeal was inadmissible. Nine current and former executives or contractors, including Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi, have been accused by Italian prosecutors of paying bribes to secure the licence to explore OPL-245. The field holds an estimated 9 billion barrels of oil but has never entered production. All have denied wrongdoing. An Eni spokesman on Wednesday reiterated that Eni denied any wrongdoing. If found guilty, those on trial could face jail. A Shell spokeswoman said on Wednesday: “Based on our review of the Prosecutor of Milan’s file and all of the information and facts available to us, we do not believe that there is a basis to convict Shell or any of its former employees.” As a rule, the Supreme Court does not comment on its decisions.

2018-06-13,"* Global stocks waver on Fed, trade caution * Fed rate hike priced in, focus on pace of future tightening * World stocks off one-month high * Oil up, crude inventories lower than expected (Updates with Wall Street open, oil report) By Nick Brown NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Stocks across the globe wavered on Wednesday on fears of trade tensions and questions about U.S. interest rates, while lower-than-expected inventory data sent oil prices into the black after morning losses. Investors are awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) decision on monetary policy, with the year’s second interest rate hike almost certain. But market participants are keen to know how many times the Fed will raise rates in 2018, with market pricing “fairly split between three and four hikes,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid wrote in a note to clients. Amid the uncertainty, Wall Street opened slightly firmer, buoyed by a jump in media stocks after Tuesday’s court ruling allowing AT&T’s $85 billion take over of Time Warner - a move expected to trigger a wave of corporate mergers. Shares of the HBO channel owner jumped about 3 percent after the approval, while AT&T dropped 1.6 percent. Overall, stock markets were moving up, but tepidly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.88 points, or 0.07 percent, to 25,339.61, the S&P 500 gained 4 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,790.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 42.30 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,746.09. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.19 percent, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe , which has been stagnating near one-month highs for about a week, gained 0.09 percent. Equity markets are “finding it difficult to make upward progress despite reasonably good economic data”, said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. Along with the Fed and other key central bank policy meetings this week, fresh fears of protectionism are weighing on stocks and currencies as the U.S. prepares to unveil more tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. Emerging market stocks lost 0.37 percent, while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.58 percent lower. Trade tensions pressured the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, which gained 0.46 and 0.35 percent, respectively, versus the greenback. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of others, fell 0.2 percent, with the euro up 0.29 percent to $1.1777. Oil prices, which had started the day in the red, rose after a report by the Energy Information Administration indicated U.S. crude inventories fell more than anticipated last week and while gasoline and distillate stocks surprised with unexpected declines. U.S. crude was up 0.36 percent to $66.60 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.36, up 0.63 percent on the day. Gasoline futures were up 1.1 percent to $2.1124 a gallon. “You tend to want to see draws in gasoline early in the summer with driving season, and this is the first number that actually does that ... in three weeks,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. In government bonds, U.S. Treasury yields were flat on Wednesday, moving in narrow ranges, with investors firmly focused on the Fed meeting. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.9535 percent, from 2.957 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond last rose 6/32 in price to yield 3.0823 percent, from 3.092 percent Tuesday. Italian government bonds were in demand, as well, after Paolo Savona, the country’s new EU Affairs Minister, said the euro was “indispensable.” The comments by Savona, who has previously expressed hostile views on the euro, followed statements earlier in the week by Italy’s new coalition government that it had no plans to leave the euro zone. In another reminder of the danger of trade disputes, shares in Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp fell as much as 41.5 percent, wiping $3 billion off its market value, as it resumed trade after agreeing to pay up to $1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government.

2018-06-13,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) is paying owners of polluting diesel-powered vehicles up to $1,000 (749.5 pounds) in additional payments to settle state lawsuits in Vermont, the state’s attorney general said on Wednesday. VW agreed to a $6.5 million (4.9 million pounds) settlement with Vermont to resolve allegations of false advertising claims. Under the settlement, VW agreed to pay owners in the state up to $1,000 each for vehicles covered under the settlement. Vermont and Arizona, which settled similar claims last month, are the only two states in which consumers will receive restitution payments as a result of a state enforcement action. Under court settlements, VW owners previously received between $5,100 (3,822.2 pounds) and $17,000 (12,740.8 pounds) in compensation for having polluting vehicles fixed or selling them back to the automaker.   In 2016, VW reached a $603 million (451.9 million pounds) consumer fraud settlement with 44 U.S. states. Since then it has struck settlements with five other states - including Vermont - worth more than $120 million. The only state with a pending consumer fraud action is New Mexico. “Vermonters expect and deserve truth in advertising – especially when it comes to making decisions involving environmental impacts,” said Attorney General Thomas Donovan. Vermont owners will receive a total of $2.9 million (2.2 million pounds) in direct consumer restitution and VW will also pay $3.6 million (2.7 million pounds) into the state’s general fund. In the Arizona settlement announced in May, VW agreed to pay $10.5 million for direct consumer payments and $20 million into the state’s general fund, to be used toward its education funding shortage. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said if the state had joined the 2016 multistate agreement, it would have received only $11 million (8.2 million pounds). In total, VW has agreed to pay more than $25 billion (18.7 billion pounds) in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The buy-backs will continue through the end of 2019. VW admitted in September 2015 to secretly installing software in nearly 500,000 U.S. cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests. The vehicles emitted up to 40 times the legally allowable pollutants. In May, federal prosecutors in Detroit unsealed criminal charges against former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn. Two other former VW employees have pleaded guilty in the investigation and  nine people in total have been charged. Volkswagen AG has paid more than $7.4 billion (5.5 billion pounds) to buy back about 350,000 U.S. diesel vehicles through mid-February, court filings show.

2018-06-13,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - At least three OPEC members disagree with Saudi Arabia and Russia on the need to pump more oil, OPEC sources said, complicating any official decision to boost supply just as consuming nations are warning of a shortage. In attempt to bridge differences, OPEC and its allies are looking at a number of options around pumping more oil, including a token increase and delaying the start of any production boost, OPEC delegates say. After almost 18 months of an OPEC and non-OPEC deal to cut production, Saudi Arabia and Russia have said they are prepared to pump more to calm consumer worries about supply and prices, which hit $80 a barrel LCOc1, the highest since 2014. But Iran, the arch-rival of Saudi Arabia, plus Venezuela, Iraq and smaller producers in the 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries disagree. Producers meet on June 22-23 to set policy. The disagreement has revived memories of a 2011 meeting that former Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, called one of the group’s worst ever - talks collapsed when a majority of members refused to endorse a Saudi push to pump more. Saudi Arabia, in the end, unilaterally raised output. Those against an increase this time are concerned it would threaten the unity of the 24-nation alliance involved in the deal and say forecasts from OPEC and others calling for higher demand in the second half of 2018 are too optimistic. “Changing the decision is very complicated,” an OPEC source said. “Iran, Iraq and Venezuela and some more countries are going to push for keeping the ceiling for OPEC in place until the end of 2018.” The source did not say which other countries oppose pumping more. Another source thought a supply boost will be agreed eventually, but a modest one. “I believe there will be a marginal increase,” a second OPEC source said, adding it would have to be “gradual, well calculated and for its impact on the market to be reviewed.” Consumers say more oil is needed. U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his attack on OPEC on Wednesday, and the International Energy Agency said the world may face a supply gap by late 2019 if OPEC cannot cover any shortfalls. Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when he visits Russia for the opening of the soccer World Cup, and the two would discuss the oil deal, the Kremlin said on Wednesday. Venezuela’s output has collapsed due to economic crisis and could fall further due to U.S. sanctions, while Iran is facing a cut in exports after the U.S. quit a nuclear deal with Tehran. “Those who oppose the increase are the ones who will not gain,” a second OPEC source said. “They will lose when prices go down because they will not be able to increase production and will get less revenue.” Gulf producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are the main OPEC members holding sufficient unused oil production capacity to boost output quickly to offset a shortage.  Sources close to the matter said a number of options are being looked at, including an increase of around 1 million barrels per day and, should prices fall, making no decision. Arab oil ministers who met in Kuwait earlier this month agreed that if there is a decline in prices toward the $60s, then OPEC would keep the deal in place until its next meeting in November, two sources familiar with the matter said. Another scenario being discussed is for producers to ease the level of cutbacks to 100 percent of the agreed level from around 150 percent now, to fill any supply gap from Venezuela and Iran, should oil get close to $80, the sources said. In a further effort toward building consensus, the amount of any increase would be distributed among all even though only three or four producers actually have the capacity to increase output, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. And a fifth OPEC source said that if OPEC decided next week to raise output it would not be with “immediate effect” and would be gradual, suggesting supply would not rise for three to four months after a June decision.

Crude inventories fell 4.1 million barrels in the week to June 8, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.7 million barrels. Refinery crude runs rose by 136,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 0.3 percentage points to 95.7 percent of total capacity. Gasoline stocks fell 2.3 million barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 443,000-barrel gain. Demand was up by 0.3 percent over the past four weeks when compared with the year-ago period, the EIA said. “You tend to want to see draws in gasoline early in the summer with driving season, and this is the first number that actually does that... in three weeks,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. U.S. crude and gasoline prices rose after the report. Crude futures were up 16 cents to $66.53 a barrel, gaining about 50 cents from before the report. Brent crude gained 43 cents to $76.30 a barrel. Gasoline futures were up 1.1 percent to $2.1124 a gallon. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 2.1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 200,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed.

The long-running graft case revolves around the 2011 purchase by Eni and Shell of Nigeria’s OPL-245 offshore oilfield for about $1.3 billion. The trial kicked off last month, with the next hearing set for June 20. The appeal was aimed at reversing the trial to the preliminary hearing stage due to what it said were procedural errors, but the court decided the appeal was inadmissible. Nine current and former executives or contractors, including Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi, have been accused by Italian prosecutors of paying bribes to secure the licence to explore OPL-245. The field holds an estimated 9 billion barrels of oil but has never entered production. All deny wrongdoing, as do Shell and Eni. If found guilty, those on trial could face jail. A Shell spokeswoman said on Wednesday: “Based on our review of the Prosecutor of Milan’s file and all of the information and facts available to us, we do not believe that there is a basis to convict Shell or any of its former employees.” As a rule, the Supreme Court does not comment on its decisions.

2018-06-13,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria may find it tough to achieve its goal of producing as much energy from renewable resources as it consumes by 2030 due to public opposition to new dams and other projects that disturb nature, the head of energy regulator e-Control said.   The 2030 target is part of a climate and energy strategy, which the coalition government’s conservative and far-right parties adopted last month. The goal is in line with the Alpine country’s commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accords. Austria already generates about 75 percent of its annual energy consumption of 65 terawatt hours (TWh) from renewables thanks to its many rivers and lakes. The country, covering 84,000 square km, has about 130 large hydropower plants. But adding more dams would require inundating an even larger area with water, which could spark protests. “The real problem is the resistance on-site,” e-Control co-chief Andreas Eigenbauer told Reuters. By 2030, Austria aims to generate the amount of energy it consumes each year from renewables, although it still expects to need fossil fuels to meet peak demand, but allowing it to export or storage excess levels. “That is visionary,” Eigenbauer said of the target. “You need a drastic change in support in the population to reach that goal. If you do not get it, then it gets really difficult.” Eigenbauer said Austria would have to generate around 80 TWh from hydro, solar and wind power by 2030 to reach the target, around 30 TWh more than now. He said the plan was to increase output equally from each of the three resources. As well as the challenge of building new dams, he said adding enough wind parks would be tough due to lack of space. The only available area big enough was in forests, which cover nearly half of the country’s land area.  “But in this area as well, resistance is mounting,” he said, even when wind turbine rotors rise above the tree level. Eigenbauer said there was potential to develop solar power on residential buildings, adding that more family homes had photovoltaic installations and major property developers were installing more solar equipment. The government’s solar target was reachable, he said. But for further expansion dedicated solar plants would be needed and these were also unpopular, he added.

2018-06-13,"(Updates with rouble gain, adds quotes, detail) MOSCOW, June 13 (Reuters) - Russia’s rouble bounced off six-week lows on Wednesday ahead of the World Cup, which some expect could have a temporary positive impact on the currency. The Russian market could see up to $3 billion converted by foreigners during the soccer tournament, which should keep the rouble from weakening to 64-65 per dollar even if other emerging currencies fall, Artem Zvonarev, a trader at VTB Capital, said. The rouble, which is usually largely driven by oil prices and risk sentiment, gained 0.3 percent to 62.65, after briefly hitting 63.24, a level last seen on May 8. Sberbank CIB said in a note it expected export-focused companies to support the rouble by ramping up FX sales they have accrued during Russia’s holidays on June 11-12. “We saw some weakening (in the rouble) in the morning as other emerging currency depreciated in the past few days. But then (the) offer of dollars appeared on the market,” Zvonarev added. “Experience of previous World Cups suggests that host countries’ currencies tend to appreciate during the event but the magnitude of the movement is quite moderate,” Nordea Bank said in a research note. The economic impact of the games, however, could be short-lived despite Moscow’s hopes that the billions of dollars spent on preparations will lead to a boost. The rouble, which has dipped on expectations that major OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers could decide to increase output at a meeting this month, gained 0.3 percent to 73.80. Brent crude, a global benchmark for Russia’s main export, was down 0.3 percent at $75.67 a barrel. The rouble has been under pressure from increased finance ministry foreign currency purchases this month, when it plans to buy the equivalent of 19 billion roubles ($301 million) a day. Russian stock indexes were steady. The dollar-denominated RTS index was unchanged at 1,141.96 points, while its rouble-based MOEX Russian index inched 0.03 percent higher to 2,272.3 points.

2018-06-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global greenhouse gas emissions began rising again last year as the first pick-up in coal burning since 2013 overshadowed a record expansion in renewable energy, a BP report said. Energy demand accelerated in 2017 by 2.2 percent, but a 17 percent gain in clean power such as solar and wind did little to offset the dominance of fossil fuels in the rapidly expanding global economy. Demand for hydrocarbons rose across the board, led by a 3 percent increase in natural gas consumption, the fastest since 2010, followed by a 1.8 percent rise in oil demand which far exceeded the average of the previous 10 years, data in BP’s benchmark annual Statistical Review of World Energy showed. (GRAPHIC: Global GDP and energy growth - reut.rs/2y5Rqdd) (GRAPHIC: Energy fuel mix -BP - reut.rs/2MkpDZE)  The opening of new coal-fired power plants in India and China drove coal consumption higher by 1 percent, highlighting the difficulties developing economies face in meeting demand for electricity while fighting pollution. BP and other oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell have led calls to reduce carbon emissions by converting coal power plants to cleaner natural gas. Still, the share of coal in power generation today remains around 38 percent, practically unchanged since 1997, while the share of non-fossil fuels slightly dipped as nuclear power capacity shrunk, BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale said. The power sector absorbs more than 40 percent of primary energy and accounts for over a third of carbon emissions. “This is really worrying,” Dale told reporters in a briefing before the report was released. “How much progress have we made in 20 years? None.” (GRAPHIC: Fuel shares in power generation-BP - reut.rs/2Mo7N85)  Carbon emissions grew last year by 1.6 percent, compared with little to no growth in the previous three years but still lower than average growth of 2.5 percent in the 10 years to 2014. A landmark climate agreement reached in Paris in 2015 calls for halving carbon emissions by 2040 and reducing them to net zero by the end of the century to limit global warming.   “Three years of flat growth was a step in the right direction, but it wasn’t a big enough step,” Dale said. Steady and robust growth in oil demand over the past five years, the strongest since 2007, was driven by lower crude prices but could be undercut by the recent rally that took prices to their highest since 2014, Dale said. “There are some signs that the boost from low oil prices may be beginning to wane,” he added. (GRAPHIC: Oil demand growth-BP - reut.rs/2MkMnc2) On the supply side, the surge in production of U.S. shale oil, also known has tight oil, has redrawn the global market. The United States overtook Saudi Arabia in 2017 to become the world’s second biggest producer behind Russia. A 2017 agreement between OPEC, Russia and other major oil producers to reduce global output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), combined with a sharp fall in Venezuela’s output, drove down global inventories to their five-year average, BP said. But a 2 million bpd growth in U.S. oil and natural gas liquids since October 2016 offset a large part of the cuts. “OPEC has always had the power to stabilise the market in response to short-term fluctuations,” Dale said. “OPEC has never had the power to try to offset structural long-term shocks to the market (such as) the emergence of new sources of supply and the growth of electric cars.” “The rapid response of U.S. tight oil just reinforces that point.” Rising exports of U.S. crude and new refineries in Asia and the Middle East have also led to a surge in global oil trading, which grew by more than 4 percent last year compared to a 10-year average of 1.7 percent, Dale said.

2018-06-13,"* Commercial oil reserves found 12 years ago * Rows over taxes, strategy delayed development * Uganda yet to start building export pipeline By Elias Biryabarema HOIMA, Uganda, June 13 (Reuters) - Oil production in Uganda is likely to start in 2021 at the earliest, China’s CNOOC said, giving a later date than the government’s 2020 target. CNOOC, which is developing the fields in the west of the country with Britain’s Tullow Oil and France’s Total , is aiming for a final investment decision this year so development can start, CNOOC spokeswoman Aminah Bukenya said. “If we have the final investment decision taken this year, then three years from the final investment decision we shall have first oil,” she said. Total, the joint operator with CNOOC, did not respond to a request for comment. Initial field development would include constructing central processing facilities and feeder pipeline networks. Uganda still needs to secure investment decisions for building a refinery and a pipeline for export, which need to be in place for production to begin. Uganda’s commercial oil reserves, now estimated at 6.5 billion barrels, were discovered more than 12 years ago. But rows between the government and oil firms over issues such as taxes and strategy have delayed development. Land-locked Uganda signed a deal last year with Tanzania to jointly develop an export pipeline worth $3.55 billion to pump oil from the oilfields to the Tanzanian Indian Ocean seaport of Tanga. Construction has yet to start, although officials have laid the foundations stones. Uganda also wants to build a refinery. A preliminary agreement was signed in April with a consortium of investors, including a subsidiary of General Electric, for the plant that is estimated to cost $3 billion to $4 billion. In Hoima, a poor region near the western oil fields, work on levelling ground and clearing elephant grass for a new airport has started. The $625 million facility will transport personnel and some equipment to the field. The plot for export pipeline facilities is still covered in mango trees. The government’s 2020 target for production has “for some time now seemed a bit over-ambitious”, said Jacques Nel, an economist at South Africa-based NKC African Economics. “Public investment in Uganda has been marred by delays, corruption and inefficient spending for some time now, and it is unlikely that this is about the change,” he said. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, 73, who has been in power for three decades and who was re-elected in 2016, has been keen to press on with the project in his bid to spur economic growth, pay down the national debt and reduce poverty.

2018-06-13,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2JI9607 * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2JDt3VI By John Kemp LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - Sanctions on Iran and the continued decline in output from Venezuela will leave the oil market very vulnerable to any further production or consumption surprises next year. Output and demand in the global market are each currently running at almost 100 million barrels per day (bpd). To ensure a steady flow of oil from the wellhead to consumers, the industry relies on a series of shock absorbers to handle any interruption in supplies or unexpected strength in demand. In rough order of responsiveness, these buffers are: * Commercial inventories * OPEC spare capacity * Strategic stocks * Short-cycle production * Consumption restraint Both commercial inventories and OPEC spare capacity have become dangerously eroded over the last 12 months, leaving the oil market much more vulnerable in 2019. If all the other shock absorbers become exhausted, oil prices will have to rise to the point where consumption growth begins to slow. The oil market’s first line of defence comes from changes in the volume of commercial inventories held by producers, traders and refiners. OECD commercial stocks currently stand at 2.8 billion barrels, composed of crude (1.1 billion barrels), other liquids (300 million barrels) and refined products (1.4 billion barrels). Additional stocks are held in non-OECD countries, as well as on tankers and in pipelines, either in transit from oilfields to refineries and on to final customers, or as floating storage. The vast majority of stocks are held for operational reasons to ensure the uninterrupted flow of oil from wellhead to final customers. Only a small percentage, generally less than 15 percent, can be considered discretionary and available to act as a shock absorber. OECD crude and product stocks are already 27 million barrels below the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, June 2018). The five-year average was inflated by the glut of oil between 2015 and 2017, so it may not be representative of the normal level of inventories. But global oil consumption has also increased by more than 6 million bpd over the five years since 2013, so other things being equal, producers, traders and refiners will want to hold more stocks for operational reasons. The fact that futures prices for both Brent and WTI are in backwardation implies oil traders see stocks as already fairly tight and expected to tighten further. For the last four decades, the oil industry’s second line of defence has been the existence of significant volumes of spare production capacity. Nearly all spare production capacity is held by Saudi Arabia, with smaller volumes held by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Russia may also hold a small amount of spare capacity at the moment, following the decision taken in 2016 to restrain production. Other OPEC and non-OPEC members essentially produce as much as they are able and do not hold significant spare capacity. OPEC’s spare capacity currently amounts to less than 2 million bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, June 2018). In its latest oil market update, the International Energy Agency explored a scenario in which exports from Venezuela and Iran could decline by as much as 1.5 million barrels per day by the end of 2019. To compensate for the lost output, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates could boost production by just over 1 million bpd, with additional supplies from Russia, according to the IEA. But if this scenario comes to pass, OPEC spare capacity will be reduced to less than 1 million bpd, the lowest level since 2004. (tmsnrt.rs/2JI9607) SHORT-CYCLE PRODUCTION With oil inventories already tight and spare capacity set to shrink, the industry will have to fall back on strategic stocks and short-cycle production to meet any unexpected shortfall. OECD governments and refiners hold almost 1.6 billion barrels of crude and products in strategic storage, which can be released in the event of an emergency. China has also amassed a strategic stockpile estimated at more than 800 million barrels, according to the International Energy Agency. Strategic stocks are the third line of defence. But the circumstances under which OECD and China’s strategic stocks would be released to the market remain opaque. Experience suggests governments react to the security and economic threat from both actual shortages of crude and/or a sharp rise in prices. However, strategic stock releases cannot be predicted, and strategic stocks are not generally considered available to the market. The industry will therefore be forced to rely on short-cycle production, its fourth line of defence. Most short-cycle production comes from the U.S. shale sector, with smaller volumes available from the accelerated development of existing oilfields in other parts of the world. But even short-cycle production can take 6-12 months or more to reach the market, given the lengthy delays involved in securing extra drilling rigs, fracking wells and connecting them up to the distribution system. The U.S. shale supply chain is already extremely stretched, with reported shortages of experienced fracking crews and truckers. And pipelines to move the produced oil from the shale fields to refining centres on the U.S. Gulf Coast or onto tankers for export are full. Short-cycle producers may therefore struggle to plug any additional shortfall in oil supplies next year, especially if consumption growth remains strong. Medium-cycle and long-cycle production from new oilfields takes too long to develop to be of any real use as a shock absorber. So the final shock absorber is always the consumer. Oil prices will have to rise high enough in 2018/19 to slow growth in consumption and restore inventory and spare capacity buffers to a more comfortable level. Rising prices will slow consumption growth through some combination of behavioural changes to cut fuel use, switching to alternative fuels, and slower GDP growth in consuming countries. Consumption is not very responsive to a small change in oil prices, at least in the short term, so large price increases are required to enforce demand restraint. Between 2006 and 2008, and again between 2011 and 2014, high oil prices coincided with falling consumption in the OECD. (tmsnrt.rs/2JDt3VI) In both cases, the rise in prices was followed by a slowdown in consumption growth and a faster increase in production, eventually rebuilding stocks and spare capacity. The combination of falling Venezuelan output, sanctions on Iran, low commercial stocks, low spare capacity, and constraints on the expansion of U.S. shale is priming the market for higher prices in 2018/19. The most likely outcome is a further rise in prices to enforce demand restraint and/or a recession in the major consuming countries to bring the market back to balance again.

This is Congo’s first licensing round since oil prices rebounded significantly in 2017 after plummeting in 2014 due to global oversupply. Interest in the tender will act as a bellwether for the country’s oil reserves and production now that higher prices have made drilling more viable. The joint statement said that the licensing round would last until June 30, 2019. It follows a previous round in 2016, in which 30 international companies registered to participate. The auction will involve around 15 offshore and onshore blocks in the Cuvette Basin, according to information on the hydrocarbons ministry’s website.

2018-06-13,"(Fixes typo in paragraph 4) * Powerful Shi’ite alliance * Sadr and Iran cautious * Cleric with erratic past By Ahmed Aboulenein BAGHDAD, June 13 (Reuters) - Iraqi nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iranian-backed militia chief Hadi al-Amiri were set on Wednesday to lead talks to form a government in Baghdad after announcing an alliance of their political blocs. Sadr and Amiri’s groupings won first and second place respectively in May’s election, which has been beset by allegations of fraud and raised fears of bloodshed among Shi’ite paramilitary groups. They announced the alliance in the Shi’ite holy city of Najaf, an apparent attempt to project unity among leaders of the Muslim sect that has dominated since the fall of Saddam Hussein. A week ago, an explosion killed at least 18 people and wounded more than 90 in Sadr’s Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City district, in what the interior ministry called “a terrorist aggression on civilians”. State television reported on Wednesday that the Supreme Judicial Council had issued arrest warrants for 20 people in connection with the blast. The Sadr-Amiri pact could ease fears of violence, which some have said could even spiral into intra-Shi’ite civil war. Amiri, widely described as Tehran’s man in Iraq, is one of the most powerful figures in the country. Iraq, a key ally of the United States and major oil producer, has 150,000 heavily armed mostly Shi’ite paramilitary fighters operating alongside state forces - some of them more loyal to their commanders and Iran than to the Iraqi state. Both Sadr and Iran seem to be taking a pragmatic approach as Iran seeks to maintain its deep influence in its most important Arab ally at a time when its wider Middle East interests are under threat. Not only has U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a global nuclear deal with Tehran and then embraced North Korea, increasing Iran’s isolation; Tehran’s allies in Yemen are also facing a major offensive from a Saudi-led coalition that could mark a turning point in the war. Sadr, who led violent campaigns against the U.S. occupation that ended in 2011, has emerged as a nationalist opponent of powerful Shi’ite parties allied with neighbouring Iran, and as a champion of the poor. Tehran has skilfully manipulated Iraqi politics in the past, and the cleric has to tread carefully. But Sadr, who derives much of his legitimacy from his revered father, Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq Sadr, assassinated in 1999 by Saddam’s agents, is a formidable and unpredictable operator. He also has street power, with a track record of mobilising tens of thousands of supporters to protest against opponents and government policies. In the 2010 election, Vice President Ayad Allawi’s group won the largest number of seats, albeit with a narrow margin, but he was prevented from becoming prime minister. He blamed Tehran, which manoeuvred Nuri al-Maliki into power, and Sadr helped to form a national unity government. During the American occupation, Tehran was accused of arming Sadr’s Mehdi Army militia with sophisticated bombs used in attacks on U.S.-led coalition forces. Tehran has accommodated him in the past; he went into self-imposed exile in Iran in 2007.

2018-06-13,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland’s center-right government sold a stake of 5 percent in oil refiner and biofuel company Neste (NESTE.HE) on Wednesday  for 861 million euros ($1.0 billion), prompting criticism from the opposition that it gives up too much control of company. As a result of the sale, the state’s stake fell to 44.7 percent. The government said it wanted to capitalize on the stock’s recent strong performance while still holding a strong grip on the company. “The state will continue to be a significant shareholder of the company, which will, among other things, ensure the strategic interest relating to the ownership,” Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintila said in a statement. The sale price was 67.27 euros per share, compared with Tuesday’s closing price of 69.18 euros. The stock fell to 66.60 euros on Wednesday by 1120 GMT. It is still up about 90 percent from a year earlier. Neste has benefited from its profitable biofuel business, which has plants in Singapore and Rotterdam, and is looking to expand its capacity. It also has two conventional refineries in Finland. The acting head of the state ownership department Jarmo Vaisanen told Reuters that there were no plans at the moment to cut the stake further. Last year, the government pushed through a law that gives it a mandate to cut the state’s previously controlling stake in Neste to a minimum of 33.4 percent - prompting strike threats from the company’s employees. State-ownership is a sensitive subject in Finland where many think the government should do more to protect Finnish jobs. “The logic of the sale is rather confusing. There is really no need to sell the shares and lose common ownership, they could instead borrow cheap money,” said lawmaker Sirpa Paatero from the opposition Social Democrats told Reuters.

Wall Street appeared set for a modestly firmer open, potentially building on the previous session’s gains, which were fuelled by buoyant mergers and acquisitions activity among media and telecoms firms  . European shares rose too as global company earnings have been revised up, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, assets such as Chinese stocks, European autos and the Mexican peso are under pressure from the risk of protectionist measures from the United States which is preparing to unveil more tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. And the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan all hold policy meetings this week, with the Fed expected to announce its second rate rise of 2018. Equity markets are “marking time and finding it difficult to make upward progress despite reasonably good economic data”, said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “We are entering three days of important central bank decisions. Markets have pretty much priced what (the banks) will do and it is clear we are in a monetary policy tightening cycle.” These issues eroded slim gains made around Tuesday’s summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The meeting has soothed some geo-political fears, as a joint statement pledged to work toward the “denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula. MSCI’s all-country share index was flat, recovering slightly from deeper losses caused by a half percent fall in non-Japan Asian equities. European stocks too were 0.3 percent higher after a weak start, led by a 1.4 percent rise in the tech index and an 80 percent leap in Dutch fintech firm Adyen on its first day of trading. An index of auto stocks lagged, however, with gains of 0.2 percent. Milligan downplayed the impact of U.S. trade measures on global commerce but noted “the direction of travel is not positive, which is why equities are not making as much progress and investor sentiment is not more positive.” Investors see trade wars as the biggest market risk, a closely watched survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) showed. It showed investors bullish on equities but still holding high levels of cash in portfolios — a clear sign of wariness. In a reminder of the danger of trade disputes,  shares in Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp fell as much as 41.5 percent, wiping $3 billion off its market value, as it resumed trade after agreeing to pay up to $1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government. Its Shenzhen shares fell by their 10 percent limit, dragging down mainland Chinese shares around 1 percent The Mexican and Canadian currencies, remained under pressure from trade war fears, the former hitting 16-month lows against the U.S. dollar. Investors see central bank policy mistakes as the second-biggest risk for markets, the BAML poll showed. Projections from the Fed’s March meeting suggest a benchmark rate of 2.1 percent at end of 2018. That implies a total of three rate rises this year. But some reckon four increases are possible. “The focus is on how many times the Fed will raise rates this year and next and how much beyond the levels it considers as neutral to the economy, or what they call the longer-run rates,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy group at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. As the Fed meeting approached, the dollar traded flat against a basket of currencies giving up some earlier gains but stayed near three-week highs versus the yen. It firmed sharply against some emerging currencies — the Turkish lira fell one percent towards recent record lows The euro eased off last week’s three-week high of $1.1840 but remained underpinned by expectations the ECB will mention plans to wind up its stimulus and even hint at the timing of its first interest rate rise when it meets on Thursday. However, Italian bond yields fell further with two-year yields down 14 bps to below 1 percent after EU affairs minister Paolo Savona, considered a eurosceptic, said the euro was “indispensable”. Such comments have soothed worries about Italy’s euro membership, but analysts say the government’s high-spending plans could boost yields again once the relief rally ebbs. “In the longer term, they need to do something different to bring the deficit under control, not just pay lip service towards the euro,” Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger said. Britain’s pound and bond yields slipped as data showing subdued inflation checked expectations for an interest rate rise this year. Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo, graphic by

2018-06-13,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s capital was once again identified as one of the worst places for air quality in May, ministry data showed on Wednesday, although general air quality in its nearby regions improved. Concentration of small breathable particles, known as PM2.5, rose 8 percent to 54 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing last month, ranking the city at No.5 from the bottom of total 74 major monitored cities, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said in a statement. It did not give explanation, but pointed out that “unfavorable weather conditions” and “increasing emissions from industrial operations” were major reasons for declining air quality in April.  The smog-prone Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, however, saw a decline in PM2.5 level last month - down 6.4 percent to 44 micrograms per cubic meter from a year ago - although Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Handan and Baoding city in Hebei also appeared in the bottom 10 for worst performance on air pollution control. The Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau said last week that the city would step up anti-pollution measures this year, targeting dust, volatile organic compounds, produced by burning fossil fuels, and diesel exhausts. A level of PM2.5 in 25 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region rose 5.6 percent to 38 micrograms per cubic meters compared to May last year, the ministry data showed. China aims to keep national concentrations of PM2.5 below 35 micrograms by around 2035.

2018-06-13,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s CK Infrastructure Holdings (1038.HK) has made a A$12.98 billion (7.33 billion pounds) takeover offer for Australia’s biggest gas pipeline company, APA Group (APA.AX), offering a hefty 33 percent premium to tap into a tight gas market. The deal would make CK Infrastructure, part of the business empire founded by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, the major player in Australia’s east coast gas pipeline network. But it comes as soaring gas and power prices have caused political blowback,  raising concerns it could run into competition and national security hurdles. APA’s shares rose 21 percent to A$10.00, but closed well below the offer price of A$11 per stapled security, signalling investor uncertainty over whether Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would clear the deal.  CK Infrastructure, leading a consortium with CK Asset Holdings (1113.HK) and Power Assets Holdings (0006.HK), said it was already talking to the regulators. Since the controversial sale of the port of Darwin to a Chinese company in 2015, the government has been at pains to demonstrate limits to its ties to China, its biggest export partner, including blocking the sale of Australia’s biggest cattle station to Chinese interests. The FIRB rejected bids by China’s State Grid and CK Infrastructure for the nation’s biggest electricity network Ausgrid in 2016 as that business served an Australian spy facility. However, CK Infrastructure ran into no trouble last year with a A$7.4 billion takeover of Australian pipelines and electricity network owner DUET Group, adding to the swathe of gas and power assets it already owns across Australia. CKI’s offer for APA A$11 per stapled security was well above APA’s last close of A$8.27 and its record high of A$9.90 hit a year ago. “It’s a decent premium. What it basically shows is there is a disconnect between how the private market wants to value these assets and how the stock market values them,” said Jason Teh, Chief Investment Officer at Vertium Asset Management, which does not own shares in APA. APA said on Wednesday it would evaluate the bid and agreed to open its books for the consortium to review. It told shareholders to take no action. “Based on the indicative price of A$11.00 cash per stapled security, the APA Board considers that it is in the best interests of APA’s securityholders to engage further with the consortium,” APA said in a statement. The CKI-led consortium welcomed APA’s decision to enter talks, saying the all-cash proposal provided a “compelling opportunity” for security holders to realise value. APA’s biggest shareholder, UniSuper, which owns a 16.1 percent stake, did not comment on the offer price, but chief investment officer, John Pearce, said it fully supported allowing CKI to conduct due diligence. The competition watchdog said on Wednesday it would take about 12 weeks to review the deal after receiving more information. APA dominates gas transportation on Australia’s east coast, where the southeastern states are increasingly dependent on supply from Queensland in the north, and where CK Infrastructure already owns a gas distribution network. JPMorgan analysts said they doubted any rival bids would emerge but said Foreign Investment Review Board approval “may be challenging considering APA’s dominant position in gas pipelines on the east coast.” Macquarie analysts, however, said plans by other companies to build liquefied natural gas import terminals might ease concerns about lack of gas competition. To avert competition concerns, CK Infrastructure has offered to divest all of APA’s pipeline assets in Western Australia, as it already owns the major Dampier to Bunbury gas pipeline in that state, acquired in its takeover of DUET. Macquarie is advising APA, while Morgan Stanley is advising the CK Infrastructure-led consortium.

2018-06-13,"(Updates throughout with details) By Amanda Cooper LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - Oil demand will grow steadily in 2019 thanks to a solid global economy, but the world may face a large supply gap by late next year if OPEC cannot cover any supply shortfalls, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. The report serves as a stark warning to the world’s largest oil exporters, who meet next week in Vienna to discuss supply policy. The IEA said it expects global oil demand to grow by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2019, to top 100 million bpd by the second quarter of the year. The agency expects demand to grow at the same rate this year, unchanged from its last report in May. “A solid economic background and an assumption of more stable prices are key factors. Risks include possibly higher prices and trade disruptions. Some governments are considering measures to ease price pressures on consumers,” the Paris-based agency said in its monthly report. “There is the possibility of a downward revision to our economic assumptions in the next few months. The world economy is feeling some pain from higher oil prices.” The oil price has risen by a third to around $76 a barrel , close to its highest since late 2014, since OPEC and other producers including Russia began cutting production in January 2017 by 1.8 million bpd. “Increasing trade tensions are the main risk to our oil demand forecast,” the IEA said. Canada and the European Union have announced plans to increase tariffs on selected U.S. goods in response to U.S. duties on steel and aluminium imports. “The risks associated with escalating retaliations are not negligible ... A prolonged slowdown in trade would negatively affect world GDP growth and oil demand, as a significant part of oil consumption is linked to trade activities.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on June 22/23 to discuss its supply policy, particularly in light of protracted declines in Venezuela and the prospect of new U.S. sanctions on Iran later this year. The group, together with its partners, may consider raising output to compensate for any supply shortfalls. “Even if the Iran/Venezuela supply gap is plugged, the market will be finely balanced next year, and vulnerable to prices rising higher in the event of further disruption. It is possible that the very small number of countries with spare capacity beyond what can be activated quickly will have to go the extra mile,” the agency said. “If the other 12 OPEC members were to continue pumping at the same rate as May, a potential supply gap could emerge and lead to a draw on stocks of more than 1.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2019,” the report said. The agency said it had looked at a scenario in which by the end of next year output from Iran and Venezuela could be 1.5 million bpd lower than it is today. The IEA estimated that Iranian exports would drop by the same amount as they did during the last round of sanctions. For Venezuela, the agency said it saw no respite in the collapse in production from economic crisis that has taken 1 million bpd off the market in the past two years. OPEC’s efforts in restraining output led to commercial oil stocks across the world’s richest nations falling by 3.1 million barrels in April to a new three-year low of 2.809 billion barrels, the agency said. Supply from outside OPEC is expected to grow by 2 million bpd this year, led predominantly by the United States, before easing to around 1.7 million bpd next year, the IEA said. “Recently this expansion has not been without stress. The discount for WTI (U.S. crude) versus Brent has blown out to $10 a barrel, amidst signs that takeaway capacity is lagging behind output growth,” the IEA said. “To make up for ... losses (from Iran and Venezuela), we estimate that Middle East OPEC countries could increase production in fairly short order by about 1.1 million bpd and there could be more output from Russia on top of the increase already built into our 2019 non-OPEC supply numbers.” The IEA estimated demand for OPEC’s crude would ease in 2019 to 31.6 million bpd from a forecast 31.9 million bpd this year.

2018-06-13,"* Stake sale would be for investment in petrochemical products * Maximum sale of 49 pct shares, foreigners allowed up to 44 pct * Stake sale switched to public auction instead of strategic sale (Adds details, CEO quotes) By Mai Nguyen and Khanh Vu HANOI, June 13 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical will offload a further 49 percent stake and not limit the sale to only strategic investors as previously planned, in order to attract more buyers, its chief executive said. The sale is expected to take place via a public auction ahead of state-owned Binh Son’s possible listing in April next year, CEO Tran Ngoc Nguyen told Reuters, adding proceeds will be used for long-term investment in petrochemicals products. In an IPO earlier this year, the Vietnamese government raised $245 million by selling a 7.79 percent stake in Binh Son, the operator of the $3-billion Dung Quat oil refinery. At the time, Binh Son had said it would sell a further 49 percent stake to strategic investors, including domestic and foreign investors. But the refinery operator has so far failed to find a strategic investor, CEO Nguyen said. “The timing is too short for strategic investors to decide to invest in such a big stake,” he added. BSR also hopes to ease requirements such as lock-up time and minimum registered capital for the planned sale, Nguyen said, adding he expected the government to approve the change in order to help speed up the process. Vietnam has been privatising hundreds of state-owned enterprises in order to boost their performance, relax a tight state budget and reform an economy that is highly reliant on foreign investments. Binh Son’s foreign ownership is capped at 49 percent. It is currently 5 percent owned by foreigners, indicating overseas buyers may take up to 44 percent in the upcoming sale. Shares of the company have been trading on the unlisted public company market, or UPCoM, since March, and Nguyen expects the shares to be listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange , the country’s main bourse, by April next year. Binh Son expects to rake in a net profit of 2.95 trillion dong ($129 million) in the first half of this year, or about 85 percent of its full-year target, it said in a statement. The company will use retained profits as well as loans to fund a planned upgrade of its Dung Quat refinery. Dung Quat, Vietnam’s first refinery that began operations in 2009, was initially designed to process light sweet crude oil, mostly sourced from the Bach Ho field offshore Vietnam. The upgrade will enable the plant to process sour crude oil as well, Nguyen said, and will also allow it to produce more petrochemical products. Binh Son will select an engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the upgrade next year. Nguyen said seven companies had registered to bid for the contract, but declined to name them.

2018-06-13,"LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - Oil demand will grow steadily in 2019 thanks to a solid global economy and stable prices, although trade tensions remain the largest risk, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. The IEA said it expects global oil demand to grow by 1.4 million barrels per day next year, to top 100 million bpd by the second quarter of the year. The agency expects demand to grow at the same rate this year, unchanged from its last report in May. “A solid economic background and an assumption of more stable prices are key factors. Risks include possibly higher prices and trade disruptions. Some governments are considering measures to ease price pressures on consumers,” the Paris-based agency said in its monthly report. “There is the possibility of a downward revision to our economic assumptions in the next few months. The world economy is feeling some pain from higher oil prices.” The oil price has risen by a third to around $77 a barrel , close to its highest since late 2014, since OPEC and other producers including Russia began cutting production in January 2017 by 1.8 million bpd. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets later this month to discuss its supply policy, particularly in light of protracted declines in Venezuela and the prospect of new U.S. sanctions on Iran later this year. The group, together with its partners, may consider raising output to compensate for any supply shortfalls. “If the other 12 OPEC members were to continue pumping at the same rate as May, a potential supply gap could emerge and lead to a draw on stocks of more than 1.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2019,” the report said. Supply from outside OPEC is expected to grow by 2 million bpd this year, led predominantly by the United States, before easing to around 1.7 million bpd next year, the IEA said.

2018-06-13,"PARIS, June 13 (Reuters) - French sugar group Cristal Union on Wednesday said it had scrapped minimum prices for sugar beet farmers as it expects sugar prices to fall further in 2018 after hitting historic lows last year. A surge in output after the European Union abolished production quotas last year and a 40-percent slump in prices since early 2017 in an oversupplied world market have left many EU companies struggling with plunging profits. “The magic world, more comfortable and predictable, in which the beet sector was living has vanished,” the cooperative group said in a statement. French producers also face uncertainty linked to the EU and the government’s hostility to some pesticides, large-scale free trade negotiations and a “hardly understandable defence of palm oil” at the detriment of local biofuel producers, it said. “The Group’s board therefore unanimously decided to scrap the minimum price for sugar beet as soon as the 2018 campaign,” Cristal Union said. “This decision ... is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the group. Maintaining a minimum price would further distance Cristal Union from the realities of the market and weaken the operations of its members.” The group had decided in 2016 to offer its farmer members a pivot price of 27 euros per tonne of sugar beet, pulp included, for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 harvests, with the possibility of a supplementary payment if market conditions permitted. French rival Tereos, which on Tuesday said it was considering offering a stake to an international partner, has maintained a guaranteed price of 25 euros a tonne for sugar beet for 2018 as part of a two-year deal with its members for the after-quota period. Cristal Union, which also makes ethanol, posted sales of 2 billion euros ($2.35 billion) for the 2017/18 fiscal year up to Jan. 31, compared to 2.5 billion in the previous one which was spread over an exceptional period of 16 months. Gross operating surplus reached 164 millions euros. The group’s beet area rose 20 percent last year with near-record sugar yields at an average of 15 tonnes per hectare, it said. French farmers have blocked access to more than a dozen oil depots and refineries as part of a three-day protest over plans to allow oil major Total to use imported palm oil at a biofuel plant, which would compete with biodiesel made from locally produced oilseed crops. Sugar beet growers often cultivate other types of crops including grains and oilseeds.

2018-06-13,"(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to the text) By Ahmed Aboulenein BAGHDAD, June 12 (Reuters) - Nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iranian-backed militia chief Hadi al-Amiri, who won first and second place respectively in Iraq’s May parliamentary election, announced on Tuesday an alliance between their political blocs. The move announced from the Shi’ite holy city of Najaf is the first serious step towards forming a new government after weeks of negotiations between parties. It comes exactly one month after an election marred by historically low turnout and fraud allegations. The two Shi’ite figures said they would keep the door open for other winning blocs to join them in forming a new government. “Our meeting was a very positive one, we met to end the suffering of this nation and of the people. Our new alliance is a nationalist one,” Sadr said. Sadr and Amiri are strange bedfellows. The cleric, who once led violent campaigns against the U.S. occupation that ended in 2011, has emerged as a nationalist opponent of powerful Shi’ite parties allied with neighbouring Iran and as a champion of the poor. He backed in the election the Saeroon list composed of his followers, the Communist Party, and other secular candidates. Amiri, a fluent Farsi speaker, is Iran’s closest ally in Iraq, having spent two years in exile there during the era of Saddam Hussein. The Fatih alliance he led in the election was composed of political groups tied to Iran-backed Shi’ite militias who helped government forces dislodge Islamic State militants from the third of Iraq they seized four years ago. “Fatih and Saeroon announce forming the nucleus of the largest bloc and call on all winning blocs to participate in this alliance under a government programme agreed upon by all that is suitable to face the challenges, crises, and problems facing Iraq,” a Fatih spokesman said in a statement. The alliance, which together has 101 seats, 64 short of the majority needed to form a government, came hours after Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who’s own bloc came third, urged politicians to keep negotiating over government formation despite an impending nationwide manual recount of votes. Parliament mandated the recount after Abadi said a government report showed there were serious violations. A few days later a storage site housing half of Baghdad’s ballot boxes caught fire, raising tensions and prompting some to call for the election to be repeated. Abadi said on Tuesday he opposed a repeat, echoing the stances of Sadr and Amiri, and warned that anyone who tried to sabotage the political process would be punished. He may yet secure a second term as a compromise candidate if he joins his blocs with Sadr and Amiri and manages to win their backing. “The matter is exclusively in the hands of the judiciary, not politicians. The government and parliament don’t have the power to cancel the election,” Abadi said of a repeat. The government report had recommended a recount of 5 percent of votes but the outgoing parliament, in which over half of lawmakers including the speaker lost their seats, instead voted for a nationwide one. Amiri said on Tuesday he supported only a partial recount. Abadi called the fire a deliberate act and said the attorney general would bring charges against those who are trying to undermine the political process. An Iraqi court ordered the arrest of four people accused of setting fire to the storage site. Three of them were policemen and one an employee of the elections commission. Abadi said a preliminary report had provided evidence of gasoline at multiple areas inside the storage site. It also showed that security cameras had been disabled and no locks had been broken, implying it was carried out by someone with access to the storage site. Iraqi authorities said the ballot boxes had been rescued but the fire has fuelled fears of violence. Sadr has warned that certain parties are trying to drag Iraq into a civil war, adding that he would not participate in one. Abadi thanked Sadr for a disarmament initiative he floated after a weapons cache at his Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City exploded, killing 18 people, and said he hoped the cleric would stick to it. “I welcome Sayed Moqtada’s announcement that his followers commit to not having weapons outside the framework of the state. We consider this good,” he said, adding that those responsible for the explosion would be brought to justice. “What happened in Sadr City is very regrettable, it is a crime. Those responsible will receive their just punishment.” Sadr, who ordered his own separate investigation into the incident, said on Tuesday he had identified the culprit who was now on the run and that he would be brought to justice.

2018-06-13,"(Repeats to more subscribers, no changes to text) MAPUTO, June 12 (Reuters) - Britain advised citizens on Tuesday against travelling to an area in northeastern Mozambique after a series of attacks by groups with links to Islamic militants. At least 17 people have been killed - 10 of them beheaded -since May in the town of Palma, near the Tanzanian border. The UK joins in the United States in issuing a warning about the attacks. “The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advise against all but essential travel to the districts of Palma, Mocimboa de Praia and Macomia in Cabo Delgado province due to an increase in attacks by groups with links to Islamic extremism,” the office said in a warning posted on its website. Palma is near one of the world’s biggest untapped offshore gas fields, and Anadarko Petroleum is seeking to raise $14 billion to $15 billion for a liquefied natural gas project in the region. The company has said it was monitoring the situation. It declined to comment on reports that it has suspended work on its project. Canada-based Wentworth Resources said the security situation was part of the reason it sought a one-year extension for its appraisal license in the region. “This has prevented safe access to the area for Wentworth staff and contractors. The Company continues to monitor the situation closely,” it said in statement posted on its website. Six men wielding machetes killed at least seven people and injured four others this month in the predominantly Muslim region. Ten people were beheaded last month, and local media reported at least two were children. Mozambique has not been a focal point of Islamist militant activity in the past and police have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists.

2018-06-13,"(Repeats June 12 story, adds TV to media slug) * Plans petrochems boost to counter risk of oil slowdown * Wants to lift refining capacity to 8-10 mln bpd by 2030 * Aramco plans world’s biggest IPO next year By Rania El Gamal DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, June 12 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude, and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to lessen the risk of a slowdown in oil demand. Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, is expanding its footprint globally by signing downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its plants, ahead of an initial public offering next year - the largest IPO in history. The state oil giant is moving ahead with multi-billion-dollar projects in China, India and Malaysia and aims to finalise new partnerships this year, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, Aramco’s senior vice president for downstream, told Reuters. Aramco plans to raise its refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels per day, from some 5 million bpd now, and double its petrochemicals production by 2030, he added. Aramco pumps around 10 million bpd of crude oil. “Our strategy is very simple. We want to be at 8 to 10 million barrels per day of participated (refining) capacity ... (and) we are going forward by trying to be a top leader in chemicals by 2040,” Judaimi said. “The market that we want to grow in ... has to be growing, a strong market, with good demand and of course these assets have to be integrated to the whole value chain of the downstream,” he said in an interview at Aramco’s headquarters in Dhahran. To help it reach these targets, Aramco has entered a 50 percent joint venture with three Indian refiners to build a $44 billion, 1.2-million-bpd refinery integrated with petrochemical facilities on India’s west coast. Aramco has said it may introduce a strategic partner to share its 50 percent stake in the Indian refining venture. Judaimi said Aramco was working with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) towards securing a partnership. It would be the first time for the two national oil companies to join hands in an international venture. “We are now finalising the MOU (with ADNOC) that would cover certain commercial principles between us,” he said, adding that the memorandum of understanding would be finalised this year. He said front-end engineering for the project could start by early 2019. Apart from India, Aramco is also taking a 50 percent stake in Petronas’ huge RAPID project in the southern Malaysian state of Johor. Aramco hopes this will help it dominate supplies in India and Malaysia, two of the world’s fastest-growing oil markets after China, and where growth potential is bigger than in other, more developed regions. Aramco is eyeing three separate refining and petrochemical projects in China, Judaimi said. “Asia has to have the lion’s share ... We believe markets east of the Suez Canal will continue to grow, including the Middle East as well,” Judaimi said, adding that the United States is “another market we want to grow in”. In April, Aramco said it was integrating a petrochemicals business into its subsidiary Motiva, the United States’ biggest oil refinery. Aramco is strengthening its refining role in China, one of its biggest customers. It has a refinery joint venture with Sinopec and Exxon Mobil and is in talks with CNPC to finalise the purchase of a stake in a 260,000-bpd refinery in Yunnan. Judaimi said he expects to take a final investment decision on the Yunnan refinery, which is operational, by the end of this year. “We are in the final stage of negotiations. It’s like building a house - the last touches take much longer.” Aramco plans to build a 300,000-bpd refinery with China’s Norinco. Judaimi said he expects to finish front-end engineering for the Norinco project by mid-2019, following which the company will take its final investment decision. Judaimi said Aramco had also started negotiations for a third refinery in China. “It’s a smart refinery with higher conversion of liquids into chemicals,” he said, declining to give details. Aramco has been integrating its refining with petrochemicals to help the company expand its market share and refined products portfolio. The company is betting on growing demand for fuel in India and Southeast Asia but also shifting more into petrochemicals in case those consumption forecasts prove too optimistic. “In the long term, we are thinking of investing more into chemicals,” he said. “We know the world needs chemicals ... as populations grow they need more plastic,” he added. One centrepiece of Aramco’s push into chemicals is a project it is building at home with Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company. The $20 billion project with SABIC is to build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly, bypassing the refining stage. Judaimi said Aramco would make a final investment decision by the end of 2019. “This is a very critical programme and we are going to do all we can to make it happen,” Judaimi said. “We believe we are the last man standing in terms of energy supply. Our cost position on the upstream side, our reliability, our location and our infrastructure are all competitive advantages to us.” (Reporting by Rania El Gamal; Editing by Dale Hudson)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-downstream/rpt-exclusive-saudi-aramco-eyes-partnerships-as-it-expands-refining-petrochems-idUKL8N1TE423,13 Jun 2018,"Saudi Aramco

Trade frictions between the United States and China were also back on radar ahead of Friday, when Washington has said it will release a list of some $50 billion worth of Chinese goods that will be subject to a 25 percent tariff. Spread-betters expect all major European indexes including Britain’s FTSE, France’s Cac and Germany’s Dax to open flat to slightly higher. But MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5 percent, erasing the slim gains made following Tuesday’s meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “For Asian markets, tariffs will be the biggest concerns in the near term,” said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. In a stark reminder of the potential damage from the trade dispute, Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp fell as much as 41.5 percent, wiping off about $3 billion of its market value, as it resumed trade after agreeing to pay up to $1.4 billion in penalties to the U.S. government. Its Shenzhen shares fell by their 10 percent limit. The CSI300 index of mainland shares fell 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei eked out gains of 0.5 percent, thanks to a dip in the yen and following a 0.17 percent gain in the U.S. S&P 500 <.SPX > the previous day. On Wall Street, technology shares continued to lead the rally, with the Nasdaq Composite adding 0.57 percent to finish at record high of 7,703. Trump and Kim promised in a joint statement to work toward the “denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula, but they offered few specifics. With the summit out of the way, the market focus is quickly shifting to the Fed’s two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday and a European Central Bank decision on Thursday. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year after a move in March, but the bigger question for investors is the outlook for future monetary tightening amid an ongoing economic expansion. “With a rate hike almost fully priced in, the focus is on how many times the Fed will raise rates this year and next and how much beyond the levels it considers as neutral to the economy, or what they call the longer-run rates,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy group at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. Projections from the Fed’s March meeting suggest a benchmark rate of 2.1 percent at end of 2018, based on the median forecast of central bank policymakers, which would mean three rate hikes in total this year. In the currency market, the dollar was relatively well bid ahead of the Fed’s meeting. The euro traded at $1.1744, off last week’s high of $1.1840 touched on June 7 though it was underpinned by expectations that the ECB may drop a hint of winding up its stimulus after its policy meeting this week. The dollar stood at 110.50 44 yen, near its highest levels in about three weeks. Some emerging market currencies stayed under pressure on worries higher U.S. rates could prompt fund outflows from emerging markets to the United States. The Mexican peso hit a 16-month low of 20.724 peso to the dollar on while the South African rand dropped to a six-month low of 13.345 per dollar, extending its decline, triggered by disappointing GDP data last week. Oil prices dropped after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a surprise build of 833,000 barrels in U.S. crude stockpiles. Analysts had expected a decline of 2.7 million barrels. Expectations that output cuts led by producer cartel OPEC could be loosened also continued to weigh on prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $66.05 per barrel, down 0.5 percent. Elsewhere, bitcoin fell to a 2-1/2-month low of $6,461 at Bitstamp exchange on Tuesday on mounting regulatory and security concerns after the weekend hacking of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail.

2018-06-13,"HANOI, June 13 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical is considering the sale of a further stake in the company ahead of a possible listing in April next year on the country’s main bourse, its chief executive said on Wednesday. The funds would be used for an upgrade of its Dung Quat refinery, aiming to raise capacity to at least 192,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 148,000 bpd now and to allow it to process more types of crude oil. Chief executive Tran Ngoc Nguyen told Reuters the stake sale, which will follow a $245 million initial public offering in January, would be through a private placement or auction. The initial sale of a 7.79 percent stake in the refinery was part of the Vietnamese government’s plan to privatise hundreds of state-owned enterprises to boost their performance, relax a tight state budget and reform an economy that is highly reliant on foreign investments. Shares of the company have been trading on the unlisted public company market, or UPCoM, since March, and Nguyen said they would be listed on the Hochiminh Stock Exchange, the country’s main bourse, by April next year. Vietnam’s first refinery, Dung Quat began operations in 2009 and was initially designed to process light sweet crude oil, mostly sourced from the Bach Ho field offshore Vietnam. The upgrade will enable the plant to process sour crude oil as well, Nguyen said, and will also allow it to produce more petrochemical products. Binh Son said in a statement on Wednesday that it will select an engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the upgrade next year. Nguyen said seven companies had registered to bid for the contract, but declined to name them. Binh Son said in the statement its net profit in the first half of this year was estimated at 2.95 trillion dong ($129 million), about 85 percent of its full-year target.

2018-06-13,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Thermal coal and gas prices have coursed into a bull run, propelled by particularly strong demand across Asia, where electricity consumption is surging thanks to healthy economic growth just as seasonal needs rise with the start of summer. Spot thermal coal cargo prices for export from Australia’s Newcastle terminal GCLNWCPFBMc1 last settled at $117 per tonne, the highest level since February 2012. That is up by more than 130 percent from 2016’s record lows. Coal prices have not just been pushed up by firm demand, which has recovered from 2015 lows, but also by several mine  closures and weak investment into capacity expansion. In gas markets, spot prices for Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) LNG-AS are at almost $10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) - a 2018 high, and up by 145 percent from 2016 troughs. “Japanese and South Korean (LNG) storage ended the winter at the lowest levels for at least five years,” said Nicholas Browne, senior gas analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “Given the strength of Chinese demand last winter, Japanese and Korean buyers utilities want to ensure that storage is full before the winter of 2018/2019 to avoid being caught out, said Browne. A procurement official at a Japanese utility said power generators were also stocking up their coal reserves ahead of high electricity demand in summer as the nation switches on air conditioning. Delays in restarting off-line nuclear power stations in Japan and South Korea also pushed prices higher, Browne said, adding that he saw “spot Asian LNG prices ending the year at close to $12 per mmBtu”. Thermal coal and gas are the most commonly used fossil fuels for electricity generation. Fuel oil, used in Asia for power generation as well, has also seen a recent boom. The surge in prices is costing utilities dearly in North Asia’s economic powerhouses. The world’s second- and third-biggest economies, China and Japan respectively, rely heavily on imports, as does South Korea. “The current market-based coal price is almost unbearable for us,” said a senior official with China’s second-largest utilities operator China Huaneng Group, declining to be named because he wasn’t authorised to speak to media. He added, however, that strong industrial demand for electricity was in turn generating healthy revenue, and that cheaper long-term coal supply contracts under government price controls were shielding the company from some of the high import costs. The bull run in fuel demand and prices is a boon for producers. Australia’s Whitehaven Coal (WHC.AX) has seen its share price chasing records for much of this year. Meanwhile LNG specialist Santos (STO.AX) in May fended off a $10.8 billion takeover bid by an investor group that was keen to get a share in the booming market. Coal and gas usually take their lead from oil markets, yet that’s not been the case recently. Although oil prices LOCc1 have also risen this year, in part due to healthy demand but mostly because of voluntary production cuts led by producer cartel OPEC. But crude markets have more recently come under pressure following rising output from all three of the world’s top producers, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia.

2018-06-13,"* Asia ex-Japan dips, Nikkei posts slim gains * Fed rate hike priced in, focus on pace of future tightening * Concerns about U.S. tariffs on China dog Asian shares By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, June 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped back on Wednesday as investors looked to the Federal Reserve policy decision later in the day and any clues it might give on future rate hikes, shifting focus away from the historic U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5 percent, erasing the slim gains they made following Tuesday’s meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trade frictions between the United States and China are also back on radar ahead of Friday, by when Washington has said it will release a list of some $50 billion worth of Chinese goods that will be subject to a 25 percent tariff. “For Asian markets, tariffs will be the biggest concerns in the near term,” said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. Japan’s Nikkei eked out gains of 0.25 percent, following the 0.17 percent gains in the U.S. S&P 500 <.SPX > the previous day. On Wall Street, technology shares continued to lead the rally, with the Nasdaq Composite adding 0.57 percent to finish at record high of 7,703. With the U.S.-North Korea summit out of the way, market focus is quickly shifting to the Fed’s two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year after a move in March, but the bigger question for investors is the outlook for future monetary tightening amid an ongoing economic expansion. “With a rate hike almost fully priced in, the focus is on how many times the Fed will raise rates this year and next and how much beyond the levels it considers as neutral to the economy, or what they call the longer-run rates,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy group at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. Projections from the Fed’s March meeting suggest a benchmark rate of 2.1 percent at end of 2018, based on the median forecast of central bank policymakers, which would mean three rate hikes in total this year. In the currency market, the dollar was relatively well bid ahead of the Fed’s meeting. The euro traded at $1.1744, off last week’s high of $1.1840 touched on June 7 though it was underpinned by expectations that the European Central Bank may drop a hint of winding up its stimulus after its policy meeting on Thursday. The dollar stood at 110.50 44 yen, near its highest levels in about three weeks. Some emerging market currencies stayed under pressure on worries higher U.S. rates could prompt fund outflows from emerging markets to the United States. The Mexican peso hit a 16-month low of 20.724 peso to the dollar on while the South African rand dropped to a six-month low of 13.345 per dollar, extending its decline, triggered by disappointing GDP data last week. Oil prices dropped after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a surprise build of 833,000 barrels in U.S. crude stockpiles. Analysts had expected a decline of 2.7 million barrels. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $66.00 per barrel, down 0.5 percent.

2018-06-13,"(Fixes typo in text) PARIS, June 13 (Reuters) - France’s main farm union called early on Wednesday for protestors to continue a blockade of refineries and fuel depots after the government failed to ease their concerns. “We have worked a lot but we did not get enough. We are disappointed given farmers’ involvement,” Christiane Lambert, head of the FNSEA which organised the protests, said after meeting with Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert. She called farmers to hold blockades until at least the morning. Talks lasted until around 0300 local time (0100 GMT). Oil and gas major Total said on Tuesday that 3.5 percent of its petrol stations in France had run out of fuel on the second day of the blockade disrupted distribution. The protests were triggered by France’s decision to allow Total to use imported palm oil at a biofuel plant, which would compete with biodiesel made from locally produced oilseed crops, further souring relations between the EU’s biggest farm sector and the government of President Emmanuel Macron.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.15 percent in early trade, giving up the slim gains they made following Tuesday’s meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

2018-06-13,"* Many analysts expect OPEC, Russia to gradually increase output * OPEC, non-OPEC producers due to meet on June 22 in Vienna * Output from top 3 producers has been rising recently By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, pulled down by rising supplies in the United States and expectations that voluntary production cuts led by producer cartel OPEC could be loosened. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $75.49 per barrel at 0005 GMT, down 39 cents, or 0.5 percent, from ther last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $65.92 a barrel, down 44 cents, or 0.7 percent from their last settlement. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with some non-OPEC producers including Russia, started withholding output in 2017 to reduce a global supply overhang and push up prices. The group is due to meet on June 22 in Vienna, Austria, to discuss future production policy. “The prospect of easing supply curbs from OPEC-led producers continues to be reflected in oil’s overall depressed price action,” said Lukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM. In the United States, the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported on Tuesday that crude oil inventories rose by 830,000 barrels in the week to June 8, to 433.7 million. The rising stocks are in part a result of the surge in U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by 28 percent in the last two years, to a record 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd). With output in Russia rising back above 11 million bpd in June and Saudi production jumping back above 10 million bpd, supplies from the top three producers are rising. “With rising production from U.S. shale adding to oil’s woes and reviving oversupply concerns, further downside could be a possibility in the short to medium term,” Otunuga said. Official U.S. production and inventory data is due to be published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) later on Wednesday.
