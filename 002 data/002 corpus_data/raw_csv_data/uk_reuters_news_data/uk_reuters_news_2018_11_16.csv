2018-11-16,"(Reuters) - The chief of California’s top utilities regulator said on Friday he was shocked to learn that reassurances he made to investors about PG&E (PCG.N) caused the embattled power utility’s stock to surge over 40 percent in a matter of minutes. PG&E’s stock had slumped over 60 percent since the state’s deadliest-ever wildfire broke out last week on fears that without help from California’s government, the utility could go bankrupt should it eventually be found responsible. The fire destroyed the town of Paradise and has killed at least 63 people. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker told Reuters on Friday that utilities must be able to borrow money cheaply in order to properly serve ratepayers. That echoed comments he made on an investor conference call organized by Bank of America on Thursday, when he said he could not imagine allowing the state’s largest utility to go into bankruptcy. Picker was surprised hours later on Thursday to learn that PG&E’s stock had surged over 40 percent in extended trading in reaction to his comments. “I was stunned and terrified,” Picker said. “I left the call yesterday and I went back to a workshop I was in, so I didn’t find out about it until several hours later.” Picker’s market-moving remarks to a private group were unusual, in part because public companies and their executives must follow federal rules aimed at avoiding selective disclosure of material news, but a government official or other outside parties sharing an outlook on a public company does not face the same obligations, experts say. PG&E shares on Friday closed up 37.54 percent at $24.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is still down about 50 percent from before the fire started, erasing nearly $13 billion in market capitalization. The cause of the Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise remains under investigation. With PG&E potentially facing mounting costs from wildfires, the regulator would also consider potential options to restructure the company, including separating its electricity and gas units, Picker told Reuters. Keeping Wall Street interested in investing in PG&E and other California utilities is key to reducing the state’s carbon emissions and making the power system more efficient, he said. “I don’t think we over-reward people. ... But we want to make sure that we can continue to keep the lights on, and be cleaner and cleaner, and ideally more reliable.” GRAPHIC: PG&E shares surge after Thursday's close on utility regulator's comments - tmsnrt.rs/2QNMYF1 California state Senator Bill Dodd told Reuters it was “too soon” to speculate about future legislation that might provide relief to PG&E in case it is found liable for the Camp Fire. Dodd sponsored legislation passed this year that lets utilities pass some of the costs related to liability from wildfires on to ratepayers, but the bill did not specifically provide for 2018. GRAPHIC: Fire Fear - tmsnrt.rs/2PyMu9a Citigroup on Friday upgraded PG&E’s stock to “buy” from “neutral.”  “Given the reaction in the stock market, we think there was an appropriate level of urgency that something needed to be done,” Citigroup analysts wrote, referring to the regulator’s statement.  The price for PG&E’s more than $18 billion of bonds also rose. The price of the March 2034 694308GE1= bond was up about 5 points in afternoon trading after earlier trading as much as 11 points higher. PG&E’s debt was pressured earlier this week after the utility borrowed $3.3 billion under its credit lines and warned it could face liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage should its equipment be found to have caused the fire. The gains in bond prices came even after both Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s cut their credit ratings on PG&E late Thursday to just one notch above junk bond territory and said the outlook remained negative.  Fitch Ratings on Friday also downgraded the utility’s long-term issuer default ratings. With the collapse in its bond prices this week, most of PG&E’s bonds were trading as though they were already speculative-grade securities, although Friday’s recovery brought many of them back in line with comparably low-investment-grade-rated corporate bonds. PG&E has about $500 million of floating rate notes maturing in two weeks and does not face another maturing security until October 2020.  That October 2020 $800 million bond, with a 3.5 percent coupon 694308GT8=RRPS, yielded more than 10 percent at one point in trading on Thursday, the first of PG&E’s securities to have breached that threshold. On Friday, the October 2020 note was up more than 4 points to 95.25 cents on the dollar, with the yield dropping to 6.24 percent. Shares of Edison International (EIX.N), whose Southern California Edison subsidiary provides power in Southern California, jumped 15 percent. While investors view it as at less risk than PG&E to massive liabilities from wildfires, its stock has been volatile over the past week as a second fire burned in that region. The Woolsey Fire in Southern California also remains under investigation.   The volatility in PG&E shares has drawn a rush of trading in options. Traders are betting the stock will remain prone to wild gyrations in the near term.

2018-11-16,"HOUSTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - BP Plc’s trading arm on Friday entered a tolling agreement with the owners of an idled oil refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, cementing plans to bring the plant back online six years after it was idled by previous owners, the company said. Under BP’s tolling agreement with Limetree Bay Refining LLC, owner of the idled Hovensa refinery, BP will supply the facility with crude and sell its products, low-sulfur fuels that will meet an International Maritime Organization mandate in 2020, it said in a statement. BP declined to comment further. Limetree did not respond to requests for comment. Limetree, owned by private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC, is investing $1.5 billion to bring the Hovensa refinery, one of the largest such facilities in the world, back online by late 2019, with plans to process 200,000 barrels per day (bpd). It aims to produce low-sulfur fuels that satisfy the International Maritime Organization rule calling for large vessels to switch by 2020 to fuels containing no more than 0.5 percent sulfur from 3.5 percent. The rule is widely expected to spur new demand for the distillates the refinery would produce. Limetree’s facility has more than 1,100 construction workers on site and has brought online 25 million barrels of crude storage capacity.

2018-11-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil ended slightly firmer after volatile trading on Friday, supported by expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree to cut output next month, though prices fell for the sixth straight week amid global oversupply concerns. OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia is keen for the major producers to cut output by about 1.4 million barrels per day, around 1.5 percent of global supply, to support the market, sources told Reuters this week. But other producers, including Russia, have been reluctant to agree to a cut.   Brent LCOc1 settled up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $66.76 a barrel. The global benchmark fell 4.6 percent in the week, the sixth consecutive decline.  U.S. crude CLc1 settled unchanged at $56.46 a barrel after trading between $55.89 and $57.96. The contract, which had its steepest one-day loss in more than three years on Tuesday, fell 5.6 percent in the week, also its sixth straight weekly decline.  After Tuesday’s sharp fall, the market was due for a slight correction, and was now stabilizing, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.  “A relief rally was in the cards,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. OPEC is likely to be spurred to action as U.S. production continues to climb, he said.  Still, the day’s gains were likely to be limited as traders were cautious going into the weekend, he said. “It would take a brave soul to go home really long this weekend considering the slaughter we’ve had in the past eight weeks.”  OPEC ministers meet on Dec. 6 in Vienna to decide on production policy for the next six months amid a growing surplus in world markets. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA reached another record last week, at 11.7 million barrels per day, government data showed. The record output contributed to the biggest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles C-STK-T-EIA in nearly two years. U.S. drillers added two oil rigs this week, bringing the total count to 888, still the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report . RIG-OL-USA-BHI The rig count is seen as an indicator of future production growth. The United States imposed sanctions on Iranian oil exports this month and Iranian crude exports have fallen sharply in recent months, although Washington cushioned the blow by granting some temporary exemptions. Other oil producers have more than compensated for the lost Iranian oil and most analysts now see a significant supply surplus with inventories building, putting pressure on prices. Fearing a repeat of the 2014 price rout, OPEC is widely expected to start trimming output soon. This could produce a swift price rebound, some analysts say, especially if production falls further in Venezuela and Libya. “We are likely from December onwards to have at least 1 million barrels per day (bpd) less of (Iranian) crude exports,” Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas, told Reuters Global Oil Forum. Tchilinguirian said he would not be surprised if Brent recovered to $80 this year. Also supporting prices, Iraq resumed exporting oil from its northern Kirkuk oilfields on Friday, pumping 50,000-100,000 bpd, an oil ministry spokesman said. Some analysts had expected the volumes to be much higher, at closer to 300,000 bpd.     Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options in New York and London during the week ended Nov. 13 by 8,259 contracts to 165,121, the lowest since June 27, 2017, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. Brent speculators on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) cut net longs by 45,216 contracts to 214,832 in the week, also the lowest since June 27, 2017.

2018-11-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar weakened and Treasury yields slid on Friday after a top Federal Reserve official said U.S. interest rates were near a neutral rate, while the S&P 500 ended positive after a seesaw session helped by optimism over U.S.-China trade ties.  Oil prices steadied but still posted their sixth straight week of losses. Uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union clouded currency and other markets. Markets were shaken by comments made by Richard Clarida, newly appointed Fed vice chair, in a CNBC interview that U.S. interest rates were nearing Fed estimates of a neutral rate, and being at neutral “makes sense.”     He also said there was “some evidence of global slowing.” While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates in December, the number of hikes next year is a matter of debate. “The big driver right now is Fed speech,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “Clarida indicated a modestly dovish bent on Fed policy, and not a particularly aggressive stance.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 123.95 points, or 0.49 percent, to 25,413.22, the S&P 500 gained 5.94 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,736.14 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.16 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,247.87. Clarida’s comments helped support stocks, which were also boosted by comments from President Donald Trump on trade.  Trump said he may not impose more tariffs on Chinese goods after Beijing sent the United States a list of measures it was willing to take to resolve trade tensions. “The market is paying attention very closely to anything surrounding trade,” said Veronica Willis, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “(A trade deal) would boost expectations for global growth, which would ultimately be good for stocks.” Investors are pointing toward the G20 meeting later this month, when leaders from the United States and China are expected to meet, and the Fed’s meeting in December as key events for markets. Weighing on equity sentiment and the Nasdaq was a disappointing forecast by chip company Nvidia Corp. Nvidia shares tumbled 18.8 percent while the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 1.2 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.35 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.20 percent as traders waited on more clarity involving Britain’s exit from the EU, known as Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May won the backing of the most prominent Brexiteer in her government as she fought to save a draft EU divorce deal that has stirred up a plot to force her out of her job. After tumbling a day earlier, sterling was last trading at $1.2825, up 0.40 percent, while the euro was  up 0.78 percent to $1.1414. “Sterling volatility has woken up from its 100-year slumber and is likely to remain reactive,” said Ulrich Leuchtmannan, FX strategist at Commerzbank.

2018-11-16,"* Kirkuk exports had been halted since October 2017 * Iraq took over Kirkuk after failed Kurdish independence vote * Washington was pressing Baghdad, Erbil to find compromise * Current flows still modest, not clear when will rise (Adds U.S. State Department comment) By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ahmed Rasheed LONDON/BAGHDAD, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Iraq on Friday restarted exports of Kirkuk oil, halted a year ago due to a standoff between the central government and Kurdistan’s semi-autonomous region, after a new government in Baghdad agreed a tentative deal with Erbil. The development is a win for the U.S. government, which has been urging both sides to settle the dispute and resume flows to help address a shortage of Iranian crude in the region after Washington imposed new sanctions on Tehran. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Twitter that resumption of exports of Kirkuk oil was “another important step in our efforts to reduce Iran’s oil exports.” Flows resumed at a modest level of around 50,000-60,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with a peak of 300,000 bpd seen last year and it was not clear when and by how much they would rise, industry sources said. The Kirkuk crude is being exported to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan by a pipeline crossing Kurdistan. A spokesman for Iraq’s Oil Ministry, Asim Jihad, confirmed exports had restarted, adding that an agreement had been reached to resume flows at 50,000-100,000 bpd. “The resumption of Kirkuk shipments of between 50,000 and 100,000 barrels per day will not add to Iraq’s total exports,” Jihad said. Oil prices rose, with Brent crude up more than $1 per barrel, supported partially by the lower-than-expected flows from Kurdistan. The deal signals that new Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban are ready to work with Erbil despite previous tensions and a failed independence referendum in September 2017. The halting of exports from Kirkuk in October 2017 stopped almost 300,000 bpd flowing out of Iraq towards Turkey and international markets - causing a net revenue loss of some $8 billion over the past year. Most of Iraq’s exports come from southern fields, but Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Exports had been on hold since Iraqi government forces retook Kirkuk from Kurdish authorities in 2017. The Kurds had taken control of Kirkuk and its oilfields after Islamic State militants drove the Iraqi army out in 2014, and Kurdish forces, in turn, ejected the militants. A pipeline Baghdad once used for export via Turkey was wrecked by Islamic State - leaving only one working. Kurdistan is producing and exporting some 400,000 bpd via the pipeline. Resumed flows from Kirkuk will lift this to 450,000-500,000 bpd, but short of the 700,000 bpd the Kurdish region had exported at some point last year. Iraqi authorities say they still need to feed local refineries, where Kirkuk’s output has been diverted over the past year. The refineries are set to receive some 185,000 bpd under the latest deal, the sources said. Baghdad and Erbil have yet to find a compromise over maximum flow levels as well as budget transfers from the central government to Erbil - something the two sides have struggled to agree on for many years.

2018-11-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would nominate the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, to take on the position permanently.  Wheeler, a long-time Washington insider known to shun the spotlight, took the reins at the EPA in July after former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned. Pruitt faced a slew of ethics controversies that included his first-class travel, round-the-clock security detail, and expensive office equipment. Wheeler has done a “fantastic job, and I want to congratulate him,” Trump said as he announced his decision during a Medal of Freedom ceremony at the White House. He had previously hinted that Wheeler might be nominated. Trump will have to formally nominate Wheeler and then the U.S. Senate will vote on his confirmation, an expected outcome as the chamber is led by Trump’s fellow Republicans. In Wheeler, Trump has seen another avid supporter of his deregulatory agenda and advocate for the fossil fuels industry, but without the constant criticism over alleged mismanagement that had plagued Pruitt. Wheeler had worked at the EPA in the 1990s and later in the Senate under Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, a skeptic of mainstream climate science, before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant. He has said that he is “not at all ashamed” of his lobbying for the coal company Murray Energy Corp, the focus of criticism by environmentalists. Wheeler had also lobbied for utility Xcel Energy Inc and consulted for biofuels industry group Growth Energy, agricultural merchant and biofuels producer Archer Daniels Midland Co and International Paper Co, according to his public disclosures. He has been in his latest EPA job for more than 100 days, one of the longest tenures for an acting chief at the agency in decades. Wheeler has said that EPA, under his leadership, would take the same course as under Pruitt, prioritizing cleaning up industrial Superfund sites, areas contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the EPA as a candidate for cleanup, and financing investments in water infrastructure.

2018-11-16,"BOGOTA, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Private oil producers in Colombia said on Friday they are optimistic about promises by President Ivan Duque to improve security and bolster the sector. Duque, who has been in office for 101 days, pledged during his campaign to lower taxes on businesses and improve security for crude producers in the country, where leftist rebels regularly bomb pipelines and community protests sometimes stymie output. “We’re seeing progress - we have all the confidence in the world in the administration,” said Occidental Petroleum chief executive Vicki Hollub, on the sidelines of an oil and gas conference in Bogota. Occidental operates the Cano Limon field in eastern Arauca province. The Cano Limon pipeline, run by state oil company Ecopetrol, has been offline for most of the year because of attacks by the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels. Production and exports from the field have remained normal despite the bombings because Ecopetrol is able to use the smaller Bicentenario pipeline for transport. Though the pipeline is currently shut, it was attacked repeatedly last weekend. Hollub, who said Occidental hopes to more than double its 30,000 barrels per day net output in the coming years, was optimistic about the security situation. “The military is incredible here.” Oil companies may be among those who benefit from a proposed tax cut to corporations that is wending its way through Congress. The government wants to reduce duties on businesses to 30 percent over the next four years, down from 35 percent. Other private producers were more cautious. “It’s still early but all the signs are positive,” said Frontera Energy chief executive Richard Herbert. “What we need now is security in prospective, less developed areas,” he said, adding that blocks won by Frontera back in 2010 in southern Caqueta and Putumayo provinces have not been developed because of ongoing security worries. Herbert said he hoped there would be a new bidding round in 2019 so further oil areas could be opened to exploration. Colombia has repeatedly delayed its deadline to receive offers for 15 onshore areas at its Sinu-San Jacinto auction. The round would be the first since 2014. Frontera estimates its average production will end 2018 at 66,000 bpd, some 57,000 of which comes from fields in Colombia. Speaking at the close of the conference, mines and energy minister Maria Fernanda Suarez said she was confident the oil sector would continue to contribute to the country’s development and its bid to become energy self-sufficient.

2018-11-16,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QN4usW By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Global oil markets are increasingly over-supplied with light distillates, such as gasoline, while there are not enough middle distillates, such as diesel, which has opened a big price differential between the two fuels. To keep meeting healthy demand for mid-distillates, refiners are processing high volumes of crude and creating a glut of gasoline. U.S. gasoline prices for delivery in June 2019 are trading just $7 per barrel above benchmark Brent futures for the same month, compared with a premium of $18 per barrel for low-sulphur distillate fuel oil. Early in October, the gap in cracking margins was much narrower, with premiums of $14 and $17 per barrel over Brent respectively, but since then gasoline prices have slumped amid fears of over-supply. Gasoline prices have been hit by a combination of record refinery processing in the third quarter and flattening consumption from U.S. motorists which have left the market carrying record stocks for the time of year. Diesel prices, on the other hand, have been supported by strong demand from the freight, manufacturing and mining sectors as well as from oil and gas drillers themselves. Distillate prices are also being supported by the prospect of even higher consumption from the start of 2020 when new pollution regulations on bunker fuels used in the shipping industry come into force. Regulations adopted by the International Maritime Organization will require shipping firms to switch from using heavy fuel oil to middle distillates unless they install expensive scrubbers to clean up their sulphur emissions. Differential growth in light and middle distillate consumption is not a new problem (tmsnrt.rs/2QN4usW). Gasoline and diesel consumption are driven by different factors which means that growth rates differ more often than they are the same. Gasoline consumption is more weighted towards private motorists while distillate is geared towards commercial freight transport, aviation, manufacturing, farming, mining and oil and gas production. Gasoline is weighted regionally towards the United States and Japan while distillate is weighted more towards Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. As a result, gasoline use tends to be steadier across the business cycle while distillate consumption varies much more with the state of the economy. In a typical expansion, gasoline consumption tends to dominate in the early stages while distillate growth takes over as the cycle becomes more mature. If the expansion or contraction is synchronised globally, the impact on distillate demand becomes much more pronounced than if it is concentrated in only a few regions. Late-cycle growth in distillate demand during 2017 and 2018 has left inventories relatively low while the introduction of new IMO regulations threatens to tighten them even further in 2019 and 2020. CO-PRODUCTION Like any commodity market, even small imbalances between the production and consumption of individual fuels can have an outsized impact on prices. But gasoline and distillate are co-products from the same refining process, so refiners have no option but to cope with the resulting large swings in margins. Refiners have some flexibility to change the ratio in which they produce light and middle distillates by altering the slate of crudes they process and running their fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units in max-distillate rather than max-gasoline mode but the flexibility is quite limited. For the most part, the market for individual fuels is made to balance through changes in prices and consumer behaviour. Rising distillate prices will force the freight transportation sector to focus on improving fuel economy by trimming schedules, consolidating loads, switching from air freight to ocean shipping, and slow steaming. Freight and logistics firms have considerable scope to cut fuel consumption by reducing part loads, minimising empty backhauls and switching away from air freight, sacrificing delivery speed for improved fuel economy. Shipping companies can also achieve large reductions in fuel consumption by making even a small reduction in sailing speed. In a period of high fuel prices, shipping companies can trade increased sailing times, smaller schedules and larger fleets (higher capital costs) for reduced fuel consumption (lower operating costs). The growing gap between diesel and gasoline prices will also accelerate the shift away from diesel towards gasoline for private motor cars and fleet vehicles especially in Europe. Government regulations and taxation policies are already favouring the sale of gasoline and electric vehicles rather than diesel cars, but the fuel price differential will speed up the shift. In Britain, for example, the average retail price of diesel is now more than 8 pence per litre (6 percent) higher than gasoline and the gap has almost doubled since the end of August. British sales of diesel cars have already fallen by almost 31 percent in the first 10 months of 2018 compared 2017, accounting for just 32 percent of new sales down from 43 percent the previous year. Petrol car sales rose by 9 percent over the same period and their share grew to 62 percent from 53 percent, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Reduced diesel consumption in favour of gasoline in Europe will play an important role in helping make more middle distillates available for the shipping industry in 2020. The biggest source of uncertainty for both refiners and middle distillate consumers is the outlook for the global economy in 2019 and 2020. Synchronised global growth provided a big boost to middle distillate consumption in 2017 tightening the market considerably. But global freight volumes have grown much more slowly in 2018 as the economy has lost momentum, easing some of the pressure on distillate supplies. If the global economy continues to slow or tips into recession in 2019, the looming distillate shortage will largely disappear, and distillate margins will soften. If the global economy accelerates again, however, then strong freight demand coupled with the new IMO regulations will likely push the premium for distillate fuels even higher.

2018-11-16,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria is backtracking on some economic reforms such as cutting costly subsidies as the country wants to minimise the risk of protests before presidential elections next year, according to the budget data and experts. The North African oil producer country had said at the start of the year subsidies for fuel and other products would be lowered from 2019 to rein in spending following a fall in oil revenues from 2014 to 2017. It gave no specifics. But its draft budget for next year includes a 7 percent increase in subsidy spending, accounting for 21 percent of the budget. The rise will be used to subsidise basic food items including milk and cereals as well as housing, officials say. The government had also approved this year higher and new taxes for some products and increases in subsidised fuel prices for the third straight year. But no new such hikes are planned for next year, according to the draft. Analysts said a rise in oil prices this year had made officials confident of being able to postpone cuts in subsidies, part of welfare spending to discourage dissent, without straining public finances. Speaking to Reuters, central bank governor Mohamed Loukal noted that the 2019 budget assumes oil prices at $50 a barrel, whereas benchmark crude prices are around $67, and hit $87 last month. Finance Minister Abderrahmane Raouia signalled the change in tack this month. “Our subsidy policy will be maintained because Algerian citizens still need it,” he said, without giving  details. Algeria has avoided upheaval like other Arab countries but riots broke out in 2011 over a rise in sugar and cooking oil prices. This year doctors and teachers went on strike for months over work conditions, while the unemployment rate remains at around 11 percent. Youth unemployment is believed to be higher. “(The) next elections require a stable social policy. It would be wrong to upset people (by cutting subsidies),” said economics professor Abderrahmane Aya. The ruling coalition has called on President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to seek a fifth term in the election in April. The 81-year old, in office since 1999, has not yet said whether he would stand. The economy has improved in recent months. Oil and gas revenues, which account for 60 percent of the budget and 94 percent of export revenues, rose by 15 percent in the first nine months from the same period in 2018. The economy is expected to grow by 4 percent this year after 2.2 percent last year. But diplomats and business leaders say backtracking on curbing subsidies might give investors the impression the government is not serious about reforms and opening up the state and oil dominated economy. Officials have repeatedly said they wanted to boost the small non-energy sector to reduce the import bill and create jobs. Ali Haddad, head of the country’s largest business association, Algerian Business Forum, said Algeria needed to encourage private investment. “This ... requires bold reforms,” he said. Another prominent businessman, Boualem Merakech, head of the Algerian Confederation of Employers (CAP), recently complained about “difficulties faced by business leaders seeking to invest in a calm environment and a clear economic vision”. Some diplomats said the shelved subsidy plan will add to confusion among investors trying to figure out economic policies in a secretive country. They point to three different rules applied in the past two years to reduce imports. “I think that this kind of changes (of the import rules) makes it difficult for firms to make plans and understand the environment in which they will work in six or 12 months,” U.S. ambassador John Desrocher told reporters. “Attracting more investment requires more transparency, more predictability and better access to markets.” Reporting by Hamid Ould Ahmed; editing by David Stamp; Editing by Ulf Laessing and David Stamp",https://uk.reuters.com/article/algeria-economy/algeria-shelves-subsidy-reforms-before-presidential-elections-idUKL8N1XK4QM,16 Nov 2018,"Algeria is backtracking on some

2018-11-16,"* Few tankers free for spot trades, boosting shipping rates * Some vessels used as storage in hope of price rises * Ample supply added to by new U.S. start-up from Cheniere By Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell this week despite several Japanese buyers in the market, as sellers held onto cargoes hoping for higher bids and used tankers as storage, which also reduced ship availability for other deals. Spot prices for January delivery in North Asia LNG-AS were heard at $10.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), 30 cents lower than last week. A trade was heard at $11.10 on Thursday, lower than on Monday. For late December, spot prices were heard at $10.40 per mmBtu, although they were under the $10 mark for early December delivery weeks. Spot prices for the whole month of December were estimated at $10.10, compared to $10.30 last week. LNG prices have fallen in eight of the past ten weeks after an earlier rush to stock up on supplies ahead of winter at the start of September. LNG shipping rates hit their highest on record this month, with several shippers heard paying $200,000 a day to transport the super-chilled fuel. Such levels signal very little availability of vessels for December and January. Rates began rising as more production came onstream and as charterers, fearing even higher costs, locked in vessels for multi-month contracts. This is now being compounded by owners of LNG with chartered ships hanging onto the cargoes in the hope of a rise in prices. Up to 20 tankers with at least 2 million cubic metres of LNG worth $400 million are floating in Asian waters, sources said. “All traders exposed to the freight market will think twice about moving a cargo in the spot market,” said one LNG trader. “Portfolio players with a contracted fleet will perform much better. We’ll probably see more swapping cargoes.” There were several Japanese buyers in the market — Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc awarded a one-cargo tender to Qatar for Dec. 25-30 delivery, according to one trader. Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal sought one cargo for mid-January delivery in a closed tender after sounding out the market last week. And power utility Kansai Electric Power Co was seeking two cargoes for December delivery. Pakistan’s tender for one cargo in January and two in February was still open with bids due on Dec. 5. Gladstone, operated by Australia’s Santos, was heard offering a cargo for Dec 12-14 delivery. Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC awarded a tender for mid-December loading. Adding to recent new supply from Australia and Russia, Cheniere Energy produced first LNG from the U.S. Corpus Christi plant, a major milestone marking the start of the third major LNG export facility operating in the country.

2018-11-16,"PARADISE, Calif., Nov 16 (Reuters) - Rescue workers searched on Friday for 630 people reported missing in a northern California town reduced to ashes by the deadliest wildfire in state history. At least 63 people were killed in and around Paradise by the Camp Fire that erupted a week ago in the Sierra foothills 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. The fire is among the most lethal U.S. wildfires since 2000. Authorities attribute the death toll in part to the speed with which flames raced through the town of 27,000, driven by wind and fueled by desiccated scrub and trees. Nearly 12,000 homes and buildings burned hours after the blaze erupted, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. The fire left a ghostly expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with debris. Thousands of additional structures are still threatened as firefighters, many from distant states, labored to contain and suppress the flames. The revised roster of 630 missing people is up from 297 listed on Thursday by the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff Kory Honea on Thursday said the remains of seven victims have been located since Wednesday's tally of 56. Nearly 300 people reported missing have been found alive and the list of missing bit.ly/2BaiYxy would fluctuate, he said. The sheriff has asked relatives of the missing to submit DNA samples to hasten identification of the dead. But he said some of those unaccounted for may never be identified. The were other smaller blazes in southern California including the Woolsey Fire that is linked to three fatalities and destroyed at least 500 structures near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. Scientists say two seasons of devastating wildfires in California are linked to drought they say is symptomatic of climate change. Two electric utilities say they sustained equipment problems close to the origins of the blazes around the time they were reported. The White House said on Thursday that President Donald Trump plans to visit the fire zones on Saturday to meet displaced residents. Critics say Trump politicized the fires by casting blame on forest mismanagement. Cal Fire said 40 percent of the Camp Fire’s perimeter is contained, up from 35 percent, even as the blaze footprint grew 2,000 acres to 141,000 acres (57,000 hectares). The Woolsey fire is 57 percent contained. Public schools in Sacramento and districts 90 miles (145 km) to the south, and as far away as San Francisco and Oakland, said Friday’s classes would be canceled as the fire worsened air quality. Many of those who survived the flames but lost homes stayed with friends or relatives or at American Red Cross shelters. Reporting by Terray Sylvester;

2018-11-16,"(Adds context, background) MADRID, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Spanish utility Endesa plans to close two of its coal plants in Spain, representing around two-fifths of its coal-fired generating capacity in the country, the company said on Friday. As companies globally move towards a lower carbon economy, Endesa’s Italian parent company Enel, is phasing out coal-fired power plants and focusing on electricity grids, renewable energy and its retail business. “We will present the application shortly because we do not plan to carry out the necessary investments to comply with European regulations,” an Endesa spokesman said. The European Union set new standards on resources and emissions for combustion plants last year, requiring expensive technological upgrades. Spain’s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez signalled his intention to go green when he took power in June, bringing together energy and environment into one ministry, which is now working on a new law on climate change. A working draft for the new law includes plans to raise the share of renewable sources in the energy mix to 35 percent by 2030. The plants in Teruel in the country’s north-east, which has a capacity of 1,101 megawatts (MW), and Compostilla in the north-west, with a 1,051 MW capacity, are due to close in 2020. With the climate change law, the government aims to help re-train people in sectors that will be affected by the shift away from carbon, and introduce social security measures. Endesa’s coal capacity is currently much larger than peers Iberdrola and Naturgy, who respectively run 874 MW and 2,010 MW in Spain.

2018-11-16,"(Adds detail, background) JOHANNESBURG, Nov 16 (Reuters) - South Africa’s cash-strapped power utility Eskom said on Friday it had revised its coal strategy to focus on contracts that offer long-term, fixed prices and security of supply as it faces possible power outages and low stockpiles of the fuel. “Eskom’s long-term coal strategy has been revised to revert Eskom’s coal supply to dedicated long-term coal contracts for the life of the stations, with a preference for conveyor-delivered coal,” an Eskom presentation showed. Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the nation’s power, has warned of potential power outages amid low coal inventories after a major supplier cut supplies and sought insolvency protection. The utility also said it would extend its “cost-plus” mine contracts, through which it pre-pays mines to start up mining operations, pays the operating costs and a management fee and in return receives security of supply. Africa’s largest public utility said it would in the short term buy 4 million tonnes of coal for immediate supply to bring all power stations above the minimum required level for stockpiles by the end of March 2019. Eskom said it had 10 power stations with coal supplies of fewer than 20 days. Five of those had fewer than 10 days’ supply. Eskom said it had concluded 27 new, short-term coal contracts between January and October for the supply of 15.8 million tonnes of coal in the current financial year. In 2015 Eskom, whose generation capacity is around 45,000 megawatts, carried out controlled outages - known as load-shedding - as low cash flow and administrative problems affected operations. The utility was also forced to cut power supplies for a few days in June due to a strike.

2018-11-16,"(Adds output figures, background) KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s gas exports have been severely impacted since the second quarter of the year due to a supply disruption at a gas field in the eastern state of Sabah, the finance minister said on Friday. “Major repairs and assessment works are still ongoing and production is only expected to return to full capacity by the middle of next year (at) the latest,” Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in a statement. The supply disruption has affected the country’s economic growth and petroleum income tax revenue received by the government, he said. Malaysia is the world’s third-biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and state energy company Petronas is a significant contributor to the state coffers. Reuters reported in August that Malaysia’s exports of LNG fell to a four-year low in July as domestic gas pipeline issues since January took their toll. Recent trade data shows Malaysia’s third-quarter LNG exports totalled 8.7 billion ringgit ($2.08 billion) in value, down about 21 percent from the same period last year. Earlier on Friday, Malaysia said its economy grew at its slowest in two years in the July-September quarter as the country grappled with weak external demand, and what the central bank called “supply shocks” for LNG and palm oil. The central bank governor, though, added that the supply shocks have bottomed. Minister Lim said the disruption was from a production breakdown in Kebabangan gas field in Sabah. Natural gas production in the second quarter totalled 553,264 million standard cubic feet, down 10 percent from the first quarter. Third quarter output fell another 3 percent quarter on quarter, Lim said. $1 = 4.1900 ringgit

2018-11-16,"* Long-awaited expansion to help double LNG exports from nation * Negotiations over revenue sharing need more work -prime minister * Papua New Guinea is hosting APEC forum (Adds comment from Oil Search, Exxon Mobil, analyst) By Jonathan Barrett and Sonali Paul PORT MORESBY/MELBOURNE, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A long-awaited project led by France’s Total SA that will help double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Papua New Guinea has come another step closer, with the government agreeing to set financial terms early next year. The LNG expansion, which analysts estimate will cost $13 billion, is crucial to the Pacific island nation’s economy as LNG is its biggest export earner, while demand for the fuel is surging in international energy markets. Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said in the country’s capital of Port Moresby on Friday that “physical terms” had been agreed. He said negotiations over how revenue would be shared in the community and provincial governments required more work. “I’d say we are almost 50 to 60 percent through already about our understanding of revenue sharing,” O’Neill said, in response to questions from Reuters. Disagreements over land-owner rights and revenue-sharing agreements have been an almost constant feature of resource development in PNG. A non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed on Friday is basically a commitment by the government to finalise a gas agreement in early 2019, which would lead to the development of Papua LNG, run by Total. The signing was held on the sidelines of the PNG-hosted Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said he hoped to make progress on the agreement quickly. “There is still some work to be done, but we are ambitious and I’d love to come back not in two years but in 10 months or before,” Pouyanne said. Papua LNG will supply gas from the Elk-Antelope fields for two new processing units, called trains, at Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant. At the same time, Exxon Mobil plans to develop gas at the P’nyang field to help fill a third new train at the plant. All together the projects will double the plant’s output to around 16 million tonnes a year. Exxon said in an emailed comment that it was pleased to see progress on the Papua LNG talks. Oil Search, a partner in both Papua LNG and PNG LNG, said all parties were “aligned on the need to ensure that new LNG developments in PNG remain competitive with other new LNG projects worldwide”. The companies are racing to start exporting from the new trains by 2024, when the LNG market is expected to need new supply to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. But analysts say that timeline might be hard to meet as a final investment decision may not come until 2020 or 2021. “Ultimately the timeline for Papua will be dictated by Exxon’s patient and disciplined centralised decision making process, and all other parties will just need to fall in line with that,” said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic. Analysts estimate the expansion will cost around $13 billion, well below the $19.5 billion cost of the original project, which involved building a wide range of infrastructure from scratch, including a 700-km (435-mile) pipeline through the nation’s rugged highlands down to the coast. The government is aiming to strike better fiscal terms for the country than it did with Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG project in 2009, when it was looking secure the biggest foreign investment in the country amid the global financial crisis.

2018-11-16,"(Reuters) - The chief of California’s top utilities regulator said on Friday he was shocked to learn that reassurances he made to investors about PG&E (PCG.N) caused the embattled power utility’s stock to surge over 40 percent in a matter of minutes. PG&E’s stock had slumped over 60 percent since the state’s deadliest-ever wildfire broke out last week on fears that without help from California’s government, the utility could go bankrupt should it eventually be found responsible. The fire destroyed the town of Paradise and has killed at least 63 people. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker told Reuters on Friday that utilities must be able to borrow money cheaply in order to properly serve ratepayers. That echoed comments he made on an investor conference call organized by Bank of America on Thursday, when he said he could not imagine allowing the state’s largest utility to go into bankruptcy. Picker was surprised hours later on Thursday to learn that PG&E’s stock had surged over 40 percent in extended trading in reaction to his comments. “I was stunned and terrified,” Picker said. “I left the call yesterday and I went back to a workshop I was in, so I didn’t find out about it until several hours later.” Picker’s market-moving remarks to a private group were unusual, in part because public companies and their executives must follow federal rules aimed at avoiding selective disclosure of material news, but a government official or other outside parties sharing an outlook on a public company does not face the same obligations, experts say. PG&E shares on Friday closed up 37.54 percent at $24.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is still down about 50 percent from before the fire started, erasing nearly $13 billion in market capitalization. The cause of the Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise remains under investigation. With PG&E potentially facing mounting costs from wildfires, the regulator would also consider potential options to restructure the company, including separating its electricity and gas units, Picker told Reuters. Keeping Wall Street interested in investing in PG&E and other California utilities is key to reducing the state’s carbon emissions and making the power system more efficient, he said. “I don’t think we over-reward people. ... But we want to make sure that we can continue to keep the lights on, and be cleaner and cleaner, and ideally more reliable.” GRAPHIC: PG&E shares surge after Thursday's close on utility regulator's comments - tmsnrt.rs/2QNMYF1 California state Senator Bill Dodd told Reuters it was “too soon” to speculate about future legislation that might provide relief to PG&E in case it is found liable for the Camp Fire. Dodd sponsored legislation passed this year that lets utilities pass some of the costs related to liability from wildfires on to ratepayers, but the bill did not specifically provide for 2018. GRAPHIC: Fire Fear - tmsnrt.rs/2PyMu9a Citigroup on Friday upgraded PG&E’s stock to “buy” from “neutral.”  “Given the reaction in the stock market, we think there was an appropriate level of urgency that something needed to be done,” Citigroup analysts wrote, referring to the regulator’s statement.  The price for PG&E’s more than $18 billion of bonds also rose. The price of the March 2034 694308GE1= bond was up about 5 points in afternoon trading after earlier trading as much as 11 points higher. PG&E’s debt was pressured earlier this week after the utility borrowed $3.3 billion under its credit lines and warned it could face liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage should its equipment be found to have caused the fire. The gains in bond prices came even after both Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s cut their credit ratings on PG&E late Thursday to just one notch above junk bond territory and said the outlook remained negative.  Fitch Ratings on Friday also downgraded the utility’s long-term issuer default ratings. With the collapse in its bond prices this week, most of PG&E’s bonds were trading as though they were already speculative-grade securities, although Friday’s recovery brought many of them back in line with comparably low-investment-grade-rated corporate bonds. PG&E has about $500 million of floating rate notes maturing in two weeks and does not face another maturing security until October 2020.  That October 2020 $800 million bond, with a 3.5 percent coupon 694308GT8=RRPS, yielded more than 10 percent at one point in trading on Thursday, the first of PG&E’s securities to have breached that threshold. On Friday, the October 2020 note was up more than 4 points to 95.25 cents on the dollar, with the yield dropping to 6.24 percent. Shares of Edison International (EIX.N), whose Southern California Edison subsidiary provides power in Southern California, jumped 15 percent. While investors view it as at less risk than PG&E to massive liabilities from wildfires, its stock has been volatile over the past week as a second fire burned in that region. The Woolsey Fire in Southern California also remains under investigation.   The volatility in PG&E shares has drawn a rush of trading in options. Traders are betting the stock will remain prone to wild gyrations in the near term.

2018-11-16,"HOUSTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - BP Plc’s trading arm on Friday entered a tolling agreement with the owners of an idled oil refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, cementing plans to bring the plant back online six years after it was idled by previous owners, the company said. Under BP’s tolling agreement with Limetree Bay Refining LLC, owner of the idled Hovensa refinery, BP will supply the facility with crude and sell its products, low-sulfur fuels that will meet an International Maritime Organization mandate in 2020, it said in a statement. BP declined to comment further. Limetree did not respond to requests for comment. Limetree, owned by private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC, is investing $1.5 billion to bring the Hovensa refinery, one of the largest such facilities in the world, back online by late 2019, with plans to process 200,000 barrels per day (bpd). It aims to produce low-sulfur fuels that satisfy the International Maritime Organization rule calling for large vessels to switch by 2020 to fuels containing no more than 0.5 percent sulfur from 3.5 percent. The rule is widely expected to spur new demand for the distillates the refinery would produce. Limetree’s facility has more than 1,100 construction workers on site and has brought online 25 million barrels of crude storage capacity.

2018-11-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil ended slightly firmer after volatile trading on Friday, supported by expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree to cut output next month, though prices fell for the sixth straight week amid global oversupply concerns. OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia is keen for the major producers to cut output by about 1.4 million barrels per day, around 1.5 percent of global supply, to support the market, sources told Reuters this week. But other producers, including Russia, have been reluctant to agree to a cut.   Brent LCOc1 settled up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $66.76 a barrel. The global benchmark fell 4.6 percent in the week, the sixth consecutive decline.  U.S. crude CLc1 settled unchanged at $56.46 a barrel after trading between $55.89 and $57.96. The contract, which had its steepest one-day loss in more than three years on Tuesday, fell 5.6 percent in the week, also its sixth straight weekly decline.  After Tuesday’s sharp fall, the market was due for a slight correction, and was now stabilizing, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.  “A relief rally was in the cards,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. OPEC is likely to be spurred to action as U.S. production continues to climb, he said.  Still, the day’s gains were likely to be limited as traders were cautious going into the weekend, he said. “It would take a brave soul to go home really long this weekend considering the slaughter we’ve had in the past eight weeks.”  OPEC ministers meet on Dec. 6 in Vienna to decide on production policy for the next six months amid a growing surplus in world markets. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA reached another record last week, at 11.7 million barrels per day, government data showed. The record output contributed to the biggest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles C-STK-T-EIA in nearly two years. U.S. drillers added two oil rigs this week, bringing the total count to 888, still the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report . RIG-OL-USA-BHI The rig count is seen as an indicator of future production growth. The United States imposed sanctions on Iranian oil exports this month and Iranian crude exports have fallen sharply in recent months, although Washington cushioned the blow by granting some temporary exemptions. Other oil producers have more than compensated for the lost Iranian oil and most analysts now see a significant supply surplus with inventories building, putting pressure on prices. Fearing a repeat of the 2014 price rout, OPEC is widely expected to start trimming output soon. This could produce a swift price rebound, some analysts say, especially if production falls further in Venezuela and Libya. “We are likely from December onwards to have at least 1 million barrels per day (bpd) less of (Iranian) crude exports,” Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas, told Reuters Global Oil Forum. Tchilinguirian said he would not be surprised if Brent recovered to $80 this year. Also supporting prices, Iraq resumed exporting oil from its northern Kirkuk oilfields on Friday, pumping 50,000-100,000 bpd, an oil ministry spokesman said. Some analysts had expected the volumes to be much higher, at closer to 300,000 bpd.     Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options in New York and London during the week ended Nov. 13 by 8,259 contracts to 165,121, the lowest since June 27, 2017, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. Brent speculators on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) cut net longs by 45,216 contracts to 214,832 in the week, also the lowest since June 27, 2017.

2018-11-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar weakened and Treasury yields slid on Friday after a top Federal Reserve official said U.S. interest rates were near a neutral rate, while the S&P 500 ended positive after a seesaw session helped by optimism over U.S.-China trade ties.  Oil prices steadied but still posted their sixth straight week of losses. Uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union clouded currency and other markets. Markets were shaken by comments made by Richard Clarida, newly appointed Fed vice chair, in a CNBC interview that U.S. interest rates were nearing Fed estimates of a neutral rate, and being at neutral “makes sense.”     He also said there was “some evidence of global slowing.” While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates in December, the number of hikes next year is a matter of debate. “The big driver right now is Fed speech,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “Clarida indicated a modestly dovish bent on Fed policy, and not a particularly aggressive stance.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 123.95 points, or 0.49 percent, to 25,413.22, the S&P 500 gained 5.94 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,736.14 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.16 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,247.87. Clarida’s comments helped support stocks, which were also boosted by comments from President Donald Trump on trade.  Trump said he may not impose more tariffs on Chinese goods after Beijing sent the United States a list of measures it was willing to take to resolve trade tensions. “The market is paying attention very closely to anything surrounding trade,” said Veronica Willis, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “(A trade deal) would boost expectations for global growth, which would ultimately be good for stocks.” Investors are pointing toward the G20 meeting later this month, when leaders from the United States and China are expected to meet, and the Fed’s meeting in December as key events for markets. Weighing on equity sentiment and the Nasdaq was a disappointing forecast by chip company Nvidia Corp. Nvidia shares tumbled 18.8 percent while the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 1.2 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.35 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.20 percent as traders waited on more clarity involving Britain’s exit from the EU, known as Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May won the backing of the most prominent Brexiteer in her government as she fought to save a draft EU divorce deal that has stirred up a plot to force her out of her job. After tumbling a day earlier, sterling was last trading at $1.2825, up 0.40 percent, while the euro was  up 0.78 percent to $1.1414. “Sterling volatility has woken up from its 100-year slumber and is likely to remain reactive,” said Ulrich Leuchtmannan, FX strategist at Commerzbank. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.49 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 12/32 in price to yield 3.0738 percent, from 3.118 percent late on Thursday.

2018-11-16,"* Kirkuk exports had been halted since October 2017 * Iraq took over Kirkuk after failed Kurdish independence vote * Washington was pressing Baghdad, Erbil to find compromise * Current flows still modest, not clear when will rise (Adds U.S. State Department comment) By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ahmed Rasheed LONDON/BAGHDAD, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Iraq on Friday restarted exports of Kirkuk oil, halted a year ago due to a standoff between the central government and Kurdistan’s semi-autonomous region, after a new government in Baghdad agreed a tentative deal with Erbil. The development is a win for the U.S. government, which has been urging both sides to settle the dispute and resume flows to help address a shortage of Iranian crude in the region after Washington imposed new sanctions on Tehran. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Twitter that resumption of exports of Kirkuk oil was “another important step in our efforts to reduce Iran’s oil exports.” Flows resumed at a modest level of around 50,000-60,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with a peak of 300,000 bpd seen last year and it was not clear when and by how much they would rise, industry sources said. The Kirkuk crude is being exported to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan by a pipeline crossing Kurdistan. A spokesman for Iraq’s Oil Ministry, Asim Jihad, confirmed exports had restarted, adding that an agreement had been reached to resume flows at 50,000-100,000 bpd. “The resumption of Kirkuk shipments of between 50,000 and 100,000 barrels per day will not add to Iraq’s total exports,” Jihad said. Oil prices rose, with Brent crude up more than $1 per barrel, supported partially by the lower-than-expected flows from Kurdistan. The deal signals that new Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban are ready to work with Erbil despite previous tensions and a failed independence referendum in September 2017. The halting of exports from Kirkuk in October 2017 stopped almost 300,000 bpd flowing out of Iraq towards Turkey and international markets - causing a net revenue loss of some $8 billion over the past year. Most of Iraq’s exports come from southern fields, but Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Exports had been on hold since Iraqi government forces retook Kirkuk from Kurdish authorities in 2017. The Kurds had taken control of Kirkuk and its oilfields after Islamic State militants drove the Iraqi army out in 2014, and Kurdish forces, in turn, ejected the militants. A pipeline Baghdad once used for export via Turkey was wrecked by Islamic State - leaving only one working. Kurdistan is producing and exporting some 400,000 bpd via the pipeline. Resumed flows from Kirkuk will lift this to 450,000-500,000 bpd, but short of the 700,000 bpd the Kurdish region had exported at some point last year. Iraqi authorities say they still need to feed local refineries, where Kirkuk’s output has been diverted over the past year. The refineries are set to receive some 185,000 bpd under the latest deal, the sources said. Baghdad and Erbil have yet to find a compromise over maximum flow levels as well as budget transfers from the central government to Erbil - something the two sides have struggled to agree on for many years.

2018-11-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would nominate the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, to take on the position permanently.  Wheeler, a long-time Washington insider known to shun the spotlight, took the reins at the EPA in July after former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned. Pruitt faced a slew of ethics controversies that included his first-class travel, round-the-clock security detail, and expensive office equipment. Wheeler has done a “fantastic job, and I want to congratulate him,” Trump said as he announced his decision during a Medal of Freedom ceremony at the White House. He had previously hinted that Wheeler might be nominated. Trump will have to formally nominate Wheeler and then the U.S. Senate will vote on his confirmation, an expected outcome as the chamber is led by Trump’s fellow Republicans. In Wheeler, Trump has seen another avid supporter of his deregulatory agenda and advocate for the fossil fuels industry, but without the constant criticism over alleged mismanagement that had plagued Pruitt. Wheeler had worked at the EPA in the 1990s and later in the Senate under Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, a skeptic of mainstream climate science, before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant. He has said that he is “not at all ashamed” of his lobbying for the coal company Murray Energy Corp, the focus of criticism by environmentalists. Wheeler had also lobbied for utility Xcel Energy Inc and consulted for biofuels industry group Growth Energy, agricultural merchant and biofuels producer Archer Daniels Midland Co and International Paper Co, according to his public disclosures. He has been in his latest EPA job for more than 100 days, one of the longest tenures for an acting chief at the agency in decades. Wheeler has said that EPA, under his leadership, would take the same course as under Pruitt, prioritizing cleaning up industrial Superfund sites, areas contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the EPA as a candidate for cleanup, and financing investments in water infrastructure.
