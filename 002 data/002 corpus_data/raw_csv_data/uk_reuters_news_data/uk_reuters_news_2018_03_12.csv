2018-03-12,"(Reuters) - The third nor’easter to hit parts of the U.S. northeast in two weeks was expected to start late on Monday and Amtrak said it would suspend service on Tuesday between Boston and New York, as the storm could bring high winds, a foot or more of snow and power outages. “This storm won’t be as widespread as before,” said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “It’ll hit New England the hardest.” The railroad said the service suspension would last until at least 11 a.m. EDT on Tuesday and that service would resume when weather conditions allowed. The storm was expected to continue into Tuesday. Amtrak said it would also cancel some trains running from New York to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Boston declared a snow emergency and announced a parking ban beginning on Monday at 7 p.m  on major roads. The city said Boston Public Schools, libraries and other city services would be closed on Tuesday. The National Weather Service said parts of Massachusetts could get up to 18 inches of snow and issued a coastal flood warning. Certain storms are classified as nor’easters because their strong winds typically are from the northeast, and they tend to occur most frequently and most violently between September and April along North America’s East Coast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some nor’easters carry hurricane-force winds.  Storms on March 2 and 7 left at least 9 people dead across the region, some 2 million homes and businesses without power, and flooding in the streets of Boston. Other areas that were severely affected in the previous two storms, including parts of New York, New Jersey and Maryland will see only one-to-four inches of snow this time around, Chenard said. Blizzard conditions are possible and power outages are a threat for parts of Rhode Island, eastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, which are under the Winter Storm Watch from Monday evening to Tuesday afternoon, he said.     “Coastal areas could see 40 or 50 mph winds,” he said. “The snow will be wet. Combined with the wind, it presents a serious risk of power outages.” Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Toni Reinhold",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-weather/update-1-u-s-northeast-braces-for-third-powerful-storm-in-two-weeks-idUKL1N1QU1Q0,12 Mar 2018,"The third nor'easter to hit parts of

2018-03-12,"(Adds Lopez Obrador comment) MEXICO CITY, March 12 (Reuters) - Mexico’s powerful CCE business lobby on Monday urged the leftist front-runner for a July 1 presidential election to stop questioning major planks of the government’s economic agenda lest it damage investment. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has led opinion polls by a wide margin for weeks, has gradually moderated his rhetoric and his leading advisers have sought to reassure investors that he will not be an economic liability as president. However, his threats to scrap a new Mexico City airport already under construction and review oil and gas exploration and production contracts issued under a 2013-14 energy reform still worry some investors. “As we’ve said, you can’t ask the private sector to take part in building a better country at the same time as undermining certainty and the rule of law as conditions for fostering investment,” Juan Pablo Castanon, president of the CCE lobby, an umbrella group for business groups, said at an event in Mexico City. “For this reason, we business folk demand guarantees that the contracts awarded under the energy reform and for the new airport will be respected,” he added. “In a country governed by the rule of law, contracts are honored, and cannot be subject to the will or interpretation of a sitting government.” On Monday, Lopez Obrador said he still planned to scrap the new airport, but added he was not going to ignore contracts awarded and bonds issued for the project. “We will respect construction contracts. Those that have those contracts don’t have to worry,” he said. “We will respect the bonds ... we’re going to solve the problem without affecting investments.” Lopez Obrador’s energy adviser has said that while publicly available versions of the energy contracts appear to be without problems, further investigation was needed to ensure corruption had not tainted the awarding process. The business community was also worried there were candidates and campaign teams already casting doubt on the validity of the election “depending on who the winner is,” Castanon said, without mentioning Lopez Obrador or his MORENA party. Castanon’s comments follow a speech by Lopez Obrador last week, in which he stuck to promises to not build the airport at the current construction site and warned there could be protests if he lost by fraud. The former mayor of Mexico City, who was runner-up in the previous two elections, organized massive protests when he was narrowly beaten in 2006. Two polls published last week showed him with a lead of more than 13 percentage points over his nearest rival.

2018-03-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investor concerns about rising U.S. oil output sent crude prices down on Monday, but investors stayed bullish on U.S. Treasuries despite an increased supply of three- and 10-year notes. U.S. Stocks closed mixed, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ending in the red, while the Nasdaq Composite added about 28 points. Energy investors weighed increased U.S. supply against the likelihood that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will maintain supply cuts that have been in effect more than a year. [O/R] “The market continues to flip back and forth on the idea that increased global demand and a production cut is going to support prices,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy. U.S. crude was last at $61.37, down 1.08 percent. Brent was last at $64.96, down 0.81 percent on the day. During the session, U.S. crude fell as much as 2.21 percent. Some of that early slide was probably profit-taking after a rise on Friday, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates. On Friday, crude prices rose after U.S. data showed the economy in February added the most jobs in more than 1-1/2 years. The payroll data also supported Treasuries.  On Monday, benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.8663 percent, hovering near multi-year highs. The Treasury on Monday sold $28 billion of three-year notes and $21 billion of the 10-year notes, in what analyst George Goncalves called an “on-the-screws type auction.” Increased supply did not quell demand for the U.S. government debt, a positive sign for the heavy issuance expected in the year ahead.     “Nothing really stood out,” said Goncalves, head of U.S. rates strategy at Nomura Securities International in New York. “You can consider that a good thing, given this year will see more and more Treasuries issued.” U.S. stocks closed mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 157.13 points, or 0.62 percent, to 25,178.61, the S&P 500 lost 3.55 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,783.02 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.52 points, or 0.36 percent, to 7,588.33. Anwiti Bahuguna, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle in Boston, pointed to after-effects of Friday’s employment report.  “We’ve seen stable, modest wage growth, nothing that should be considered harmful for equity markets,” Bahuguna said. “It was a Goldilocks sort of report, and the market is still digesting it. What we’re looking ahead to is the inflation report.” The broader trend remained positive for Wall Street’s main indexes, which had closed up nearly 2 percent on Friday on the strength of the jobs report. They have nearly reversed declines in recent weeks as investors had begun to fear higher wages might lead to price pressures. Last week’s jobs data, as well as an easing of fears of a global trade war, also boosted stocks across many parts of the world. MSCI’s world equity index hit a two-week high on Monday, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed up 1.93 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.24 percent. In currencies, investors’ appetite for riskier bets hurt the U.S. dollar. The dollar index fell 0.21 percent, with the euro up 0.27 percent to $1.2338. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.37 percent versus the greenback to 106.39 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3906, up 0.40 percent on the day.

Crude prices rose on Friday after the U.S. economy added the biggest number of jobs in more than 1-1/2 years in February. But U.S. crude fell as much as 2.21 percent on Monday, to $60.67 per barrel, before bouncing back to $61.35, down 1.11 percent. “It just looked like some profit taking,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates. Brent was last at $64.96, down 0.81 percent on the day. Energy investors are weighing increased U.S. supply against the likelihood that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will maintain supply cuts that have been in effect more than a year. “The market continues to flip back and forth on the idea that increased global demand and a production cut is going to support prices ... but U.S. production, and North American production levels in general, is going to negate a lot of the impact of that,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy. Friday’s strong U.S. payroll data, which showed a hefty 313,000 rise in jobs but tempered growth in hourly earnings, supported Treasuries in Monday trade. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.8663 percent. That is not far off the 2.957 percent yield on Feb. 21, the highest since the instrument yielded more than 3 percent in January 2014. The Treasury on Monday sold $28 billion of three-year notes and $21 billion of the 10-year notes, in what analyst George Goncalves called an “on-the-screws type auction.” Increased supply did not quell demand for the notes, a positive sign for the heavy issuance expected in the year ahead. “Nothing really stood out,” said Goncalves, head of U.S. rates strategy at Nomura Securities International in New York. “You can consider that a good thing, given this year will see more and more Treasuries issued.” Last week’s U.S. jobs data, as well as an easing of fears of a global trade war, boosted stocks across many parts of the world.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 33.19 points, or 0.44 percent, at 7,594.00.

2018-03-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday as investors grappled with ongoing concerns over rising U.S. output and tight OPEC supply, while last week’s data showing speculators cut bets on oil suggested more selling could be seen. Brent crude futures LCOc1 slipped 54 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $64.95 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 fell  68 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $61.36 per barrel. Hedge funds and money managers pared their bullish wagers on U.S. crude oil, with long positions falling last week for the first time in three weeks. Gross short positions on the New York Mercantile Exchange 3067651MSHT climbed to their highest in nearly a month. That has undercut some of the enthusiasm for oil, as investors weigh increased U.S. supply against the likelihood that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers will maintain supply cuts that have been in effect for more than a year. “The market continues to flip back and forth on the idea that increased global demand and a production cut is going to support prices ... but U.S. production, and North American production levels in general, is going to negate a lot of the impact of that,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy.  Energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday that energy companies last week cut oil rigs for the first time in almost two months. RIG-OL-USA-BHI Still, the United States is now the world’s no. 2 crude oil producer, ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia.  “We are maintaining a bearish trading stance in anticipation of a range in nearby WTI between about $58 and $63, Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “While Friday’s favorable jobs data and oil rig decline might suggest a test of the high side of this expected range first, we still view downside price risk exceeding that to the upside,” he said. On Sunday, Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said OPEC could agree in June to begin easing current production curbs in 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported. Also on Sunday, Saudi officials said they would be delaying the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco until 2019. This week’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) release, given its potential impact on the dollar, could be critical, said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago. The dollar tends to have an inverse relationship with oil prices, as a weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.

2018-03-12,"ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - German energy firm E.ON said on Monday it expects as many as 5,000 job cuts and up to 800 million euros ($987 million) of synergies as part of an asset swap with peer RWE involving its renewables and network arm Innogy. Plans to break up Innogy and divide its assets between parent RWE and E.ON, first announced a day earlier, added 4.3 billion euros to the market value of Germany’s three largest utilities in the sector’s largest overhaul in recent history. Germany’s power companies are reshaping as they look to boost green energy output, shift away from fossil fuels and prepare for Germany’s exit from nuclear power in 2022. “This strategic exchange of businesses will create two highly focused companies that will shape a better future for Europe’s energy landscape,” E.ON Chief Executive Johannes Teyssen said in a statement. “Each company will have a stronger entrepreneurial core.” The changes will turn RWE into Europe’s third-largest renewable player and at the same time create one of the continent’s top grid and energy retail groups under the aegis  of E.ON, with about 50 million customers across the continent. “Overall, we view the planned transaction between RWE AG and E.ON SE as positive, from a strategic as well as a financial point of view,” municipal shareholders in RWE, which together hold about 23 percent in the group, said. “We think that this transaction gives significant thrust to the successful implementation of Germany’s energy shift.” Before striking a deal with E.ON, RWE held talks with European peers Enel and Engie and came close to a deal with Spain’s Iberdrola before Christmas, people familiar with the matter said. Shares in Innogy closed up 12.1 percent at 38.70 euros after Sunday’s proposed deal from RWE and E.ON, which plans to offer Innogy’s minority shareholders 40 euros per share, or 5.2 billion euros, a 16 percent premium to Friday’s close. Two bankers who have worked on previous Innogy deals put the chances of a rival bid for the German energy company as “very low” to “zero”, since RWE has already explored alternative deals with other candidates. RWE is being advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi on the deal, E.ON has hired Perella Weinberg Partners and BNP. Goldman Sachs is working for Innogy, sources said. The deal is expected to close in late 2019. In a letter to staff seen by Reuters, Innogy interim Chief Executive Uwe Tigges said Innogy’s management and supervisory boards would thoroughly assess the planned deal, which was agreed in principle and still requires antitrust approval. “We assure you that the interests of the employees of our company as well as those of our shareholders continue to be our primary focus,” said Tigges, who has been in the role for only three months. Innogy, which reported its annual results on Monday, said that it had so far not reflected on the proposal and would comment at a later stage. Frank Bsirske, head of the Verdi labor union and deputy chairman of RWE’s supervisory board, welcomed the deal, saying it offered good prospects for growth and jobs. The supervisory boards of both RWE and E.ON have approved the transaction. Germany’s cartel office said it was too early to comment on possible hurdles in the planned asset swap deal, which is expected to involve German and European antitrust regulators. Innogy and E.ON have large overlapping retail businesses in Germany, Britain and the Czech Republic. E.ON said it expects 600-800 million euros in annual synergies by 2022. Shares in RWE, which owns 76.8 percent of Innogy, closed 9.2 percent higher while E.ON’s ended the day up 5.4 percent. Their proposed transaction comes just two years after RWE spun off its renewable, retail and network operations to form Innogy and E.ON split off some of its business to create Uniper. If approved, the deal would spell the end for Innogy as a standalone company. It has been in turmoil since former Chief Executive Peter Terium resigned in December and on Monday said it would cut 400 million euros in costs through the end of 2020. Analysts at Jefferies said while helping E.ON achieve scale and efficiencies in networks and retail, and transforming RWE into a leading renewables and security of supply provider, a deal “would involve another two years in costly restructuring”. Innogy reported a 3 percent rise in 2017 adjusted operating profit and said it would propose a dividend of 1.60 euros per share for 2017, unchanged from a year earlier. E.ON, in a separate statement on its annual results, said it would propose a dividend of 0.30 euros per share for 2017 and 0.43 euros per share for 2018.

2018-03-12,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - A significant lead in votes for Colombian right-wing candidate Ivan Duque over leftist Gustavo Petro in presidential primaries pushed the peso up against the dollar on Monday as investors bet Duque would be more business friendly that the former guerrilla candidate. Petro’s promise of a “social economy” that would raise taxes and shift away from oil, Colombia’s top export, towards agriculture has worried investors in the Andean nation as opinion polls showed the former member of the disbanded M-19 guerrilla group and ex-mayor of Bogota running ahead of Duque. Parties will likely now look to form alliances before the May 27 election to replace President Juan Manuel Santos. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, a second round will be held in June. Sunday’s primaries - in which Duque won almost 42 percent more votes than Petro did - were considered a better test of voter support than often inaccurate opinion polls, although some voters will have participated strategically and may not back either winner in the presidential vote. More than 6 million votes were cast in the three-way right-wing primary and 3.5 million in the two-way left-wing contest.  While all candidates advocate clamping down on corruption and investment in education and health, the two top pollers differ in their views on a peace deal with Marxist FARC rebels.  Duque, 41, supported by former President Alvaro Uribe and his Democratic Center party, backs foreign investment and an aggressive security strategy meant to combat Colombia’s remaining rebel group, which regularly kidnaps and bombs oil pipelines.  He has been vocal in his opposition to the 2016 FARC accord, which could stymie implementation if he wins. Petro, 57, and his Colombia Humana party pledges to improve conditions for the poor, ban open pit mining and use clean energy. Voters also elected a new congress. While no party came close to winning control of either legislature, the Democratic Center party came out on top in the Senate, with 19 seats and second in the lower house, with 32 seats. Petro’s Decencia coalition won just four Senate seats, and only two seats in the lower house. “There’s now sure to be at the presidential level a shake out of candidates over the coming weeks as we approach the first round – Petro can’t yet be completely discounted but he looks further from his goal today compared with Friday,” said Rupert Stebbings, managing director of equities at Grupo Bancolombia. The peso <COP = STFX> strengthened 0.67 percent against the dollar to 2,851 and local Treasury bonds rose to yield 6.238 percent from Friday’s close of 6.278 percent.  The peso and bonds markets are much more liquid than the stock market, which is heavily dependent on oil prices and shares of state-owned oil company Ecopetrol. “The fact that the centre right has won - that doesn’t represent a political change for the markets,” said Juan David Ballen, head of economic studies at Casa de Bolsa brokerage. The FARC, now the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force party, were guaranteed five seats in both houses as part of the peace deal and failed to win any others. Also running for president are Sergio Fajardo, a former mayor of Medellin, and ex-vice president German Vargas Lleras.  They both favour improvements to infrastructure and tax cuts for businesses, though Fajardo is considered left-leaning. Duque and Vargas Lleras, from the Radical Change party, have strong party machines behind them and can count on backing in Congress if they win. Other candidates include Liberal party elder statesman Humberto de la Calle, who lead government negotiators at FARC talks, and former defence minister and U.S. ambassador Juan Carlos Pinzon.

The deal continues the break-up of E.ON and RWE, which were two vertically integrated utilities before they split their renewables and grids from their thermal generation assets. With E.ON set to sell its stake in thermal generation unit Uniper to Finland’s Fortum this year, E.ON and RWE will be left with the only assets that still make money in Europe’s power industry: subsidised renewables and regulated networks. Germany’s switch from nuclear to renewables after the Fukushima disaster in 2011 and European Union support for renewable energy created huge overcapacity that is pricing thermal and nuclear-power generation out of the market. In response, RWE’s and E.ON’s first spin-offs two years ago were about getting out of traditional generation. Now, even highly integrated state-owned utilities like France’s EDF and Czech Republic’s CEZ have been presented with break-up scenarios. “European utilities are increasingly specialising in one part of the value chain,” said Colette Lewiner, energy adviser to the chairman of Capgemini, a consultancy. She said this might be partly because spot markets set the power price and thus integrate the value chain from power generation to electricity retailing. The Innogy deal is also notable for its lack of foreign utilities’ involvement. Before the 2008 financial crisis, European utilities were in a dealmaking frenzy, all seeking to buy footholds in other European countries. But most of those deals fell through or turned sour and now only a few EU utilities have a significant presence in other EU countries. Investment bankers had floated Enel, Iberdrola or Engie as potential buyers of Innogy. But none of them materialised as bidders. Electricity, unlike oil and gas, is difficult to transport, which is why utilities never went global. And besides the physics, politics too has played a part in crimping cross-border deals. A decade ago, the EU tried to drive politics out of utilities with a push for privatisation and the unbundling of monopoly-owned grids. But politics has returned via the back door. Germany’s nuclear exit, Spain’s unwinding of renewables subsidies and Britain’s threat of price caps all show the extent to which utilities dance to governments’ regulatory tunes. Roland Vetter, chief investment officer at PraXis Partners, said that besides valuation and the lack of synergies, politics was a major reason for foreign utilities not buying Innogy. “The moment you own these businesses, you are involved in German politics. E.ON already is, for them it is not an issue,” he said. German companies have some impact on politicians, but not foreigners, he said. “If, say, Iberdrola buys a German company, there is no protection, only downside.” Vetter expects no further major M&A deals, neither intra-country or on a regional scale. That is not to say there will be no smaller deals. In a bid to innovate, utilities are buying dozens of small to medium-size companies in new business areas such as electric vehicle charging, insulation, smart meters and energy services. Utilities will also continue investing in emerging markets, which have huge power needs and more liberal regulation. “As new market entrants steal their customers at home, European utilities have no choice but to go seek growth where they can find it,” said Montpellier University’s Jacques Percebois.

2018-03-12,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia and the Marxist ELN guerrilla group will restart peace talks in Ecuador, President Juan Manuel Santos said on Monday, after a six-week pause marked by deaths on both sides. Santos suspended talks in late January after the National Liberation Army (ELN) launched a series of bomb attacks that killed eight police officers and injured dozens, immediately following the end of the two sides’ first-ever ceasefire. “Since the bilateral ceasefire ended, there have been too many deaths on both sides, too many wounded, too many victims - this is what we must stop,” Santos said in a televised address. “And that can only be achieved by talking,” he said, adding he hoped the two sides could agree to another ceasefire. Santos has said the halt to talks was a dilemma and hinted he could scrap them entirely, though he applauded the unilateral ceasefire held by the rebels during legislative elections. He acknowledges talks are unpopular and has slammed the group for its attacks on the armed forces. Santos did not specify a start date for the renewed talks, but said the government negotiators will travel back to Quito. Colombian forces have killed 34 rebels in fighting since the ceasefire ended on Jan. 9, while rebels have launched repeated attacks, killed 19 members of the armed forces and halted pumping of crude oil with bomb attacks. The ELN said in a statement it would answer Santos’ call to return to negotiations and reiterated the desire for another bilateral ceasefire. “We join President Santos’ call to restart talks, with the conviction that it is better to have dialogue in the midst of a bilateral ceasefire.” Talks with the former FARC rebel group, which signed a 2016 peace deal, were also fraught at times. Santos suspended talks when that group, now a political party, kidnapped a general. The peace deal failed in a referendum, but eventually passed through Congress. The ELN, founded by Roman Catholic priests in 1964, is  considered more radical than the FARC and is less centralized. The group has sought peace with the government before but made little progress.  Presidential elections in May could determine the fate of the talks.  Left-wing candidates, including the Liberals’ Humberto de la Calle, who was the government’s head negotiator at the FARC talks, say negotiations are positive but not a panacea. Right-leaning candidates accuse Santos of failing to make a fair deal with the FARC - including by allowing ex-rebels to avoid jail sentences.

Tillerson has been involved in discussions within the U.S. administration on a possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “There will be several steps necessary to agree on location, agree on the scope of those discussions. It’s very early stages. We’ve not heard anything directly back from North Korea but we expect to hear something directly from them,” he said during a visit to Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. He was speaking at the end of a week-long trip to five African countries. Tillerson did not clarify which steps were needed for the talks and declined to comment on potential locations. It would be the first face-to-face encounter between any leaders of the two countries and potentially marks a major breakthrough in easing tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme.

Crude prices had risen on Friday and earlier on Monday after the U.S. economy added the biggest number of jobs in more than 1-1/2 years in February. But the trend began to reverse later in the day. Investors are weighing increased U.S. supply against the likelihood that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will maintain supply cuts that have been in effect more than a year. “The market continues to flip back and forth on the idea that increased global demand and a production cut is going to support prices... but U.S. production, and North American production levels in general, is going to negate a lot of the impact of that,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy. U.S. crude fell 1.66 percent to $61.01 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.58, down 1.39 percent on the day. Friday’s strong U.S. payroll data, which showed a hefty 313,000 rise in jobs but tempered growth in hourly earnings, supported Treasuries in early trade. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.8865 percent, from 2.894 percent on Friday. The Treasury Department will auction $21 billion in 10-year notes on Monday, as well as $28 billion in three-year notes. A high yield going into auction could limit demand from bidders at that level, widening the spread between the expected high yield when the auction starts, versus the actual high yield during the auction. A wider spread is called a “tail” and indicates weaker demand from bidders. “Auctions last month tailed,” said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies & Co in New York, referring to February’s near-record issue of supply. “If yields get a little too rich, you’ll see a repeat of that scenario.” Last week’s U.S. jobs data, as well as an easing of fears over a global trade war, boosted stocks across the world. MSCI’s world equity index hit a two-week high, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed up 1.93 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.21 percent. U.S. stocks, though, were little changed on Monday, with the S&P 500 up 0.1 points, or 0.00 percent, to 2,786.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 104.75 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,230.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.21 points, or 0.48 percent, to 7,597.02. Wall Street’s main indexes had closed up nearly 2 percent on Friday on the strength of the jobs report, and have nearly reclaimed losses sustained in recent weeks when investors feared that higher wages might lead to price pressures. “We’re seeing some positive follow-through, but it would not surprise me to see some profit-taking coming off a very powerful performance on Friday,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. In currencies, investors’ appetite for riskier bets caused the U.S. dollar to inch down. The dollar index fell 0.05 percent, with the euro up 0.06 percent to $1.2312. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.21 percent versus the greenback at 106.56 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3884, up 0.25 percent on the day.

2018-03-12,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s plan to broadly expand drilling in U.S. offshore waters is moving slowly due to opposition from coastal states and indifference from oil companies that have turned their focus to other opportunities. The administration hopes encouraging U.S. energy development outside of shale oilfields will further its goal of “energy dominance.” But existing Obama administration lease rules remain in place through 2022 unless the new rules gain approval.   The Department of the Interior this year proposed opening vast new acreage in the U.S. outer continental shelf to drilling. The comment period wrapped up March 9. Still, Secretary Ryan Zinke said last week he remained deep in discussions with state governors, some of whom have thrown up roadblocks that would impede or bar drilling off their coasts.   A new outer continental shelf lease program proposes 47 lease sales, including areas that had not been offered since 1983. At least 12 states have sought exemptions, and Zinke has agreed to exclude areas off Florida. “On the five-year plan we made everything available to look at,” Zinke told Reuters at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. Governors from across the West Coast and much of the East Coast are meeting with the Interior and objecting to areas off their states for drilling. State discussions could last through year end. So far, officials in Alaska, Maine, Georgia and U.S Gulf Coast states other than Florida have said they were open to expanding drilling. California and other states have said they would deny needed permits for onshore services or transport. “You can’t bring energy ashore unless you have access to state waters,” Zinke said.    While oil companies say they have met with Interior officials on Gulf of Mexico access to new regions, Zinke said they must go through the official comment process. “They know my position: we put everything on and will go line by line,” he said. While Washington continues to discuss the opening with states, oil companies are turning to well-mapped basins in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and other nations were deepwater drilling or auctions are ongoing, like Brazil, Mexico and Guyana.  “We are constantly scouring the planet to really understand resource potential,” said Steve Pastor, BHP Billiton’s (BHP.AX) president of petroleum operations. The Gulf of Mexico has some of the best discovered potential, he said.  BHP has previously explored acreage in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, at its Sake project, in a formation off the coast of Alabama.  Proposed new lease areas along the U.S. Atlantic coast would require seismic mapping and development of infrastructure that would take time. “I can’t put a fine point on whether we would pursue it,” Pastor said.  Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which disclosed a large Gulf of Mexico oil discovery in existing lease areas earlier this year, said new areas will have to stack up against existing projects.  They “will have to compete with the other drilling we have in the world,” said Robert Ryan, Chevron’s vice president of global exploration. “We just don’t know, most of those areas haven’t been evaluated yet.”   Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which is active in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, said it was encouraged by the additional Gulf acreage that is opening under existing lease sales. Costs, including a recent 25 percent tariff on imported steel, would be an issue.  “We know what we like here,” said Wael Sawan, Shell’s executive vice president of deepwater. “We’re encouraged by some of the elements but then some things like steel tariffs raise a question mark,” he said.

2018-03-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - RWE and E.ON’s EONGN.DE surprise carve up of Germany’s Innogy (IGY.DE) could complicate a merger of SSE (SSE.L) and Innogy-owned npower to create Britain’s second largest energy supplier, although both firms said it remained on track.  Under Sunday’s proposed break-up of Innogy, its assets will be divided between parent RWE and E.ON, which would take over npower, potentially raising regulatory concerns, some analysts said on Monday. SSE and npower said last year they would merge their retail gas and power operations, combining some 11.5 million customers to better challenge top-ranked British Gas. Uncertainty over the merger plan hit SSE shares on Monday. They were down 1.6 percent to 1237 pence per share at 1526 GMT, underperforming the wider FTSE 100 index .FTSE. SSE and npower said in separate statements that their proposed deal was on track despite the development in Germany, without giving further details.. Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is expected to make an initial decision by April 26 on the planned merger, said on Monday it will be engaging with both SSE and Innogy to consider the implications of the new German deal. “The deal the CMA has been looking at is between Innogy’s npower and SSE, but now if npower is owned by E.ON, that’s three of the big six (energy suppliers) involved,” Jefferies analyst Ahmed Farman told Reuters. Britain’s “big six” energy suppliers control around 80 percent of the retail energy market. The other three suppliers are Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, EDF Energy (EDF.PA) and Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power. “It could potentially complicate things from a regulatory point of view,” Farman added. Innogy, RWE and SSE have not commented on how the E.ON/Innogy transaction could impact the British merger which would create a new separately-listed retail company, with SSE shareholders holding 65.6 percent and Innogy 34.4 percent. But Innogy said on Monday the joint venture with SSE has great strategic importance for the group, adding the deal had been filed with British antitrust bodies and was expected to close late this year or early in 2019. One solution to potential regulatory hurdles could be for E.ON to sell down its Innogy share in the new company, said Peter Atherton, an associate at consultancy Cornwall Insight. “We haven’t seen any indication E.ON wants to do that, but if it (the SSE/Innogy merger) is a stumbling block for the wider deal then that is a logical solution,” he said. E.ON has not given any further details on its plans for npower, but said it intends to take on Innogy’s retail business. Innogy managers, speaking at the group’s annual news conference, said the UK market environment remained difficult, despite Innogy having cut prices and invested efforts in stemming customer losses.

2018-03-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - npower, the British retail arm of German utility Innogy (IGY.DE), lost 155,000 domestic accounts last year amid the highest customer churn in the UK for several years, the firm said in its annual results on Monday. Npower’s revenues for 2017 dropped by 76 million pounds ($106 million) to 6.027 billion pounds due to fierce competition between suppliers, it said in a statement. It had 4.56 million UK customer accounts at the end of 2017, down from 4.71 million a year earlier. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2017 rose by 34 million pounds from a year earlier to 56 million pounds, mainly thanks to a savings programme. “Energy supply remains an extremely competitive market. Rising costs and the changing regulatory landscape, such as the proposed standard variable tariff price cap, present all energy suppliers with real challenges,” npower’s Chief Executive Paul Coffey said in a statement. “While we saw a 155,000 year-on-year decline in domestic customer accounts, these can largely be attributed to the first quarter,” he said, adding that the company gained customers during the rest of the year which partially offset first quarter losses. Britain’s energy firms are under pressure to reduce bills. Regulator Ofgem is preparing to issue a price cap on the most widely used tariffs. Large energy suppliers have been losing market share as smaller rivals have lured customers away with cheaper deals. Innogy-owned npower and SSE (SSE.L) said last year they would merge their retail gas and power operations, combining some 11.5 million customers to better challenge top-ranked British Gas. However, a surprise breakup of Innogy by RWE (RWEG.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE), announced on Sunday, could complicate the merger, some analysts said. Coffey said the proposed merger was on track and the company recently started work to start a review process for the Competition and Markets Authority.

2018-03-12,"FRANKFURT/ESSEN (Reuters) - Plans to carve up Innogy (IGY.DE) between parent RWE (RWEG.DE) and fellow utility E.ON (EONGn.DE) are unlikely to be disrupted  by rival bidders due to the complexity of the planned transaction, people close to the matter said. RWE, which owns 76.8 percent of Innogy, had also already explored alternative combinations but without reaching agreement, further reducing the chances of the deal now being challenged. The transaction announced on Sunday will sharpen the corporate focus of RWE, which will become one of Europe’s largest renewable players, and create one of the continent’s top grids and energy retail players under the umbrella of E.ON. “The chance of a rival bidder coming in is at best 5 percent,” one of the people said, adding that it would be hard for any potential interloper to offer an attractive mix of assets to both RWE and E.ON. RWE had been in talks with European peers including Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Enel (ENEI.MI) over the last year on a potential transaction and was even close to reaching a deal with Iberdrola (IBE.MC) in late 2017, the sources said. “It was a competitive process,” one of the sources said, adding that RWE had decided to strike the deal with E.ON after considering proposals from peers. One source said Australia’s Macquarie (MQG.AX) had also been in the race. While asset swaps had been discussed with other European companies, too, RWE never felt comfortable with taking on large exposure to southern Europe, the people said, citing ill-fated forays into the region by E.ON (EONGn.DE) during the last decade. A German deal was also seen as having better chances to receive political backing. Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the deal and said she had faith in Germany’s utilities to find the best way to adapt to the country’s energy shift dubbed Energiewende. Under Merkel, Germany decided to phase out nuclear power by 2022 as a direct consequence of the disaster at the Fukushima plant in Japan, dealing a major blow to E.ON and RWE and forcing a far-reaching strategy rethink. While the two companies were in touch with each other over the last year, concrete negotiations about Innogy only picked up this year, the sources said. Former Innogy chief executive Peter Terium left the company in late 2017, following a profit warning, but people close to the matter said that the real reason for his departure was his opposition to the asset swap.  Despite being an internal German deal, the asset swap of RWE and E.ON could accelerate the consolidation of the energy sector in Europe, according to a person familiar with the industry. “Inevitably, there are going to be movements. The CEOs of the energy companies could get nervous with this deal,” the person said, adding that the deal would also potentially open up opportunities to snap up assets that RWE and E.ON have to sell to get regulatory clearance for their deal.

2018-03-12,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian employers and labor unions embarked on four weeks’ of wage talks on Monday to stave off widespread strikes that risk impacting output in western Europe’s biggest crude producer. Unlike most years, in which wages are set on an industry-by-industry basis to reduce complexity, the 2018 round rolls a majority of private sector firms into a single negotiation in a bid to resolve a stand-off over pension reform. “We’ve understood that there is no real will among employers to compromise from the outset,” labor union negotiator Asle Reime, who will represent oil workers, told Reuters ahead of the talks. “Pension rights are important to all workers regardless of which industry they are in, that’s why I think there is more weight behind the demands this year and also more willingness to strike,” he added. While employers are willing to discuss an increase in inflation-adjusted pay, it will be more difficult to meet demands for better pensions and change in travel-related compensation, Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO) Chief Executive Kristin Skogen Lund told reporters. If initial talks break down, a state-appointed mediator will attempt to broker a deal in the final days leading up to an April 7 deadline, after which most workers are allowed to go on strike unless an agreement is found. A few days in advance, Labour unions must name the companies that would be hit in a first wave of industrial action, making it difficult to predict how extensive an initial walk-out could be. While Norway’s production of oil and natural gas is unlikely to be targeted from the start since the contract for rig workers’ is valid until June, unions may still hit the sector by shutting down yards and other suppliers. Onshore processing and export facilities for natural gas are also at risk of strike, unions said, while offshore oil production workers could become involved in any extended strike. Western Europe’s largest producer of oil and gas pumps about two million barrels of crude, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) per day, while its output of natural gas stands at around 320 million cubic meters per day.

2018-03-12,"(Adds info on France contribution) By Huizhong Wu NEW DELHI, March 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has moved to quickly scale up its use of renewable power. In 2014, the year Modi took office, India had 3 gigawatts of solar power. By the end of 2017, it had nearly 7 times that, or 20 GW, according to industry tracker Bridge to India, a renewable energy consultancy. Now India wants to quintuple that total by 2022 – a goal once seen as hugely ambitious but now considered within reach by energy experts. Progress is clearly happening quickly: During 2017 alone, India doubled its installed solar capacity from 10 GW to 20 GW. “India is going to maintain and accelerate the momentum. It will move to be the number two player in the next year or two,” said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Australia-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a think tank. In 2017, India added the third largest amount of national solar capacity, just behind the U.S. and China, and was overtaking Japan, according to IEEFA research. Now, in partnership with France, India wants to take its growing resources and knowledge on solar power and use it to help other sunny countries jumpstart their solar ambitions as well. On Sunday, in New Delhi, Modi and the French President Emmanuel Macron hosted the launch of a solar energy partnership that aims to build a network to help tropical countries around the world boost their use of solar power. “In the Vedas (ancient Hindu texts), the sun was thought to be the world’s soul. In India, the sun was thought of as the nurturer of all life,” Modi said at the launch of the International Solar Alliance (ISA). “These days, when we are looking for a way to combat climate change, we must look to this ancient perspective,” he said. As part of the alliance, India will offer financial support to help with 27 solar projects in other countries, the prime minister said. Macron said France also will commit 700 million euros to the alliance. Upendra Tripathy, the director general of the new alliance, said it aims scale-up solar power in many more countries. “Everyone has access to (the sun) but in terms of ability to exploit solar energy, (that) is not equal,” he said in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Credit is a challenge. Skillset is a challenge. The fundamental issue is, do all member countries have equal ability to exploit solar energy?” ISA plans to address that issue in part by creating a larger, global market for solar technology that would benefit smaller countries by aggregating the risk and the demand, Tripathy said. The alliance, an effort to advance the 2015 Paris climate agreement, aims to become a network of 121 countries, he said. Currently 32 countries are full members and another 61 are on their way to full membership. Many are developing nations. India’s solar push is in part boosted by steadily dropping costs of providing solar energy. To produce a unit of solar power now costs 2.5 rupees – a cost similar to that of more traditional energy sources, said Kanika Chawla, the senior programme lead at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a partner organisation of the ISA. India’s transition to renewable energy - without shutting down its coal-fired power plants - represents a new model for developing countries going forward, Chawla said in a telephone interview. But India still gets about three-quarters of its power from coal, although that is expected to fall to below 50 percent by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. India’s power providers, largely state-run public companies, are heavily in debt and as a result many companies generating solar power are not being paid on time, Chawla said. India’s government also is considering a 70 percent tariff on solar imports to protect India’s solar manufacturers – something that is causing a lot of uncertainty as investors try to bring new solar projects into the country, Buckley said. Other issues for the nation’s solar scale-up include the tricky business of figuring out how to integrate renewables into the existing electricity grid and the lack of a business model for such utilities – a problem other countries using solar energy also face, Chawla said. All of these issues have contributed to a slowdown in the pace at which solar projects are being commissioned in India, she said. But what the renewable energy future holds for the South Asian giant will be critical for the world, climate change experts say. As China’s economic growth slows, India’s is heating up, along with its energy demand. India is today the top contributor to growth in energy demand, according to the International Energy Agency. “It’s worth acknowledging the Indian market and economy is still significantly smaller than China and it will be for some time to come,” Buckley said. However, “India is very much wedded to the energy transformation. It’s coming straight from the Prime Minister, and the energy minister and the coal minister are very much onboard,” he said. And “especially with the U.S. leaving the Paris agreement, there’s a perceived void that some country needs to fill – and the International Solar Alliance is a clever way of signaling climate leadership”, Chawla said. “It is India’s offering to the world.” (Reporting by Huizhong Wu ; editing by Laurie Goering : (Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.

2018-03-12,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s state-owned electricity distributor has given businesses, including mines and large-scale farms, six months to clear their bills or risk being cut off and face litigation, the company said on Monday. The Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDS) is owed more than $1 billion by electricity users, including domestic households, farmers, industries and mining companies. ZETDC said in a public notice that businesses had six months to clear their bills because it required the money to pay for electricity imports to supplement local generation. Zimbabwe, which has had stable electricity supplies for more than a year, currently produces 938 megawatts and imports up to 450 megawatts from South Africa and Mozambique. Isaac Kwesu, the chief executive of the Chamber of Mines, said although some members had accrued huge bills over the years, they had made plans to clear the arrears with ZETDC. “I know members will make all efforts to honor their dues because there is no one who can afford to have a mine closed,” Kwesu said, but declined to name members with arrears. Zimbabwe this month expects to commission two new generating units at the country’s biggest hydro power plant, Kariba, which will add 300 megawatts of capacity.

2018-03-12,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2DmlwXg By John Kemp LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have resumed liquidating their bullish long positions in crude oil and refined fuels amid more signs that the earlier rally in prices has fizzled out. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 50 million barrels in the week to March 6. The reduction largely reversed an increase of 68 million barrels the previous week, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2DmlwXg). Portfolio managers have now reduced their net long position in petroleum in five of the last six weeks by a total of 245 million barrels since Jan. 23. The most recent week saw a reduction in net length in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-17 million barrels), Brent (-5 million), U.S. gasoline (-10 million), U.S. heating oil (-5 million) and European gasoil (-13 million). Some of the froth has blown off the market in the last six weeks but the hedge fund community still has a very bullish bias towards oil prices. Fund managers hold a net long position in the six major petroleum contracts amounting to 1,239 million barrels of oil, a level of bullishness that had never been seen until four months ago. Long positions still outnumbered short positions by a ratio of 10:1, down from a peak of almost 12:1 in January, but again a level of bullishness that was unprecedented until this year. With so many long positions already established, and few remaining short positions to cover, oil prices have struggled to rise further in recent weeks. Instead the market has seen a slow but steady liquidation with existing longs cut by a total of almost 250 million barrels (15 percent) since Jan. 23. It remains uncertain whether this is merely a pause and the price rally will resume shortly, or whether it marks a temporary peak, with more liquidation and price falls to come. But the balance of risks remains tilted towards the downside in the short term given the huge number of long positions still hanging over the market.

2018-03-12,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Rating’s agency Moody’s warned on Monday the water crisis affecting Cape Town would cause the city’s borrowing to rise sharply and the provincial economy to shrink the longer the situation lasted.  A severe drought afflicting South Africa’s Western Cape province is expected to cut agricultural output by 20 percent in 2018, decimating the wheat crop and reducing apple, grape and pear exports to Europe, according to national government. The City is bracing for “Day Zero” in late August when its taps could run dry. Moody’s said in a report that one of the most direct impacts would be on Cape Town’s operating revenues, as 10 percent of them are from water charges. The ratings agency estimates capital expenditure related to water and sanitation infrastructure could be as much as 12.7 billion rand ($1 billion) over the next five years. “The long-term solutions are likely to require significant capital and operating expenditure,” Daniel Mazibuko, an analyst at Moody’s said. The drought also threatens to slow South Africa’s economic rebound which has been fueled by a surge in agricultural production. Cape town generated nearly 10 percent of the country’s total gross domestic product in 2016.  Last Tuesday, Statistics South Africa said the economy grew 3.1 percent in October-December, the highest rate since the second quarter of 2016, after expanding by a revised 2.3 percent in the third quarter. Agriculture showed a 37.5 percent expansion after growing 41.1 percent in the previous quarter.    Government has declared drought a national disaster after its southern and western regions including Cape Town got hit hard by the drought, freeing extra funds to tackle the crisis.

2018-03-12,"* Private sector firms begin talks with labour unions * All major industries involved, including oil, gas * Risk of strike unless agreement by April 7 deadline By Camilla Knudsen OSLO, March 12 (Reuters) - Norwegian employers and labour unions embarked on four weeks’ of wage talks on Monday to stave off widespread strikes that risk impacting output in western Europe’s biggest crude producer. Unlike most years, in which wages are set on an industry-by-industry basis to reduce complexity, the 2018 round rolls a majority of private sector firms into a single negotiation in a bid to resolve a stand-off over pension reform. “We’ve understood that there is no real will among employers to compromise from the outset,” labour union negotiator Asle Reime, who will represent oil workers, told Reuters ahead of the talks. “Pension rights are important to all workers regardless of which industry they are in, that’s why I think there is more weight behind the demands this year and also more willingness to strike,” he added. If initial talks break down, a state-appointed mediator will attempt to broker a deal in the final days leading up to an April 7 deadline, after which most workers are allowed to go on strike unless an agreement is found. A few days in advance, Labour unions must name the companies that would be hit in a first wave of industrial action, making it difficult to predict in advance how extensive an initial walk-out could be. While Norway’s production of oil and natural gas is unlikely to be targeted from the start since the contract for rig workers’ is valid until June, unions may still hit the sector by shutting down yards and other suppliers. Onshore processing and export facilities for natural gas are also at risk of strike, unions said, while offshore oil production workers could become involved in any extended strike. Western Europe’s largest producer of oil and gas pumps about two million barrels of crude, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) per day, while its output of natural gas stands at around 320 million cubic metres per day.

2018-03-12,"LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - RWE and E.ON’s surprise carve up of Germany’s Innogy could complicate a merger of SSE and Innogy-owned npower to create Britain’s second largest energy supplier. Under Sunday’s proposed break-up of Innogy, its assets will be divided between parent RWE and E.ON, which would take over npower, potentially raising regulatory concerns, some analysts said on Monday. SSE and npower said last year they would merge their retail gas and power operations, combining some 11.5 million customers to better challenge top-ranked British Gas. Uncertainty over the merger plan hit SSE shares on Monday. They were down 1.2 percent to 1242 pence per share at 1210 GMT, underperforming the wider FTSE 100 index. Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is expected to make an initial decision by April 26 on the planned merger, said on Monday it will be engaging with both SSE and Innogy to consider the implications of the new German deal. “The deal the CMA has been looking at is between Innogy’s npower and SSE, but now if npower is owned by E.ON, that’s three of the big six (energy suppliers) involved,” Jefferies analyst Ahmed Farman told Reuters. Britain’s “big six” energy suppliers control around 80 percent of the retail energy market. The other three suppliers are Centrica’s British Gas, EDF Energy and Iberdrola’s Scottish Power. “It could potentially complicate things from a regulatory point of view,” Farman added. Innogy, RWE and SSE have not commented on how the E.ON/Innogy transaction could impact the British merger which would create a new separately-listed retail company, with SSE shareholders holding 65.6 percent and Innogy 34.4 percent. But Innogy said on Monday the joint venture with SSE has great strategic importance for the group, adding the deal had been filed with British antitrust bodies and was expected to close late this year or early in 2019. One solution to potential regulatory hurdles could be for E.ON to sell down its Innogy share in the new company, said Peter Atherton, an associate at consultancy Cornwall Insight. “We haven’t seen any indication E.ON wants to do that, but if it (the SSE/Innogy merger) is a stumbling block for the wider deal then that is a logical solution,” he said. E.ON has not given any further details on its plans for npower, but said it intends to take on Innogy’s retail business. Innogy managers, speaking at the group’s annual news conference, said the UK market environment remained difficult, despite Innogy having cut prices and invested efforts in stemming customer losses.

European shares shot up across the board, following their Asian counterparts, while emerging market currencies strengthened as investors bought up so-called riskier assets and sold “safe haven” securities such as gold and government bonds. Markets have been cheering Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls data which showed a hefty 313,000 rise in jobs, but also revealed that annual growth in average hourly earnings had slowed to 2.6 percent after spiking in January. This suggested that the world’s largest economy is experiencing a high growth without a corresponding spike in inflation. This is referred to in the market as a “Goldilocks” trend; giving investors an incentive to buy assets such as equities and high-yield bonds without having to fear tighter central bank policy. “Friday’s U.S. employment data was about as perfect a set of figures as you can get from a policy maker’s point of view. The increase in jobs was nothing short of amazing,” said Marshall Gittler, a strategist at ACLS Global, a currency strategy firm. “In other words, it was a ‘Goldilocks’ report: not too hot, not too cold, just right.” As a result, the S&P500 surged more than 1.7 percent on Friday — its second-best day of the year so far — and futures pricing pointed to another day of gains on Monday. The warm glow extended around the globe, with Asian and European shares gaining. Germany’s DAX led gains in Europe, rising 0.9 percent, and MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hit a two-week high. Inflation data from the world’s largest economy is due on Tuesday, and the question is how signs of economic strength may affect the U.S. Federal Reserve’s pace of monetary tightening. “The jobs report will reinforce the confidence the Fed has on economic momentum - it’s a very solid reading, plus you add a bit of (fiscal) stimulus on top,” said Investec economist Victoria Clarke. “But they are a cautious institution who will be wary of reading too much into one print.” Earlier, MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.3 percent, poised for a third session of gains. South Korea rose 1 percent, while Australia’s main index added 0.7 percent, boosted by mining shares on news that Australia could be exempt from new U.S. trade tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Concerns over those tariffs have been weighing on European stocks, with the main pan-European stock index hitting a seven-month low at the start of the month. It has recovered somewhat from that trough to rise 0.3 percent on Monday. The jobs news also lifted currencies such as the Mexican peso and Canadian and Australian dollars, while weighing on the safe-haven yen. Investors had trimmed holdings of yen last week on news U.S. President Donald Trump was prepared to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a potential breakthrough in nuclear tensions in the region. U.S. officials on Sunday defended Trump’s decision, saying the move was not just for show and not a gift to Pyongyang. Brent crude gave up some of Friday’s gains, dropping 35 cents to $65.14 a barrel, as rising U.S. output loomed over markets despite a slowdown in rig drilling activity. Gold prices also slipped half a percent to $1,315.81 an ounce, as demand for safe haven investments fell.

2018-03-12,"(Repeats March 11 item for additional readers with no changes to headline or text) By Allison Martell HAMILTON, ONTARIO, March 11 (Reuters) - A temporary exemption from U.S. tariffs is little comfort to the Canadian steel city of Hamilton, coping with months of uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a potentially devastating 25 percent duty unless the North American Free Trade Agreement is renegotiated. Canadian negotiators are weighing the interests of the relatively small sector, responsible for about 22,000 direct Canadian jobs and C$9.0 billion ($7.0 billion) in U.S. exports, against those of bigger industries like auto manufacturing and politically influential groups like dairy farmers. “I don’t think we’re at the end of it. Now it’s being used as leverage,” said Hamilton Port Authority Chief Executive Officer Ian Hamilton. “President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on everybody.” Hamilton, population 700,000, has pushed to diversify its economy, with better transit links to Toronto and affordable homes that are attracting families priced out of Canada’s biggest city. A C$139-million project is underway to clean up coal tar that contaminates the harbor and condos are replacing once empty downtown storefronts. When Canadian steel escaped U.S. steel tariffs in 2002, the duties had diverted some cheap steel into Canada. In recent years, a global steel glut has made it difficult for Canadian mills to compete. But ArcelorMittal’s Dofasco mill, coking and finishing operations at Stelco, and a collection of smaller operations still directly employ 10,000 people in Hamilton. The North American steel industry is heavily integrated, with raw materials, steel and parts crossing the U.S.-Canadian border several times before a finished product such as a vehicle or refrigerator is sold to consumers. About 65 percent of the Hamilton port’s tonnage is iron ore and coal used to make steel. Hamilton, the port president, said one steel company called after Trump first signaled the tariffs on March 1, when it was unclear whether Canada would be exempt at all. The firm wanted to know if the agency might be willing to take over management of its warehouse and find different cargo to fill it. Hamilton Chamber of Commerce President Keanin Loomis, a former Washington lawyer, is part of a new generation in the city who have never worked in a steel mill. But like much of the city, he has a personal connection to steel, a father-in-law retired from the Dofasco mill. If a tariff is imposed, Loomis expects imports to lower domestic steel prices, potentially driving some employers south of the border, where tariffs are expected to boost prices. Loomis said high labor costs, environmental regulations and a looming carbon tax already make it difficult for the steel industry to compete. “This could be the thing that puts it over the edge,” he said. The city’s United Steelworkers Local 1005 has only about 550 active members, down from more than 13,000 in its heyday in the 1970s. The local union represents workers at Stelco, but not Dofasco, which never organized. Since 2004 it has weathered the closure of Stelco’s Hamilton mill, Stelco’s two trips through bankruptcy protection, and two new owners. Members at another plant, Max Aicher North America, have been locked out for almost five years over proposed wage and benefit cuts. And union president Gary Howe sees choppy waters ahead. “With Trump being in there, it’s probably never going to be over,” he said. The Canadian government has vowed to continue lobbying Washington until the threat of duties disappears. Pressed on Trump’s decision to link the exemption to NAFTA, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Thursday that Canada considers the two issues to be totally separate. “I think they should get some more backbone,” Steve Kajganic, a retired veteran of the Stelco mill and a second-generation steelworker, said of the Canadian government. “Stand up for our country, instead of selling it out.” (Editing by Denny Thomas and Jeffrey Benkoe)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-canada-hamilton/rpt-canadas-steel-town-still-nervous-despite-tariff-reprieve-idUKL1N1QT0IL,12 Mar 2018,"A temporary

2018-03-12,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s oil ministry on Monday said the nation would reduce its petroleum products imports by 25 percent as crude oil refineries are being rehabilitated following fighting with Islamic State militants. Iraq is also producing more oil products by processing natural gas liquids, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said in a statement, without indicating a specific timeframe for the import cuts. The ministry has announced in the past few months an increase in the capacity of the Kirkuk oil refinery as well as plans to this year to rehabilitate parts of the Baiji plant, which used to be Iraq’s largest petroleum processing facility. Iraq is OPEC’s second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia. Its refining capacity was curtailed when Islamic State militants overran Baiji, north of Baghdad, in 2014. Iraqi forces recaptured Baiji in 2015 but it sustained heavy damage. The country now relies mainly on the Dora refinery, in Baghdad, and the southern Shuaiba plant.

2018-03-12,"JAKARTA, March 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s plans to keep electricity tariffs and some fuel prices unchanged for the next two years would cost around 8.1 trillion rupiah ($588.36 million) in additional subsidies this year alone, finance ministry officials said on Monday. The plans, which have to be discussed with parliamentarians, were announced last week as a measure to increase the purchasing power of the country’s citizens. Southeast Asia’s largest economy grew 5.07 percent in 2017, its best pace in four years, but consumption - the biggest contributor to the economy - has remained sluggish at around 5 percent versus a pre-financial crisis era rise of 6 percent. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the measure was needed to maintain a low inflation rate, since the average oil price is expected to be higher than initially anticipated in 2018, while the rupiah exchange rate will likely be weaker. “We are mitigating the risks to inflation and to the balance sheets of companies through a number of regulations,” Indrawati told reporters. The rupiah is forecast to trade at 13,500 to the dollar on average in 2018, compared to the government’s initial forecast of 13,400, she said, adding that Indonesia’s crude oil price is expected at $55-$60 a barrel, compared to $48. Askolani, director general of budgeting at the ministry, said the 2018 budget deficit is still seen at 2.19 percent of gross domestic product, despite the increase in subsidies, as oil and gas-related revenue would also rise. Indonesia’s annual inflation rate in February was 3.18 percent, the lowest since December 2016. The central bank is targeting inflation of 2.5-4.5 percent for 2018.

European shares shot up across the board, following their Asian counterparts, while emerging market currencies strengthened as investors bought up so-called riskier assets and sold “safe haven” securities such as gold and government bonds. Markets have been cheering Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls data which showed a hefty 313,000 rise in jobs, but also revealed that annual growth in average hourly earnings had slowed to 2.6 percent after spiking in January. This suggested that the world’s largest economy is experiencing a combination of high growth and low inflation, referred to in the market as a “Goldilocks” trend; giving investors an incentive to buy assets such as equities and high-yield bonds without having to fear tighter central bank policy. “Friday’s U.S. employment data was about as perfect a set of figures as you can get from a policy maker’s point of view.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.3 percent, poised for a third session of gains. South Korea rose 1 percent while Australia’s main index added 0.7 percent, boosted by mining shares on news that Australia could be exempt from new U.S. trade tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 put on another 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.2 percent, showing little immediate reaction as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came under renewed fire over suspicions of cronyism involving the sale of state-owned land. Inflation worries faded on Friday after U.S. data showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by 313,000 jobs last month, but annual growth in average hourly earnings slowed to 2.6 percent after a spike in January. The pullback in wages tempered speculation the Federal Reserve would project four rate hikes - or dot plots - at its policy meeting next week, instead of the current three. “The release threaded the stock needle perfectly, exhibiting strong overall net job adds alongside an increase in the participation rate and tepid wages suggesting labour demand is being met by new entrants into the workforce,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. “In reality though the market is probably reading too much into a single jobs report,” they cautioned. “A fourth dot on March 21 may have been averted but the labour market is increasingly demonstrating evidence of tightness and this will inevitably translate into upside wage pressure.” For now, Wall Street was happy to take the data at face value and the Dow jumped 1.77 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.74 percent and the Nasdaq 1.79 percent. On the week, the S&P rose 3.5 percent, the Dow 3.25 percent and Nasdaq 4.2 percent. The jobs news likewise lifted riskier currencies, including the Mexican peso and Canadian and Australian dollars, while weighing on the safe-haven yen. Those cross currents left the U.S. dollar a shade lower against a basket of currencies at 89.973. The euro was last up a fraction at $1.2323. The dollar edged down on the yen to 106.38, having bounced 0.5 percent on Friday.

2018-03-12,"* Province says controversial dam “fully legally compliant” * NGO said project encroaches upon forests, nature reserves * Yunnan’s green energy ambitions still stymied by grid failures By David Stanway BEIJING, March 12 (Reuters) - Officials from southwest China’s Yunnan province have defended a plan to build a dam in the region as “fully legally compliant”, after an environment group took developers of the project to court last month for violating laws. The Beijing-based Friends of Nature had filed a suit against the 113-megawatt Huilong Mountain hydropower plant on the Mekong river in rural Xishuangbanna, near the Myanmar border, saying it would destroy rain forest and encroach upon nature reserves. “In the project we discovered several serious problems,” said Zhang Boju, the group’s executive director. “Looking at them from current legislation, we saw they could be considered in breach of the law.” But Xishuangbanna Governor Luo Hongjiang said, in a statement sent to Reuters during the latest session of China’s parliament, that construction was “fully legally compliant” since approval was granted in 2015. “Various laws related to the development and utilisation of hydropower, environmental protection, fish habitats in the Lancang (Mekong) river basin, management of nature reserves and so on have been strictly implemented,” he added. China Resources Power, the developer leading the project, did not respond to questions about the project. Hydropower has been at the heart of China’s efforts to cut its dependence on coal, and it promised in guidelines published last week that it would speed up dam-building in the southwest this year and add another 6 gigawatts of capacity. But projects in the region, including the world’s biggest at the Three Gorges, have been responsible for flooding fragile ecosystems, displacing millions and worsening earthquake risks. The Mekong and the Salween rivers also flow into Myanmar and Thailand, raising concerns about downstream water disruptions. Grid deficiencies and weak local demand have also meant that Yunnan’s existing plants run at less than optimal levels. Yunnan’s governor Ruan Chengfa said last week the province was “in pain” because of weak grid coverage. “We are not using green energy to the full, and we are suffering about 30 billion kilowatt-hours of wasted hydro every year.” Several projects, including a series of dams on the Salween, have been shelved because of grid deficiencies. Resolving grid issues will take time, said Stephanie Jensen-Cormier, NGO International Rivers’ China program director. “It would be foolish for the local government to continue to build dams before having fully addressed these issues.” Friends of Nature’s Zhang said local authorities were underestimating the costs of hydro and exaggerating benefits. “We think if Yunnan continues plans to develop as a green power and energy base with hydropower at its core, it will probably be in violation of the central government’s policies and curbs,” he added.

2018-03-12,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Embattled commodities trader Noble Group has opted not to pay the coupon on a $750 million bond, but said on Monday that it was “very close” to reaching final terms with a group of senior creditors over a proposed restructuring of its debt. The company, which reported a $4.9 billion loss for 2017,  has been negotiating a $3.4 billion debt-for-equity swap - crucial to its survival - after it sold billions of dollars of assets, took hefty writedowns and cut hundreds of jobs over the past three years. “In reaching its decision not to pay the coupon, the Board consulted extensively with an ad hoc group of the Group’s senior creditors (the “Ad Hoc Group’) and took into consideration advice received from the Group’s legal and financial advisors,” Noble said in a statement. The coupon on the five-year 8.75 percent notes, which  Thomson Reuters International Financing Review said garnered orders of $2.4 billion last year, was due on March 9. Noble said that under the terms of the 2022 notes, it now had a 30-day grace period. Some analysts had expected Noble not to pay the coupon while the company’s debt was being restructured. Noble has a $379 million bond that matures on March 20. Noble is seeking to halve its senior debt and hand over 70 percent of the restructured business to a group of senior creditors, known as the Ad Hoc Group, while existing equity holders would be diluted to 10 percent and company management would end up owning up to 20 percent.  “The board currently considers that the company is very close to reaching final terms with the Ad Hoc Group in respect of a proposed restructuring of the group’s unsecured liabilities,” Noble said. The company’s debt restructuring deal has been opposed by some bondholders and shareholders including Goldilocks Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi Financial Group equity fund.Noble, which had ambitions to rival global commodity traders such as Glencore and Vitol, has shrunk to its Asian roots, dealing in commodities such as coal and owning freight and liquefied natural gas (LNG) businesses. Noble’s shares rose 22 percent to S$0.16 on Monday. The company’s market value stands at just S$215 million ($164 million) from $6 billion in February 2015.

2018-03-12,"(Adds comments from CPC, government official; background) TAIPEI, March 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan’s government has ordered state-run refiner CPC Corp to partially suspend operations at a refinery in the southern city of Kaohsiung, a government official told Reuters on Monday, after a fire injured three workers. CPC’s Talin refinery in Kaohsiung was hit by an explosion on Saturday and part of its production will be suspended until further review, said Chung Mon Pi, chief secretary of the city’s Labour Affairs Bureau. The incident will affect daily production of about 35,000 barrels of reformate, but there will be no shortfall in domestic supply thanks to abundant inventory, CPC Vice President Ann Bih told Reuters by telephone. However, the company will “adjust its supply” to overseas markets, she said but did not elaborate. CPC is aiming to resume its full production at the plant by end-March after a review by the government, she said. “The company has to address our concerns and improve safety before it’s allowed to resume full production,” said Pi. The injured workers remained in intensive care unit, the government said. The company said total damage and the exact reason for the fire were still under investigation. It was fined T$300,000 ($10,253) by authorities in Kaohsiung after the incident. CPC’s diesel output was hit in January after an explosion at a refinery in the northwestern city of Taoyuan. Bih said it will still “take some time” for the company to fully resume the production at the plant.

2018-03-12,"* Nikkei up 1.5 pct, leads Asia higher after Wall St jump * Market sees best of both worlds in strong U.S. jobs, soft wages * Investors await more detail on possible Trump/Kim meeting By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, March 12 (Reuters) - A relief rally swept across Asian share markets on Monday after the latest U.S. jobs report managed to impress with its strength while also easing fears of inflation and faster rate hikes, a neat feat that whetted risk appetites globally. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.1 percent, for a third session of gains. South Korea rose 1 percent while Australia’s main index added 0.7 percent, boosting by mining shares on news that Australia could be exempt from new U.S. trade tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 put on another 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.5 percent, showing little immediate reaction as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came under renewed fire over suspicions of cronyism involving the sale of state-owned land. Inflation worries faded on Friday after U.S. data showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by 313,000 jobs last month, but annual growth in average hourly earnings slowed to 2.6 percent after a spike in January. The pullback in wages tempered speculation the Federal Reserve would project four rate hikes - or dot plots - at its policy meeting next week, instead of the current three. “The release threaded the stock needle perfectly, exhibiting strong overall net job adds alongside an increase in the participation rate and tepid wages suggesting labour demand is being met by new entrants into the workforce,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. “In reality though the market is probably reading too much into a single jobs report,” they cautioned. “A fourth dot on March 21 may have been averted but the labour market is increasingly demonstrating evidence of tightness and this will inevitably translate into upside wage pressure.” For now, Wall Street was happy to take the data at face value and the Dow jumped 1.77 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.74 percent and the Nasdaq 1.79 percent. On the week, the S&P rose 3.5 percent, the Dow 3.25 percent and Nasdaq 4.2 percent. The jobs news likewise lifted riskier currencies, including the Mexican peso and Canadian and Australian dollars, while weighing on the safe-haven yen. Those cross currents left the U.S. dollar a shade lower against a basket of currencies at 90.028. The euro was last up a fraction at $1.2317, sandwiched between support at $1.2270 and resistance at $1.2296. The dollar edged down on the yen to 106.58, having bounced 0.5 percent on Friday. Investors had trimmed holdings of yen last week on news U.S. President Donald Trump was prepared to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, a potential breakthrough in nuclear tensions in the region. U.S. officials on Sunday defended Trump’s decision, saying the move was not just for show and not a gift to Pyongyang. The mix of brisk U.S. economic growth and restrained inflation was a positive one for most commodities, with industrial metals and oil performing well. Spot gold was steady on Monday at $1,323.60 an ounce. Brent crude futures rose 21 cents to $65.70 a barrel, after surging almost 3 percent on Friday.

2018-03-12,"WATAMU, Kenya, March 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Like many places in the world, Kenya’s coast faces challenges with waste plastic, from used shopping bags that block drains to throw-away water bottles that litter streets and wash into the sea. But this Indian Ocean resort village, best known for its tropical beaches and Swahili history, is taking on plastic waste, turning it into homes, furniture – and maybe even a ship capable of sailing all the way to South Africa to raise awareness about plastic pollution. Sammy Baya, for instance, one resident of the coastal community, now owns a house with walls made of stacked glass and plastic bottles. “It just like living in any other house but this one, unlike other ordinary houses, allows more light to enter the house and therefore I don’t use my solar (panels) for lighting when there is a full moon,” Baya told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “You should see the inside of this house at night when there is a full moon. It’s mesmerising,” he said. He said building his three-bedroom house last year in part with waste plastic and glass cut the costs by about 40 percent. Justin Kitsao, chairman of the Watamu Marine Association, an environmental non-governmental group, said constructing houses using plastic and glass bottles reduces the need for other building materials, particularly sand and concrete blocks. PLASTIC BANS, BUY-BACKS Watamu’s not the only part of Kenya taking action on plastic waste.  The country has banned the sale and use of disposable plastic carry bags and last month Charles Sunkuli, Kenya’s environmental principal secretary, said his ministry will launch a plastic bottle buy-back scheme in April. The move is a step back from an earlier proposed total ban on plastic bottles – but it has won the support of the key Kenyan Association of Manufacturers. Waste disposal planning “needs to be coupled with the instruments and infrastructure to help recycle and reuse waste material,” the association noted in a statement. Because throw-away plastic creates environmental pollution and takes fossil fuels to produce, cutting back on its use is important to curb climate change and improve the environment, Kenyan environmentalists say. In Watamu, Eco World, a non-governmental organisation, has hired 17 local people to collect plastic along the Indian Ocean beach each week. The group then separates the plastics according to weight before grinding some of them into tiny pieces that are sold to artisans, who use them to make chairs, poles and tables. Intact plastic and glass bottles also are washed and bound together with sand and cement to create walls that can replace brick and block walls in homes and other structures. Bottles of different sizes and colours can be used to create different effects. Any plastic waste Eco World cannot sell is donated to an unusual effort to raise awareness about the problem:  A plastic ship, being built in Lamu County, that is set to sail to South Africa to raise awareness on the importance of recycling plastic to protect the sea. Ali Skanda, who hopes to captain the voyage in June, said cutting the amount of plastic waste reaching the ocean is becoming increasingly urgent. “If we continue to litter our water bodies, the marine life might disappear one day,” he predicted in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Melinda Ress, meanwhile, the operations manager at Hemingways, a Watamu resort, said her facility has begun to replace palm leaf roofs on some structures with recycled plastic roofing. For now the material is imported from Malaysia, but the resort hopes to begin using locally recycled plastic soon, she said. “I fully support the ban on plastic bags and I wish they could extend it to the plastic straws. Plastic has been a menace to the marine ecosystem,” she said. Reporting by Benson Rioba ; editing by Laurie Goering :

2018-03-12,"* U.S. drillers cut for first time in 7 weeks -Baker Hughes * U.S. adds 313,000 new jobs in February -Labor Department By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 12 (Reuters) - Oil markets climbed on Monday on the back of a drop in the number of U.S. rigs drilling for more production and as the U.S. economy continued to create jobs, which industry hopes will drive higher fuel demand. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.22 a barrel at 0102 GMT, up 18 cents, or 0.3 percent. Brent crude futures were at $65.70 per barrel, up 21 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their previous close. “A falling rig count and the strong employment data may have helped support prices,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Rivkin Securities. The U.S. economy added the biggest number of jobs in more than 1-1/2 years in February, with non-farm payrolls jumping by 313,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. In oil markets, U.S. energy companies last week cut oil rigs for the first time in almost two months RIG-OL-USA-BHI, with drillers cutting back four rigs, to 796, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. Despite the lower rig count, which is an early indicator of future output, activity remains much higher than a year ago when, when just 617 rigs were active, and most analysts expect U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has already risen by over a fifth since mid-2016, to 10.37 million barrels per day (bpd), to rise further. That’s more than top exporter Saudi Arabia producers and almost as much as Russia pumps out, at nearly 11 million bpd. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-03-12,"* ADNOC looking to find balance in strategic partners -analyst * Deal offers low-risk, long-term supply to Eni -analyst * Agreements are for 40 years (Adds analyst comment, changes date in dateline) DUBAI, March 12 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) said on Sunday it had signed 40-year agreements with Eni , awarding the Italian company a 10 percent stake in its Umm Shaif and Nasr offshore oil concession and a 5 percent stake in Lower Zakum. Eni has contributed a participation fee of 2.1 billion dirhams ($575 million) for the Umm Shaif and Nasr offshore concession and a fee of 1.1 billion dirhams for the Lower Zakum oil concession, ADNOC said in a statement. The signing ceremony in Abu Dhabi was attended by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Italian premier Paolo Gentiloni. “The awards mark the first time an Italian energy company has been given concession rights in Abu Dhabi’s oil and gas sector,” ADNOC said in the statement. The agreements with Eni have a term of 40 years and are backdated to March 9, 2018, ADNOC said. “Our partnership with Eni, and other concession partners, will enable us to accelerate our growth, increase revenue and improve integration across the upstream value chain,” ADNOC Chief Executive Sultan Al-Jaber said in the statement. Last month, a consortium led by India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Japan’s INPEX and Spain’s Cepsa were all awarded stakes in different areas of the offshore concession. “This is the first award by ADNOC to a major (in the offshore renewal), and shows it is looking to find a balance in its strategic partners between companies from major buyers, such as Japan and India, and IOCs (international oil companies) with technology and project delivery expertise,” said Tom Quinn, senior research analyst, Middle East Upstream, Wood Mackenzie. The ADNOC deal also provides low-risk, long-term supply to Eni, and lays the foundation for the Italian company’s Middle East portfolio, Quinn said. ADNOC said on Sunday it was still finalising opportunities with potential partners for the remaining 15 percent in the Lower Zakum concession and for the remaining 30 percent stake in the Umm Shaif and Nasr concession. ADNOC will keep a 60 percent share in both concessions. In August, ADNOC said it would split its ADMA-OPCO offshore concession into three areas - Lower Zakum, Umm Shaif and Nasr, and Sateh Al Razboot and Umm Lulu - with new terms to unlock greater value and increase opportunities for partnerships. The existing ADMA-OPCO concession, which expired on March 8 produces around 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil and is projected to have a capacity of about 1.0 million bpd by 2021. The original shareholders in the ADMA-OPCO included BP , and Total SA.

2018-03-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Companies in Britain and the European Union face an extra 58 billion pounds ($80 billion) in annual costs if there is a no-deal Brexit, with Britain’s vast financial sector set to be the worst-hit industry, according to a report on Monday. Firms across the EU’s 27 countries other than Britain will have to pay 31 billion pounds a year in tariff and non-tariff barriers if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal, the report by Oliver Wyman management consultants and law firm Clifford Chance said. In return, British exporters to the EU will have to pay 27 billion pounds a year. “These increased costs and uncertainty threaten to reduce profitability and pose existential threats to some businesses,” the report said.  Britain is due to leave the EU next year after voting in favor of ending more than four decades of political, economic and legal ties with the world’s largest trading bloc. In the absence of an agreement, trade between Britain and the other 27 EU members would default to World Trade Organization rules and tariffs, a sharp contrast to the access the UK has enjoyed as a member of the EU’s single market. Although Britain wants a deal, the government says it is preparing for any outcome, including the chance that Britain could crash out of the bloc without a deal. It has set aside 3 billion pounds to prepare for all eventualities. If Britain stays in a form of a customs union it would reduce the costs for both sides by about half, the report said. However, Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out keeping Britain in an EU customs union because it would prevent the country from striking its own trade deals with fast-growing economies such as China and India. Monday’s report showed 70 percent of the extra costs in Britain from a no-deal Brexit would be shared by five industries: financial services, cars, agriculture and food and drink, consumer goods and chemicals and plastics. Financial services firms in Britain would suffer the biggest hit because, unlike some automotive and aerospace firms that can switch to domestic suppliers of components, they will have to set up new operations in the EU to continue serving clients. Goldman Sachs and UBS said last week they were starting to transfer some bankers to Frankfurt in preparation for Britain’s exit from the EU. The Bank of England has warned that about 10,000 finance jobs may leave Britain by the end of next year because of Brexit. However, top U.S. investment banks are currently planning to hire far more people in London than anywhere else in Europe.  In the EU, the hardest hit sector would be the automotive sector, agriculture and food and drinks, chemicals and plastics, consumer goods and industrials, the report said.
