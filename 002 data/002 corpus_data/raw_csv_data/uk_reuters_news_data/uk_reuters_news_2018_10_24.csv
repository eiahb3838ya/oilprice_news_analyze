Nikkei futures were down 2.7 percent and pointing to opening losses of around 600 points for the cash index. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan seemed certain to start at its lowest since March last year. The dive in formerly high-flying tech stocks sent investors scampering to the safety of sovereign bonds, with yields in 10-year Treasuries falling the most since May to 3.11 percent. “Concerns that earnings growth may be peaking against an unsettled global backdrop and that fiscal stimulus will wane continued to weigh on sentiment,” said analysts at ANZ in a note. Global worries included the growing international pressure on Saudi Arabia over the death of Jamal Khashoggi. Adding to the air of tension police intercepted suspected bombs mailed to former U.S. President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats, as well as to CNN, in what New York officials  branded an act of terrorism. Weak readings on manufacturing in Europe added to angst over world growth, as did a surprise slump in U.S. home sales which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing. On Wall Street, disappointing forecasts from chipmakers hammered the tech sector. They followed disappointing forecasts on Tuesday from industrial giants Caterpillar and 3M . The Nasdaq closed down 12.4 percent from its Aug. 29 record closing high, falling 4.4 percent for the day in its biggest one-day percentage decline since Aug. 18, 2011. The Dow <.DJI > fell 2.41 percent and the S&P 500 lost 3.09 percent. In currency markets, funds flowed to the U.S. dollar and Treasuries and out of the euro and the British pound. The euro shed 0.7 percent to $1.1397 and breached a major chart bulwark at $1.1430. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar climbed to a nine-week peak and was last trading at 96.370. Sterling hit a seven-week trough $1.2865, having dropped 0.8 percent overnight. The yen got the usual safe-haven bid, with the euro skidding to a two-month low at 127.68 yen. Even the dollar eased to 112.08 yen. Oil prices eased amid all the concerns over global growth.

2018-10-24,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - State-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro said on Wednesday it had started production on its eighth platform in the offshore Lula field, Brazil’s most productive, as it ramps up output from the Santos basin in the coveted pre-salt oil play. Platform 69 will be able to produce up to 150,000 barrels of oil per day and 6 million cubic meters of gas from the field, which already accounts for 30 percent of production in Brazil, now Latin America’s top producer. The platform features eight production wells and seven injection wells to extract oil and gas from the field, which was discovered in 2006 and where production began four years later. Petrobras operates the field and owns a 65 percent stake. Royal Dutch Shell and Galp have 25 and 10 percent stakes respectively. In the pre-salt offshore area, billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor. The Santos basin already accounts for over half of production in Brazil. A Shell executive told Reuters last month that Lula should hit peak production in 2020 or 2021, after reaching 1 million barrels of oil and gas per day next year.

Investors have been unnerved by a myriad of issues including some disappointing earnings reports, uncertainty over Brexit, Italy’s budget spat with the European Commission, and pressure on Saudi Arabia over the killing of a prominent journalist. “Everyday we have a different worry. Today European growth numbers were definitely disappointing,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina who sees volatility potentially continuing until the Nov. 6 U.S. midterm elections. The U.S. dollar climbed nearly one percent against the euro to its strongest level since August after PMI data showed business growth in the euro zone decelerated faster than expected due to waning orders. And the European Commission rejected Italy’s draft 2019 budget, saying it broke EU rules on public spending, and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks. While markets were still digesting the European data, U.S. data showed a fall in sales of new single-family homes to a near two-year low in September and numbers for the prior three months were revised lower. Also, the S&P 500 briefly dipped further after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Beige Book of economic conditions focused more than usual on tariffs and talked about modest to moderate growth. “Markets are still in flux and looking for a footing while the macro and micro data are mixed,” said John Augustine, Chief Investment Officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio citing the U.S. housing data and changes in the Beige Book. “There’s still political overtones to stocks whether it’s China, Italy or Saudi Arabia or U.S. midterm elections. It can affect sentiment,” he said. “The confidence of long term equity buyers is still not present. Markets are more focused on headlines and technicals.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 244.51 points, or 0.97 percent, to 24,946.92, the S&P 500 lost 44.61 points, or 1.63 percent, to 2,696.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 202.55 points, or 2.72 percent, to 7,234.99.

2018-10-24,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday that the government’s list of prospective investment projects, which it wants to develop with companies, would be worth around 46 trillion rubles ($700 billion), TASS news agency reported. Negotiations between the government and major Russian firms have been taking place since August, when Kremlin aide Andrei Belousov first proposed a windfall tax to raise additional revenue for the state budget, sending their share prices lower. The proposal was subsequently watered down, replaced by a call for more investment by the companies in projects related to infrastructure, the environment and new technologies. The government and Russian firms have since created a mutual working group to discuss the list of proposed investment projects, which were first valued, in total, at 11 trillion rubles, according to Interfax. The list is now 729 projects long, TASS quoted Siluanov as saying. “Together with the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, we are actively working to attract private capital for the realization of national projects,” TASS cited Siluanov as saying.  “By the end of the year, we plan to sign memorandums of cooperation between investors, ministries of various sectors, and the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs,” Siluanov said.

2018-10-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose modestly on Wednesday, rebounding after several days of weakness as a much bigger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. gasoline and diesel inventories augured a seasonal increase in refining demand.  However, traders remain concerned about worldwide demand, and that weakness in global equities would also reduce buying of  assets like oil by investment managers. On Tuesday, oil prices slumped 5 percent on concerns about a weaker economic outlook.  Looming U.S. sanctions on oil exporter Iran have helped support prices.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 rose 39 cents to settle at $66.82 a barrel, up 0.6 percent. The market bounced around during the day, posting gains into the early afternoon before pulling back. More than 710,000 WTI contracts changed hands on Wednesday, exceeding the 10-month daily average of about 576,000 contracts, according to Eikon. Brent crude LCOc1 settled at $76.17 a barrel, down 27 cents, or 0.4 percent. The global benchmark is more affected by the outlook for world supply, and Saudi Arabia’s saying it plans on boosting output may reduce buying interest in Brent.    The U.S. Energy Department said gasoline stocks fell 4.8 million barrels to 229.3 million barrels last week, the lowest since December 2017. Distillates, which include diesel, were down 2.3 million barrels, both more than forecast.  The EIA data also showed U.S. crude inventories rose 6.3 million barrels, much more than the 3.7 million-barrel increase expected in a Reuters poll. [EIA/S]  U.S. gasoline futures RBc1 rose 0.9 percent to $1.853 a gallon. “The headline number was a little bearish on crude but with the drop in gasoline supplies and an uptick in refinery runs, the market is holding in there pretty good,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Refining utilization rose modestly. Flynn said that signaled that maintenance season is coming to a close, and refiners will begin to process more diesel and heating oil as winter approaches. Prices had slumped as forecasters such as the International Energy Agency predicted slower oil-demand growth for 2019. [IEA/M] Weakness in equities has also weighed on crude. [.N] .DJI “Notwithstanding the last few days of selloffs in equities, I need to see a lot more evidence before we can start talking about a slowdown in demand,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington.  With U.S. sanctions on Iranian exports due to take effect on Nov. 4, two people with knowledge of the matter said two Chinese state-owned refiners were not planning to load Iranian oil for November. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would step up to “meet any demand that materializes to ensure customers are satisfied”. Some analysts say prices could rebound before the end of the year.  “We feel that surprises going forward with the run up to the November 4th deadline are more apt to be bullish than bearish despite Saudi assurances of stronger production,” wrote Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates, an oil advisory firm.

2018-10-24,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya held a rare oil conference in the eastern city of Benghazi on Wednesday as its state oil firm NOC reached out to a region home to a parallel government backing a rival oil firm. The “Benghazi Oil and Gas Exhibition and Forum” is the first international business conference in Libya’s second-largest city since 2014 when it turned into a battlefield. Forces of Khalifa Haftar declared victory in July 2017 over Islamists, ending four years of fighting that destroyed parts of the port city. Hotels and Benghazi airport have reopened but several bombings killed dozens of people this year, forcing organizers to postpone the conference until security had improved. “Benghazi city will play a prominent and important role for the oil and gas sector in the region and probably the world,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in his opening comments, marking a rare public speech in Benghazi. He said he was working to improve conditions for oil workers who have staged small protests at some facilities recently, adding that Benghazi would get a staff training institute. An executive of U.S. oil services firm Schlumberger (SLB.N), a partner of NOC, said “the event will be very important to us and we are looking forward to interesting discussions. No major deals are expected at the two-day forum in the Tibesti hotel, which aims to promote an industry exchange and, more importantly, to appease complaints in the east about few government activities there, industry sources said. “It’s a political message to appease the east,” said the CEO of a Libyan oil service firm. Some 68 companies took part in the event, according to organizers. NOC has had a rocky relationship with the Haftar and his leadership whose forces control much of east, including major oil ports. In June Haftar’s administration said it wanted to route oil exports from the key Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports through a separate NOC based in Benghazi after its troops seized them back from a militia in a costly battle. Eastern factions have long accused the central bank in Tripoli of misspending oil revenue and allocating insufficient funds to the east. “I demand from Sanalla a fair distribution of oil revenues,” said Salem al-Fitouri, a senior member of a Benghazi group campaigning to relocate NOC headquarters there from Tripoli. “What happened today was that Benghazi proved to Sanalla that the city is not like Tripoli, a city of militias. But Benghazi deserves more than holding a mere conference, exhibition or meeting,” he added. NOC has been carefully trying to stay out of Libya’s conflict stemming from the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.  International oil buyers have stuck with NOC Tripoli, building on decade-long relationships. But calls for secession or at least autonomy remain popular in the east, known as Cyrenaica or Barqa in Arabic, where much of Libya’s oil wealth lies but which was long neglected by Gaddafi as a punishment for opposition. Libya’s government said in 2013 it was planning to move NOC’s headquarters to Benghazi to reverse Gaddafi’s decision to move the oil leadership to Tripoli from the eastern city. But the move was never implemented as Libya split into rival administrations in 2014 and fighting broke out in Benghazi. The east has it own central bank which has also been largely ignored by the international community like NOC east.

2018-10-24,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s Capital Markets Authority said on Wednesday it had begun an investigation into irregular share trades in relation to a takeover offer for KenolKobil (KENO.NR) by French fuel storage and distribution company Rubis (RUBF.PA). Rubis made a takeover offer for KenolKobil earlier on Wednesday that it said valued the Kenyan oil marketer at about 35 billion shillings ($346.19 million) The regulator said its market surveillance had identified potentially irregular trading of KenolKobil shares in the run up to the Rubis bid announcement. “Consequently, in connection with these investigations the Authority has instructed the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation to place a freeze on the suspected accounts to allow for the conduct of the necessary inquiries,” the regulator said in a statement. The volume of trading in KenolKobil’s shares on the Nairobi stock exchange jumped to 373.46 million on Oct. 23 from 29.51 million a day earlier, according to Refinitiv data. Rubis, which is active across Europe, Africa and the Caribbean, has purchased nearly a quarter of the shares of KenolKobil on the open market and wants to buy the remaining shares, the companies said in bourse filings. Rubis has offered to buy them for 23 shillings each, 53.4 percent above their weighted average closing price over the previous 30 days. That values all of KenolKobil at about 35 billion shillings, according to the French company KenolKobil shares closed at 15.85 shillings on Wednesday, after surging 31 percent to a record high of 21.75 shillings. “It is a pretty decent offer,” said Eric Musau, a research analyst at Standard Investment Bank.  Rubis said it had struck agreements with two shareholders, including long-serving KenolKobil CEO David Ohana, to buy shares representing 9.69 percent of the company. Rubis plans to expand parts of the Kenyan business, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), once the deal is concluded. “We have become specialists in LPG and bitumen for instance, the demand for these kind of products is very strong in Kenya and other countries, to address that demand we have to invest in logistics,” Bruno Krief, Rubis chief financial officer.   KenolKobil also operates in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia. The deal will give Rubis, which has a market value of about $4.7 billion, an foothold in East Africa, where it currently does not have any operations. If Rubis gets 90 percent of KenolKobil, it plans to invoke rules allowing it to acquire the remaining shares, it said.    If it gets 75 percent but less than 90 percent, it may take steps to delist the shares from the Nairobi Securities Exchange, it added. KenolKobil’s profits increased in 2017 and the company has reduced its debt from $170 million in 2014 to almost zero. “They were clearly beautifying the asset for sale,” said Aly Khan Satchu, an independent trader and analyst in Nairobi. A previous takeover bid for the company by Switzerland-based Puma Energy, a subsidiary of Trafigura Beheer BV, fell through in 2013 after months of talks.

2018-10-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Leading shipping finance banks have joined industry players in support of faster action to cut carbon emissions by the sector. In April, the United Nations shipping agency reached an agreement to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 compared with 2008 levels, which fell short of more ambitious targets. The UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) is meeting in London this week to work on an initial strategy on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.    In the meantime, bankers in the shipping sector have come together for the first time aiming to boost momentum toward de-carbonization.  “We believe it is important for banks to support the IMO’s vision in making shipping a cleaner and more environmentally sustainable industry,” said Michael Parker, global head of shipping with Citi. “We encourage other lenders to the industry to join us in supporting this call to action,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.   The initiative has been led by the Global Maritime Forum (GMF), an international non-profit foundation trying to drive change in the shipping industry.     The GMF said it was working with financial institutions, shipowners and other bodies “on a set of principles for the inclusion of climate alignment and climate risk considerations in lending decisions”. The GMF said the shipping industry’s greenhouse gas cuts would require “absolute reductions” in carbon emissions to accommodate an expected growth in global trade.     “The requirement for the industry to work toward a de-carbonized future is accepted by the GMF,” said Peter Stokes, chairman of the GMF, who is also head of shipping with financial advisory firm Lazard.  The shipping sector, along with aviation, avoided specific emissions-cutting targets in a global climate pact agreed in Paris at the end of 2015, which aims to limit a global average rise in temperature to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius from 2020.     Other banks involved included Norway’s DNB, Germany’s KfW IPEX-Bank and France’s Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking - all of whom are active lenders to the industry.   The banks are part of 46 companies that have joined GMF, which also include trade houses Cargill, Trafigura and shipping groups such as A.P. Moller Maersk and Euronav. “The shipping sector clearly shares a collective responsibility to transform its operations, build new technologies and infrastructure, and make sustainable shipping a reality,” said Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation division. Shipping accounts for 2.2 percent of world CO2 emissions, according to the IMO. The IMO has adopted mandatory rules for new vessels to boost fuel efficiency as a means of cutting CO2 from ship engines. A final IMO plan on measures is not expected until 2023.    In separate climate action, the IMO, which responsible for regulating pollution from ships, has set new rules that will ban ships from using fuels with a sulfur content above 0.5 percent from Jan. 1 2020, compared with 3.5 percent now unless they have equipment to clean up sulfur emissions.

2018-10-24,"(Reuters) - Boeing (BA.N) shares jumped on Wednesday after the world’s largest planemaker reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and cash flow, helped by soaring demand from airlines and solid defense sales and services, and raised its 2018 sales and profit estimates.  Demand from commercial airlines has driven a surge in revenue, pushing shares up by roughly a third over the past 12 months. Boeing shares were up 3.3 percent to $361.51 after rising nearly 5 percent earlier, helping limit losses on Wall Street. A $691-million charge tied to Boeing’s MQ-25 refueling drone and T-X training jet defense programs just weeks after it won the latter contract in cooperation with Sweden’s Saab AB (SAABb.ST) took some of the shine off Boeing’s results, however. “Today’s results are all the proof you need that they have a an enormously successful commercial business that’s allowing for very aggressive pricing on the defense side,” said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group.  Boeing said the stronger cash flow was primarily driven by timing of receipts and expenditures as well as planned higher commercial airplane production rates.  On a call with analysts, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg played up the T-X and MQ-25 wins as long-term growth plays. He repeated his promise to boost production rates on the best-selling 737 narrowbody next year despite supplier delays that left dozens of semi-finished jets parked outside a Seattle-area factory. “We’re seeing positive signs in our supply chain recovery and remain confident on the overall 737 production profile and ramp up plans,” Muilenburg said.  Chicago-based Boeing raised its full-year profit forecast to $14.90-$15.10 from the previous $14.30-$14.50 per share, and revenue to a range of $98 billion to $100 billion, up $1 billion. It cited defense volume and services growth for the higher forecast. Core earnings, which exclude some pension and other costs, came in 11 cents above analysts’ average forecasts at $3.58 per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Boeing has delivered 568 aircraft in the first nine months of 2018, as it works to overcome factory snarls on its best-selling 737 narrowbody, up from 554 at the end of September a year ago, putting it on track to deliver another record year of plane sales. That keeps the manufacturer, which aims to deliver between 810-815 planes in 2018, in front of its European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA), which delivered 503 aircraft through September this year. Airbus shares gained 2.7 percent.  Boeing recorded $176 million in additional charges in the quarter on its delay-plagued KC-46 aerial refueling tanker, bringing the total cost of the program to more than $3 billion.  It also took a $691-million charge on the MQ-25 and T-X military programs, though the charge was offset in part by a $412 million tax benefit.  Asked on the conference call whether the charge was in some way an effort to anticipate a similar situation to the KC-46, Muilenburg said, “it’s dramatically different than that.” “These are planned, purposeful investments upfront with a commercial business case wrapped around it,” Muilenburg said.

Hariri, sitting beside the crown prince, commonly known as MbS, took part in the humour as the audience laughed. “With all my freedom,” he said. Hariri, who has Saudi citizenship, was summoned to Riyadh a year ago, briefly detained and compelled to resign as prime minister in a speech read out on television from Saudi until France intervened to free him. The joke took place as the Crown Prince comes under mounting global pressure to come up with answers over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct 2. During the panel discussion, he said “justice will prevail” and the culprits would be punished in his most high profile comments since U.S. resident Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, was killed. Hours earlier U.S. President Donald Trump, in his toughest comments yet, told the Wall Street Journal that the crown prince bore ultimate responsibility for the operation that led to Khashoggi’s killing. The kingdom has survived other crises, including the fallout of the short-lived kidnapping of Hariri. Hariri was verbally humiliated and beaten, according to eight Saudi, Arab and Western diplomatic sources.

The C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) Woodfibre LNG project, backed by Indonesian billionaire Sukanto Tanoto’s RGE Group, would be Canada’s second LNG project to go ahead, following the approval of the massive LNG Canada project earlier this month. “We’re hoping to move to a notice to proceed to construction in Q1 (of 2019),” Woodfibre LNG President David Keane told Reuters on Tuesday. “It will be sometime in February or March.” Woodfibre LNG is a relatively small project at 2.1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), but was long touted as the front runner to get Canadian natural gas to Asian markets, where demand for the fuel is booming. It was given the go-ahead in 2016, but then delayed as the company worked through a number of issues. Keane said the project is nearly there - the company is just working with engineering contractor KBR Inc on reducing costs and awaiting a November decision on import tariffs on fabricated steel components, used for LNG liquefaction units. “We’ve been very clear as an industry that there is no capability in Canada to build these large, complex modules,” Keane said. “We feel that the federal government will be fair.” Woodfibre also needs to finalize its benefit agreement with the local Squamish Nation, which Keane said has been initialed, but needs to be formally signed by council. He hopes that will be done by year end. Once a construction decision is made, the project will be completed in roughly four years, ensuring first shipments of the supercooled fuel by 2023. LNG Canada, which will produce some 14 mtpa further north in the town of Kitimat, British Columbia, has said it expects to be shipping fuel before 2025. Woodfibre has sold 100 percent of its first phase output and financing for the build is in place, said Keane. The project has also secured its gas supply and is working with utility FortisBC on a 47 kilometre (29 mile) pipeline connection.

Investors have been unnerved by a range of issues in recent days, including some disappointing earnings reports, worries about global growth, a spat between Italy and the European Union over Italy’s budget, uncertainty over Brexit and criticism of oil power Saudi Arabia over the killing of a journalist. “There’s too much uncertainty out there,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut, adding worried about U.S. interest rate hikes to the list. “The market loves to climb a wall of worry but this keeps getting bigger.” The U.S. dollar climbed nearly one percent against the euro to its strongest level since August on signs economic growth could be flagging across the euro zone. The European Commission rejected Italy’s draft 2019 budget saying it broke EU rules on public spending, and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks or face disciplinary action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258.81 points, or 1.03 percent, to 24,932.62, the S&P 500 lost 33.48 points, or 1.22 percent, to 2,707.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 124.36 points, or 1.67 percent, to 7,313.18. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.21 percent, failing to maintain gains from earlier in the session. MSCI’s gauge of stock markets across the globe shed 0.96 percent. On Tuesday, the index closed more than 11 percent below its January record close. Treasury prices rose as investors were wary of volatile equities, though Treasury yields on Wednesday were above the three-week lows touched during Tuesday’s session. Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York said “the market’s trying to find a short-term range as everyone evaluates different global events going forward.” Economic growth worries were highlighted by the International Monetary Fund, which recently cut forecasts, citing trade wars and capital flight from emerging markets. The latest European PMI surveys underscored that view, showing German private-sector growth at the slowest in three years. Oil rose towards $77 a barrel after hitting a two-month low as a strong drawdown in U.S. gasoline and diesel inventories augured for a coming seasonal rebound in refining demand. U.S. crude rose 0.9 percent to $67.03 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.65, up 0.27 percent on the day. Saudi Arabia is in the midst of a diplomatic storm over the death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi during a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In currencies, the euro fell 0.6 percent against the dollar to its lowest since August, on PMI data showing business growth in the euro zone decelerated faster than expected due to waning orders. The dollar index rose 0.44 percent, with the euro down 0.68 percent to $1.1391. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 112.43 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2903, down 0.61 percent on the day. British Prime Minister Theresa May was to meet with Conservative Party lawmakers, some of whom have discussed toppling her amid ongoing Brexit negotiations. U.S. gold futures fell 0.32 percent to $1,232.80 an ounce as the dollar firmed and speculators locked in profit from a more than three-month peak hit in the previous session.

Speaking at an investment conference in Riyadh, the crown prince also said he expected economic growth next year to be higher. Higher oil prices has helped Saudi Arabia’s economy grow in the second quarter at its fastest pace for over a year, according to official data. Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, expanded 1.6 percent from a year earlier in the April-June quarter. That was up from 1.2 percent in the first quarter and the fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2016.

2018-10-24,"ANKARA/ATHENS (Reuters) - Turkey warned Greece on Wednesday to stay out of its activities in the eastern Mediterranean, heralding a potential showdown with Cyprus over hydrocarbons research in a region thought to be rich in natural gas. Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Ankara would not tolerate further Greek harassment of Turkish vessels after complaining last week that a Greek frigate had hassled a Turkish exploration ship west of Cyprus.  Greece, which has a defence protection pact with close ally Cyprus, denied the charge. Attempts to tap hydrocarbons in the eastern Mediterranean, along with a dispute over Greece’s maritime borders, have revived tensions between Athens and Ankara - NATO allies who are separated by the Aegean Sea. Turkey and the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government in Cyprus have overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the eastern Mediterranean.  Both sides plan exploratory drills this year. Turkish officials earlier this month said a drill would take place in October. “Our warships are providing the necessary protection in the region. We will never tolerate new harassment,” Akar told Turkey’s state Anadolu news agency. “We have (taken) all kinds of measures. I want everyone to know that we will not tolerate a fait accompli of any sort on this subject.” Cyprus, which has no diplomatic relations with Turkey, accused Ankara of stirring up tensions.  “We are not going to go along with this artificial climate of tension which is trying to give an impression that there is a dispute,” Cypriot government spokesman Prodromos Prodromou said. “There is no dispute in the seas of Cyprus.”  Breakaway north Cyprus, which is supported by Turkey, says any offshore wealth also belongs to them, as partners in the establishment of the Cyprus republic in 1960. Greek Cypriots, who run the island’s internationally recognised government, say any future benefits of gas finds will eventually be shared by all Cypriots. The island was split in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Countless peacemaking endeavours have failed, and offshore wealth has increasingly been the elephant in the room of peace negotiations even though Greek Cypriots say that matter is not up for discussion.

2018-10-24,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers moved on Wednesday to ban widely-used, throw-away plastics such as straws and cotton buds, and put a greater burden on manufacturers to recycle in an effort to clear up ocean pollution.  Under the proposal, overwhelmingly backed by the European Parliament, 10 single-use plastic products with readily available alternatives would be banned by 2021. EU states would be obliged to recycle 90 percent of plastic bottles by 2025 and producers to help cover costs of waste management. “We are sending a strong signal to industry,” EU lawmaker Frederique Ries, a Belgian liberal, told Reuters. “There is broad and growing popular support on this issue,” said Ries, who is representing the parliament in negotiations with EU governments.  The EU recycles only a quarter of the 25 million tonnes of plastics waste it produces per year. China’s decision to stop processing waste coupled with growing alarm over damage to oceans has pushed the continent to end reliance on developing countries to deal with its waste. Regulators hope the new rules will lead to a drop in the price of recycled plastics. The EU’s final rules still need to be approved in talks with member states - some of which have balked at the curbs, worried they will be too difficult to implement for industry. But the deputy head of the EU executive, who is overseeing efforts to cut down on plastic waste, called for action.  “Europe has to come to terms with the fact that we cannot just put it on someone else’s shoulders,” EU Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans told Reuters, saying he was  encouraged by a shift in the private sector toward more voluntary recycling and public activism on the issue. “It is the first strategy in the world that looks at the whole issue of the role of plastics in our economy,” he added. “If we don’t move now, if we don’t move swiftly ... you will have more plastic in the oceans than fish.” EU lawmakers added polystyrene fast-food containers and products made of oxo-degradable plastics, which critics say do not fully break down, to the list proposed by the EU executive earlier this year. Waste from cigarette butts, which can take over a decade to degrade in water, would also have to be cut by 50 percent in 2025 and by 80 percent in 2030. EU countries would also have to collect fishing gear polluting beaches. Ries said the restrictions on tobacco products and obligations on member state governments to recycle more could be sticking points.

2018-10-24,"BENGHAZI, Libya, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Libya held a rare oil conference in the eastern city of Benghazi on Wednesday as its state oil firm NOC reached out to a region home to a parallel government backing a rival oil firm. The “Benghazi Oil and Gas Exhibition and Forum” is the first international business conference in Libya’s second-largest city since 2014 when it turned into a battlefield. Forces of Khalifa Haftar declared victory in July 2017 over Islamists, ending four years of fighting that destroyed parts of the port city. Hotels and Benghazi airport have reopened but several bombings killed dozens of people this year, forcing organisers to postpone the conference until security had improved. “Benghazi city will play a prominent and important role for the oil and gas sector in the region and probably the world,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in his opening comments, marking a rare public speech in Benghazi. An executive of U.S. oil services firm Schlumberger, a partner of NOC, said “the event will be very important to us and we are looking forward to interesting discussions. No deals are expected at the two-day forum in the Tibesti hotel, which aims to promote an industry exchange and, more importantly, to appease complaints in the east about few government activities there, industry sources said. “It’s a political message to appease the east,” said the CEO of a Libyan oil service firm. NOC has had a rocky relationship with the Haftar and his leadership whose forces control much of east, including major oil ports. In June Haftar’s administration said it wanted to route oil exports from the key Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports through a separate NOC based in Benghazi after its troops seized them back from a militia in a costly battle. Eastern factions have long accused the central bank in Tripoli of misspending oil revenue and allocating insufficient funds to the east. NOC has been carefully trying to stay out of Libya’s conflict stemming from the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. International oil buyers have stuck with NOC Tripoli, building on decade-long relationships. But calls for secession or at least autonomy remain popular in the east, known as Cyrenaica or Barqa in Arabic, where much of Libya’s oil wealth lies but which was long neglected by Gaddafi as a punishment for opposition. Libya’s government said in 2013 it was planning to move NOC’s headquarters to Benghazi to reverse Gaddafi’s decision to move the oil leadership to Tripoli from the eastern city. But the move was never implemented as Libya split into rival administrations in 2014 and fighting broke out in Benghazi. The east has it own central bank which has also been largely ignored by the international community like NOC east.

2018-10-24,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A German court on Wednesday ordered Porsche Automobil Holding SE (PSHG_p.DE) to pay shareholders 47.2 million euros ($53.8 million) in compensation for violating disclosure rules over an emissions scandal at its main investment Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). Shareholders who held Porsche SE stock between May 23, 2014, and Sept. 22, 2015, were entitled to be compensated for the share price declines caused by Volkswagen’s (VW) cheating of U.S. diesel emissions tests, the Stuttgart court said.  Porsche SE, which holds a 30.8 percent stake in VW and 52 percent of voting rights at the carmaker, said it would appeal the ruling and that it was confident a higher court would overturn the lower court’s findings. “Porsche SE is convinced that the lawsuits are without merit,” it said.  Porsche SE shareholders sued the company for failing to inform its investors in a timely manner about VW’s diesel emissions cheating, which has cost the automaker more than 27 billion euros in fines and vehicle refits.  At the time U.S. regulators caught VW using illegal software to rig diesel engine tests, the carmaker was headed by Martin Winterkorn, who was also CEO of Porsche SE. Law firm Nieding & Barth said the pension fund for the city of Wolverhampton in central England was awarded 3.2 million euros in damages by the Stuttgart court.

The men, who did not enter a plea, were found not guilty at Southwark Crown Court on a separate charge relating to a management buyout of another of Afren’s business partners.

2018-10-24,"ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - A Sunni Arab parliamentary bloc has pulled out of talks on forming Iraq’s next government, its leader said on Wednesday, underscoring the difficulties faced by Prime Minister-designate Adel Abdul Mahdi as he seeks consensus over his cabinet. The decision by the Qarar (Decision) Alliance could prolong uncertainty in Iraq, which is still in the process of forming a government five months since a parliamentary election. Party leader Osama al-Nujaifi, a former parliament speaker, told local media his bloc — which won 14 seats in May’s election — had abandoned the talks because ministries had been awarded to only “one bloc” representing the sect. He was apparently referring to the other main Sunni parliamentary bloc, led by current speaker, Mohammed al-Halbousi. Ever since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, power in Iraq has been shared by the three largest ethnic-sectarian groups: Shi’ite Arabs, Sunni Arabs, and Kurds. Abdul Mahdi, a Shi’ite, was tasked on Oct. 2 by President Barham Salih, a Kurd, with forming the new government. According to Iraq’s constitution, he has 30 days to assemble a cabinet before Salih has to name someone else. An independent who did not run in the May election himself, Abdul Mahdi was chosen as a compromise candidate by the two largest parliamentary blocs. He is scheduled to present a list of ministers to parliament for approval later on Wednesday, but lawmakers told Reuters he was struggling to please all sides and that the process might face further delays.

2018-10-24,"* H1 EBIT at 479.5 mln euros vs 549.4 mln euro forecast * Full year EBIT seen just under 1 bln euros * Texas plant out of operations after fire (Adds detail, background) By Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Austrian specialty steelmaker Voestalpine cut its full-year operating profit forecast on Wednesday, citing weaker demand from carmakers following profit warnings from some big names in the auto industry. Shares in the group hit a two-year low following the statement, which said an unplanned plant shutdown in the U.S. had also hurt second-quarter earnings. For the full year, the group said it now expects earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of “just under 1 billion euros”. In August it had said that the EBIT would be roughly at the previous year’s level of 1.18 billion euros. Average analyst estimates are at 1.14 billion euros, Refinitiv Eikon data shows. “There is not just one reason (for the profit warning) but several factors that added up,” a company spokesman said. “Above all of this, an economic downturn becomes noticeable.” Voestalpine shares fell as much as 8.5 percent to 30.88 euros. “The possible profit decline in automotive related products might more than be included in ... (its) share price decline,” Baader analyst Christian Obst said in a note to clients. Voestalpine, which makes around one third of group sales from the auto industry, said the car market in Europe had been distorted by a new exhaust emission test procedure introduced on Sept. 1 and related uncertainties. Chief Executive Wolfgang Eder warned last week, that after three boom years, the auto industry must adjust to the fact that demand will no longer grow quite as strongly. German premium carmaker Daimler issued its second earnings warning since June last week, partly blaming new emissions standards. French tyre maker Michelin also cut its full year forecast, blaming weaker Chinese vehicle demand in addition to the new emissions rules. Another reason for the Voestalpine profit warning was a fire at its Texas plant last week, the spokesman said, adding that the site will remain offline until Thursday or Friday. The costs resulting from the fire and the shutdown could not yet be estimated. The plant, which opened two years ago, produces two million tonnes of premium hot briquetted iron, or sponge iron - a material used in steel production - annually and is Voestalpine’s biggest foreign investment so far. Voestalpine, which transports much of the steel it produces in Austria via the Danube, said low water levels made freight transport difficult and also led to higher costs. The Austrian group will give more details on Nov. 7 when it publishes its final half-year results. The company said preliminary first-half EBIT totalled 479.5 million euros ($548 million). That was well below average analyst expectations of 549.4 million euros, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. $1 = 0.8754 euros

2018-10-24,"(Adds detail, share price) MOSCOW, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Russia’s biggest non-state gas producer Novatek beat forecasts with a 22 percent rise in third-quarter net profit as it benefited from rising oil and gas prices and the start of LNG production. Novatek, France’s Total and Chinese partners jointly launched production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic circle last December. The company said on Wednesday that LNG output helped increase its third quarter net profit to 45.9 billion roubles ($700 million), topping a Reuters poll forecast of 43.7 billion roubles. In the first nine months of 2018, Novatek shipped 5 million tonnes of LNG and 473,000 tonnes of stable gas condensate from the port of Sabetta in Yamal, for delivery under both short-term and long-term contracts. Russia wants to become a global leader in LNG production, more than doubling its worldwide market share to 20 percent in the next decade and targeting annual exports of 80 million-115 million tonnes. U.S. and European sanctions imposed on Russia over Moscow’s actions in Ukraine have made exports of technology to Russia and the funding of some projects challenging. However, Novatek - which is controlled by its CEO Leonid Mikhelson and businessman Gennady Timchenko, a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin - said it was able to raise necessary funding for the Yamal project. “The group together with its foreign partners currently raises necessary financing for our joint ventures from non-U.S. debt markets and lenders,” the company said in its results statement. Yamal LNG shareholders opened additional credit line facilities denominated in euros in the third quarter of 2018 to finance construction of the fourth train of the plant, it said. Novatek’s total group sales jumped 68 percent in July-September from a year earlier to 219.37 billion roubles, while normalised earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of subsidiaries increased by 57 percent to 70.7 billion roubles, exceeding the average forecast of 69.6 billion roubles.

2018-10-24,"BUCHAREST, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Romania’s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved on Wednesday a much-awaited offshore hydrocarbons legal framework, needed before energy groups OMV Petrom and Exxon decide whether to pursue further investment in the Black Sea. Austria’s OMV has said it was confident Bucharest would establish an acceptable framework for its Black Sea exploration project, regarding taxes and royalties, before it can give a final nod to “a billion euro investment”. Under the bill, which must be signed into law by President Klaus Iohannis, holders of current offshore petroleum agreements with Romania, will be levied the current level of royalties, taxes and gross production thresholds. It also stipulates that companies involved in production operations in Romania’s offshore perimeters, would need to sell at least 50 percent of yearly gas output in a “transparent, public and non-discriminatory way on the centralised market.” The exploration of the Black Sea Neptun block is a joint venture between OMV’s Romanian subsidiary Petrom and U.S. major ExxonMobil and includes the first deep-water exploration well in Romanian waters. In 2012, the firms said they had discovered 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet (42-84 billion cubic metres) (bcm) of gas reserves at the ExxonMobil operated Domino-1 well, around 170 km offshore. Unlike other countries in the region, European Union member Romania is almost entirely energy independent, importing less than 10 percent of its gas needs from Russia, with the rest produced locally, largely by state producer Romgaz and Petrom.

Hefty U.S. losses the day before have left MSCI’s all-country benchmark near one-year lows, possibly putting it on course for its worst month in six years. The index is now down 12 percent from record highs hit in January and flat on the day . European shares however, bounced off near two-year lows , as exporters benefited from weaker currencies, while Asian markets earlier closed flat after Chinese media reported authorities were considering allowing insurance firms to invest in equities. “We’ve got to accept that in this correction we have had ‘on’ and ‘off’ days’ — a few days back, markets were buoyant on back of an announcement from China on fiscal, monetary and regulatory stimulus, then another day, there are earnings reports that are perceived by investors to be bad,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “But underlying it all are half a dozen issues that are worrying investors and none of them are going away soon.” Factors that have conspired to knock markets this week include disappointing company earnings, a spat between Italy and the European Union over Italy’s budget, criticism of oil power Saudi Arabia over the killing of a dissident journalist and finally, worries that world growth is losing steam. Growth worries were highlighted by the International Monetary Fund, which recently cut forecasts, citing trade wars and capital flight from emerging markets. The latest European PMI surveys underscored that view, showing German private-sector growth at the slowest in three years. There are also signs U.S. economic and earnings growth, fuelled partly by tax cuts, may be waning. Wall Street suffered heavy losses on Tuesday after some companies, among them industrial giant Caterpillar, maintained or cut profit forecasts. European equity sentiment was hit by weak PMIs, but bank and tech shares took the worst beating after sickly German giant Deutsche Bank and chipmaker STMicroelectronics posted disappointing earnings. “Many of the reports coming in are not that different to expectations, but the mood (at present) is to shoot from the hip first and ask questions later,” Milligan said. U.S. shares eventually saw some buying late on Tuesday and closed only half a percent lower. But futures for all three New York indexes signal more losses, standing around 0.5 percent lower That could take the S&P500 benchmark beyond Tuesday’s five-month lows. Microsoft, AT&T, Visa, UPS, Ford and Whirlpool are among U.S. companies posting earnings on Wednesday. “More bouts of mini-panic” will occur until U.S. midterm elections on Nov. 6, said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. But “as last night’s resilience by Wall Street shows, sentiment has not broken down completely.” Growth jitters weighed on oil prices, too, with Brent around $76, almost $10 a barrel off recent highs following a 4 percent slide on Tuesday. But prices were also knocked by the prospect of more supply from Saudi Arabia, which pledged to pump more crude quickly if needed. Saudi Arabia is also in the midst of a diplomatic storm surrounding the death of Jamal Khashoggi. Turkey dismissed the kingdom’s efforts to blame the killing on rogue operatives while U.S. President Donald Trump said Riyadh staged the “worst cover-up ever.” In currencies, the euro fell 0.6 percent to the dollar , undermined by PMI surveys that showed business growth in the single-currency area decelerated faster than expected, dragged down by waning orders. The lacklustre growth picture narrowed the gap between German two-year and 10-year yields, flattening the yield curve — a classic sign of growth worries. “The flash PMI for October gives a first glimpse on where the euro zone economy is heading. And the picture is not terrific,” ING economist Peter Vanden Houte said. The dollar rebounded 0.5 percent versus a basket of currencies while sterling slipped to six-week lows versus the dollar.

2018-10-24,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Sinopec Group and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the country’s top state-owned refiners, have not made any nominations to load Iranian oil for November because of concerns they would be violating U.S. sanctions, two persons with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Washington is set to re-impose sanctions on oil exports from Iran on Nov. 4 to force Tehran to halt its ballistic missile program. Iran is the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and China is the biggest buyer of its oil.  Sinopec and CNPC are skipping bookings for November because it is unclear if Chinese buyers could win waivers from the sanctions, said the persons, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the matter.     “With no clarity over waiver, no company will risk taking any barrels for November,” said one person, a senior industry official with a state oil company. “The risk is a lot greater than the amount of oil cut.” Companies also skipped nominating barrels they are entitled to from their investment in Iranian oil fields, the person added.  Sinopec declined to comment. CNPC also declined to comment.  The National Iranian Oil Co did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  The decisions by the state oil majors came after two visits each around June and September by officials from the U.S. State Department including Francis Fannon, Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Energy Resources, said the same senior person.  During the meetings with Chinese oil companies, U.S. officials repeated Washington’s stance asking Chinese buyers to cut Iranian oil imports to zero from November or face sanctions, the person added.  With fewer buyers, Iran, using tankers operated by National Iranian Tanker Company, is sending an unprecedented volume of oil into storages in China this month and in early November, according to an Iranian shipping source and data from Refinitiv Eikon. Beijing has repeatedly stated its opposition to unilateral U.S. sanctions but the government has not given any clear guidance to encourage companies to keep booking Iranian oil as the sanctions deadline approaches, said the two sources.  Iran is using mostly bonded storages in Dalian in the northeast and Zhoushan on the east coast, the sources said, which give NIOC the options to store the oil there or sell to regional customers later.

Saudi Arabia is also in the midst of a diplomatic storm surrounding the death of Jamal Khashoggi. Turkey dismissed the kingdom’s efforts to blame the killing on rogue operatives while U.S. President Donald Trump said Riyadh staged the “worst cover-up ever.” On currencies, the euro fell 0.5 percent to the dollar , undermined by the PMI surveys that showed  business growth in the single-currency area decelerated faster than expected, dragged down by waning orders. The lacklustre growth picture narrowed the gap between German two-year and 10-year yields, flattening the yield curve — a classic sign of growth worries. “The flash PMI for October gives a first glimpse on where the euro zone economy is heading. And the picture is not terrific,” ING economist Peter Vanden Houte said. The dollar rebounded 0.3 percent versus a basket of currencies while sterling slipped 0.4 percent to six-week lows versus the dollar.

2018-10-24,"BEIJING, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Sinopec Group and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the country’s top state-owned refiners, have not made any nominations to load Iranian oil for November because of concerns they would be violating U.S. sanctions, said two persons with direct knowledge of the matter. Washington is set to re-impose sanctions on oil exports from Iran on Nov. 4 to force a renegotiation of pact on its nuclear programme. Iran is the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and China is the biggest buyer of its oil. Sinopec and CNPC are skipping bookings for November because it is unclear if Chinese buyers could win waivers from the sanctions, said the persons, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the matter. “With no clarity over waiver, no company will risk taking any barrels for November,” said one person, a senior industry official with a state oil company, “The risk is a lot greater than the amount of oil cut.” Sinopec declined to comment.

On a conference call for third-quarter results, Stefano Cao said state energy company Saudi Aramco remained his group’s biggest client and the country continued to be a major pillar in its strategy. “The sheer size of investments by Saudi Aramco are the long-term basis for our engagement and commitment,” Cao said. Saudi Arabia plans to sign deals worth more than $50 billion in the oil, gas, infrastructure and industries sectors, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. But U.S. and European reaction to Saudi Arabia’s account of the death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi is stifling some of the enthusiasm for business opportunities in the kingdom. Saipem, which has a framework agreement with Saudi Aramco to 2021, has a fabrication yard in Saudi Arabia that it says gives it advantages for local work. In July it was awarded a procurement and construction contract in the country for the development of the Haradh gas plant in the east of the country. “Saudi Arabia is very, very important and there are many more projects we’ll be participating in,” Cao said.

European shares opened higher, taking a cue from Asia where MSCI’s Asian ex-Japan index closed flat following a bounce in China where local media reported authorities were mulling allowing insurance firms to invest in equities. A pan-European equity index rose 0.6 percent, after approaching two-year lows on Tuesday, shrugging off poor bank earnings, while MSCI’s all-country index hovered just off flat after touching one-year lows. Chinese shares closed 0.3 percent higher. “We’ve got to accept that in this correction we have had ‘on’ and ‘off’ days’ — a few days back markets were buoyant on back of an announcement from China on fiscal, monetary and regulatory stimulus, then another day, there are earnings reports that are perceived by investors to be bad,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “But underlying it all are half a dozen issues that are worrying investors and none of them are going away soon.” Several factors have conspired to knock markets this week — some earnings disappointment, a brewing conflict between Italy and the European Union over budget spending, criticism of oil power Saudi Arabia over the killing of a dissident journalist and finally, worries that world growth is losing steam. Growth worries were highlighted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which recently cut economic forecasts, citing trade wars and capital flight from emerging markets. Latest European PMI surveys underscored that view, showing German private-sector growth at the slowest in three years . There are also signs a burst of U.S. economic and earnings growth, fueled partly by tax cuts, may be waning — Wall Street suffered heavy losses on Tuesday after some companies, including industrial giant Caterpillar which is seen as an economic growth bellwether, maintained or cut profit forecasts. The shares pared losses towards close of trade and closed only half a percent lower but futures for all three New York indexes were 0.5-0.7 percent lower. Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo, predicted “more bouts of mini-panic” until Nov. 6 U.S. midterm elections. But he added that “as last night’s resilience by Wall Street shows, sentiment has not broken down completely.” Growth jitters also weighed on oil prices, with Brent around $76, almost $10 a barrel off recent highs following a 4 percent slide on Tuesday. But prices were also knocked by the prospect of more supply from Saudi Arabia which pledged to pump more crude quickly if needed. Saudi Arabia is also in the midst of a diplomatic storm surrounding the death of Jamal Khashoggi after Turkey dismissed the kingdom’s efforts to blame it on rogue operatives while U.S. President Donald Trump said Riyadh staged the “worst cover-up ever.” However, Saudi equity markets have rebounded from recent lows and traded 0.2 percent higher thanks to strong company earnings. On currency markets, the euro was undermined by purchasing manager surveys that showed slowing growth in manufacturing and new orders in Germany and France. The single currency fell half a percent against the dollar while the greenback rebounded 0.3 percent versus a basket of currencies Sterling slipped 0.3 percent to a new 2-1/2 week low versus the dollar, trapped in a narrow range as uncertainty reigned over Britain’s EU exit. The lacklustre growth picture narrowed the gap between German 2-year and 10-year yields, in what is known a ‘flattening’ of the yield curve and a classic sign of growth worries.

2018-10-24,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Iberdrola (IBE.MC) stuck to its 2018 guidance on Wednesday after a 22.5 percent jump in core profit in the first nine months, boosted by its Brazilian business, recovering hydropower output in Spain and new renewable assets.  The supplier of energy to more than 30 million people in countries including Spain, the United States and Britain said it still expects core earnings to pass 9 billion euros ($10.3 billion) this year.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were 6.72 billion euros in the nine months to Sept. 30. Under the reiterated guidance, net profit is expected to reach 3 billion euros with dividends increasing in line with rising income. The company said on Tuesday that it would raise its interim dividend by 7 percent to 0.15 euros per share. Net profit fell 13.5 percent to 2.091 billion because of an unfavourable comparison with last year, when it received a dividend from the merger of wind power business Gamesa - of which it owned almost 20 percent - with the wind division of Germany’s Siemens (SGREN.MC).   As part of a drive to focus on renewable assets and cut debt, Iberdrola sold its Scottish gas, hydro and pumped storage power plants to Britain’s Drax (DRX.L) last week. In the Spanish company’s domestic market, concern has been growing over plans being hatched by the young Socialist government to limit profits on hydro and nuclear power generation, a prospect analysts say could weigh on Iberdrola shares for some months to come.

The U.S. currency was given a lift as the 10-year Treasury note yield rebounded to 3.162 percent after stooping to a three-week low of 3.111 on Tuesday. The Canadian dollar took in stride the sharp decline in oil and stood firm against its U.S. counterpart as investors maintained bets that the Bank of Canada (BoC) will hike interest rates later on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar stood little changed at C$1.3081 per dollar after gaining 0.1 percent the previous day. “We do not believe that the declines in the markets so far are enough to dissuade either the Fed or the BoC from continuing to hike interest rates, as soon as today in the case of the BoC,” wrote Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics. “However, markets will start to rethink the need for tighter policy if global equity markets go off the rails.” China’s yuan added to the previous day’s modest gains and rose to 6.9367 per dollar in onshore trade, continuing its modest pull-back from a near two-year low of 6.9445 marked on Monday. The pound was little changed at $1.2987 and near a three-week trough of $1.2937 brushed overnight.

2018-10-24,"(Corrects day to Wednesday in first paragraph) * Darkening economic outlook also weighs on markets * U.S. crude stocks rise by 9.9 million barrels - API By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices on Wednesday extended falls from the previous day, when crude slumped as much as 5 percent, after Saudi Arabia said it would make up for supply disruptions from U.S. sanctions targeting Iran’s petroleum exports from next month. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $76.37 a barrel at 0031 GMT, 7 cents below their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $66.31 a barrel, 12 cents below their last settlement. The dips came after Brent closed down 4.3 percent and WTI 4 percent in the previous session. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at an investment conference in Riyadh on Tuesday that despite expected supply disruptions from U.S. sanctions against Iran that kick in from Nov. 4, Saudi Arabia would step up to “meet any demand that materialises to ensure customers are satisfied.” “Oil prices fell substantially... as Saudi Arabia released assurances it could supply more to the global market,” Australia’s Rivkin Securities said. Beyond the pledge by Saudi Arabia, oil prices are also being weighed down by economic concerns. South Korea’s KOSPI-100 equity index has now fallen by nearly 19 percent over the past year, the fastest rate of decline since the financial crisis of 2008/09. The KOSPI-100 has correlated closely with the growth in international trade, given the South Korean economy’s strong export orientation, so the decline suggests a slowdown in global trade. In the United States, commercial crude inventories rose by 9.9 million barrels in the week to Oct. 19 to 418.4 million, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley said “recent trends in refining margins, time spreads and inventories suggest a spell of weakness in oil markets.” Despite this, the U.S. bank said “we still see Brent reaching $85 per barrel by year-end” as Iran sanctions are expected to tighten markets towards the end of the year.

2018-10-24,"NORZAGARAY, Philippines, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  In battling the timber poachers who roam the thick Sierra Madre forests near his home, Larry Garaes has found a new ally: solar panels. With solar chargers, the radios he and other forest rangers rely on no longer run out of power on multi-day operations in the mountains, he said. “Communication between rangers is a lot better. Now, we can catch the poachers while they are in the act because we can coordinate our moves quietly without resorting to shouting at the next ranger - unlike before,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Access to clean energy is bringing a range of unexpected benefits around the world. On the longest mountain range in the Philippines, those benefits include better forest protection – and power for tribal people who once lacked it. More than 2 million households – or about 10 percent of all households – in the Philippines lack electricity, according to a 2017 report by the country’s Department of Energy. About three quarters are in remote rural locations, in a country spread over thousands of islands, according to the Small Power Utilities Group (SPUG), which is trying to get them connected. Because bringing the national grid power to many of those people is not cost effective, the state National Power Corporation has charged SPUG with setting up and running small power plants in these areas. So far 327 such plants have been established, according to the National Power Corporation. Government plans call for 100 percent electrification of the country by 2022. “Government has to do its work to connect all those areas that are not yet connected to the grid,” said Edmundo Veloso Jr., the head of the National Power Corporation’s SPUG unit. But all but one of the new generation plants use diesel fuel, he said - even though transport of fuel can be a big problem in remote areas. Diesel is “the fastest and the only technology available at the moment for off-grid areas. Diesel is still the cheapest in terms of capital outlay,” he said. In Garaes’ community, however, in Bulacan province in the northern Philippines, two solar micro-grids are providing the community’s first power. They were put in place last December by the Forest Foundation Philippines, a non-governmental organisation that aims to improve forest protection, and the Centre for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology (CREST), a Quezon City-based organisation focused on expanding use of clean power. While the new grid was primarily set up to help members of the local Dumagat ethnic group police the forests, it also supplies power free of charge to common areas of the village of 36 families, including a study hall and communal kitchens. The forest rangers and other members of the community have been trained to troubleshoot and maintain the system, CREST officials said. “In the past we would need to walk almost two kilometres to the nearest village where there is electricity to charge our radios and cellphones for a fee,” Garaes said. “That was a burden to us.” Such solar micro-grids could fill gaps in providing electricity to many remote areas of the Philippines as they are cheap to operate – and don’t face the fuel transport issue of diesel-run plants, said Sara Ahmed, an energy analyst for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s not economically viable to transfer power from one (place) to another if the demand is not high. That’s why far-flung areas don’t get power,” Ahmed said. “This is where micro-grids come in. There is no need to build transmission lines and wires. You can have power right there and then. You save a lot of money.” In Garaes’ village, each micro-grid produces 1 kilowatt of electricity – enough to provide lights in the communal kitchen, along village pathways, in the classroom and for a television set. Building the grid cost about $3,000, according to CREST officials. Urbano Mendiola Jr., vice president for corporate affairs at the National Power Corporation, said his agency was considering installing hybrid power plants that combine diesel and solar power in some remote areas. A hybrid plant to power about 1,250 households costs about $985,000, he said, while a diesel-only plant costs about $425,000. But while hybrid plants are more expensive to set up at the moment, they bring cost savings in the long run because energy from the sun is free, he said. He said the company is not setting up solar-only plants in remote areas at the moment because of the cost of the batteries needed to store solar power and provide energy at night. Rural off-grid power plants in the Philippines are funded by the government and by a small surcharge on the electrical bills of grid power users, aimed at bringing the cost of power for rural users closer in line with that in urban areas. Ahmed said that tapping the full potential of renewable energy would require a sea-change in the views of officials tasked with providing energy. Currently they say diesel is the most affordable option. But “diesel is not affordable... When they say it’s cheaper, they only mean upfront,” she said. “If you look at wind and solar, the prices have dramatically gone down,” Ahmed said. “SPUG needs to update itself with the technology”.

2018-10-24,"(Repeats item issued late Tuesday, with no change to text) By Chen Aizhu and Shu Zhang BEIJING, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Bank of Kunlun Co, the key Chinese conduit for transactions with Iran, is set to halt handling payments from the Islamic Republic under pressure of imminent U.S. sanctions against the country, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Kunlun, the main official channel for money flows between China and Iran, has verbally informed clients that it will stop accepting yuan-denominated Iranian payments to China from Nov. 1, said the sources, who include external loan agents and business officials who trade with Iran. The bank, controlled by the financial arm of Chinese state energy group CNPC, had already quietly suspended euro-denominated payments from Iran in late August, the four sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Kunlun did not respond to an emailed request seeking comment. A CNPC spokesman declined comment. It was not immediately clear how long the suspension of services will last and how Chinese businesses still selling goods or services to Iran would be able to receive payment. It was also not clear whether the bank’s services settling China’s payments for Iranian oil purchases would be affected. China is the top buyer of Iranian oil and nearly all of its oil payments go through Kunlun. China had been buying some $1.5 billion worth of oil each month from Iran as recently as September. But state refiners have since October been scaling back oil purchases from Iran to comply with looming U.S. sanctions, oil industry sources have said. The previously unreported moves by Kunlun highlight the mounting pressure Beijing faces as Washington reimposes sanctions targeting Iran’s financial and oil sectors from early November. “A Kunlun account manager told us payments from Iran made after that date will be rejected and returned,” said one of the sources, an agent who serves as a go-between for the bank and corporate borrowers. “Whether and when to resume the services depends on the international situation after the sanctions start on Nov. 5,” said another one of the sources, a businesswoman, citing a WeChat message from her trade agent recounting what she had heard from Kunlun. The agent urged her in the message to hurry up payment collections, the person said. The new round of U.S. sanctions aims to force Tehran to stop its involvement in regional conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq and halt its ballistic missile programme, after President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear plans. China has said it is opposed to any unilateral sanctions and has defended its commercial ties with Tehran. Kunlun was established in 2006 as a city commercial bank in Karamay, an oil-producing hub in China’s far-western Xinjiang region. CNPC became its major shareholder in 2009 through a capital injection in a bid to expand its oil financing business. Kunlun is now 77.09 percent owned by CNPC Capital, the bank’s latest annual report shows. Early this decade, Kunlun was chosen by Beijing as its main bank to process billions of dollars in oil payments to Iran, shielding other banks from penalties under Western sanctions that ran between 2010 and 2015. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Kunlun in 2012 for conducting business with Iran and transferring money to an entity linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. The lender has nearly 30,000 corporate clients, largely state-owned enterprises and oil firms, its annual report said. One of its flagship products is called “Yi Lu Tong”, meaning “Iran Connect”, the bank said in its annual report. The 2012 U.S. sanctions barred Kunlun from directly accessing the U.S. financial system. Most of the bank’s transactions are conducted in yuan and euros. Two of the sources said Kunlun’s moves to suspend euro settlement in August and yuan starting next month were triggered by U.S. sanctions. They did not give further details. “We were told that from Nov. 1 Kunlun would no longer receive payments from Iran. That basically means Iran will have to stop importing from China,” said an executive with an eastern China-based manufacturer that exported electronic components to Iran until recently. China’s exports to Iran totalled $16.4 billion in 2016, the latest year for which data is available, while imports totalled $14.8 billion in 2016, down one-third from the record $24.3 billion in exports and $27.5 billion in imports posted in 2014, according to data from China’s National Statistical Bureau. Most of what China imports from Iran is oil. Kunlun had 317.5 billion yuan ($46 billion) in assets at the end of last year, and reported annual revenue at 5.4 billion yuan and net profits of 2.97 billion yuan.

2018-10-24,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OKoiAg By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The global economic outlook is deteriorating, with a broad range of asset prices and real-time economic indicators pointing to either a slowdown in growth or an outright recession occurring in 2019. South Korea’s KOSPI-100 equity index has now fallen by almost 19 percent over the last year, the fastest rate of decline since the financial crisis of 2008/09, in a warning sign for investors and commodity traders. The KOSPI-100 has correlated closely with the growth in international trade, given the South Korean economy’s strong export orientation, so the sharp decline suggests trade growth will slow sharply in the months ahead. Germany’s DAX index, another share market heavily exposed to international trade, has also fallen by more than 14 percent over the last year, its worst performance since early 2016, and before that 2011. Even in the United States, which is much more closed to international trade and has reported the strongest economy and stock market in 2017/18, there are signs the bull run is running out of momentum. The broad S&P 500 equity index is up just 7 percent compared with the end of October 2017, the smallest year-on-year increase for almost two years, and far below its peak of 24 percent at the start of 2018. The stimulus of corporate tax reductions which went into effect at the start of the year is beginning to fade and more U.S. businesses are struggling with a rising exchange rate, tariffs and slower revenue growth. Revenue growth at U.S. corporations is slowing, with a significant number of S&P500 firms reporting disappointing sales in the third quarter (“Bull market’s latest hurdle: slowing sales growth”, WSJ, Oct. 21). The U.S. Treasury yield curve remains close to inversion, with rates on 10-year paper just 26 basis points above 2-year notes, a signal that has often preceded a slowdown in growth or recession in the past. The U.S. dollar remains close to its highest value for a quarter of a century against a trade-weighted basket of the currencies of U.S. trading partners (tmsnrt.rs/2OKoiAg). The combination of a rising interest rates, a flattening yield curve, falling share prices and a strengthening dollar represents a significant tightening of financial conditions, not just in the United States but around the world. The OECD’s composite leading indicator has fallen to its lowest in almost two years and is at a level that is consistent with a slowdown in economic momentum. Rising oil prices, especially for consuming countries outside the United States, have added to the pressure on many emerging markets. U.S. freight movements also indicate the rate of growth is easing after accelerating consistently for two years between the middle of 2016 and mid-2018. U.S. rail freight movements are still rising but a slightly slower rate than in the first half of the year. Truck tonnage growth has seen an even sharper slowdown since peaking in June. Total freight movements by road, rail, barge, pipeline and air were about 4.5 percent higher in August than at the same point a year ago, down from a peak of more than 8 percent in June. On their own, any of these financial and real indicators could be dismissed as due to idiosyncratic factors, but in combination, when they all point in the same direction, they point to a loss of momentum in the global economy. The latest Reuters’ quarterly poll of more than 500 economists found the global outlook for 2019 had worsened for the first time (“Global growth outlook for 2019 dims for the first time”, Reuters, Oct. 22). At this point it is impossible to know whether the slowdown will take the form of a moderation in the rate of growth (a “growth recession”) or an actual decline in activity (an “outright recession”). Deep recessions such as the one which accompanied the financial crisis in 2008/09 are uncommon and unlikely to be repeated this time around. Most recessions since 1945 have involved either a mild slowdown in the rate of growth or a very small and short-lived decline in economic activity. But most indicators now point to significantly slower growth next year than in 2017/18.

2018-10-24,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.2 pct, Nikkei rises 0.25 pct * Asia stocks bounce after Wall St pares bulk of losses * Crude sags after Saudi Arabia says it can increase supply * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up on Wednesday as a late round of buying helped Wall Street indexes pare most of their earlier panic-driven losses, although crude oil struggled near two-month lows after Saudi Arabia flagged possible supply increases. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 percent following a decline of more than 2 percent the previous day. Global stocks suffered earlier this week on worries about U.S. earnings, Italian government finances, U.S. trade tensions and mounting pressure on Saudi Arabia over the death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. South Korea’s KOSPI added 0.5 percent and Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.25 percent. Wall Street’s three major indexes slumped early on Tuesday but ended well off the day’s lows as investors snapped up beaten-down shares late in the session. “Broader market sentiment remains fragile, but as last night’s resilience by Wall Street shows, sentiment has not broken down completely,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “We may see more bouts of ‘mini panic’ until the U.S. midterm elections, but the bottom line is that the U.S. economy is in good shape and that should prevent sentiment from breaking down.” The dollar flagged against the yen, which is often sought in times of risk aversion. The U.S. currency was at 112.43 yen after dropping 0.35 percent overnight. The greenback was also held down on a decline in Treasury yields, as the recent risk aversion drove investors to safe haven government bonds. The 10-year Treasury note yield was at 3.171 percent after stooping to a three-week low of 3.111 on Tuesday. The pound was little changed at $1.2986 and near a three-week trough of $1.2937 brushed overnight. Sterling briefly gained half a percent against the dollar on Tuesday after a media report that the European Union could offer British Prime Minister Theresa May a UK-wide customs union to clinch a Brexit deal. The pound’s strength was fleeting, however, a sign the market remains unconvinced May can successfully sell any deal to her Conservative party colleagues and get it through parliament. The euro was steady at $1.1472 after nudging up 0.05 percent the previous day. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 95.924 after posting a modest loss the previous day. In commodities, U.S. crude futures traded at $66.33 per barrel after dropping roughly 4 percent on Tuesday to a two-month low of $65.74. Crude slid after Saudi Arabia said it could supply more crude quickly if needed, easing concerns ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran. The recent sell-off in global equities has also raised worries about slowing growth curbing demand for crude.

2018-10-24,"SEOUL, Oct 24 (Reuters) - South Korea will cut domestic transport fuel taxes by 15 percent for six months from Nov. 6 to ease the burden of rising global oil prices on households and small businesses, the finance ministry said on Wednesday. The gasoline fuel tax will drop by 111 won per litre to 635 won ($0.5589) per litre. The diesel fuel tax will fall to 450 won a litre from the current 529 won per litre, the ministry said in a statement. The government will also lower fuel taxes on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and butane by 28 won to 157 won per litre. The temporary tax cut will amount to a 2 trillion won ($1.76 billion) reduction in tax revenue for the government over the next six months, the statement said. Retail prices for gasoline and diesel have been rising for 16 straight weeks, according to data from the state-run Korea National Oil Corp, reflecting high global oil prices which now stand at just below $80 per barrel. As of Tuesday, the average retail price for gasoline and diesel was 1,690 won a litre and 1,495 won a litre respectively, according to KNOC data. In the first nine months of 2018, demand for diesel eased 0.7 percent to 124.7 million barrels from the same period a year ago, while gasoline demand rose 1 percent to 60.2 million barrels, KNOC data showed.

2018-10-24,"XUZHOU, China (Reuters) - In a former mining district in eastern China, authorities have shut dozens of pits and invested billions of yuan to resculpt the broken landscape, creating gardens, forest walks and wetland parks, as well as a small museum dedicated to coal. “There were many villages specialising in running coal mines and when the mines were shut down we lost around four-fifths of our income - we were under huge economic pressure,” said Meng Qinqxi, a senior Communist Party official in Mazhuang, a village on the outskirts of the heavy industrial city of Xuzhou. “This problem is not ours alone... but a national policy, and no one can resist it.”   Xuzhou, in the Yangtze River delta manufacturing hub of Jiangsu, shut its coal pits a decade ago after 130 years of mining, one of many districts to stop producing the filthiest of fossil fuels in line with central government directives. But despite an unprecedented surge of investment in alternative energies, together with caps on coal use and the establishment of “no-coal zones” throughout the country, China’s overall consumption and production are again rising.  When U.S. President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord last year, China reaffirmed its commitments to tackle the problem of coal, by far the biggest source of its climate-warming carbon emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a landmark report this month that “unprecedented” changes were needed to keep global temperature rises to within 1.5 degrees Celsius, including profound cuts in burning coal. China has made efforts to cut the share of coal in total energy use, with the figure expected to drop to 58 percent by 2020, down more than 10 percentage points in a decade. It has also already met a 2020 target to cut the amount of carbon dioxide it emits per unit of growth.  But the absolute volumes of both coal and CO2 remain by far the world’s highest, and are still set to rise. Though some studies have suggested total CO2 emissions peaked at 9.53 gigatonnes in 2013, well ahead of its official target of “around 2030”, environmental group Greenpeace says they could reach a new high this year or next. Coal production has also risen 5.1 percent in the first three-quarters of this year to 2.59 billion tonnes. Falling coal demand after 2013, as the economy slowed, lumbered China’s massive coal sector with a huge supply glut and crippling debts. Giant miners such as China Shenhua Energy sought to transition into alternative energies amid forecasts of a structural decline in coal use.  But fortunes have recovered rapidly since 2016, when state efforts to shed excess capacity coincided with a revival in demand. Shenhua’s profits nearly doubled in 2017, while net earnings at rival Yanzhou Coal surged more than 200 percent compared with the previous year. “China embarked on an energy transformation in terms of cutting coal and developing renewables, but we are now facing difficulties on both fronts,” said Li Shuo, senior climate advisor with Greenpeace.          Big coal-producing regions such as Inner Mongolia and Shanxi have been under pressure to cap capacity, and the state promised to shut 500 million tonnes of annual production between 2016 and 2020. It also banned the import and use of lower-quality coal.   But despite closing uneconomical pits, official annual production capability rose to 3.491 billion tonnes by the end of June, up from 3.41 billion tonnes a year earlier, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said this month. Another 976 million tonnes were under construction. Closures have been offset by rises in output elsewhere. Though all collieries in Xuzhou have closed, the city’s main mining firm continues to produce large volumes of coal, coal chemicals and coal-fired power, running projects elsewhere in China as well as Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Xuzhou Mining Group produced 24 million tonnes of coal last year, up 6.7 percent on the year.    And while provinces such as Hebei and Shandong have set targets to cut coal use and convert heating systems to cleaner natural gas, others are still approving new coal-fired power plants. Coal-fired power has remained the cheapest and most readily available option for many local governments, with many already struggling to find enough natural gas to supply local houses with heat.       China’s mainly coal-fired thermal power capacity rose 58 gigawatts (GW) from the end of 2016 to the end of August this year, more than half of all new domestic capacity over the period and almost enough to power Australia, NEA data showed. According to the China Electricity Council, China added 38.55 GW of coal-fired power capacity in 2017 alone, down 1.42 gigawatts compared with 2016 but still more than the country’s entire nuclear reactor fleet. Beijing’s “decarbonisation” plans have been hit by grid bottlenecks and subsidy backlogs that have impeded efforts to maximise solar and wind generation. Solar capacity grew by a record 53 GW in 2017, but additions are capped at 30 GW this year.   They have also been hurt by a slowdown in the construction of nuclear reactors, one of the few alternative power sources that can provide the reliable “baseload” generation role currently played by traditional coal-fired plants. “With renewables ramping up so quickly, it has given the illusion of decarbonisation, but China is falling into the same trap that Germany has fallen into - deploying lots of renewables that have to be backed up with lots of coal-fired power plants,” said Li Ning, nuclear scientist and dean of the College of Energy at Xiamen University.     With no new commercial reactors approved in nearly three years, local authorities have had little choice but to turn to more cheaper and more reliable coal to provide the baseload. China pledged to launch another six to eight reactor projects this year, but Li said it was unlikely it would get around to making the required approvals until next year.    “If nuclear can’t keep up, then it is coal,” he said.
