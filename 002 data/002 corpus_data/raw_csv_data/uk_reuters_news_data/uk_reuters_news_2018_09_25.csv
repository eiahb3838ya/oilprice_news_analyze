2018-09-25,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday with Trump vowing more sanctions against Tehran and Rouhani suggesting his American counterpart suffers from a “weakness of intellect.” Trump used his annual address to the United Nations to attack Iran’s “corrupt dictatorship,” praise last year’s bogeyman North Korea and lay down a defiant message that he will reject globalism and protect American interests. But much of his 35-minute address was aimed squarely at Iran, which the United States accuses of harbouring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. “Iran’s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,” Trump told the gathering in the green-marbled hall. “They do not respect their neighbours or borders or the sovereign rights of nations.” Rouhani, addressing the assembled world leaders later, sharply criticized Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran. He said he had “no need for a photo opportunity” with Trump and suggested the U.S. president’s pull back from global institutions was a character defect. “Confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength. Rather it is a symptom of the weakness of intellect - it betrays an inability in understanding a complex and interconnected world,” he said. Trump’s address was met largely by silence from world leaders still not comfortable with go-it-alone views that have strained U.S. relationships with traditional allies worldwide. His speech, while delivered in a low-key fashion, was nonetheless a thunderous recitation of his “America First” policies. He has disrupted the world order by withdrawing the United States from the nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, and threatened to punish NATO nations for not paying more for their common defence. “We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy,” Trump said, in language popular with his political base. “America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.” Besides calling out Iran, Trump also criticized China for its trade practices but made no mention of Russia’s interference in Syria’s war or its suspected meddling in U.S. elections. Rouhani was defiant in his speech to the world body. “What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfilment of obligations,” Rouhani said. Offering an alternative view when it was his turn at the podium, French President Emmanuel Macron told the delegates that the law of the survival of the fittest, protectionism and isolationism would only lead to heightened tensions. Defending multilateralism and collective action, he said  nationalism would lead to failure and if countries stopped defending basic principles, global wars would return.   “I do not accept the erosion of multilateralism and don’t accept our history unravelling,” Macron told the assembly, at times raising his voice. “Our children are watching.”  Macron, citing the example of Iran, said that this unilateralism push would lead directly to conflicts. Trump, who begins his political rallies with boasts about his economic record in less than two years in office, used the same rhetoric before the crowd of world leaders and diplomats, telling them he had accomplished more than almost any previous U.S. president. The remark led to some murmuring and laughter in the crowd, taking the president slightly aback. “I didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s OK,” he said. Trump attempted to drive a wedge between Iran’s leadership and its people, days after an attack in southwestern Iran on a military parade killed 25 people and unsettled the country. In remarks to reporters on his way to his speech, Trump said he would not meet the Iranians until they “change their tune.” Though he held out the possibility of a better relationship in the future, he made clear economic pressure on Iran would not abate. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, addressing a group called United Against a Nuclear Iran, called the 2015 accord “the worst diplomatic debacle in American history” and had a warning for “the mullahs in Tehran.” “If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be HELL to PAY,” he said. In May, Republican Trump withdrew the United States from the  deal to put curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for easing sanctions. France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union were part of the accord with Iran. Foes for decades, Washington and Tehran have been increasingly at odds since May. The accord with OPEC member Iran was negotiated under Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. “Additional sanctions will resume November 5th and more will follow and we are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially,” Trump said. He said the United States would help create a regional  strategic alliance between Gulf nations and Jordan and Egypt, a move the United States sees as a bulwark against Iran. Trump compared U.S. relations with Iran to what he called  improved ties with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who Trump had met in Singapore in June as part of a still-unfulfilled drive to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons. In his address last year to the U.N., Trump insulted Kim as a “rocket man” bent on nuclear destruction. On Tuesday, Trump praised Kim for halting nuclear and missile tests, releasing Americans held prisoner and returning some remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950s Korean War. The two leaders are trying to arrange a second summit. Trump has said sanctions on North Korea would remain for now. Delivering a harsh message to OPEC members, Trump called on them to stop raising oil prices and to pay for their own military protection. He threatened to limit U.S. aid only to countries that are friendly to the United States. Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said oil prices were driven only by markets, by supply and demand. “These are not things that can be manipulated by a decision here or there,” said Gargash, whose country is an OPEC member. Crude oil prices shot to a four-year high on Tuesday, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.

2018-09-25,"NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Iranian oil exports are declining ahead of a second round of U.S. sanctions to be imposed on Nov. 4 and Iran’s economy is likely to contract 3 percent this year and 4 percent in 2019, the Institute of International Finance said on Tuesday. Exports of crude oil and condensates have declined by 0.8 million barrels a day (mbd) from April to September 2018, the IIF, which represents major banks and financial institutions from around the world, said. It said crude oil and condensates exports were 2.8 mbd in April and are now estimated at 2.0 mbd in September. The IIF said in an updated note on Iran’s economy that oil exports are falling even although Iran is selling key grades at a deep discount and using its own tankers to ship products to China and India at no extra cost. The IIF said Iranian shippers were also providing generous payment terms and, in some cases, accepting euros and Chinese yuan instead of U.S. dollars. The IIF said barter trade and cash could play a bigger role as U.S. sanctions are enforced. The updated report comes as U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. The remaining parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which curbed Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and from which Trump withdrew the United States in May, agreed on Monday to work to maintain trade with Tehran despite skepticism this is possible as U.S. sanctions to choke off Iranian oil sales resume in November. In a statement after a meeting of Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran, the group said they were determined to develop payment mechanisms to continue trade with Iran despite skepticism by many diplomats that this will be possible. The European Union’s plans for a “special purpose vehicle” (SPV) designed to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports is deeply counterproductive, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. Several European diplomats said the SPV idea was to create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands. The IIF said such a system would likely fail to persuade major European companies to do business with Iran for fear of U.S. sanctions. “Iran may continue to be committed to the 2015 nuclear deal providing the EU and others do the same,” the IIF said. “However, failure to renegotiate the deal with the U.S. would likely bring about even deeper damage to Iran’s economy,” it added.

2018-09-25,"PARIS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Oil and gas major Total , said on Tuesday it expected deepwater oil and gas operations to make a strong contribution to its output and cash flow thanks to major developments in the West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea region, Brazil and U.S. Gulf area. Production from deepwater projects is expected to reach 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Kboe/d) by 2020, contributing to its 6 to 7 percent output growth target per year from 2017 to 2020. “Deepwater is today for us a growing and very profitable part of the portfolio,” Total’s President for Exploration and Production Arnaud Breuillac, told investors in New York. Deepwater production will increase to more than half a million barrels of oil per day by 2020 with cash flow from operations at over $30 per barrel at an oil price of $60 per barrel, Breuillac said. “Deepwater is approximately 15 percent of the group’s production but it will contribute to more than 35 percent of cash flow from operations in the coming years,” he said during a presentation. Total’s deepwater projects on the West African coast includes Moho Nord in Congo, Kaombo North in Angola which began production in July. Production is expected to start at its Nigeria’s Egina field by the end of the year, and at Kaombo South by the summer of 2019. Breuillac said the French company had a number of significant projects in pipeline in Brazil’s “pre-salt” or deep offshore projects, including Lapa, Libra and Lara projects which could add around 100 kboe/d by 2022. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Ballymore giant discovery is being appraised, while production and more developments were ongoing at its Jack and Tahiti operations. Total is also exploring in several new deep water areas in Guyana, Mauritania and Senegal, and in South African and Namibia. “We have a strong deepwater exploration portfolio with numerous drill targets in large areas, targeting significant areas to be drilled in the next two to three years,” Breuillac said.

2018-09-25,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday criticized Washington for its hostile policy towards his country and said the U.S. approach was doomed to failure. Rouhani, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, said the United States had waged “economic war” against Iran by reimposing unilateral sanctions, which were lifted under the country’s 2015 multinational nuclear deal in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. “The United States policy vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic of Iran has been wrong from the beginning, and its approach of resisting the wishes of the Iranian people as manifested in numerous elections is doomed to failure,” Rouhani said. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact in May, and his administration reimposed sanctions on Iran in August. Harsher sanctions on Iran’s oil and banking sector are expected in November. “The economic war that the United States has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the Iranian people but also entails harmful repercussions for the people of other countries, and that war has caused a disruption in the state of global trade,” Rouhani said.    “What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfilment of obligations.” Mounting pressure from the Trump administration combined with discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy are rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers, officials and analysts say. The rial has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar IRR= since April. Iran has blamed U.S. sanctions for the currency's fall, saying the measures amount to a “political, psychological and economic” war on Tehran.  To pile on the pain, Washington says all countries must end crude imports from Iran by Nov. 4, hitting the oil sales that generate 60 percent of the country’s income. Iran says this level of cuts will never happen. Tehran has suggested it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries’ oil exports in retaliation for U.S. sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude. Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes. “The security of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz has always been important for us ... we will confront any and all disruptive efforts in this critical waterway in the future,” said Rouhani. The Strait of Hormuz is a strategic artery linking Middle East crude producers to key markets in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond. A third of the world’s seaborne oil passes through the strait in southern Iran.   Trump, in his annual U.N. speech, said he would keep up economic pressure on Tehran to try to force a change in its behaviour. But Rouhani said Iran had no intention of succumbing to the U.S. pressure. “The United States’ understanding of international relations is authoritarian. ... Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition,” Rouhani said. “No state and nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force,” said the pragmatist president, adding that Iran did not want any war.  “Our proposal is clear: commitment for commitment; violation for violation; threat for threat; and step for step, instead of talk for talk,” he said. Rouhani expressed Iran’s willingness to improve ties with the regional countries. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia has been at loggerheads with Shi’ite Iran for decades, fighting a long-running proxy war in the Middle East and beyond that has influenced conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Riyadh and its Gulf allies have hailed Trump’s decision to exit the nuclear deal and to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, reflecting their concern about Iran’s influence in the region.  “We believe in the formation of a collective mechanism for the Persian Gulf region with the presence and participation of all regional countries,” Rouhani said.

2018-09-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose Tuesday on global supply concerns following U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, with benchmark Brent surging to a four-year high, then retraced gains to settle just slightly higher after U.S. President Donald Trump called again on OPEC to boost crude output.  In a speech before the United Nations, Trump reiterated calls on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to pump more oil and stop raising prices. Earlier, oil prices had surged on worries about global supply after U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports take effect Nov. 4. Brent LCOc1 hit $82.55 per barrel, its highest since Nov. 10, 2014. “It’s hard to believe that the Saudis won’t answer the call at some point, especially if prices tick much higher,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. “He’s going to be unrelenting in pressuring them.” The so-called “OPEC+” group, which includes Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan, met over the weekend to discuss a possible increase in crude output, but the group was in no rush to do so.  Mohammad Barkindo, OPEC secretary general, said in Madrid on Tuesday OPEC and its partners should cooperate to ensure they do not “fall from one crisis to another.” Brent crude futures settled up 67 cents at $81.87 a barrel. U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose 20 cents to $72.28 a barrel, close to the highest since mid-July.  Global benchmark Brent is on course for its fifth consecutive quarterly increase, the longest stretch since early 2007, when a six-quarter run led to a record high of $147.50 a barrel. Trump also said in his speech that Washington will put more sanctions on Iran following oil sanctions in November. The sanctions are expected to have an immediate impact on exports from OPEC’s third largest producer. “Iran will lose sizeable export volumes, and given OPEC+ reluctance to raise output, the market is ill-equipped to fill the supply gap,” Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at French bank BNP Paribas, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.    Most of the potential supply shortfall has already been priced into the contract, Again Capital’s Kilduff said.  The International Energy Agency forecast strong oil demand growth of 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and 1.5 million bpd in 2019, and said in its most recent report the market was tightening. [IEA/M]  U.S. crude inventories were forecast to have declined for a sixth straight week, according to analysts polled ahead of reports from the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, on Tuesday, and from the U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday.

2018-09-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - European shares climbed on Tuesday as oil prices above $80 a barrel lifted energy stocks, while U.S. stocks slid on losses in chipmakers and rate-sensitive shares ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike. U.S. consumer confidence also unexpectedly rose in September, lifting it to levels last seen in 2000, the Conference Board said, underscoring strength in the labor market and overall economy.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 69.72 points, or 0.26 percent, to 26,492.33, the S&P 500 lost 4.38 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,914.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.05 points, or 0.13 percent, to 8,003.29. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.54 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.02 percent. “A lot of the noise around trade and anything else around politics really hasn’t suppressed consumer confidence nearly to the degree that the other factors have boosted it,” said Mike Dowdall, investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management, in Chicago. Brent crude futures shot to four-year highs of almost $82 a barrel, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.[O/R]     “The combination of tight supply, healthy demand, falling global inventories – down from already under-stored levels – and anemic spare capacity helps support an oil price which could end the year above $90,” Richard Robinson, manager of Ashburton’s Global Energy Fund, said.    U.S. crude oil futures settled at $72.28 per barrel, up 20 cents or 0.28 percent. Brent  settled at $81.87, up 67 cents or 0.83 percent. The rise in energy shares, however, failed to squash broader market pessimism after new tariffs imposed by Beijing and Washington on each other’s goods kicked in on Monday, and Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen accused the United States of putting “a knife to China’s neck.” There are other big worries for investors too, not least the timing and pace of central bank policy tightening. While the Fed is poised to hike rates for a third time in 2018 this week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Monday raised expectations the euro zone will also start to normalize policy over the coming year by referring to “relatively vigorous” underlying inflation and brisk wage growth. That pushed German 10-year bond yields to four-month highs above 0.5 percent. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields held at a new four-month high above 3.10 percent after a $38 billion government debt sale on Tuesday.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 3.1039 percent, from 3.078 percent late on Monday. The U.S. dollar weakened ahead of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, as investors have already priced in two more interest rate increases this year and some in 2019, leaving little room for further currency gains. The dollar index fell 0.05 percent, with the euro up 0.16 percent to $1.1765. Since mid-August, the dollar has declined 3.1 percent against that basket of currencies. “The U.S. dollar appears vulnerable... given extended speculative bullish positioning against most of the G10 currencies and considerable tightening already reflected in fed funds futures,” said Eric Theoret, currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. The drifting dollar helped gold edge higher. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,201.01 an ounce.

2018-09-25,"(Adds details on the number of potentially affected turbines) By Alwyn Scott and Geert De Clercq NEW YORK/PARIS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - French power utility Electricite de France SA said on Tuesday it has shut down a General Electric Co turbine at its Bouchain power plant for one month due to a turbine blade issue that has shut down similar plants in the United States. GE shares fell 4 percent after EDF said it took the action over the weekend following a failure of a turbine blade at Exelon Corp’s Colorado Bend plant in Texas. GE and Exelon said last week that four such turbines in Texas were halted when one of them had a blade failure. “The (Bouchain) plant will be closed until Oct. 22 to proceed with controls and maintenance as advised by GE,” an EDF spokeswoman told Reuters. GE shares were down 4 percent at $11.26. GE reiterated on Tuesday its comments from last week, saying it has a fix for the problem, which resulted from oxidation that “affects the lifespan of a single blade component on 9HA and 9FB gas turbines” along with GE’s HA turbines. The Boston-based conglomerate said the problem could potentially affect all 70 of its 9FB turbines it has installed, and all the 51 HA turbines it has shipped. GE has sold thousands of turbines over many decades. GE said is working with customers “on a case-by-case basis, including EDF, to implement the solution and quickly return the units to service.” The company said it was too early to estimate a timeframe for replacing blades at all units. The turbine blades are exposed to extreme temperatures in the hottest part of the gas turbine, industry experts said. GE’s HA turbine has come to symbolize its power-plant ambitions: a large, powerful machine capable of generating power for thousands of homes and holding two Guinness World Records for efficiently turning natural gas fuel into electricity. One of those records was set at EDF’s Bouchain plant in 2017.

2018-09-25,"ZAGREB (Reuters) - With the summer season winding down on Croatia’s Adriatic Sea beaches, environmentalists and diving clubs are turning to the task of clearing plastic waste left behind by locals, tourists and washed up from Albania, Greece or Montenegro.  Once a year Croatia’s “Blue Cleaning” takes part in many locations along the coast and involves around 10,000 people, according to the Zmergo environmentalist group. A smaller clean-up being organized for next week in Kornati national park, which stretches down Croatia’s west coast taking in an archipelago of 89 islands, is the third of its kind and targets six locations within the park, according to organizers. “Along with local products, we also find a lot of plastic waste with labels in Albanian or Greek, for example, brought by the sea currents,” Martina Markov, who works in the park, told Reuters. In a similar clean-up this month in the Telascica nature park, just north of the Kornati park, plastic bottles of Coca Cola and local water brand Jamnica and two popular beer brands were among the most frequent products found in the sea. “The solution lies in changing habits and tougher legislation. Cleaning is just a palliative measure which won’t solve the problem,” Markov said. Plastic pollution affecting the wider Mediterranean Sea has prompted Greenpeace in Croatia, Spain, Italy, Greece and Bulgaria to launch a campaign against single-use plastic items.

2018-09-25,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told Germany on Tuesday to follow Poland’s example and not rely on Russia for its energy supplies which could make it vulnerable to “extortion and intimidation”.  Russia’s Gazprom and its European partners are developing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double natural gas volumes pumped from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, avoiding traditional transit route Ukraine. “Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave nations vulnerable to extortion and intimidation and that is why we congratulate European states such as Poland for leading construction of a Baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their energy needs,” Trump told the United Nations General Assembly. “Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course.” Most eastern Europe states and the United States argue the proposed pipeline could ultimately limit supply routes and the energy security of the European Union, as well as hurting Ukraine’s efforts to reform its economy as bypassing the country would deprive it of billions of dollars in gas transit fees. While Berlin and Moscow have been at loggerheads since Russia’s annexation of Crimea four years ago, they share a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.

2018-09-25,"(Adds details, quotes) By Camillus Eboh ABUJA, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele said on Tuesday he was optimistic the bank would resolve a dispute linked to allegations that South African telecom firm MTN moved funds out of the country illegally. The regulator last month ordered MTN and its banks to bring $8.134 billion back into Nigeria which the central bank alleged the company had sent abroad in breach of foreign exchange regulations. MTN’s latest troubles come about two years after it agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle a dispute over SIM cards in Nigeria, whose finances have been hit by a weak economy and volatile global oil prices. Emefiele said the crux of the latest alleged infraction, related to the repatriation of funds, was that MTN did not obtain final approval before moving the naira equivalent of $8.1 billion from its profits out of Nigeria. MTN and its banks have written to the central bank and provided documents on the matter, Emefiele said. “I am very optimistic we will resolve the matter and I believe that everybody will be happy. MTN will be happy, the banks will be happy. CBN and government would be happy,” Emefiele told reporters in Abuja. Nigeria, which accounts for a third of MTN’s annual core profit, is MTN’s biggest market and Emefiele said MTN was “systemically important” to his country. Emefiele said an investigation into the matter started two years ago. He said inadequate responses from the telecoms group compelled it to publish its finding. The central bank announcement on Aug. 29 sent MTN shares in Johannesburg down by nearly a third but they have recovered after the Nigerian regulator softened its stance on the matter. The shares initially fell on Tuesday but rallied from the previous session to gain 3.24 percent by 1445 GMT. MTN’s lenders; Standard Chartered, Stanbic IBTC Bank, Citibank and Diamond Bank were also fined in connection to the money transfer. Earlier on Tuesday, Standard Bank, said Nigeria’s central bank would not be debiting its local unit Stanbic for $2.6 billion, which the regulator said was the bank’s portion of the MTN funds which had been sent abroad. Emefiele said any liability arising from the funds transfer was that of MTN and not its banks.

2018-09-25,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government will hold another summit on Friday to try to agree a way to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles without resorting to bans, with the transport minister saying his top priority is to ensure owners can swap old cars for cleaner ones. Two government sources said on Tuesday the high-level summit would be held in the German chancellery, and both Environment Minister Svenja Schulze and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier were due to take part. Carmakers and German government representatives failed to reach a compromise on Sunday over potential hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles. Friday’s meeting will take place ahead of a deadline at the end of September set by Chancellor Angela Merkel to stave off bans on older vehicle.  The government currently envisages offering owners of affected diesels in 10 heavily polluted cities options including buy-backs, exchanges and hardware refits, according to a document seen by public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. But ministries are divided over the issue. The Environment Ministry favours hardware retrofits costing around 3,000 euros ($3,500) per vehicle, but Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer favours incentives for drivers of older diesel vehicles to trade them in for newer models to curb pollution. Differences over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with excessive emissions have strained Merkel’s ruling coalition. She said on Monday that a coalition committee would meet on Oct. 1 to discuss matters including diesel policy. The subject has proved controversial as pollution levels have exceeded European Union limits in a number of German cities, but the government is worried about the cost of replacing or upgrading vehicles and the impact on the country’s powerful car industry, its biggest source of export income. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said on Twitter the problem could not be solved without retrofits, adding: “Hardware retrofits paid for by manufacturers are the best and most fair way to deal with the diesel crisis.” Scheuer said in a statement on Tuesday, however, that he favoured exchanging older diesel cars for newer, cleaner ones. “Regarding possible hardware retrofits for German diesel vehicles, my aim is to make sure owners do not pay anything. My aim is also to ensure that the loss of value of used diesel cars is offset by carmakers, who would either take them back or exchange them,” he said.     Industry sources said the decline in value would only be compensated for in regions particularly badly affected by pollution. On retrofits, industry and government sources said the aim in particular was to refit around 1.2 million vans as it was relatively easy in technical terms and such vehicles were on the roads in towns often and for long periods of time. A spokesman for automaker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) said the company was working on a package of measures.

2018-09-25,"SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) will not delay implementing a reduction in the amount of sulfur in marine fuel in 2020, officials with the UN’s shipping agency said on Tuesday.  “I can categorically say there will not be a delay,” said Edmund Hughes, the head of air pollution and energy efficiency at the IMO, during the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore.  From 2020, IMO rules will ban ships from using fuels with a sulfur content above 0.5 percent, compared with 3.5 percent now, unless they are equipped with so-called scrubbers to clean up sulfur emissions. This will be enforced by fines levied by the IMO’s member states. The IMO regulations will create a level playing field for the global shipping industry and if it were to back down, it could lead different rules being implemented in different regions, creating greater levels of uncertainty for the global industry, Hughes said. “A delay to the regulation would damage the IMO’s reputation and credibility as a rule-making body for international shipping and would lead to more regional and national action to control air pollution from ships,” he said. Frederick Kenney, director of legal affairs and external relations with the IMO, said separately that even if a motion was proposed by member states to change the implementation date it would take 22 months for any amendments to take effect, which would run beyond 2020.  “You have to look at how strong the majority was to implement … 2020 and it would be up to the proponents of any change to change that consensus,” Kenney told Reuters at a Capital Link shipping conference in London. A paper submitted to the IMO by the Bahamas, Liberia, Marshall Islands and Panama together with BIMCO, INTERTANKO and INTERCARGO shipping associations called for ways to gather and analyze data to see if changes needed to be made to the 2020 regulations. The paper said challenges in implementation of the regulations “must be resolved satisfactorily in the months to come in order to preserve the smooth flow of maritime trade”.  The shipping and oil refining industries are scrambling to prepare for the shift and have made large investments to comply with the new standards since they were announced in 2016.  But some shippers have been slow to respond and have argued that the burden of compliance with the IMO’s stricter fuel standards should rest with refiners to produce lower sulfur fuels.  “(This) is a shipping regulation and it’s amazing how many times I’ve heard this is a refining problem,” said Savvas Manousos, global head of trading at Maersk Oil Trading, at the conference.   “The onus of compliance is on the shipping industry, not on the refining industry,” said Manousos, adding that the two industries must work together to address the global issue. Maersk Oil Trading purchases marine fuel for its parent company A.P. Moller-Maersk and is among the biggest ship fuel buyers in the world.

2018-09-25,"(Adds Trump quotes, paragraphs 2-4) By Steve Holland and Michelle Nichols NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would not meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani as world leaders gathered in New York but signaled he was open to a future meeting, despite  simmering tensions over Tehran’s nuclear deal. In remarks to reporters on his way to his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Trump said he would not meet the Iranians until they “change their tune.” Both Trump and Rouhani were attending the annual U.N. event. “Iran has acted very badly,” said Trump. “We look forward to having a great relationship with Iran, but it won’t happen now.” Foes for decades, Washington and Tehran have been increasingly at odds since May, when the Republican U.S. president pulled out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and announced sanctions against the OPEC member. The accord, negotiated under Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama, lifted most international sanctions against Tehran in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program. Over the summer, Trump had said he would meet with Rouhani without preconditions to negotiate a new deal, an offer reiterated on Sunday by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and extended to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Rouhani said on Monday Tehran would not talk to Trump until the United States returned to the 2015 deal.. The top adviser to Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati, rejected the U.S. offer on Tuesday, saying “Trump’s and Pompeo’s dream would never come to reality,” the IRNA news agency said. “Despite requests, I have no plans to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Maybe someday in the future. I am sure he is an absolutely lovely man,” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter earlier on Tuesday. Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran’s U.N. mission, told Reuters that Iran has not requested a meeting with Trump. Some Iranian insiders have said any talks between Rouhani and Trump would effectively kill the existing nuclear accord. Tensions have been rising after a deadly attack on a military parade in southwestern Iran in which 25 people were killed. Khamenei said on Monday the attackers had been paid by U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and that Iran would “severely punish” those behind the bloodshed. Quashing the current pact would come at a political cost for the Iranian president, who championed the deal with the supreme leader’s guarded backing and could lose support from  European allies. Rouhani is also under increasing pressure from Iranian hardliners, including Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, which have kept up the anti-American rhetoric ahead of the U.N. session. Trump’s administration is pushing allies to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero as Washington prepares to restore sanctions on Iran’s oil sales in November. The remaining countries in the deal, which see it as the best chance to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, on Monday agreed to keep working to maintain trade with Tehran. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, following a meeting on Monday with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran in New York, warned that the U.S. strategy of applying maximum pressure on Tehran and going it alone could risk a regional escalation.

2018-09-25,"PARIS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total has made a final investment decision to expand its Texas Bayport Polymers joint venture to double polyethylene production capacity to around 1.1 million tonnes a year, the company said. Total said it aimed to become a major player in the U.S. polyethylene market when it announced the joint venture in March 2017 with Borealis and Canada’s Nova Chemical . The Bayport project is in line with the company’s $3 billion programme that began a year ago with a $1.7 billion investment to build an ethane steam cracker at its Port Arthur refining complex in Texas. The cracker will process ethane, which is abundantly available from U.S shale gas at competitive prices, and will supply Bayport polyethylene units. Production is expected to start in 2021. The new unit is expected to have a capacity of a 625,000 tonnes a year, that will added to the existing 400,000 tonnes per year unit. The Bayport unit engineering, procurement and construction has been awarded to the company McDermott, Total said. Polyethylene is used in packaging, pipes, bottles, plastics and other composite materials. It is also seen as a growing market, that Total is targeting with a global expansion of its petrochemicals refining units. “The project is in line with our strategy to develop petrochemicals at our major integrated (refining) complexes and leverage competitively priced feedstocks,” said Bernard Pinatel, Total’s President for Refining and Chemicals. Pinatel said light materials are increasingly used as substitutes for metals in various industrial sectors such as transport and energy, all of which is lifting demand for plastics and polymers. “It is a market that is growing by 3 to 4 percent per year,” Pinatel said. As part of this expansion into the polyethylene market, Total and Saudi Aramco had said in April they would invest around $5 billion to build a petrochemical complex at their Jubail Satorp refinery. In May, Total also signed a $1.5 billion deal with Algeria’s Sonatrach to build a polypropylene plant in western Algeria that will supply plastic to the Algerian and wider Mediterranean market. Last December, its South Korean joint venture with Hanwha Group had also said it would invest $331 million in the group’s refining and petrochemicals platform to increase polyethylene output by 400,000 tonnes per year by 2019. That increased investment was planned to deal with growing demand, particularly from China.

2018-09-25,"PARIS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Oil and gas group Total reiterated its production target for the three years up to 2020, kept its target range for capital investments during the period, and said it would use the favourable, low-cost environment for more projects. Total said its upgraded portfolio, following a recent string of acquisitions and discoveries, had a rich pipeline of major projects to be approved by 2020. Those projects should add more than 700 kboe/d of production. This will contribute to 5 percent average growth in production from 2017 to 2022, it said in a strategy and outlook presentation given to investors in New York. “Over the past three years, Total has demonstrated a track record of delivering on its objectives including production growth, cost reduction, capital discipline, and asset sales,” the French company said in a statement. It added that with Brent oil prices at $60 per barrel, its cash flow was expected to increase by $7 billion from 2017 to 2020 and return on equity to increase to 12 percent, which would enable it to continue to reward shareholders.

2018-09-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Energy stocks climbed on Tuesday as oil prices surged above $81 a barrel, but U.S. shares ended lower as chipmakes fell on ratings downgrades and rate-sensitive shares lost ground ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike. The dollar weakened as the expected Fed rate hike has already been priced in by investors.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 69.84 points, or 0.26 percent, to 26,492.21, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 3.81 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,915.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 14.22 points, or 0.18 percent, to 8,007.47.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 touched a four-year high, at $82.55 a barrel, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.[O/R]     Oil prices pared gains, however, after U.S. President Donald Trump, in a speech before the United Nations, called on OPEC again to boost crude output. “The combination of tight supply, healthy demand, falling global inventories – down from already under-stored levels – and anemic spare capacity helps support an oil price which could end the year above $90,” Richard Robinson, manager of Ashburton’s Global Energy Fund, said.    U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.01 percent to $72.07 per barrel. Brent LCOcv1 was last at $81.56, up 0.44 percent on the day. The rise in energy shares, however, failed to squash broader market pessimism a day after Washington and Beijing imposed new tariffs on each other’s goods, and Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen accused the United States of putting “a knife to China’s neck.” There are other big worries for investors too, not least the timing and pace of central bank policy tightening. The Fed is widely expected to hike rates when it ends its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, in a third increase in 2018. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Monday raised expectations the euro zone will also start to normalize policy over the coming year by referring to “relatively vigorous” underlying inflation and brisk wage growth. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields held near a new four-month high above 3.10 percent after a $38 billion government debt sale on Tuesday.

2018-09-25,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday with Trump vowing more sanctions against Tehran and Rouhani suggesting his American counterpart suffers from a “weakness of intellect.” Trump used his annual address to the United Nations to attack Iran’s “corrupt dictatorship,” praise last year’s bogeyman North Korea and lay down a defiant message that he will reject globalism and protect American interests. But much of his 35-minute address was aimed squarely at Iran, which the United States accuses of harbouring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. “Iran’s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,” Trump told the gathering in the green-marbled hall. “They do not respect their neighbours or borders or the sovereign rights of nations.” Rouhani, addressing the assembled world leaders later, sharply criticized Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran. He said he had “no need for a photo opportunity” with Trump and suggested the U.S. president’s pull back from global institutions was a character defect. “Confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength. Rather it is a symptom of the weakness of intellect - it betrays an inability in understanding a complex and interconnected world,” he said. Trump’s address was met largely by silence from world leaders still not comfortable with go-it-alone views that have strained U.S. relationships with traditional allies worldwide. His speech, while delivered in a low-key fashion, was nonetheless a thunderous recitation of his “America First” policies. He has disrupted the world order by withdrawing the United States from the nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, and threatened to punish NATO nations for not paying more for their common defence. “We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy,” Trump said, in language popular with his political base. “America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.” Besides calling out Iran, Trump also criticized China for its trade practices but made no mention of Russia’s interference in Syria’s war or its suspected meddling in U.S. elections. Rouhani was defiant in his speech to the world body. “What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfilment of obligations,” Rouhani said. Offering an alternative view when it was his turn at the podium, French President Emmanuel Macron told the delegates that the law of the survival of the fittest, protectionism and isolationism would only lead to heightened tensions. Defending multilateralism and collective action, he said  nationalism would lead to failure and if countries stopped defending basic principles, global wars would return.   “I do not accept the erosion of multilateralism and don’t accept our history unravelling,” Macron told the assembly, at times raising his voice. “Our children are watching.”  Macron, citing the example of Iran, said that this unilateralism push would lead directly to conflicts. Trump, who begins his political rallies with boasts about his economic record in less than two years in office, used the same rhetoric before the crowd of world leaders and diplomats, telling them he had accomplished more than almost any previous U.S. president. The remark led to some murmuring and laughter in the crowd, taking the president slightly aback. “I didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s OK,” he said. Trump attempted to drive a wedge between Iran’s leadership and its people, days after an attack in southwestern Iran on a military parade killed 25 people and unsettled the country. In remarks to reporters on his way to his speech, Trump said he would not meet the Iranians until they “change their tune.” Though he held out the possibility of a better relationship in the future, he made clear economic pressure on Iran would not abate. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, addressing a group called United Against a Nuclear Iran, called the 2015 accord “the worst diplomatic debacle in American history” and had a warning for “the mullahs in Tehran.” “If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be HELL to PAY,” he said. In May, Republican Trump withdrew the United States from the  deal to put curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for easing sanctions. France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union were part of the accord with Iran. Foes for decades, Washington and Tehran have been increasingly at odds since May. The accord with OPEC member Iran was negotiated under Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. “Additional sanctions will resume November 5th and more will follow and we are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially,” Trump said. He said the United States would help create a regional  strategic alliance between Gulf nations and Jordan and Egypt, a move the United States sees as a bulwark against Iran. Trump compared U.S. relations with Iran to what he called  improved ties with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who Trump had met in Singapore in June as part of a still-unfulfilled drive to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons. In his address last year to the U.N., Trump insulted Kim as a “rocket man” bent on nuclear destruction. On Tuesday, Trump praised Kim for halting nuclear and missile tests, releasing Americans held prisoner and returning some remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950s Korean War. The two leaders are trying to arrange a second summit. Trump has said sanctions on North Korea would remain for now. Delivering a harsh message to OPEC members, Trump called on them to stop raising oil prices and to pay for their own military protection. He threatened to limit U.S. aid only to countries that are friendly to the United States. Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said oil prices were driven only by markets, by supply and demand. “These are not things that can be manipulated by a decision here or there,” said Gargash, whose country is an OPEC member. Crude oil prices shot to a four-year high on Tuesday, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.

2018-09-25,"NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Iranian oil exports are declining ahead of a second round of U.S. sanctions to be imposed on Nov. 4 and Iran’s economy is likely to contract 3 percent this year and 4 percent in 2019, the Institute of International Finance said on Tuesday. Exports of crude oil and condensates have declined by 0.8 million barrels a day (mbd) from April to September 2018, the IIF, which represents major banks and financial institutions from around the world, said. It said crude oil and condensates exports were 2.8 mbd in April and are now estimated at 2.0 mbd in September. The IIF said in an updated note on Iran’s economy that oil exports are falling even although Iran is selling key grades at a deep discount and using its own tankers to ship products to China and India at no extra cost. The IIF said Iranian shippers were also providing generous payment terms and, in some cases, accepting euros and Chinese yuan instead of U.S. dollars. The IIF said barter trade and cash could play a bigger role as U.S. sanctions are enforced. The updated report comes as U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. The remaining parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which curbed Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and from which Trump withdrew the United States in May, agreed on Monday to work to maintain trade with Tehran despite skepticism this is possible as U.S. sanctions to choke off Iranian oil sales resume in November. In a statement after a meeting of Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran, the group said they were determined to develop payment mechanisms to continue trade with Iran despite skepticism by many diplomats that this will be possible. The European Union’s plans for a “special purpose vehicle” (SPV) designed to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports is deeply counterproductive, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. Several European diplomats said the SPV idea was to create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands. The IIF said such a system would likely fail to persuade major European companies to do business with Iran for fear of U.S. sanctions. “Iran may continue to be committed to the 2015 nuclear deal providing the EU and others do the same,” the IIF said. “However, failure to renegotiate the deal with the U.S. would likely bring about even deeper damage to Iran’s economy,” it added.

2018-09-25,"PARIS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Oil and gas major Total , said on Tuesday it expected deepwater oil and gas operations to make a strong contribution to its output and cash flow thanks to major developments in the West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea region, Brazil and U.S. Gulf area. Production from deepwater projects is expected to reach 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Kboe/d) by 2020, contributing to its 6 to 7 percent output growth target per year from 2017 to 2020. “Deepwater is today for us a growing and very profitable part of the portfolio,” Total’s President for Exploration and Production Arnaud Breuillac, told investors in New York. Deepwater production will increase to more than half a million barrels of oil per day by 2020 with cash flow from operations at over $30 per barrel at an oil price of $60 per barrel, Breuillac said. “Deepwater is approximately 15 percent of the group’s production but it will contribute to more than 35 percent of cash flow from operations in the coming years,” he said during a presentation. Total’s deepwater projects on the West African coast includes Moho Nord in Congo, Kaombo North in Angola which began production in July. Production is expected to start at its Nigeria’s Egina field by the end of the year, and at Kaombo South by the summer of 2019. Breuillac said the French company had a number of significant projects in pipeline in Brazil’s “pre-salt” or deep offshore projects, including Lapa, Libra and Lara projects which could add around 100 kboe/d by 2022. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Ballymore giant discovery is being appraised, while production and more developments were ongoing at its Jack and Tahiti operations. Total is also exploring in several new deep water areas in Guyana, Mauritania and Senegal, and in South African and Namibia. “We have a strong deepwater exploration portfolio with numerous drill targets in large areas, targeting significant areas to be drilled in the next two to three years,” Breuillac said.

2018-09-25,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday criticized Washington for its hostile policy towards his country and said the U.S. approach was doomed to failure. Rouhani, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, said the United States had waged “economic war” against Iran by reimposing unilateral sanctions, which were lifted under the country’s 2015 multinational nuclear deal in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. “The United States policy vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic of Iran has been wrong from the beginning, and its approach of resisting the wishes of the Iranian people as manifested in numerous elections is doomed to failure,” Rouhani said. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact in May, and his administration reimposed sanctions on Iran in August. Harsher sanctions on Iran’s oil and banking sector are expected in November. “The economic war that the United States has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the Iranian people but also entails harmful repercussions for the people of other countries, and that war has caused a disruption in the state of global trade,” Rouhani said.    “What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfilment of obligations.” Mounting pressure from the Trump administration combined with discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy are rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers, officials and analysts say. The rial has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar IRR= since April. Iran has blamed U.S. sanctions for the currency's fall, saying the measures amount to a “political, psychological and economic” war on Tehran.  To pile on the pain, Washington says all countries must end crude imports from Iran by Nov. 4, hitting the oil sales that generate 60 percent of the country’s income. Iran says this level of cuts will never happen. Tehran has suggested it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries’ oil exports in retaliation for U.S. sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude. Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes. “The security of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz has always been important for us ... we will confront any and all disruptive efforts in this critical waterway in the future,” said Rouhani. The Strait of Hormuz is a strategic artery linking Middle East crude producers to key markets in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond. A third of the world’s seaborne oil passes through the strait in southern Iran.   Trump, in his annual U.N. speech, said he would keep up economic pressure on Tehran to try to force a change in its behaviour. But Rouhani said Iran had no intention of succumbing to the U.S. pressure. “The United States’ understanding of international relations is authoritarian. ... Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition,” Rouhani said. “No state and nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force,” said the pragmatist president, adding that Iran did not want any war.  “Our proposal is clear: commitment for commitment; violation for violation; threat for threat; and step for step, instead of talk for talk,” he said. Rouhani expressed Iran’s willingness to improve ties with the regional countries. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia has been at loggerheads with Shi’ite Iran for decades, fighting a long-running proxy war in the Middle East and beyond that has influenced conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Riyadh and its Gulf allies have hailed Trump’s decision to exit the nuclear deal and to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, reflecting their concern about Iran’s influence in the region.  “We believe in the formation of a collective mechanism for the Persian Gulf region with the presence and participation of all regional countries,” Rouhani said.

2018-09-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose Tuesday on global supply concerns following U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, with benchmark Brent surging to a four-year high, then retraced gains to settle just slightly higher after U.S. President Donald Trump called again on OPEC to boost crude output.  In a speech before the United Nations, Trump reiterated calls on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to pump more oil and stop raising prices. Earlier, oil prices had surged on worries about global supply after U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports take effect Nov. 4. Brent LCOc1 hit $82.55 per barrel, its highest since Nov. 10, 2014. “It’s hard to believe that the Saudis won’t answer the call at some point, especially if prices tick much higher,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. “He’s going to be unrelenting in pressuring them.” The so-called “OPEC+” group, which includes Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan, met over the weekend to discuss a possible increase in crude output, but the group was in no rush to do so.  Mohammad Barkindo, OPEC secretary general, said in Madrid on Tuesday OPEC and its partners should cooperate to ensure they do not “fall from one crisis to another.” Brent crude futures settled up 67 cents at $81.87 a barrel. U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose 20 cents to $72.28 a barrel, close to the highest since mid-July.  Global benchmark Brent is on course for its fifth consecutive quarterly increase, the longest stretch since early 2007, when a six-quarter run led to a record high of $147.50 a barrel. Trump also said in his speech that Washington will put more sanctions on Iran following oil sanctions in November. The sanctions are expected to have an immediate impact on exports from OPEC’s third largest producer. “Iran will lose sizeable export volumes, and given OPEC+ reluctance to raise output, the market is ill-equipped to fill the supply gap,” Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at French bank BNP Paribas, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.    Most of the potential supply shortfall has already been priced into the contract, Again Capital’s Kilduff said.  The International Energy Agency forecast strong oil demand growth of 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and 1.5 million bpd in 2019, and said in its most recent report the market was tightening.

2018-09-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - European shares climbed on Tuesday as oil prices above $80 a barrel lifted energy stocks, while U.S. stocks slid on losses in chipmakers and rate-sensitive shares ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike. U.S. consumer confidence also unexpectedly rose in September, lifting it to levels last seen in 2000, the Conference Board said, underscoring strength in the labor market and overall economy.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 69.72 points, or 0.26 percent, to 26,492.33, the S&P 500 lost 4.38 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,914.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.05 points, or 0.13 percent, to 8,003.29. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.54 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.02 percent. “A lot of the noise around trade and anything else around politics really hasn’t suppressed consumer confidence nearly to the degree that the other factors have boosted it,” said Mike Dowdall, investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management, in Chicago. Brent crude futures shot to four-year highs of almost $82 a barrel, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.[O/R]     “The combination of tight supply, healthy demand, falling global inventories – down from already under-stored levels – and anemic spare capacity helps support an oil price which could end the year above $90,” Richard Robinson, manager of Ashburton’s Global Energy Fund, said.    U.S. crude oil futures settled at $72.28 per barrel, up 20 cents or 0.28 percent. Brent  settled at $81.87, up 67 cents or 0.83 percent. The rise in energy shares, however, failed to squash broader market pessimism after new tariffs imposed by Beijing and Washington on each other’s goods kicked in on Monday, and Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen accused the United States of putting “a knife to China’s neck.” There are other big worries for investors too, not least the timing and pace of central bank policy tightening. While the Fed is poised to hike rates for a third time in 2018 this week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Monday raised expectations the euro zone will also start to normalize policy over the coming year by referring to “relatively vigorous” underlying inflation and brisk wage growth. That pushed German 10-year bond yields to four-month highs above 0.5 percent. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields held at a new four-month high above 3.10 percent after a $38 billion government debt sale on Tuesday.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 3.1039 percent, from 3.078 percent late on Monday. The U.S. dollar weakened ahead of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, as investors have already priced in two more interest rate increases this year and some in 2019, leaving little room for further currency gains. The dollar index fell 0.05 percent, with the euro up 0.16 percent to $1.1765. Since mid-August, the dollar has declined 3.1 percent against that basket of currencies. “The U.S. dollar appears vulnerable... given extended speculative bullish positioning against most of the G10 currencies and considerable tightening already reflected in fed funds futures,” said Eric Theoret, currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. The drifting dollar helped gold edge higher. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,201.01 an ounce.

2018-09-25,"(Adds details on the number of potentially affected turbines) By Alwyn Scott and Geert De Clercq NEW YORK/PARIS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - French power utility Electricite de France SA said on Tuesday it has shut down a General Electric Co turbine at its Bouchain power plant for one month due to a turbine blade issue that has shut down similar plants in the United States. GE shares fell 4 percent after EDF said it took the action over the weekend following a failure of a turbine blade at Exelon Corp’s Colorado Bend plant in Texas. GE and Exelon said last week that four such turbines in Texas were halted when one of them had a blade failure. “The (Bouchain) plant will be closed until Oct. 22 to proceed with controls and maintenance as advised by GE,” an EDF spokeswoman told Reuters. GE shares were down 4 percent at $11.26. GE reiterated on Tuesday its comments from last week, saying it has a fix for the problem, which resulted from oxidation that “affects the lifespan of a single blade component on 9HA and 9FB gas turbines” along with GE’s HA turbines. The Boston-based conglomerate said the problem could potentially affect all 70 of its 9FB turbines it has installed, and all the 51 HA turbines it has shipped. GE has sold thousands of turbines over many decades. GE said is working with customers “on a case-by-case basis, including EDF, to implement the solution and quickly return the units to service.” The company said it was too early to estimate a timeframe for replacing blades at all units. The turbine blades are exposed to extreme temperatures in the hottest part of the gas turbine, industry experts said. GE’s HA turbine has come to symbolize its power-plant ambitions: a large, powerful machine capable of generating power for thousands of homes and holding two Guinness World Records for efficiently turning natural gas fuel into electricity. One of those records was set at EDF’s Bouchain plant in 2017.

2018-09-25,"VORKUTA, Russia (Reuters) - Russian railway worker Andrey Bugera had a singular goal: get to pension age so he can leave the polluted, frigid coal mining town above the Arctic Circle where he works and move south to live out even a brief bit of retirement in comfort. But now that President Vladimir Putin has said he plans to raise the retirement age by five years, Bugera fears this will never happen.  In his city of Vorkuta, a place so isolated it cannot be reached by road, temperatures dip below minus 40 degrees Celsius in the winter and clouds of coal dust can turn the white snow black. Thin, polluted air, scarce sunlight and winters lasting up to 10 months weigh heavily on the average life expectancy in the city, labelled the eighth most polluted in Russia by the government last year. In June, in the space of two weeks, three of Bugera’s friends died before reaching the age of 50.  “One of my colleagues came home from his night shift and just didn’t wake up. Left his family, three kids. He was 47 years old. It was his heart, a blood clot... So how can they even think about us retiring at 60?” Bugera said. Though one long time concession in the far north has been early retirement, to help attract workers to its harsh environment, the government’s planned reforms will raise the pension age by five years to 60 for men and 55 for women. Yet males born in 2005 in Komi Republic, where Vorkuta is located, on average are expected to live to 56, government data shows, or four years short of the proposed new retirement age. In the rest of Russia, the retirement age is set to rise to 65 for men and 60 for women making matters little better as the nationwide life expectancy for men was 66 years old in 2015, government data shows. Two years ago, Bugera and his wife used their savings to buy an apartment in Sokol, a small, riverside town in the Vologda region, in central Russia. They have spent their holidays there since, gradually renovating the apartment in the hope of one day leaving the Arctic.  Now, Bugera said he has given up thinking about ever leaving Vorkuta. “With this pension reform, with everything pushed back, I feel like I’ll never get out,” Bugera said. The government’s decision to raise the retirement age is part of efforts to balance Russia’s creaking finances after four years of weak growth made worse by sanctions but it is proving its most unpopular move in more than a decade. Putin’s vice-like grip on power is not directly threatened because he has no real challengers, but his popularity rating has slipped, and once loyal Putin voters are starting to express scorn for their rulers. Around 200,000 people lived in Vorkuta in the 1980s, most coming from across the Soviet Union in search of the high wages miners in the desolate city used to earn.  Now, just four of its 13 coal mines remain, and the population has fallen closer to 70,000.  Districts of empty, blackened apartment blocks with collapsed roofs and yards littered with rubble surround central Vorkuta. With no roads leading out of the city, it is too expensive for most residents to take their belongings with them when they leave. In abandoned apartments, furniture rots and clothes and books lie strewn across the floor. “When I leave, I’ll take my guns and my guitar, that’s it. People drop everything and go,” said Sergei, a coal miner, travelling to Vorkuta by train. A doctor at a district hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she did not want to stay in a town where everything was being shut. She was due to retire next year, and like Bugera planned to move to a home she had prepared for her family in the south. “With this reform, probably none of that is going to happen. I don’t know. But I have no more strength, will, anything, to live in a town like this. Where everything is in ruins,” she said. “You walk around like a zombie.” Bugera attended protests in Vorkuta against the pension reforms. The events were relatively small, attracting around 1,000 people in July, and are expected to dwindle as the snows set in next month.  “If we don’t manage to change anything with our protests... at least I’ll leave some sort of base for my children,” Bugera said.  A muted anger was registered in regional elections on Sept. 9, however. Vorkuta saw a turnout of just 7 percent, election commission data showed.  The presidential election, which took place in March, before the proposed pension reform was announced, saw a turnout of 50 percent.  “This pension reform has become the final straw. People have summed everything up and understood that this is the final straw for them,” said former miner and security guard Alexander Golyanchuk, 37, referring to the low election turnout. “We live in tough conditions and we don’t live for very long. Now they’re taking away our pensions as well?” he added.  Walking through Vorkuta, Olga Lebedeva, 47, said she previously had four years to go until her pension.  “Now they’ve added five. So now it’s nine. I’ll grin and bear it,” she said, before pausing. “No... I’ll drink.” Writing by Polina Ivanova; editing by Christian Lowe and Jason Neely",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-pensions-arctic-circle/above-the-russian-arctic-circle-prisoners-of-putins-pension-reform-idUKL8N1W90KZ,25 Sep 2018,"* Early retirement long one perk for region's harsh

2018-09-25,"(Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) said on Tuesday that U.S. regulators have received a “wake-up call” from automakers over the hurdles they face in trying to meet rising Obama-era fuel-efficiency requirements. In day two of a three-day public hearing over the Trump administration’s proposal to freeze fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026, automakers urged regulators to continue to boost fuel requirements but also take into account shifting consumer demand. The Obama administration in 2012 approved rules to nearly double fuel-efficiency requirements to a fleetwide average of more than 50 miles per gallon but agreed to an evaluation by 2018 over whether the final years of the requirements were feasible. The Trump administration billed the proposed rollback from Obama-era fuel efficiency standards as a way to help car companies and lower vehicle prices for consumers, but critics note the plan will raise estimated fuel consumption by 500,000 barrels of oil a day by the 2030s and boost pollution. Securing America’s Future Energy, a group of retired military leaders and business executives, proposed on Tuesday a compromise hiking requirements by at least 2 percent annually through 2026 with credits for electric vehicles and incentives for self-driving vehicles. The Trump administration’s proposed freeze “places America at a strategic disadvantage,” said retired U.S. Marine Corps Commandant James Conway at the hearing in Dearborn, Michigan. Steve Bartoli, a Fiat Chrysler vice president who oversees fuel economy issues, said at the hearing that the U.S. auto market is significantly different today than was forecast in 2012, marked by lower gasoline prices and a dramatic shift in buying habits from cars to sport utility vehicles. He said starting in 2016 the auto industry has been unable to meet current requirements without using credits earned from prior model years. Bartoli called the gap “a wake-up call that assumptions made seven years ago about the U.S. auto market need to be revisited.” He added that “in business and in government, we have to make decisions based on the best information available to us at the time, but we also must be nimble enough to adjust our plans when the facts on the ground change.” Neither Fiat Chrysler nor Ford Motor Co (F.N), which also testified at the hearing, back a specific fuel-efficiency requirement through 2026. The Trump administration also wants to revoke California’s authority to set its own strict tailpipe emissions rules and mandate the sale of electric vehicles. California is moving ahead with setting its own rules, and 19 states said in August they would challenge the rollback in court. California this week urged the administration to abandon its proposal. Automakers want California and the White House to reach agreement on nationwide rules. Bob Holycross, a Ford environmental executive, said at the hearing automakers need “regulatory certainty, not protracted litigation.”  Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autos-emissions/fiat-chrysler-says-regulators-get-wake-up-call-over-fuel-rules-idUKL2N1WB15M,25 Sep 2018,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV

2018-09-25,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has for the first time allowed state refiners to buy 35 percent of their oil imports in tankers arranged by the seller, a document reviewed by Reuters showed, enabling them to swiftly tap cheaper cargoes. The move will help refiners in Iran’s second biggest oil market to boost purchases from alternative sources as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to halt Iranian oil sales through a new set of sanctions from Nov. 4. The measure is part of a series of attempts by the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer to cut its surging oil import bill in the face of rising oil prices and a weaker Indian rupee. India had previously allowed state refiners to buy only 15.48 percent of their estimated 118.15 million tonnes of oil imports in the current fiscal year to March 31 on a Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) basis, meaning the seller arranges the vessel and insurance. The rest was largely procured on a Free on Board (FOB) basis to help Indian shipping lines and insurers. India’s shipping ministry told the country’s oil ministry about the move in a letter dated Sept 19. “Advance NOC (no objection certificate) is now granted to oil marketing companies to further import crude up to 23.07 million tonnes (balance 19.52 percent),” it said. More than doubling the percentage of CIF cargoes the refiners can buy gives them much greater flexibility to take advantage of more speculative or distressed sellers who need to sell their oil quickly. This also suggests that Indian refiners will be in a position to purchase more U.S. oil, which is mostly available on a CIF basis, helping to compensate for the loss of Iranian oil supplies. U.S. crude is currently trading at a discount of about $10 a barrel to the Brent global benchmark price. “Basically that (the new higher limit) has increased flexibility (for us) to look at opportunities that are available around the world and buy most economic cargoes,” said one source at an Indian refinery who asked not to be named. “It was difficult for us to take advantage of the situation when traders or companies are going around with material in the ships,” this source said. The shipping ministry said in the letter it would review the “outcome of this liberalized offer” before deciding on policy for the next fiscal year. “Previous approval for lower volumes was given before Iran sanctions were announced but (the) situation has changed now, for example, we cannot buy U.S. oil on an FOB basis,” said another source at one of the state refiners. Record high retail prices for petrol and diesel are risking a populist backlash, which could hurt Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government ahead of general elections next year. India’s oil ministry and the four refiners, Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS), Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL.NS), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL.NS) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL.NS) did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comments.

2018-09-25,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil and gas group Total (TOTF.PA) on Tuesday reiterated its key production, savings and investments targets for the coming years, and accelerated its investor reward programmes in 2018 thanks to high oil prices. Total plans to buy back $1.5 billion (1.1 billion pounds) of shares by the end of 2018 after purchasing around $600 million in shares during the first half of the year as part of its $5 billion 2018-2020 share buyback programme announced in February. “We will realise the $1.5 billion in 2018 on top of the 2 billion scrip share buyback,” Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne told investors in New York. “The share buyback is a way to share additional revenues with our investors. In February, we said up to 5 billion because oil was still at around $60, this time I can confirm that the $5 billion will be bought back in 2018-2020,” Pouyanne said. Crude oil prices rose to a fresh four-year high on Tuesday. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were up nearly 1 percent at $81.95 by 1513 GMT. [O/R] Although Total was benefiting from the high oil prices, which has enabled it to generate strong cash flow, and launched new projects, Pouyanne said the oil market was expected to remain volatile in the long-term. He added that oil demand was strong, supported by fundamentals, but it was sensitive to uncertainty over global economic growth. Pouyanne said oil companies were still prudent on investments and this could have an impact in the next three to four years, which could support oil prices. Total kept its production growth target of 6 to 7 percent per year from 2017 to 2020, and capital investments for the same period at $15 billion to $17 billion. It also maintained coats savings target of $5 billion per year by 2020 compared to the 2014 base. Pouyanne said that although Total will maintain discipline on costs, it will continue to give the go-ahead to projects in its portfolio with a low break-even point. Following a recent string of acquisitions and discoveries, Total has a pipeline of major, and short-cycle projects to be approved by 2020 which should add more than 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboe/d) of production. This will contribute to 5 percent average growth in production from 2017 to 2022. “Over the past three years, Total has demonstrated a track record of delivering on its objectives including production growth, cost reduction, capital discipline, and asset sales,” the French company said in a statement. It added that with Brent oil prices at $60 per barrel, its cash flow was expected to increase by $7 billion from 2017 to 2020 and return on equity to increase to 12 percent, which would enable it to continue to reward shareholders. Total's shares closed up 1.2 percent, among the top gainers in France's CAC 40 .FCHI index, which was up 0.05 percent.

2018-09-25,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia denied it had backed the gunmen who killed 25 people at a military parade in southwestern Iran over the weekend, almost half of them Revolutionary Guards, the Saudi state news agency reported on Tuesday.  “Saudi Arabia rejects and condemns the false accusations that Iranian officials have made about Saudi Arabia supporting the events that took place in Iran last Saturday,” SPA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the attackers were paid by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and pledged that the Islamic Republic would “severely punish” those behind the assault. The deputy head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards also accused the United States and Israel of involvement and said they should expect a devastating response. Arch-rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, both oil super-powers, are waging a war for influence across the Middle East, backing opposite sides in conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. On Saturday, gunmen fired on a viewing stand in Ahvaz where officials had gathered to watch an annual parade marking the start of Iran’s 1980-88 war with Iraq. Ahvaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in oil-rich Khuzestan province, and Islamic State have both claimed responsibility, without giving evidence. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday dismissed Tehran’s threats, and a senior UAE official had previously denied the accusations. Separately, the semi-official Iranian news agency Fars posted a video on Tuesday threatening that Iran might carry out missile strikes on Israel and Saudi Arabia. The original footage showed Jerusalem and the Saudi capital Riyadh as being targeted, but Fars soon deleted that video and posted a new version with the cities’ names not shown.

2018-09-25,"OSLO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Swedish oil firm Lundin Petroleum expects to increase its resource estimate for the Alta discovery in Norway’s Arctic region following a successful two-month production test. Finding significant oil reserves in the Norwegian Arctic has been challenging for oil firms, but Alta is among the exceptions. The company and its partners are considering developing the discovery as a subsea field connected to a floating production and storage vessel, and may also tie in the smaller Gohta find, which is located nearby. Prior to the production test the combined gross resource range for the Alta and Gohta discoveries was estimated at between 115 and 390 million barrels of oil equivalent. “These positive results are expected to increase the Alta resource estimate and reduce the uncertainty range,” Lundin said on Tuesday. “We have significantly advanced our understanding of this complex carbonate reservoir, the development of which would be a first for Norway. We will now concentrate our efforts on further defining the route to commercialisation and progressing development concept studies,” it added. Lundin holds a 40 percent stake in Alta, while Idemitsu Petroleum and DEA hold 30 percent each. Lundin also holds 40 percent at the nearby Gohta, while Aker BP holds 60 percent.

2018-09-25,"(Reuters) - British energy supplier SSE (SSE.L) has acquired the other half of offshore wind joint venture Seagreen Wind Energy Limited from Fluor Ltd as it increases its renewable energy ambitions, the company said on Tuesday. SSE said it would take full ownership of the offshore wind projects being developed by Seagreen and purchase Fluor’s 50 percent stake in the venture for 118 million pounds ($155 million). Seagreen’s offshore wind projects are located in Scottish waters in the outer Frith of Firth and Frith of Tay. They have a potential capacity of around 1.5 gigawatts (GW), enough to power at least 670,000 homes. “The Seagreen acquisition aligns with SSE’s ambition to create value from owning, operating and developing clean energy assets and infrastructure,” SSE’s wholesale director, Martin Pibworth, said in a statement. “SSE’s expertise in the development, construction and operation of offshore wind will be an asset to Seagreen, and we will review the ownership structure in due course,” he added.  SSE also said it was sticking to its outlook for the fiscal year to March 31, after it said earlier this month it expected adjusted operating profit for the six months to Sept. 30 to be around half that of the same period in 2017, which was 586 million pounds. Last month, SSE and Innogy (IGY.DE) received provisional approval from Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority to merge their retail units. SSE said the transaction remained on course for completion by the end of the company’s current financial year.

2018-09-25,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Standard Chartered said on Tuesday it will stop financing new coal-fired powerd stations, joining the growing ranks of lenders and financiers ending support for the dirtiest fossil fuel amid rising concerns about climate change. StanChart said in a statement on its website that “save where there is an existing commitment, it will cease providing financing for new coal-fired power plants anywhere in the world.” Burning coal to generate power produces large quantities of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. An international agreement reached in Paris in 2015 committed signatories to cutting fossil fuel use. Many global banks have exited or cut support for coal. Europe’s largest bank HSBC said in April it would mostly stop funding new coal power plants, along with financing for oil sands and Arctic drilling. Japan’s Marubeni Corp, a major investor in coal -fired power stations, said last week it would no longer start any new such projects and will halve its generating capacity using the fuel by 2030.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open on the defensive, with Britain’s FTSE giving up 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX starting unchanged and France’s CAC losing 0.2 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.15 percent. But Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend and edged up nearly 0.2 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.7 percent and Australian stocks eased 0.1 percent. Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday. China and the United States imposed new tariffs on each other’s goods on Monday and neither side looks to be in the mood to compromise, raising the risk of a protracted battle that could chill investment and disrupt global trade. The Dow fell about 0.7 percent and the S&P 500 slipped 0.35 percent overnight. The tense backdrop added to the general caution ahead of an expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve this week and uncertainty over the future of U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election The Fed begins its two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday. U.S. equities had made strong gains last week as investors had hoped the United States and China would find a way out of the trade impasse. “Wall Street weakness amid the latest flare up in trade conflict concerns is a negative factor for equities. Some markets, like Japan’s, have positive factors to fall back on like the weaker yen, but such support could be negated if the Chinese market is hit by volatility,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. In currencies, the euro stood little changed at $1.1742 . The single currency had surged to a 3-1/2-month peak of $1.1815 on Monday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said he sees a vigorous pickup in euro zone inflation, backing moves toward unwinding an ECB asset-purchase program meant to stimulate the economy. Ahead of the Fed’s expected rate hike, the greenback climbed to a two-month peak of 113.00 yen before easing to 112.915. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies edged up 0.15 percent to 94.329. China’s yuan was a shade weaker at 6.8641 per dollar in onshore trade. It dipped in offshore trade on Monday, which was a holiday in mainland markets, after reports that Beijing was scrapping plans to attend trade talks this week. The Australian dollar, a proxy of China-related trades and a gauge of broad risk appetite, retreated 0.15 percent to $0.7241 after shedding 0.5 percent on Monday. Brent crude oil futures hovered near $81.48, the highest since November 2014 scaled overnight. Oil prices had rallied more than 3 percent on Monday after Russian and OPEC leader Saudi Arabia ruled out on Sunday any immediate, additional increase in crude output, effectively rebuffing U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for action to cool the market. “We would expect oil to trend higher in the coming weeks... This is because OPEC have essentially ignored President Trump’s call to raise output to help lower prices,” said Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. “We don’t believe OPEC can actually raise output significantly in the near term, as the physical spare capacity in the system is not that high,” Kelty said. Furthermore, the United States from November will target Iran’s oil exports with sanctions, and Washington is putting pressure on governments and companies around the world to fall in line and cut purchases from Tehran.

2018-09-25,"SINGAPORE, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The marine construction unit of the state-owned China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) on Tuesday signed an agreement to work with Singapore-based commodities trader Zenrock Group to purchase fuel. Marine Construction & Development Co (MCD), which is involved in major infrastructure projects around the world as part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, wants to streamline its process for buying fuel, said Chief Financial Officer Jin Xinxiang. “In the past, (our) oil procurement activities have been very segregated into individual projects. With this new joint venture initiative, it is envisaged we will have all oil procurement activities centralised under one umbrella,” Jin told Reuters. “We own over 200 construction vessels around the world which consume close to about 500,000 tonnes of marine fuel on average each year and we have many more ships on hire,” said Jin, adding that the group’s oil requirements go beyond just marine fuels and include crude oil, refined products and bitumen used in road construction. He also said the company could use the joint venture to sell oil it may receive as payment on some of its infrastructure projects. “In countries where payment issues may arise and there is a need for payment in oil, for example, we want to prepare ourselves so we are able to monetize that,” said Jin. Zenrock, an oil and petrochemicals trader with offices in China and Indonesia, hopes the deal will help its expansion outside Asia. Zenrock president Xie Chun said the firm is looking to tap into markets including Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the United States because Asia’s growing refining capacity is expected to leave the region with an excess supply of refined products such as gasoline and diesel. Established in 2014, Zenrock expects its trading volumes to reach 9 million tonnes of crude oil and oil products in 2018 with $5 billion in revenues, up from 5.7 million tonnes of traded volumes and $2.9 billion in revenues the year before. “(Through the joint venture, we) expect turnover to be increased to 8 billion in 2019, with a 50 percent increase in traded volumes,” said Chun.

2018-09-25,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Iran will tighten global oil supplies sharply until the end of the year, but a threat to world demand looms in 2019 from the U.S.-China trade war, the head of BP’s oil trading in Asia said. “We’re moving into the tightest part of 2018 ... the re-imposition of Iran sanctions is the main factor as the market will tighten substantially from now to year-end,” Janet Kong, chief executive of Integrated Supply and Trading Eastern Hemisphere at BP (BP.L) told Reuters. Saudi Arabia and Russia won’t add significantly more oil to the market because of a lack of capacity, a top Iranian official said on Monday, predicting prices will probably rise further. Sanctions on Venezuela are also exacerbating a production decline there, while outages in Nigeria and Libya have further crimped supplies, Kong said, with Brent LCOc1 supported at above $80 a barrel. “The market fundamentals in the short term look very bullish and positive due to supply shocks, but over time, when supply catches up and the shock to demand becomes more evident, the market will go through another round of re-balancing next year,” she said. The world’s two largest economies, China and the United  States, have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports in an escalating trade war that has rattled global markets and raised concerns of a slowdown in world economies and commodities demand next year. “Going into 2019, I worry about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, manifesting itself slowly,” Kong said.  “The trade war impact has not really shown up in the data anywhere, but it will show up gradually over time. So the supply shock is very sharp and prompt, while the impact from trade war is boiling over slowly.”  Analysts and the International Monetary Fund have forecast a 0.5 percent to 1 percent drop in world gross domestic product growth next year, she said. The International Energy Agency said in its monthly oil report that global oil demand is set to top 100 million bpd next year, although emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent this figure. “The Trump administration wants intellectual property protection ... reducing subsidies to Chinese SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and open market access by all businesses which are difficult, in my view, for the Chinese government to agree to,” Kong said. “So it’s very likely this war will drag on for a long time.” Reporting by Florence Tan; editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/asia-oil-appec-bp/u-s-china-trade-war-poses-oil-demand-shock-in-2019-bp-idUKL3N1W649G,25 Sep 2018,"U.S. sanctions on Iran will

Rosenstein oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election The Fed begins its two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday. U.S. equities had made strong gains last week as investors had hoped the United States and China would find a way out of the trade impasse. “Wall Street weakness amid the latest flare up in trade conflict concerns is a negative factor for equities. Some markets, like Japan’s, have positive factors to fall back on like the weaker yen, but such support could be negated if the Chinese market is hit by volatility,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. In currencies, the euro shed 0.1 percent to $1.1736. The single currency had surged to a 3-1/2-month peak of $1.1815 on Monday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said he sees a vigorous pickup in euro zone inflation, backing moves toward unwinding an ECB asset-purchase program meant to stimulate the economy. Ahead of the Fed’s expected rate hike, the greenback climbed to a two-month peak of 113.00 yen before easing to 112.825. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies edged up 0.15 percent to 94.320. China’s yuan was a shade weaker at 6.8637 per dollar in onshore trade. It dipped in offshore trade on Monday, which was a holiday in mainland markets, after reports that Beijing was scrapping plans to attend trade talks this week. The Australian dollar, a proxy of China-related trades and a gauge of broad risk appetite, was little changed at $0.7247 after shedding 0.5 percent on Monday. Brent crude oil futures nudged up 0.2 percent to $81.32 a barrel after surging more than 3 percent overnight to $81.48, the highest since November 2014. Oil prices had rallied after OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group, Russia, ruled out on Sunday any immediate, additional increase in crude output, effectively rebuffing U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for action to cool the market. “We would expect oil to trend higher in the coming weeks... This is because OPEC have essentially ignored President Trump’s call to raise output to help lower prices,” said Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. “We don’t believe OPEC can actually raise output significantly in the near term, as the physical spare capacity in the system is not that high,” Kelty said. Furthermore, the United States from November will target Iran’s oil exports with sanctions, and Washington is putting pressure on governments and companies around the world to fall in line and cut purchases from Tehran.

2018-09-25,"(Repeats Sept. 24 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Eleven years ago, on Monday Sept. 24, 2007, the price of Brent crude closed just below $79 per barrel, not far from where it is today. Three days later, Brent closed above $80 for the first time in history. Less than 10 months after that, prices closed at an all-time high of $146. Past prices are not necessarily a guide to the future, but the events of 2007/08 are a reminder that price moves are highly non-linear, especially around turning points in the cycle. Price moves tend to accelerate in the run-up to cyclical peaks and troughs, as the market struggles to overcome a worsening deficit or surplus. As a result, oil prices tend to rise far higher, and fall much further, than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier. The current situation in the global economy and the oil market has many similarities to what happened in 2007 and 2008. In the earlier episode, the global economy had been expanding strongly for several years, with rapid growth in oil consumption. The U.S. economic cycle peaked in December 2007, though that was not evident until about a year afterwards, and oil prices continued rising for another seven months. Yields on short-term U.S. Treasury notes peaked around June 2007 and U.S. equity markets hit their pinnacle in October 2007. Most of the other major industrial economies tipped into recession in the second half of 2007 or the first half of 2008. In the oil market, persistent concerns about demand destruction were raised, but dismissed by many participants, and validated only after prices peaked. The introduction of new low-sulphur standards for distillate fuel oil in the United States led to concerns about the availability of enough sweet crude. There were mounting concerns about the exhaustion of OPEC’s spare capacity and the organisation’s ability to add more medium-sweet barrels to meet demand from refiners. Throughout 2007 and early 2008, OPEC leaders continued to insist the oil market was adequately supplied and they would make additional barrels available if refiners requested them. But the Brent market moved into a sharp backwardation in the second half of 2007 and the first four months of 2008, indicating traders were concerned about oil availability. In September 2007, OPEC agreed to increase its collective production by 500,000 barrels per day from the start of November, citing the tightness in U.S. fuel markets and the shift in crude futures into backwardation. In December 2007, however, OPEC’s conference judged the market remained well supplied and that crude and product stocks were at comfortable levels and decided not to increase output further. In March 2008, the conference continued to judge the market well supplied, noting growing downside risks in the world economy, and blamed the continued rise in oil prices on non-fundamental factors, especially speculators. In May, the organisation’s secretary-general issued a statement saying “there is clearly no shortage of oil in the market” and blaming speculative funds for the increasing volatility in crude oil. The organisation promised to be proactive in monitoring developments and act if necessary to ensure a stable and balanced market but did not promise additional barrels. Prices continued to accelerate higher and became increasingly volatile, with $5-per-day price moves becoming frequent, and many traders pulling back from making markets due to the increase in risk. OPEC insisted throughout that oil supplies were adequate, Saudi Arabia and other members would provide more oil, if refiners asked, but that prices were being driven by non-fundamental factors. Eventually, the backwardation began to break down in May and spot prices started to fall from early July as the financial and economic outlook deteriorated. With the intensification of the financial crisis in September 2008, the global economy headed deeper into recession through the second half of the year and in the first half of 2009. Could the same sequence of events play out in 2018/19? The U.S. economy and financial markets are again at a relatively late stage in the current cyclical expansion. In the rest of the world, the global outlook is softening, with the balance of risks tilted towards the downside, according to many forecasters. Oil consumption growth has been strong but may be starting to soften, though as usual this will not be certain until after the event. Six-month Brent calendar spreads are trading in a backwardation of around $2 per barrel, which is comparable to the corresponding point in September 2007. New pollution regulations will tighten sulphur specifications for marine fuels from the start of 2020, which will put pressure on the availability of medium-density and sweet crudes. There are reported shortages of medium crudes as imminent sanctions reduce the export of medium-density oil from Iran (“Saudi Arabia worries oil crunch could push up prices”, Wall Street Journal”, Sept. 21). Saudi Arabia says it has enough spare capacity to increase production by another 1.5 million barrels per day but some market participants are sceptical about the amount and the quality. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers concluded on Sunday the overall balance between supply and demand remains healthy. But hedge funds have amassed a large bullish position in Brent crude, amounting to almost 470 million barrels, betting prices will head even higher.

Oil markets have been driven up by looming U.S. sanctions against Iran and an unwillingness or inability by Middle East dominated producer cartel OPEC and Russia to raise output. Brent crude futures were at $81.39 per barrel at 0042 GMT, up by 19 cents, or 0.2 percent from their last close. This was not far off the November 2014 high of $81.48 a barrel reached the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $72.22 a barrel, up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent from their last settlement. The United States from November will target Iran’s oil exports with sanctions, and Washington is putting pressure on governments and companies around the world to fall in line and cut purchases from Tehran. “It is clear that the impact of forthcoming U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports... will be deeper than many had expected,” said Peter Kiernan, lead energy analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Iran is a member, and Russia increase their supplies to make up for the expected fall in Iranian exports. OPEC and Russia, however, have so far rebuffed such calls. “We would expect oil to trend higher in the coming weeks... This is because OPEC have essentially ignored President Trump’s call to raise output to help lower prices,” said Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. “We don’t believe OPEC can actually raise output significantly in the near term, as the physical spare capacity in the system is not that high,” Kelty said. “We can see oil trending higher - perhaps to $90, but would not expect to see $100 oil anytime soon,” he added. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it has lifted its average Brent crude oil price forecast for 2019 from $75 per barrel to $80 per barrel, while it increased its WTI crude oil forecast by $2 to $71 per barrel in 2019. The U.S. bank said “the Iran factor may dominate the market near-term and cause a (crude price) spike,” although it added that emerging market “demand concerns could reappear thereafter.” Indian refiners - struggling from high crude feedstock prices and a sliding rupee - are planning to reduce oil imports in what could be a first sign that high prices are starting to hurt demand.

2018-09-25,"* Lundin considers connecting filed to floating vessel * Most firms struggled to find reserves in Norway’s Arctic * Find to lift confidence in Barents Sea prospects - analyst (Adds analysts, details) OSLO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Swedish oil firm Lundin Petroleum expects to increase its resource estimate for the Alta discovery in Norway’s Arctic region following a successful two-month production test. Finding significant oil reserves in the Norwegian Arctic has been challenging for oil firms, but Alta is among the exceptions along with ENI’s Goliat field and Equinor’s Johan Castberg discovery. Lundin and its partners are considering developing the discovery as a subsea field connected to a floating production and storage vessel, and may also tie in the smaller Gohta find, which is located nearby. Prior to the production test the combined gross resource range for the Alta and Gohta discoveries was estimated at between 115 and 390 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), and Lundin said it would update its forecast in early 2019. “These positive results are expected to increase the Alta resource estimate and reduce the uncertainty range,” the company said on Tuesday. “We have significantly advanced our understanding of this complex carbonate reservoir, the development of which would be a first for Norway. We will now concentrate our efforts on further defining the route to commercialisation and progressing development concept studies,” it added. During the two months of tests, Lundin produced up to 18,000 barrels per day of oil, and analysts said the results could give a boost to the outlook for the wider region. “It increases the market’s confidence in the Barents Sea as a growth area,” Pareto Securities analyst Johan Spetz said. Brokers Sparebank 1 Markets said it now expected Alta and Gohta to hold some 200 million to 390 million boe combined, significantly lifting the lower end of the forecast compared to Lundin’s 115 million-390 million prediction. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate estimates that the Barents Sea holds more than half of all undiscovered petroleum resources on the Norwegian continental shelf. Lundin holds a 40 percent stake in Alta, while Idemitsu Petroleum and DEA hold 30 percent each. Lundin also holds 40 percent at the nearby Gohta, while Aker BP holds 60 percent.

Trump, in a tweet, has linked U.S. support for Middle Eastern countries to oil prices and has repeatedly urged OPEC to lower prices. OPEC and its allies reduced oil output in August as a drop in Iranian supply due to U.S. sanctions. Global energy demand is expected to grow by 33 percent to 2040, the Secretary General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Barkindo said, citing the group’s long-term world oil outlook, released on Sunday. Oil would continue to have a predominant role in the energy mix for the foreseeable future, Barkindo said during a question and answer session.

2018-09-25,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A senior Chinese official said on Tuesday it is difficult to proceed with trade talks with the United States while Washington is putting “a knife to China’s neck”, a day after both sides heaped fresh tariffs on each other’s goods.  When the talks can restart would depend on the “will” of the United States, Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said at a news conference in Beijing. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory taxes by Beijing on $60 billion worth of U.S. products including liquefied natural gas (LNG) kicked in on Monday, unnerving global financial markets. “Now that the United States has adopted such a huge trade restriction measure ... how can the negotiations proceed? It’s not an equal negotiation,” Wang said, stressing the United States has abandoned its mutual understanding with China. The Chinese government’s top diplomat also told business people at a meeting in New York that talks could not take place against the backdrop of “threats and pressure”, the Foreign Ministry said. Certain forces in the United States have been making groundless criticisms against China about trade and security issues, which has poisoned the atmosphere for Sino-U.S. ties and is highly irresponsible, State Councillor Wang Yi was quoted as saying, without naming anyone. “If this continues, it will destroy in an instant the gains of the last four decades of China-U.S. relations,” Wang told members of the U.S.-China Business Council and National Committee on United States-China Relations. U.S. representatives there included Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) Chief Executive Ajay Banga, the National Committee on United States-China Relations said on its website.  China also accused the United States of engaging in “trade bullyism”, and said Washington was intimidating other countries to submit to its will, according to a white paper on the dispute published by China’s State Council, or cabinet, on Monday.  Several rounds of Sino-U.S. talks in recent months have appeared to produce no breakthroughs, and fresh mid-level negotiations which had been expected in coming weeks have been shelved after Beijing reportedly decided late last week not to send a delegation to Washington. While Vice Commerce Minister Wang said he still hopes “there is a way out” if both sides treat each other with sincerity, analysts say neither side looks to be in the mood to compromise in the increasingly bitter dispute, raising the risk of a lengthy battle that could chill the global economy by discouraging business investment and disrupting trade.  “The sharp criticism (from Beijing on Monday) suggests that China might prefer to wait out the current U.S. administration, rather than embarking on potentially futile negotiations,” Mizuho Bank said in a note to clients. “Given these developments, it is increasingly likely that both sides will not resume negotiations for some time, at least until there is a noticeable shift in the political mood on either side.” U.S. exporters including LNG suppliers would “certainly” be hurt, but Beijing’s retaliation would provide opportunities to other LNG-exporting countries, Vice Commerce Minister Wang said, adding that Australia is an important source of the fuel for China. “China is a big and powerful nation, so whether it is a confrontation with China economically or militarily, it would come at a huge price,” the state-backed Global Times said in an editorial on Tuesday.  “As such, it is an attractive prospect for other countries including the United States to coexist with China peacefully,” said the newspaper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily.  China does not know why the United States changed its mind after reaching an agreement with China on trade earlier, Wang said. He was apparently referring to talks in May, when it appeared that the two sides had sorted out a framework before the White House backed away.  Luo Wen, a vice minister at the Ministry of Industry and Information, told a news conference that the government is aware that some foreign companies are considering relocating out of China as the trade row threatens to heighten their risks and costs. But he said the government is working to accommodate their needs and reduce their tax burdens. However, the trade war risks disrupting global supply chains and throwing them into chaos, Luo said. Senior officials also once again rejected Washington’s accusations that China forces foreign companies to share their technology with Chinese joint-venture partners, adding that Beijing has passed a rule forbidding government entities from such illegal behavior. “The government has not forced this, and a lot of JVs are actually performing very well in China,” Wang said, giving an example of American car giant Ford (F.N). “Ford produces more cars and makes more profits in China through its JV than it does in the United States,” he said.

Following falls across Asian share markets, European bourses opened firmer, with a pan-European index up 0.2 percent . MSCI’s main index of world stocks traded flat, though it is holding just under six-month highs hit earlier this month. Beijing and Washington have imposed new tariffs on each other’s goods and Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen on Tuesday accused the United States of putting “a knife to China’s neck”. Neither side appears ready for compromise, worrying investors the conflict is fast-becoming a protracted battle that will chill investment and hurt global trade. The developments pushed Wall Street lower on Monday though futures indicated a slightly higher open. “Markets have tried hard to shrug off the implications of an escalating trade spat on global trade and growth but this is becoming harder with each fresh round of tariffs and will slowly but surely take its toll on investor sentiment,” Jasper Lawler, head of Research at London Capital Group, said. There are other big worries for investors too, not least the timing and pace of central bank policy tightening. While the U.S. Federal Reserve will almost certainly hike rates for a third time in 2018 this week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Monday raised expectations the euro zone will also start to normalise policy over the coming year by referring to ‘relatively vigorous’ underlying inflation and brisk wage growth. That pushed German 10-year bond yields to four-month highs above 0.5 percent, while yields also rose across the euro bloc with money markets now pricing a rate rise by the ECB next September. That’s a marked change from a few weeks ago when a move was only expected by December 2019. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields too rose, touching a new four-month high above 3.10 percent. Goldman Sachs analysts noted a change in how markets were viewing rising bond yields — having considered them a signal of improving growth and hence a positive for equities, higher bond yields were becoming attractive in their own right, they said. “With U.S. 10-year bond yield above 3 percent and U.S. real yields close to 1 percent, the risk especially to equities from rates is now back in focus,” they told clients in a note. “We think the bar for investing in risky assets is rising as returns on safer assets are becoming more attractive.” Currency markets were mostly quiet as investors watched from the sidelines before the Fed meeting. The euro eked out a small rise to $1.177 after rising above $1.18 after Draghi’s comments on inflation while the dollar index was flat having inched off two-month lows hit at the end of last week. The dollar’s three percent reversal since mid-August has given some respite to emerging markets in recent days but MSCI’s emerging equity index slipped 0.4 percent while most currencies also weakened, anticipating a hawkish tone from the Fed. The yuan was a touch weaker as most investors expect Chinese authorities to not follow the Fed in raising rates. Oil prices are also becoming a concern. They surged more than three percent on Monday after Russia and OPEC leader Saudi Arabia resisted pressure to raise crude output to offset the expected hit to supply from U.S. sanctions against Iran. Brent crude futures rose to as high as $81.69 a barrel on Tuesday, a level not seen since November 2014. Additional reporting by Sujata Rao in London; Shinichi

2018-09-25,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on Iran will tighten global oil supplies sharply until the end of the year, but a threat to world demand looms in 2019 from the U.S.-China trade war, the head of BP’s oil trading in Asia said. “We’re moving into the tightest part of 2018 ... the re-imposition of Iran sanctions is the main factor as the market will tighten substantially from now to year-end,” Janet Kong, chief executive of Integrated Supply and Trading Eastern Hemisphere at BP (BP.L) told Reuters. Saudi Arabia and Russia won’t add significantly more oil to the market because of a lack of capacity, a top Iranian official said on Monday, predicting prices will probably rise further. Sanctions on Venezuela are also exacerbating a production decline there, while outages in Nigeria and Libya have further crimped supplies, Kong said, with Brent LCOc1 supported at above $80 a barrel. “The market fundamentals in the short term look very bullish and positive due to supply shocks, but over time, when supply catches up and the shock to demand becomes more evident, the market will go through another round of re-balancing next year,” she said. The world’s two largest economies, China and the United  States, have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports in an escalating trade war that has rattled global markets and raised concerns of a slowdown in world economies and commodities demand next year. “Going into 2019, I worry about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, manifesting itself slowly,” Kong said.  “The trade war impact has not really shown up in the data anywhere, but it will show up gradually over time. So the supply shock is very sharp and prompt, while the impact from trade war is boiling over slowly.”  Analysts and the International Monetary Fund have forecast a 0.5 percent to 1 percent drop in world gross domestic product growth next year, she said. The International Energy Agency said in its monthly oil report that global oil demand is set to top 100 million bpd next year, although emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent this figure. “The Trump administration wants intellectual property protection ... reducing subsidies to Chinese SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and open market access by all businesses which are difficult, in my view, for the Chinese government to agree to,” Kong said. “So it’s very likely this war will drag on for a long time.” Reporting by Florence Tan; editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/asia-oil-appec-bp/u-s-china-trade-war-poses-oil-demand-shock-in-2019-bp-idUKL3N1W649G,25 Sep 2018,"U.S. sanctions on Iran will

U.S. equities had made strong gains last week as investors had hoped the United States and China would find a way out of the trade impasse. “Wall Street weakness amid the latest flare up in trade conflict concerns is a negative factor for equities. Some markets, like Japan’s, have positive factors to fall back on like the weaker yen, but such support could be negated if the Chinese market is hit by volatility,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. In currencies, the euro shed 0.1 percent to $1.1736.

This is because OPEC have essentially ignored President Trump’s call to raise output to help lower prices,” said Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. “We don’t believe OPEC can actually raise output significantly in the near term, as the physical spare capacity in the system is not that high,” Kelty said. Furthermore, the United States from November will target Iran’s oil exports with sanctions, and Washington is putting pressure on governments and companies around the world to fall in line and cut purchases from Tehran.

2018-09-25,"(Repeats Sept. 24 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Eleven years ago, on Monday Sept. 24, 2007, the price of Brent crude closed just below $79 per barrel, not far from where it is today. Three days later, Brent closed above $80 for the first time in history. Less than 10 months after that, prices closed at an all-time high of $146. Past prices are not necessarily a guide to the future, but the events of 2007/08 are a reminder that price moves are highly non-linear, especially around turning points in the cycle. Price moves tend to accelerate in the run-up to cyclical peaks and troughs, as the market struggles to overcome a worsening deficit or surplus. As a result, oil prices tend to rise far higher, and fall much further, than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier. The current situation in the global economy and the oil market has many similarities to what happened in 2007 and 2008. In the earlier episode, the global economy had been expanding strongly for several years, with rapid growth in oil consumption. The U.S. economic cycle peaked in December 2007, though that was not evident until about a year afterwards, and oil prices continued rising for another seven months. Yields on short-term U.S. Treasury notes peaked around June 2007 and U.S. equity markets hit their pinnacle in October 2007. Most of the other major industrial economies tipped into recession in the second half of 2007 or the first half of 2008. In the oil market, persistent concerns about demand destruction were raised, but dismissed by many participants, and validated only after prices peaked. The introduction of new low-sulphur standards for distillate fuel oil in the United States led to concerns about the availability of enough sweet crude. There were mounting concerns about the exhaustion of OPEC’s spare capacity and the organisation’s ability to add more medium-sweet barrels to meet demand from refiners. Throughout 2007 and early 2008, OPEC leaders continued to insist the oil market was adequately supplied and they would make additional barrels available if refiners requested them. But the Brent market moved into a sharp backwardation in the second half of 2007 and the first four months of 2008, indicating traders were concerned about oil availability. In September 2007, OPEC agreed to increase its collective production by 500,000 barrels per day from the start of November, citing the tightness in U.S. fuel markets and the shift in crude futures into backwardation. In December 2007, however, OPEC’s conference judged the market remained well supplied and that crude and product stocks were at comfortable levels and decided not to increase output further. In March 2008, the conference continued to judge the market well supplied, noting growing downside risks in the world economy, and blamed the continued rise in oil prices on non-fundamental factors, especially speculators. In May, the organisation’s secretary-general issued a statement saying “there is clearly no shortage of oil in the market” and blaming speculative funds for the increasing volatility in crude oil. The organisation promised to be proactive in monitoring developments and act if necessary to ensure a stable and balanced market but did not promise additional barrels. Prices continued to accelerate higher and became increasingly volatile, with $5-per-day price moves becoming frequent, and many traders pulling back from making markets due to the increase in risk. OPEC insisted throughout that oil supplies were adequate, Saudi Arabia and other members would provide more oil, if refiners asked, but that prices were being driven by non-fundamental factors. Eventually, the backwardation began to break down in May and spot prices started to fall from early July as the financial and economic outlook deteriorated. With the intensification of the financial crisis in September 2008, the global economy headed deeper into recession through the second half of the year and in the first half of 2009. Could the same sequence of events play out in 2018/19? The U.S. economy and financial markets are again at a relatively late stage in the current cyclical expansion. In the rest of the world, the global outlook is softening, with the balance of risks tilted towards the downside, according to many forecasters. Oil consumption growth has been strong but may be starting to soften, though as usual this will not be certain until after the event. Six-month Brent calendar spreads are trading in a backwardation of around $2 per barrel, which is comparable to the corresponding point in September 2007. New pollution regulations will tighten sulphur specifications for marine fuels from the start of 2020, which will put pressure on the availability of medium-density and sweet crudes. There are reported shortages of medium crudes as imminent sanctions reduce the export of medium-density oil from Iran (“Saudi Arabia worries oil crunch could push up prices”, Wall Street Journal”, Sept. 21). Saudi Arabia says it has enough spare capacity to increase production by another 1.5 million barrels per day but some market participants are sceptical about the amount and the quality. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers concluded on Sunday the overall balance between supply and demand remains healthy. But hedge funds have amassed a large bullish position in Brent crude, amounting to almost 470 million barrels, betting prices will head even higher.

Oil markets have been driven up by looming U.S. sanctions against Iran and an unwillingness or inability by Middle East dominated producer cartel OPEC and Russia to raise output. Brent crude futures were at $81.39 per barrel at 0042 GMT, up by 19 cents, or 0.2 percent from their last close. This was not far off the November 2014 high of $81.48 a barrel reached the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $72.22 a barrel, up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent from their last settlement. The United States from November will target Iran’s oil exports with sanctions, and Washington is putting pressure on governments and companies around the world to fall in line and cut purchases from Tehran. “It is clear that the impact of forthcoming U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports... will be deeper than many had expected,” said Peter Kiernan, lead energy analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Iran is a member, and Russia increase their supplies to make up for the expected fall in Iranian exports. OPEC and Russia, however, have so far rebuffed such calls. “We would expect oil to trend higher in the coming weeks... This is because OPEC have essentially ignored President Trump’s call to raise output to help lower prices,” said Ashley Kelty, oil and gas research analyst at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. “We don’t believe OPEC can actually raise output significantly in the near term, as the physical spare capacity in the system is not that high,” Kelty said. “We can see oil trending higher - perhaps to $90, but would not expect to see $100 oil anytime soon,” he added. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it has lifted its average Brent crude oil price forecast for 2019 from $75 per barrel to $80 per barrel, while it increased its WTI crude oil forecast by $2 to $71 per barrel in 2019. The U.S. bank said “the Iran factor may dominate the market near-term and cause a (crude price) spike,” although it added that emerging market “demand concerns could reappear thereafter.” Indian refiners - struggling from high crude feedstock prices and a sliding rupee - are planning to reduce oil imports in what could be a first sign that high prices are starting to hurt demand.
