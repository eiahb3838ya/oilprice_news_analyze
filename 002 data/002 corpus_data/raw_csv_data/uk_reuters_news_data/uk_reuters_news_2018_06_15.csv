2018-06-15,"SAO PAULO, June 15 (Reuters) - China’s State Power Investment Corp is likely to deliver a bid for Brazil’s fourth-largest hydroelectric dam as soon as next month, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. The sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly, said that China’s State Power Investment Corp had been in talks with shareholders of the Santo Antonio plant last year, before breaking off negotiations to bid for another dam. Cia Energética de Minas Gerais (Cemig) and Odebrecht SA, the owners of the 3.6-gigawatt Santo Antonio dam in the state of Rondonia, are selling assets to pay down debt. Cemig, Odebrecht and SPIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China’s State Power Investment Corp paid 7.2 billion reais ($1.9 billion) in a September auction for the license to operate the 1.7-gigawatt Sao Simao hydroelectric plant. Reuters reported last month that the Chinese group was looking for new targets in Brazil. China’s State Power Investment Corp, which has 120 gigawatts of power generating capacity in 41 countries, aims to add 30 gigawatts worldwide through 2020. $1 = 3.729 reais

2018-06-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Friday and global stocks continued to slide after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese goods, while oil plummeted 3 percent on expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia output would soon increase.   Trump announced hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports starting on July 6, with Beijing immediately vowing to respond in kind, intensifying fears of a growing trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump unveiled a 25 percent tariff on a list of strategically important imports from China, including cars, promising further measures if Beijing struck back. “Investors are worried that with the trade war escalating, today it’s better to sell out... and take profits,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.48 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.00 percent. Emerging market stocks were hit particularly hard, tumbling 1.06 percent, a move maybe attributable as much to a strong dollar as to trade tensions. In commodities, soybeans sank as the U.S.-China trade spat threatened shipments to the world’s biggest buyer of the oilseed. Soybean futures fell 2.5 percent, hitting their lowest level since June 23 of last year. ICE cotton futures also dropped on the day. Trump’s decision on tariffs comes a day after stock markets rallied on the European Central Bank’s decision to hold off on raising rates at least until the middle of next year. By the close of U.S. markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 84.83 points, or 0.34 percent, to 25,090.48, the S&P 500 lost 3.07 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,779.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 14.66 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,746.38. The outbreak of a global trade war has been the most frequently cited “biggest tail risk” by investors this year in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey of global fund managers, on the back of ramped up protectionist rhetoric and measures by the U.S. administration. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.65 percent lower, with Chinese stocks leading the losses. (GRAPHIC: World shares set for weekly loss: reut.rs/2MszUmP World oil markets cratered on fears of increased supply, with U.S. Crude on track for its biggest decline since May 15, and to end the week down 1.3 percent. Brent was headed for a 4 percent loss on the week. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is slated to meet next week in Vienna, with two of the biggest producers - Saudi Arabia and Russia - indicating they were prepared to increase output.  “Everyone is talking about raising production - the only question is by how much,” said Bob Yawger, director, energy at Mizuho in New York. U.S. crude settled at $65.06 per barrel, down 2.74 percent, and Brent crude was last at $73.44, down 3.29 percent. In currencies, the U.S. dollar slipped against the safe-haven yen in the wake of the announced tariffs, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six currencies, rose 0.01 percent.  The euro, which on Thursday suffered its biggest fall against the dollar in two years after the ECB’s interest rate decision, rose up 0.35 percent to $1.1607. Trade fears drove demand for safe government bonds, causing U.S. Treasury yields to fall to their lowest levels in a week. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.9223 percent, from 2.946 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond last rose 14/32 in price to yield 3.0434 percent, from 3.066 percent Thursday. “You’ve seen a little bit of a risk-off trade, which is aiding in the Treasury rally,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.

2018-06-15,"June 15 (Reuters) - Beijing surprised oil markets with threats to levy tariffs on imports of U.S. crude oil, natural gas and other energy products on Friday, just as China has risen to the top of the list of importers of oil from the United States. China responded to $50 billion in tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump with a similar amount of levies on a variety of U.S. goods. But China also said it would impose tariffs on U.S. energy products, which analysts considered a surprise as previous tariff threats had centered on agricultural goods and automobiles. “This is a big deal. China is essentially the largest customer for U.S. crude now, and so for crude it’s an issue, let alone when you involve (refined) products, too. This is obviously a big development,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. China currently imports about 363,000 barrels of U.S. crude daily, on par with Canada as the biggest U.S. crude importer, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. It also takes in an additional 200,000 barrels a day (bpd) of other products like propane. The U.S. energy industry has been buoyed by production from the nation’s shale fields, boosting overall daily oil production to a record 10.9 million bpd. Of that, the United States is now exporting about 2 million bpd, and Trump has touted dominance in energy production and export as key to American global influence. The United States has also been urging other nations, including China, to buy more U.S. energy and limit purchases of Iranian crude after Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear arms agreement with Tehran. China is the largest buyer of Iranian oil, purchasing 650,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2018, and it is unclear if it plans to reduce those purchases. A tariff would discourage Chinese refiners from buying U.S. crude imports. The threatened tariff by China comes just as major producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia look set to increase production at next week’s meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with other non-member states. China is also a major importer of other products such as propane, and tariffs would boost prices for that and several other petroleum products, said Bernadette Johnson, vice president at Drillinginfo in Denver. She also said sellers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), also emerging as a U.S. export to China, have been worried about tariffs. “The constant back-and-forth about the tariffs creates a lot of market uncertainty that makes it harder to sell cargoes or sign long-term (trade) deals,” she said.

2018-06-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday it cannot make large oil refineries blend additional biofuels into their gasoline to make up for volumes waived under the small refinery hardship waiver program unless Congress authorizes it. The agency’s decision was certain to anger the powerful U.S. corn lobby and Congressional members from farming states. EPA has issued a record number of waivers freeing small refineries from the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the past year, drawing criticism from the biofuel industry and its legislative backers that the program undermines demand for corn-based ethanol.  Lawmakers like Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa have demanded that other refiners take on bigger obligations to compensate for the volumes exempted under the program, as a way for President Donald Trump’s administration to keep its promise to protect the 15-billion-gallon biofuel mandate. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend specific volumes of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the fuel supply each year and prove compliance by acquiring credits called RINs that can be either earned or purchased. The law has helped farmers by creating a big market for ethanol, but refining companies have complained it costs them a fortune. The EPA, under Administrator Scott Pruitt, has issued more than two dozen small refinery exemptions from the RFS for 2017, including waivers to plants owned by some the largest U.S. refining companies. Refiners have until early 2019 to comply with all or a portion of the 2017 obligation. The biofuel industry says the waivers have cut the 15 billion gallon mandate to roughly 13.5 billion and have asked the EPA to reallocate the waived volumes to the remaining refineries who must comply.   “Law says 15b gallons & Congress intended 15b gallons & Trump promised 15b gallons / why can’t Pruitt do 15b gallons? Poor excuses killing ethanol/Midwest farmers,” Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said on Twitter on Friday.       While the EPA said there is a path to reallocation, it is a near impossible one.  “Our regulations only allow reallocation of an exempted refinery’s RIN obligations for a given year if the exemption is granted before we finalize the volumes for that year,” EPA spokeswoman Molly Block said.  That is impossible because hardship waivers are not granted until after the annual volumes are set. “Binding precedent holds that agencies can only impose retroactive obligations if Congress has given them the authority to do so,” Block explained. Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell who works with refiners, including Valero, said the EPA is correct about retroactively, calling it a staple of administrative law. “If the ethanol industry would like to open the renewable fuel standard in a comprehensive way, I am sure that many parties – fuel makers, environmentalists, consumer groups and others – would be very happy to join in,” Segal said. The biofuels industry did not like the message. “That certainly contradicts what EPA has stated before. The Agency has admitted in past RFS rulemakings that its decision not to reallocate exempted volumes is an interpretive decision made by EPA, not one directed by the statute,” Renewable Fuels Association Executive Vice President Geoff Cooper said on Friday.

2018-06-15,"* Worker protests trigger controlled power cuts * Outages hurt economic output in 2015 * Unions want 15 pct pay hikes, Eskom offering no raises * Minister says two sides have agreed to talk * Standoff is key test for President Ramaphosa (Adds public enterprises minister’s comments) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Reuters) - South Africa suffered power outages for a second day on Friday as workers protested over wages at national electricity provider Eskom, in a test of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s resolve to cut costs at struggling state companies. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said late on Friday Eskom and the unions had agreed to resume talks immediately on conditions that include Eskom makes a pay increase offer and operations return to normal. “The parties have agreed that the current disruptions at Eskom that resulted in load-shedding since yesterday are not beneficial to either party nor the country and the economy,” Gordhan said in a statement. Eskom, which produces more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power, said it would implement outages throughout the day because of an “illegal protest action” by some of its employees. The rand currency weakened after Eskom announced the outages and said there was a high risk of further disruptions over the weekend. Cutting costs at troubled state entities such as Eskom is a top priority for Ramaphosa, and the unrest will test his administration’s commitment to reforms aimed at putting a struggling economy on sustained growth path. In 2015, severe power constraints caused a prolonged period of outages, hitting growth. Eskom is regularly cited as a threat to South Africa’s credit rating because it has more than 220 billion rand ($16.4 billion) of government-guaranteed debt. Eskom started controlled outages - known locally as “load-shedding” - on Thursday after it said protesters had blocked trucks carrying coal and buses ferrying staff to power stations. Two large labour unions, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), have threatened a total shutdown of Eskom’s operations unless it meets their demands for a 15 percent pay rise. Eskom, which has obtained a court order declaring the labour protests unlawful, has offered no pay increases. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe blamed the power cuts on acts of “intimidation and sabotage” by union members, but NUM and NUMSA said their members were respecting the court order and had done nothing illegal. Ramaphosa oversaw the appointment of a new board and chief executive at Eskom in an effort to stabilise its finances after it became embroiled in corruption scandals under former president Jacob Zuma. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said: “This is about more than salaries. The government has lost the moral authority because of the looting that went on at state firms like Eskom. “If Ramaphosa doesn’t intervene the lights will stay off and people will start asking: where is our president?” ($1 = 13.4449 rand) (Additional reporting by Ed Stoddard and Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo Editing by Joe Brock and Robin Pomeroy)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/safrica-eskom/update-5-south-african-power-outages-enter-2nd-day-as-workers-protest-idUKL8N1TH0LG,15 Jun 2018,"* Standoff is key test for President Ramaphosa

2018-06-15,"(Reuters) - SandRidge Energy Inc (SD.N) said on Friday it had been approached by 17 potential bidders for a buyout, including billionaire Carl Icahn who is fighting for control of the oil and gas producer’s board. The activist investor, however, said in response he had no plans to make a bid soon, adding that any bid would depend on the approval of a majority of the unaffiliated shareholders. (bit.ly/2JUQugI) Icahn has criticized SandRidge’s leadership, forced the removal of its chief executive officer and got the embattled company to back out of its planned buyout of rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc (BCEI.N). The investor, who said in April he was willing to buy the company, will now have to await a June 19 shareholder vote for directors as he seeks to revamp the board with his seven preferred nominees. Icahn holds a 13.6 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Some investors tip their hat to an Icahn-led board, as that might offer a quicker and possibly greater gain,” said David Beard, an analyst at Coker Palmer Institutional. “But it also seems that both management and Icahn want a higher stock price. Either way, shareholders should win.” The analyst reckoned most of the potential bidders could be from Oklahoma’s SCOOP/STACK region, a fast-growing shale oil play that is attracting investment as companies look beyond the Permian basin in Texas. Devon Energy (DVN.N), Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) and smaller producers such as Colorado’s Cimarex Energy (XEC.N) are some of the companies in the SCOOP/STACK region. SandRidge, which has a market value of $544 million, has most of its production in the north west STACK region. Its stock has risen about 18 percent since Icahn disclosed his buyout interest in April. Earlier this month, the oil and gas producer said proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) recommended shareholders should vote for the company’s board nominees. SandRidge also said Midstates Petroleum (MPO.N), whose all-stock bid was rejected by the company in March, did not agree to its confidentiality terms, even after month long negotiations with the smaller rival. Both Midstates and Icahn, however, rejected SandRidge’s claims on Friday. “While SandRidge has offered a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to Midstates, it would require Midstates to enter into a standstill, which is an unusual requirement for a party that has made a public offer,” Midstates said. SandRidge has informed Midstates that it will not provide internal forecasts to the company even if it were to sign the NDA offered by SandRidge, Midstates added. Siding with Midstates, Icahn said in a letter to shareholders that it is “inherently impossible to negotiate with a counterparty that demands unreasonable and onerous terms.” SandRidge declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. SandRidge’s shares closed 1.6 percent up at $15.61 on Friday, while those of Midstates closed 3 percent lower at $11.92.

2018-06-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than $2 a barrel Friday after two of the world’s biggest producers indicated they might increase output at next week’s OPEC meeting, while U.S. exports were threatened by potential Chinese tariffs on crude oil and refined products. Oil investors have been nervous ahead of the coming OPEC summit in Vienna. Saudi Arabia and Russia have already boosted production modestly, and have indicated they were prepared to increase output at that meeting. Brent crude oil LCOc1 fell $2.50, or 3.29 percent to settle at $73.44 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 settled $1.83 lower at $65.06 a barrel. In post-settlement trading, U.S. crude retreated further, falling 2.25, or 3.4 percent, to $64.64 a barrel. Brent crude was on track to end the week down more than 4 percent, while U.S. crude was heading to fall 1.7 percent.  After settlement, China announced $50 billion in retaliatory tariffs, in response to a series of levies by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier.  Some investors were surprised when crude oil and other energy products were included for tariffs at a later date, the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Tariff Commission of the State Council. Over the past six months, the United States has exported an average 363,000 bpd of crude oil to China, which along with Canada is the biggest buyer of U.S. crude.  “They were a big outlet, and we’re going to notice it,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. “It’ll take time for other buyers to absorb that crude.” U.S. crude’s discount to Brent widened in post-settlement trade after China announced the planned tariffs. WTCLc1-LCOc1 Both contracts have drifted lower since hitting 3-1/2-year highs in May. Prices have been pressured by rising U.S. crude production, while the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and others look poised to increase output in their meeting in the Austrian capital on June 22-23. “We’re going into an OPEC meeting where everyone is talking about raising production - the only question is by how much,” said Bob Yawger, director, energy at Mizuho in New York.  On Thursday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after talks with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih in Moscow that both nations “in principle” supported a gradual increase in production after restricting output for 18 months. Novak said one option would involve gradually raising output by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), possibly starting July 1. Falih said “I think we’ll come to an agreement that satisfies, most importantly, the market.” Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader, said Russia seemed to want a bigger rise in production than some other producers. “My guess is the increase will be something less than the 1 million bpd (barrels per day) that the U.S. is supposed to have asked the Saudis for,” McKenna said. Adding to investor jitters about supply, U.S. production continues to ramp up.  U.S. energy companies added one oil rig this week, the fourth week of increases, according to weekly data from GE’s Baker Hughes division.

Tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods including agricultural products such as soybeans will take effect from July 6, the ministry said. Soybeans are China’s biggest import from the United States by value. The tariffs will also be applied to autos and aquatic products, the ministry said. The list of 659 U.S. goods was longer than a preliminary list of 106 goods published by the commerce ministry in April, although the value of products affected remained unchanged at $50 billion. (here) Aircraft, included in the earlier Chinese list, were not on the revised list. The effective date of the tariffs on the remaining $16 billion of U.S. goods will be announced later, according to the commerce ministry.

He also vowed further measures if Beijing struck back. “The U.S. has ignored China’s resolute opposition and solemn representation, and has insisted on adopting behaviours that violate WTO rules,” China’s commerce ministry said. “This is a violation of the legitimate rights and interests that China is entitled to according to WTO rules, and is a threat to China’s economic interest and security.” (Reporting by Ryan Woo and Stella Qiu; editing by David Evans)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-tariffs/update-2-china-to-impose-25-pct-tariffs-on-659-u-s-goods-worth-50-bln-idUKL4N1TH501,15 Jun 2018,"China will impose additional 25

2018-06-15,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB.N) and Odebrecht SA, the controlling owner of petrochemicals producer Braskem, said on Friday they have entered into exclusive talks for Lyondell to acquire control of Braskem, and two people familiar with the matter said the companies are planning a cash and shares deal that could top $9 billion (£6.7 billion). LyondellBasell and Odebrecht expect to reach a final deal in two months, but there is no deadline yet for LyondellBasell to deliver a binding proposal, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the terms publicly. The sources said Odebrecht expects a premium over Braskem’s market capitalisation, which was 33.2 billion reais (£6.7 billion) as of Thursday’s market close. Once LyondellBasell and Odebrecht reach an agreement on price, the acquirer will extend the same terms for the stake owned by state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), known as Petrobras, Braskem’s No. 2 shareholder, according to the sources. Petrobras previously said it planned to divest fully from its stake in Braskem. While Odebrecht is angling for a minority stake in LyondellBasell, the deal may be structured so that Petrobras may receive an all-cash offer if it wishes to, the sources said, adding that minority shareholders will also receive a tender offer. Braskem shares soared 19 percent in Sao Paulo, lifting its market cap to 37.7 billion reais. LyondellBasell edged nearly 1 percent higher in New York, while Petrobras shares were down nearly 3 percent, tracking tumbling crude prices. LyondellBasell and privately held Odebrecht declined to comment on details of the deal. Petrobras said in a filing it had been informed of talks. Most of LyondellBasell’s 55 plants are in the United States, Europe and Asia — a footprint complementary to that of Braskem, which has 29 plants in Brazil, five in the United States, four in Mexico and two in Germany.  “The discussions are preliminary and no agreements have been reached,” the two companies said. “There can be no assurance the discussions will result in a transaction or on what terms any transaction may occur.” During the exclusive negotiations, LyondellBasell will examine Braskem’s long-term naphtha supply contract with Petrobras, which is set to expire in 2020.  Odebrecht recently pledged its 38 percent stake in Braskem as collateral on loans, and part of the proceeds from a deal may go to paying debt, so the conglomerate’s creditors will have to agree to the sale, the sources said.

2018-06-15,"MOSCOW/DUBAI (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia have a general consensus that the OPEC+ format should be “institutionalised” and extended until 2019 and beyond for oil market monitoring and joint action in case of need, Russia’s energy ministry said in a statement on Friday. Citing Russian Minister Alexander Novak, the ministry added that the two major oil producers planned to sign a mutual agreement which will draw their cooperation in the energy arena to a new level.    Russia, the world’s top crude oil producer, and Saudi Arabia, the driver of OPEC policy and the third-largest crude producer behind the United States, agreed with OPEC and non-OPEC nations to cut supply by 1.8 million barrels per day since 2017.  A Gulf source familiar with Saudi oil thinking said the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  and other major producers in Vienna on June 22 “will look into a number of options” to guarantee oil market rebalancing.  “Any action will happen after all the consultation and agreement of the 24 countries,” the source told Reuters. “Saudi Arabia and Russia acknowledge the hard work that has been done over the past year and a half along with members of the declaration of cooperation and plan to continue having that cooperation and institutionalizing it to a permanent framework,” the source said. Inventories have since dwindled the deal, taking global benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 to $80 a barrel in late May, near a four-year high.  In recent weeks, both Russia and Saudi Arabia have started to raise production, in part after complaints from U.S. President Donald Trump about high prices. Brent fell to near $73 on Friday, a five-week low. Saudi Arabia plans to host a leaders’ oil summit later this year for OPEC and non-OPEC countries in the deal to cut supply, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Friday. An OPEC source described the summit as an idea which would be developed into a proposal, and a second source said it would be discussed in Vienna, where the deal will be reviewed.    Riyadh and Moscow took the first step in institutionalising the long-term framework for co-operation between OPEC and non-OPEC nations this week, the sources said. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin this week. Russia defeated Saudi Arabia in the opening match of the soccer World Cup, which Russia is hosting.  The two countries plan to strengthen their relationship with investment throughout the energy sector and sharing of technology, the Gulf source said.

2018-06-15,"June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added one oil rig this week, the fourth consecutive week of increases, despite a 9 percent decline in crude prices over the past four weeks. Despite that decline, producers still expect higher prices for their oil in 2018 than they received in 2017. The oil rig count in the week to June 15 rose to 863, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI That was the tenth time drillers added rigs in the past 11 weeks, although the increases have slowed down in June to about one a week. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 747 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s efforts to cut global output in a bid to take advantage of rising prices. U.S. crude futures were on track to fall for a fourth week in a row this week, falling below $65 per barrel on Friday ahead of an OPEC meeting next week where Saudi Arabia and Russia were expected to say they will boost output. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $65.15 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $64 for the balance of 2018 and below $62 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise to 1,038 in 2018, 1,097 in 2019 and 1,232 in 2020, up from a projected 1,025 in 2018 and 1,125 in 2019. With the boost in rigs so far this year, however, analysts were not so bullish on much further increases in the count. Since 1,059 oil and gas rigs were currently in service, drillers would only have to add a few more rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 999, up sharply from 2017’s average of 876. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 11.8 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. The current all-time U.S. annual output peak was in 1970 at 9.6 million bpd, according to federal energy data. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-06-15,"NEW DELHI, June 15 (Reuters) - India faces the worst long-term water crisis in its history as demand outstrips supply and millions of lives and livelihoods could be at risk, said a think tank chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. By 2030, water demand is projected to be double the supply, implying severe scarcity for hundreds of millions of people. The shortage will eventually shave around 6 percent off gross domestic product, the report said. About 200,000 Indians die every year due to inadequate access to safe water and 600 million face high to extreme water stress, the National Institute for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog said on Thursday, citing data by independent agencies. “Critical groundwater resources that account for 40 percent of India’s water supply are being depleted at unsustainable rates,” the report said, calling for an immediate push towards sustainable management of water resources. “India is suffering from the worst water crisis in its history and millions of lives and livelihoods are under threat,” it said. The think tank said it has developed a Composite Water Management Index with nine areas of assessment to help state governments manage water resources. Droughts are becoming more frequent, creating problems for India’s rain-dependent farmers. At the same time, disputes between states are on the rise. Interstate disagreements are on the rise, with seven major disputes currently raging, pointing to the fact that limited frameworks and institutions are in place for national water governance. The report said there are seven major ongoing disputes over water resources, which highlights the limited framework and institutions for water governance. Nearly 163 million of India’s population of 1.3 billion lack access to clean water close to home, the most of any country, according to a 2018 report by Britain-based charity WaterAid.

2018-06-15,"MONTREAL/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The U.N. aviation agency is expected to include fossil fuels in a landmark global agreement to limit aircraft emissions, a move that could encourage airlines to purchase crude over more costly biojet fuels, sources familiar with the matter said.  Countries at the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) are seeking to agree on rules that will govern how the overall deal, brokered by the ICAO in 2016, will be implemented.  The United States, backed by Saudi Arabia and other countries, has proposed giving airlines credit for using crude oil as well as aviation fuels from renewable sources like corn, provided they meet the deal’s lower-emissions criteria, two industry sources said. Europe will back the proposal next week at an ICAO meeting in Montreal, as long as the fossil fuels eligible under the deal deliver actual carbon savings, two European Commission officials said separately. ICAO experts would determine how many emissions each fuel emits to avoid any confusion.  The emission levels of individual fuels need to be “very robust so there is no fooling around with what is the actual performance of one fuel over another”, one of the officials said. Oil giant Saudi Arabia, for example, has previously argued that the 2016 agreement should be “fuel neutral” - whereby it does not discriminate between different types of fuels - because technological advances could one day enable crude to be produced with 10 percent fewer emissions, as the deal requires, according to a Saudi presentation seen by Reuters. “What they (the Saudis) are saying is ‘don’t rule it out for us,” said the first industry source. All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because talks on how to implement the 2016 deal, known as the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), are private.     Representatives from Saudi Arabia and the U.S. State Department did not respond to requests for comment. An ICAO spokesman declined to comment.     The European Commission sent a letter to EU ministers this week reiterating concerns that any attempts to weaken the 2016 deal, which will go into effect in 2021, should be “strongly opposed.”      The agreement aims to cap airline emissions at 2020 levels, and airlines would be required to limit their emissions or offset them by buying carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the world.  Airlines would receive credit toward lowering their emissions if they use eligible lower-carbon fuels.      Haldane Dodd, spokesman for the Air Transport Action Group, which represents 50 members of the aviation industry, would not take a position on the use of lower-carbon crudes but advocated “strong sustainability standards for our fuels.”  Europe hopes that airlines will still be encouraged to use more costly biojet fuels if they deliver bigger emissions savings. But with aviation biofuels now only produced in small quantities, lowering the emissions of conventional jet fuel may prove a better option for the environment, said a fifth source who works in the aviation industry.     “If we can develop technologies that are going to make fossil fuels with lower emissions, isn’t that a carbon savings compared with business as usual?” Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington; Editing by Susan Fenton",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-aviation-oil/un-aviation-agency-may-include-fossil-fuels-in-emissions-deal-sources-idUKL8N1TH3Z5,15 Jun 2018,"The U.N. aviation

2018-06-15,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Is Europe’s economy merely encountering a soft spot or entering a more lasting decline? Bank of England policymakers are likely to debate this question in the week ahead, while data from the euro zone will indicate whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is right to refer to current conditions simply as a “soft patch”. A cold snap from February into March, later Easter holidays than usual and strikes took their toll in the first quarter, but hard data since have not pointed to a clear rebound. In announcing an end to bond purchases by the end of the year, Draghi said such softness could last longer than currently projected by ECB economists. “In some countries, for example, it is foreseen that it may extend into the second quarter,” he said, while adding the underlying strength of the economy did not appear changed, albeit with greater uncertainty, such as over global trade. Peter Vanden Houte, chief euro zone economist at ING, said markets were very much looking for news to test the ECB’s idea that the economy would grow at a satisfactory pace in the second quarter and possibly even accelerate afterwards. “This is still in doubt because you might also have a further deceleration of the economy. That will remain very much in the mind of traders and economists,” he said. Belgian central bank chief Jan Smets, an ECB Governing Council member, said an improving labour market, with income gains, and accommodating monetary policy, were foundations for growth in the coming years. “That cannot make us blind that, especially in the global environment, there are prominent risks which may even have increased. One is the protectionist measures, which I regret,” he said. Draghi may also return to this issue at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Portugal. He gives a speech on Tuesday and appears on a panel the day after with U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Reserve Bank of Australia head Philip Lowe. Survey data on Thursday and Friday may then provide some answers. The euro zone flash estimate for consumer confidence on June 21 is forecast to decline for a second consecutive month, with the index turning negative for the first time since October. On Friday, IHS Markit’s composite flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to overall economic health, is seen unchanged. However, this would match  an 18-month low and with the manufacturing component expected to fall for a sixth straight month. “These are the first figures that will actually show what has been the impact of Italy,” Vanden Houte said, referring to Italy’s new government of anti-establishment parties. They will also be the first survey data since U.S. President Donald Trump made EU steel and aluminium subject to import tariffs. Draghi said on Thursday that the impact in Europe of U.S. tariffs was limited to date, but a series of tit-for-tat measures could particularly hit confidence. With political uncertainty in Germany too, it is only a dip in oil prices after an upward march of 11 months that has really provided some comfort. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other producers meet in Vienna from Friday and could agree to increase production from July. In Britain, the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to keep interest rates on hold, but the focus will be on indications for its following meeting in August, when markets put the chance of a hike at about 50 percent. The chances of a rate increase were pegged back in the past week by softer than expected manufacturing, earnings and inflation data. Its announcement will come on Thursday, with no news conference, though BoE governor Mark Carney will deliver a speech at the annual banker’s dinner at London’s Mansion House that evening. The BoE has said it wants to be sure the economy has recovered from near-stagnation in an unusually cold early 2018, before pushing ahead with only its second rate hike since before the global financial crisis. In the United States, there is little on the economic front to occupy markets a week after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the second time this year and signalled more to come. The global trade war could though ramp up a notch after Trump announced new tariffs of $50 billion (37.7 billion pounds) of Chinese imports and Beijing threatened to respond in kind.

2018-06-15,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombians will choose either a business-friendly protégé of a powerful ex-president or a leftist former guerrilla as their new head of state on Sunday, with the future of a historic peace accord and the nation’s economic model hanging in the balance. Ivan Duque, hand-picked by former hardline president Alvaro Uribe, is predicted to win Sunday’s runoff as he is polling about 20 points ahead of Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogota and one-time member of the now-defunct M19 rebel group.  At stake is the implementation of a 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which brought an end to five decades of conflict with the Marxist rebel group, and whether Latin America’s fourth-largest economy will abandon its traditionally market-friendly posture. “A Duque victory wouldn’t mean the end of the peace agreement, but it could mean it’s reduced to a minimum,” said Yann Basset of Rosario University. “A Petro victory would probably mean a difficult period of economic uncertainty.” The 41-year-old Duque made a name as senator for his staunch opposition to the peace deal negotiated by outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos, who once counted Uribe among his backers before falling out with him over the talks. Duque has promised changes to the accord, which he slams as far too lenient on former rebels. His pledge to jail commanders for war crimes has sparked concern among some Colombians that he could upset the deal and send fighters back to the trenches.  Petro has criticized the deal as not resolving deep rural inequality but says he will keep it intact. It remains to be seen what changes, if any, Duque can make to the deal, which was upheld by the constitutional court. Whoever takes office as president on Aug. 7 faces a tough time.  The $320 billion (241 billion pounds) economy remains weak, a new wave of drug trafficking crime gangs have moved into areas once controlled by the FARC and almost a million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into Colombia, looking for food and work. here Though he was never a combatant, Petro belonged to the M19 urban rebel group, which demobilized in 1990. He has been hailed as an example of how ex-rebels can transition to politics but his tenure as mayor was criticized and he failed to win over Bogota voters in the May 27 first round. He was ousted from office for allowing garbage to pile on Bogota’s streets when he was mayor, before being reinstated. “He was a very bad leader. Bogota was too big for him to govern; the whole country would be too,” said Fidel Hernandez, 43, standing outside a Bogota bicycle shop where he works. His opponents accuse him of wanting to turn Colombia into socialist Venezuela, which is suffering a punishing economic crisis. The 58-year-old denies his plans to redistribute land amounts to expropriation and says power has remained too long in the hands of elites. Petro would likely struggle to get his policies through a conservative congress. Duque, who worked at the Inter-American Development Bank until 2014, is considered by some to be too inexperienced and beholden to Uribe. The former president is loved and hated in equal measure by millions who either believe he safeguarded Colombians by crushing the FARC or supported right-wing paramilitary death squads that killed thousands. “Duque is counselled by Uribe. He’s his puppet,” said deliveryman Francisco Roballo, 50, who plans to vote for Petro. Colombia may struggle to maintain its prized investment grade credit rating whoever wins. Petro’s pledges to hike taxes on the rich and raise social spending have unsettled investors but there are concerns that Duque’s agenda of cutting taxes could also worsen the deficit. Duque has promised policies friendly to the oil and mining industries, Colombia’s top exporters, in a bid to revive production. Petro wants to ban open-pit gold mining and not renew coal contracts, as well as transition state-run oil company Ecopetrol to renewables.

2018-06-15,"BOGOTA, June 15 (Reuters) - Gustavo Petro, a former insurgent turned rabble-rousing mayor, is fighting to become Colombia’s first leftist president, turning his humble beginnings and revolutionary past into a rallying cry for millions of the nation’s youth and poor. The 58-year-old economist is about 20 points behind right-wing candidate Ivan Duque to replace President Juan Manuel Santos, but his presence in the second round has worried many in the traditionally conservative nation, where the right has kept a vice-like grip on power. Proposals from Petro to change the nation’s economic model by piling taxes on unproductive landowners and abandoning oil and coal for clean energy have spooked investors. Some fear his efforts to shift wealth from rich to poor could turn Colombia into another Venezuela. Known for his fiery speeches from the Senate against corruption and right-wing paramilitary groups, Petro says his political awakening began in 1973 with the military coup that ended the rule of Chile’s socialist President Salvador Allende. Colombia was descending into violence around the same time, as guerrilla groups began a wave of kidnappings and attacks on civilians. It was then that Petro, the son of a teacher, pledged to fight the “feudal” oligarchy enriching itself at the expense of Colombia’s poor, the former member of the M-19 guerilla group said. “Twenty-first century politics is between the politics of life and the politics of death,” the father of six told Reuters in April. “I represent the politics of life.” Inspired as a child by political biographies, Petro reportedly raised the ire of his Catholic teachers by reading books by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Although never a combatant, Petro’s years in the now-defunct M19 rebel group - which stormed the Supreme Court in 1985, leading to the deaths of more than 100 people - have created fodder for critics. He was arrested that year for weapons possession and served 18 months in prison, where he has said he was tortured. Petro’s 2011 election as mayor of Bogota, Colombia’s second-most powerful post after the presidency, was seen as proof that politics was the way forward for insurgent movements like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which demobilized last year and formed a political party. He won 4.8 million votes in the first round. “Petro represents a clearly populist project,” said Andres Molano, director of the Hernan Echavarria Olozaga institute of political science. “He presents himself as an outsider - an enemy of the elites - and has elaborated a messianic and anti-liberal discourse that promises a kind of revolution both politically and economically.” A win for Petro may help shore up Colombia’s fragile peace process that ended five decades of war with the FARC, but angered many by giving their commanders a political voice instead of a jail cell. Petro promises Latin America’s fourth-largest economy will include all of society, creating a public banking system that guarantees cheap credit to small-and-medium sized businesses and expanding free education. That may be difficult. The economy remains weak, a new wave of drug trafficking crime gangs have moved into areas once controlled by the FARC and half a million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into Colombia looking for food and work. Critics say his ideas are strikingly similar to the early days of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez’s government in Venezuela. “There are many echoes of the so-called 21st century socialism that flourished in Latin America during the last two decades,” said Molano. Petro has said he does not plan to expropriate property, but he raised eyebrows with his recent offer to buy a huge piece of productive land from billionaire sugar baron and media mogul Carlos Ardila Lulle to give to the poor. While it may be tough for Petro to push radical change through Congress - his Colombia Humana party won just six seats in March’s legislative election - he said he would seek alliances with center, left and other minority parties or attempt a change to the constitution through a constituent assembly. Known for his stubborn management style and ruling by decree, the bespectacled Petro has taken flack for living in a gated community and wearing $500 shoes, but his expensive lifestyle has not swayed voters or his discourse. “Because I’m from the left, I have to wear espadrilles?” he responded wryly in a recent radio interview.

2018-06-15,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Trump OKs $50B in tariffs as China vows retaliation * World stocks suffer as euro rebounds against dollar * Oil down 3 pct on prospect for higher output By Nick Brown NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - World shares fell on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs that sparked fears of a trade war between the U.S. and China, while oil prices plummeted 3 percent over signs that supply may soon rise. Trump announced hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, with Beijing threatening to respond in kind, in a move that could ignite a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump unveiled a 25 percent tariff on a list of strategically important imports from China, promising further measures if Beijing struck back. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.59 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.76 percent. Emerging market stocks were hit particularly hard, tumbling 1.20 percent, a move maybe attributable as much to a strong dollar as to trade tensions. “I think the biggest concern at the moment, more than talk about trade, is the tightening of monetary conditions in emerging markets caused by a stronger dollar,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London, noting the Federal Reserve’s forecast for a total of four interest rate rises in 2018. Trump’s decision on tariffs comes a day after stock markets had rallied on the European Central Bank’s decision to hold off on raising rates at least until the middle of next year. U.S. share indexes were feeling the hit from the impending tariffs in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 206.32 points, or 0.82 percent, to 24,968.99, the S&P 500 lost 10.85 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,771.64 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 27.06 points, or 0.35 percent, to 7,733.98. The outbreak of a global trade war has been the most frequently cited ‘biggest tail risk’ by investors this year in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey of global fund managers, on the back of ramped up protectionist rhetoric and measures by the U.S. administration. It is not clear when Trump will activate the measures, but rising Sino-U.S. tensions will put more pressure on China’s economy, which is starting to show signs of cooling. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.65 percent lower, with Chinese stocks leading the losses. World oil markets cratered in early trading on fears of increased supply, with U.S. crude down 2.8 percent to $65.02 per barrel and Brent last at $73.55, down 3.15 percent. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is slated to meet next week in Vienna, with two of the biggest producers - Saudi Arabia and Russia - indicating they were prepared to increase output. “Everyone is talking about raising production - the only question is by how much,” said Bob Yawger, director, energy at Mizuho in New York. In currencies, the U.S. dollar slipped against the safe-haven yen in the wake of the announced tariffs, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six top currencies, fell 0.04 percent. The euro, which on Thursday had suffered its biggest fall against the dollar in two years after the ECB’s interest rate decision, jumped 0.41 percent to $1.1615. Trade fears drove demand for safe government bonds, causing U.S. treasury yields to fall to their lowest levels in a week. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.9059 percent, from 2.946 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond rose 24/32 in price to yield 3.0284 percent, from 3.066 percent Thursday. “You’ve seen a little bit of a risk-off trade, which is aiding in the Treasury rally,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.

2018-06-15,"OSLO, June 15 (Reuters) - Europe’s largest intraday power market, launched on Tuesday to trade electricity between 14 countries, has had a smooth start and offers traders better access to energy resources and volumes, Norway’s Statnett power grid told Reuters. The new market, called Cross-Border Intraday or XBID, came online after years of development and testing and is a collaboration between a number of power exchanges and transmission system operators across Europe. “In principle, trades can be made directly from Portugal to Norway, if transmission capacities are available. Increasing the market allows for more trading and better access to resources for doing that,” Statnett’s spokesman Henrik Glette said. XBID allows electricity trading between Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, and more countries are due to join it in 2019. “The first days have shown positive results, and the system has performed well ... This is a major step towards an integrated European power market,” said Glette. The new intraday market will not only ensure better utilisation of Europe’s resources, but will also create a wider so-called balancing mechanism for its members when they need more electricity than they have expected, said Statnett. The Nordpool power exchange received XBID’s first bid in Denmark and the first deliveries were made on Wednesday, said the exchange. XBID relies on a common IT system and a shared order book, a capacity management system and a transmission system. It allows the matching of orders entered by market participants in the different countries it covers, if capacity allows. After its first week, project members expect trading volumes to increase, said power exchange Nordpool. The system is designed to handle up to 400,000 trades per day, and will be developed to process both more trades and more products, said Statnett. XBID is so far backed by 31 system operators, including Statnett, as well as 15 power exchanges. In Finland, a country that had struggled to agree with its Nordic neighbours a new balancing market in 2017, the state-owned grid Fingrid also praised the project.

2018-06-15,"(Adds background) By Carolina Mandl and Tatiana Bautzer SAO PAULO, June 15 (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd on Friday called off listing its Brazilian sugar and ethanol unit amid a global glut for the sweetener and erratic fuel-pricing policies in the domestic market. In a statement, the U.S. agricultural commodities trader said it was postponing the initial public offering (IPO) of its Bunge Açúcar & Bioenergia unit due to adverse market conditions. Bunge filed last month to float its stake in the loss-making unit, which has struggled to reduce its 2.9 billion reais ($763 million) of debt with sugar prices languishing near multi-year lows. The latest setback was a dramatic reversal last month in how Brazil handles diesel pricing, following a truckers’ strike that paralyzed economic activity, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A price freeze and tax cuts stoked investor concerns Brazil would resume heavy fuel subsidies after less than a year of letting domestic prices track global markets. Over the past decade, gasoline and diesel subsidies in Brazil have undercut the profitability of sugarcane ethanol, which competes at pumps. Bunge’s Brazilian sugar and ethanol unit IPO had not been an easy deal to pull off even before the discussion on fuel subsidies.

2018-06-15,"June 15 (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp’s Columbia Gas Transmission (TCO) unit said it fixed a section of the Leach Xpress natural gas pipeline downstream of a pipe blast in West Virginia last week. That work enabled the Stagecoach-Leach Xpress meter in southeast Ohio to return to service late Thursday, according to a notice to customers. The Stagecoach meter in Monroe County on the Ohio-West Virginia border connects to EQT Midstream Partners LP’s Strike Force South gathering fields in Monroe and Belmont counties in Ohio. Strike Force can also deliver to Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Rover and Enbridge Inc’s Texas Eastern Transmission (Tetco) pipelines. Columbia Gas said all other meters affected by the blast will remain at zero until the pipeline returns to service. The company did not say when the full pipe would return to service, noting the site of the incident is in the restoration process. Columbia Gas told customers it will provide an update on the status of the pipe on June 18. The shutdown of Leach Xpress forced producers using the line to find other pipes to ship gas out of the Marcellus and Utica shale regions of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Alternative pipelines include ETP’s Rover, Tallgrass Energy Partners LP’s Rockies Express (REX), EQT Midstream Partners LP’s Equitrans and Enbridge’s Tetco, according to analysts at S&P Global Platts. Columbia Gas, which declared a force majeure after the blast, said the damaged section of pipe could affect movement of about 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd). One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Energy analysts said overall output in the Appalachian region was little changed by the blast as producers, like Range Resources Corp and Southwestern Energy Co, found other pipes to ship their gas. Appalachian output rose from 27.5 bcfd on June 7, the day of the blast, to 27.7 bcfd over the weekend before easing back to 27.5 bcfd on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters data. The 1.5-bcfd Leach Xpress in West Virginia and Ohio, which entered full service at the start of this year, transports Marcellus and Utica shale gas to consumers in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast. The 12,000-mile (19,312-km) Columbia pipeline system, which TransCanada acquired in 2016, serves millions of customers from New York to the Gulf of Mexico.

2018-06-15,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to host a leaders’ oil summit later this year for OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in a supply cut pact, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. Riyadh and Moscow took the first step in institutionalizing the long-term framework for co-operation between OPEC and non-OPEC nations this week, the sources said.  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. Russia and Saudi Arabia played the opening match of the soccer World Cup, which Russia is hosting. An OPEC source described the summit as an idea which would be developed into a proposal, and a second source said it would be discussed at next week’s meeting of energy ministers in Vienna, where the supply-limiting deal will be reviewed. OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers have been cutting output since January 2017 to get rid of excess supply.

2018-06-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cambridge University said it would keep investing in funds that hold shares in fossil fuel companies, despite public pressure from hundreds of its academics. One of the most eminent academic institutions in the world, Cambridge University has an endowment fund (CUEF) of just under 3 billion pounds, the vast majority of which is invested indirectly through funds. “Disengagement from any funds that have even small fossil fuel components, or that would require CUEF to step back from investments in alternative energy initiatives by global companies currently regarded as fossil fuel companies, would result in significant limitations on the CUEF’s ability to invest as successfully as in the past,” Cambridge said. Any weakening in the performance of the fund would mean less support to academic activities, it said late on Thursday, adding it had no direct investment in fossil fuel companies and wanted to avoid any direct investment in coal and tar sands, while keeping any indirect investment in those areas to a minimum. Last year, Cambridge’s principal governing body Regent House, including some 5,000 staff, voted in favour of full divestment from fossil fuels. In April, about 350 Cambridge academics signed a letter to the university and its colleges, which are largely independent from the university’s central administration and have their own investments, urging them to excise fossil fuel investments. Signatories included chemist David King, who was Britain’s Special Representative for Climate Change until last year after a seven-year stint as the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor. Shortly afterwards, BP (BP.L) Chief Executive Bob Dudley urged Cambridge University not to yield to pressure to cut its investments in fossil fuels and pointed to BP’s donations to the university.     Cambridge Zero Carbon Society, a divestment campaign group, has called for the resignations of members of the University finance office, including Finance Director David Hughes, who formerly worked for BG, now part of Shell (RDSa.L). “Our managers often talk about ‘risk management’ and the importance of avoiding ‘reputational damage’. It is hard to imagine a more risky, reputation-damaging moment in the history of the university,” Mary Laven, a history professor, said in a statement via the Zero Carbon Society. The world’s top oil and gas companies are facing rising pressure from investors to shift to cleaner energy and renewables in order to meet international targets to sharply reduce carbon emissions by the end of the century.

2018-06-15,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court ruled on Friday that investors pushing for damages over a sharp fall in Volkswagen shares after the carmaker disclosed emissions cheating in 2015 can also seek redress from majority shareholder Porsche SE. Investors from around the world have lodged lawsuits at a regional court in Braunschweig, seeking around 9 billion euros (£7.9 billion) in damages from Volkswagen, which they say did not inform shareholders quickly enough over its cheating of emissions tests in the United States. The lawsuit at the regional court in Braunschweig, near VW’s Wolfsburg headquarters, is led by investment firm Deka.  Due to procedural matters, the suit will now be extended to Porsche SE, the investment vehicle for the Porsche and Piech families that controls 52 percent of VW’s voting stock, a spokeswoman for the court said. “The third civil senate of the Higher Regional Court of Braunschweig today clarified that besides Volkswagen, Porsche Automobil Holding SE is also a defendant in the capital investor model procedure” pending at the court, the court said in a statement.  Lawyers for VW have said the carmaker had no obligation to disclose the possible financial damage of its emissions manipulations prior to Sept. 22, 2015 when it specified the implications of its use of illicit emissions-control software, because it believed the financial costs of the cheating would be insignificant. “This (move by the Braunschweig court) is giving investors another chance to submit further claims,” said Axel Wegner of law firm Tilp, which represents Deka Investment GmbH.    Deka lost money on its VW shares when they fell sharply after the emissions cheating but says the purpose of its legal action is to provide a test case - resolving generic or common issues for other related cases. However, unlike in a U.S. class action suit, this case does not have the legal effect of resolving all individual claims. Public hearings of the Braunschweig case are due to start in early September.

2018-06-15,"* Yemen’s war has exposed old divisions * Conflict is between unstable local coalitions * No guarantee a decisive battle in Hodeidah will bring peace By Angus McDowall BEIRUT, June 15 (Reuters) - The battle for the western Yemeni port of Hodeidah could be an important milestone in the three-year civil war. But analysts say the conflict is so complex that even a decisive outcome there might not bring peace. Why is Yemen so divided? Yemen’s internal splits have festered for years. North and south Yemen united into a single state in 1990, but separatists in the south tried to secede from the pro-union north in 1994. Their forces were swiftly beaten, and more power and resources flowed to the northern capital of Sanaa, angering many southerners. Former president Ali Abdullah Saleh had ruled north Yemen since 1978 and the unified state after 1990. But he alienated many Yemenis. His relatives controlled core parts of the army and economy, and critics said corruption was rife. In the far north, some of the Zaydi sect of Shi’ite Islam also chafed. Zaydis had ruled northern Yemen until the 1962 revolution, but their heartland was now impoverished. In the late 1990s, some Zaydis formed the Houthi group, which fought Yemen’s army and grew friendly with Iran. Though allied to Saleh, the Muslim Brotherhood and other Sunni Islamists were also gaining strength, particularly under General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who built a power base in the army. Taking advantage of factional rivalries, jihadist fugitives set up al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the group’s most powerful wings, and began staging attacks. How did ‘Arab Spring’ protests lead to war? When mass protests broke out in 2011, some of Saleh’s former allies turned on him. The army split between units loyal to Saleh and those who followed Ahmar. Separatists rallied in the south. The Houthis seized more areas. AQAP attacks increased. After a year of crisis, including a bombing that nearly killed Saleh, Yemen’s Gulf neighbours persuaded him to step down, but he stayed in Yemen. Deputy president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was elected in 2012 to a two-year term to oversee a democratic transition. A “National Dialogue” meeting of all Yemen’s opposing groups began hashing out a new constitution. But despite the dialogue, things were falling apart. Hadi was widely seen as weak and his administration corrupt. Saleh’s allies in the army and government undermined the transition. AQAP set up a mini-state and hit Sanaa with ever bloodier bombings. In 2014, the Houthis seized Sanaa with help from army units loyal to Saleh, forcing Hadi to share power. When the National Dialogue proposed a federal constitution, both Houthis and southern separatists rejected it for blunting their new-found sway. The Houthis arrested Hadi in early 2015, but he escaped and fled to Aden. The Houthis pursued him, battling loyalists of the transitional government. Days later, Saudi Arabia entered the war on Hadi’s side, backed by a coalition of Arab allies, to prevent Iran from gaining influence via the Houthis on its border and to preserve the Gulf-brokered transition. They plucked Hadi from Aden and took him to Riyadh, notionally preserving his internationally recognised government and the democratic transition plan. Why was there deadlock for so long? The crisis was now a war between two unstable coalitions. The Houthis and Saleh were old enemies jointly ruling the populous highlands and Red Sea coast. Hadi had no personal power base, but became a nominal figurehead for southern separatists, tribes in the northeast, Sunni Islamists and army remnants loyal to Ahmar. Internal rivalries even emerged in the coalition set up by Saudi Arabia to back Hadi. Riyadh and its main ally, the United Arab Emirates, differed over local allies and tactics. The Houthis and Saleh’s forces were driven from Aden and its environs in south Yemen, and from central Marib and the desert area to its east in 2015. Years of military stalemate followed. The Houthis held most of the easily defended highlands. They also held the flat Red Sea coast and its port of Hodeidah - the last entry point for supplying northern Yemen. The coalition kept up intense air strikes, aiming to split the Houthis and Saleh. They imposed a partial blockade to stop Iran arming the Houthis, something it denies doing. But despite this pressure, U.N.-backed talks went nowhere. How have internal divisions played out? Then, last year Saleh finally abandoned his Houthi allies, hoping to cut a deal and regain power for his family. But he was killed fleeing Sanaa in December, 2017. His loyalists turned on the Houthis, helping the advance towards Hodeidah that culminated in this week’s assault. Divisions widened on the other side too. The UAE supported separatists in the south who sometimes clashed with fighters backed by Saudi Arabia. In the north, the Saudis brought in Ahmar to command forces around Marib - a red flag for the UAE because of his connection to the Muslim Brotherhood, its biggest bugbear. Meanwhile, the death toll from air strikes and the near famine aggravated by the partial blockade prompted international outrage, making it harder for Gulf states’ key Western allies to maintain military aid. If the Hodeidah fighting lasts long, causing big coalition casualties and an outcry over a humanitarian catastrophe, the Houthis may hope the advance will fail. If the Houthis are driven out and lose all ability to keep supply lines open, they might lose the war. But there is no guarantee the victors could put aside their own divisions and build a real peace.

2018-06-15,"* Iran was India’s third biggest oil supplier * U.S. reimposes sanctions after quitting Iran deal * SBI wants to protect U.S. operations - source (Adds comments from SBI source, BPCL) By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, June 15 (Reuters) - India’s imports of Iranian oil may be hit from the end of August after the State Bank of India informed refiners it would not handle payments for the crude from November, the finance chief of Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said on Friday. The move by the state-controlled bank, India’s biggest, comes after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran last month, pledging to reimpose tough sanctions within 180 days. “(Oil) loading will be affected from end-August under the current mechanism unless a new payment route is established,” IOC’s A. K. Sharma told Reuters in a telephone interview on Friday. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably affecting the petroleum sector, after a 180-day period ending on Nov. 4. Although New Delhi had cut imports from Tehran in 2017/18 due to a dispute over a giant gas field, Iran remained its third-biggest oil supplier. Iran supplied about 458,000 barrels per day (bpd), or about a 10th of India’s more than 4.5 million bpd of imports, in the fiscal year to March 2018. SBI has written to the Indian refiners and the government that it would not be able to handle oil payments to Iran from Nov 4, an official at SBI said. “We have said that we cannot handle oil payments to Iran in any currency as that will have an immediate impact on our U.S. operations,” this source said. An SBI spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India’s refiners currently use SBI and Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to buy Iranian oil in euros, according to IOC and other companies. India, Iran’s top oil client after China, was one of the few nations that continued to trade with Tehran during a previous round of Western sanctions. The South Asian nation has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions, but companies and banks with links to the U.S. financial system could face penalties if they do not comply. Iran offers Indian refiners a 60-day credit period on oil sales, which means payment for cargoes loaded from the end of August will be due in November. Analysts feel Iran may have to offer more incentives to protect its oil sales to India. “Indians may ask Iran for more discount in exchange for early payment for oil purchases instead of a 60-day credit period,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil at consultancy FGE. Seeking to safeguard oil imports from Iran and scout for alternate payment avenues, an Indian delegation last week visited officials and bankers in France, Germany, Britain and Brussels, the base for the European Union. “That visit was only exploratory in nature ...we are still watching the situation,” Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Reuters this week. Apart from banks, shipping firms and insurance companies have already begun distancing themselves from Iran. IOC’s Sharma said his firm received very few responses to inquiries on hiring tankers to import Iranian oil. “Only NITC (National Iranian Oil Company) and a few others participated, “ he said, adding freight rates for transportation of Iranian oil have also gone up due to the threat of sanctions. IOC previously said it would look at buying oil from traditional suppliers mostly in the Middle East to compensate for any cut in supplies from Iran related to U.S. sanctions. Indian state-refiners previously drew up plans to almost double oil imports from Iran, which had offered deep discounts on shipping of crude. Officials at other state refiners Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum Corp confirmed receiving the SBI letter. Mumbai-based refiner Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, while Rosneft-promoted Nayara Energy has started cutting purchases from this month, sources previously told Reuters. BPCL’s head of refiners R. Ramachandran said there were other potential suppliers, including Canada and the United States or other Middle East states, that cold replace Iranian crude. “We hope suppliers like Iraq and Saudi Arabia will fill the gap,” he said. “We will get alternatives similar to Iranian oil but we will have to pay extra”.

2018-06-15,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Dozens of industrial plants in Russia have turned to the state’s reinsurance company for cover after an extension of U.S. sanctions made it difficult to get reinsurance elsewhere, the head of that firm told Reuters. The Russian National Reinsurance Company (RNRC) has signed the new contracts for dozens of industrial plants since new sanctions took effect in early April to cover risks including a halt in production or shipping, he said. Nikolay Galushin’s comments underscore the impact of fresh sanctions on the Russian economy as it chokes off access to regular reinsurance - a critical process that backstops insurance by sharing large risks. RNRC was set up chiefly to offer reinsurance to firms barred from using Western providers.  On April 6, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Russian magnate Oleg Deripaska and companies in which he is a large shareholder, including the world’s second-largest aluminum producer Rusal (0486.HK), in response to what it called “malign activities” by Russia.  The firms owned by billionaire Viktor Vekselberg were also sanctioned, as the United States responded to suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  “The insurance company which was covering these risks asked the foreign market (counterparts) where these risks were offloaded: are you with us or with the sanctions?” Galushin said.  “Basically, each single reinsurer said: we’ve pulled out, we can’t do it,” he said. Galushin did not name any companies whose risks RNRC has taken since April 6. Galushin said that previously such risks had been “almost entirely offloaded in the West”. “We have taken the risks of all who had pulled out,” he said.  Relations between Russia and the West have worsened after Moscow annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine.  Since then, a wide range of sanctions on companies, banks and individuals were imposed on Russia by the European Union, the United States and other Western nations. Washington suggested it might lift the sanctions against Rusal and its parent En+ if Deripaska cuts his En+ stake to below 50 percent and introduces independent board members.  The firms are set until mid-summer to come up with a plan to meet U.S. requirements to escape sanctions. “There are a couple of dozen industrial plants which are insuring their property, (potential) losses from stoppage in production, cargoes, liability etc,” Galushin said. Deripaska’s business empire includes insurer Ingosstrakh (INGSI.MM) as well as EuroSibEnergo. The U.S. Treasury gave Deripaska’s counterparts until Oct. 22 to wind down business with Rusal. Galushin said that the reinsurance liability limit on the single event on the “new (sanctioned) risks” exceeds 20 billion rubles ($320 million). RNRC’s capital is 21.3 billion rubles and it also has central bank guarantee worth 49.7 billion rubles. He said that the current capital was enough to cover for any potential payouts under the commercial contracts it has while in an event of a sanctioned company payout the central bank was ready to provide more funds.

2018-06-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors pulled more cash out of European and emerging markets in the past week, opting instead for U.S. stocks, as robust economic growth encouraged a sixth straight week of inflows, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday. The bank’s data, which tracks fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, references a period when investors braced for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s second interest rate rise of 2018 and awaited signals from the European Central Bank on its stimulus exit path. The ECB said on Thursday it would end bond buying this year but not raise rates until the second half of 2019. BAML said the week had seen $5.6 billion enter global equity funds, with U.S. stocks accounting for a $10.3 billion inflow and European equities losing $2.5 billion. Emerging stocks funds shed $1.3 billion and Japan suffered $400 million outflows. “It’s a game and world of two halves,” BAML analysts wrote in a reference to the football World Cup which started this week in Russia.  “U.S. decoupling from the rest of the world accelerating,” BAML said, noting that in the past six weeks $29 billion had flowed to U.S. stocks, contrasting with losses of $13 billion from European markets.  Emerging debt and equity redemptions now amount to $12 billion over the past seven weeks, the bank added. “The bigger picture is global QE is ending, with the United States the sole growth story.” Moreover, U.S. equities now stand just 3 percent off all-time highs, while euro zone and Chinese stocks languish around 30 percent off peaks, the note said. European equities have shed nearly $20 billion so far this year, fund flows data shows, and a pan-European equity index is barely in positive territory, hit by signs of a growth slowdown and also fears the United States will impose large import tariffs on goods such as autos and steel. U.S. markets meanwhile are benefiting from large tax cuts as well as the continued rally in technology shares. On bond markets, investors bought higher quality investment-grade debt for the fourth week in a row, putting in $900 million, while junk-rated debt witnessed their sixth week of outflows.

2018-06-15,"TOKYO, June 15 (Reuters) - Japanese nuclear operators want to curb stockpiles of plutonium extracted from spent nuclear fuel by using them as feedstock for reactors, the industry’s top official said on Friday. He was responding to a media report that the United States has called on Tokyo to reduce its mounting stockpiles. The Nikkei business daily, citing unidentified sources familiar with the matter, reported on Sunday that the U.S. Department of State and the National Security Council had requested that Japan trim its stockpiles ahead of an extension next month of a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement. Japan is also the only nation without atomic weapons to have significant amounts of plutonium, which has led to constant criticism from neighbouring countries, scientists and others. The chairman of the Japanese power utilities’ federation, Satoru Katsuno, who is also president of Chubu Electric Power , said he was not aware of such diplomatic discussions and added that Japanese utilities had not received any request from the Japanese government to set an upper limit on plutonium stockpiles. “Under the principle of not having plutonium with no purpose for usage, we are trying to carry out MOX (mixed oxide) fuel usage at reactors promptly. We will continue to try to curb plutonium stockpiles,” he said during his monthly news conference in Tokyo. Chubu Electric wants to use its plutonium stockpiles as fuel for its Hamaoka No.4 reactor, which has been shut pending rigorous safety checks imposed after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, he said. With most of Japan’s commercial reactors still shut down in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the stockpiles have been gradually building up. At the end of 2016, Japan had 46.9 tonnes of plutonium, including 9.8 tonnes domestically and the rest held in reprocessing facilities in Britain and France under contracts with Japanese nuclear operators, according to the latest available data from the Cabinet Office. Japan says it has firmly maintained the principle of not owning plutonium whose use is unspecified and of putting all nuclear materials under the International Atomic Energy Agency’s safeguards, in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Only a limited number of reactors in Japan can use MOX in reactors, but the use of MOX - a blend of uranium and plutonium recycled from spent nuclear fuel - in conventional commercial reactors is a pillar of resource-poor Japan’s energy policy.

The MSCI All Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent in morning trade in Europe and set for a weekly loss. Wall Street was set to open lower. U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to impose “pretty significant” tariffs and will announce a list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods on Friday, and a second wave of products worth $100 billion has been cued up. Beijing vowed it would strike back quickly if its interests were hurt. The outbreak of a global trade war has been the most frequently cited ‘biggest tail risk’ by investors this year in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey of global fund managers, on the back of ramped up protectionist rhetoric and measures by the U.S. administration. It is not clear when Trump will activate the measures, but rising Sino-U.S. trade tensions will put more pressure on China’s economy, which is starting to show signs of cooling after a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said that in the context of trade flows, the sum of goods targeted was small. “The big question is do we fall into tit for tat? What’s the response going to be from China and the EU? Can it remain at a technical level or will we see a series of high-profile failing conversations between Mr Trump and other leaders?” “That may not affect GDP growth all that much in the short term, but it will have a noticeable impact on cross-border capital flows and business sentiment,” Milligan said. The Asia Pacific MSCI index ex-Japan edged down 0.3 percent and was set for a weekly loss of more than 1 percent. Many markets in Asia were closed on Friday for holidays celebrating the end of Ramadan. Chinese stocks led the losses, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite index plumbing a 20-month low, as investors worried about the economic damage from the trade tensions with the United State. Japan’s Nikkei average closed up 0.5 percent and Australian shares ended 1.3 percent higher. European shares were set for their best week in more than three months as investors pushed back expectations for an interest rate increase after Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.4 percent, as a recovering euro weighed. Both stocks and the euro dipped briefly on a report said Germany’s Christian Social Union party would dissolve its alliance with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. They recovered after the report was denied, and found to be a hoax. The single currency was headed for its worst weekly loss in 19 months after the ECB on Thursday signalled interest rates would be left at record lows into at least mid-2019. The currency had shed 1.9 percent to the dollar, its biggest daily decline since Britain voted to quit the EU in 2016. The overall weakness in the euro gave a lift to the dollar, which hit its highest against a basket of currencies since November 2017. “I think the biggest concern at the moment, more than talk about trade, is the tightening of monetary conditions in emerging markets caused by a stronger dollar,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London, noting the Federal Reserve’s forecast for a total of four interest rate rises in 2018. While the Federal Reserve and the ECB provided much of the week’s central bank fireworks, the Bank of Japan produced no surprises at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Friday and looked set to continue its asset purchases for some time. Boosted by the ECB’s announcement and positive comments on the euro from politicians in Rome, Italy’s government bonds were on course for best week since Mario’s Draghi’s “whatever it takes” Outright Monetary Transactions programme was created in September 2012.

2018-06-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s energy minister will meet with companies on Wednesday to discuss the potential construction of offshore floating wind farms, he told Reuters on Friday. The meeting is the first concrete step to spur development of offshore floating power generation, after the government said last December it would seek to accommodate such plans. “Wednesday next week I will have a meeting with different stakeholders in offshore wind and discuss both the opening process and the regulatory framework,” Terje Soeviknes said. Unlike offshore wind turbines that are fixed to the seabed, floating wind parks are seen as potentially more feasible for use in deeper waters. The minister didn’t name any firms, but Norway’s Equinor, which recently changed its name from Statoil to increase its focus in renewable energy, has said it will take part in the country’s first such tender if there are subsidies. The company said in May it expected about 13 gigawatt (GW) of floating offshore wind to be installed globally by 2030 and aimed to take “a fair share” of that. Equinor is also the owner of the world’s first floating offshore wind farm project, a 30 megawatt farm called Hywind off the coast of Scotland, and is already maturing a project in Norway to combine floating wind with oil platforms. Norway’s energy minister expected to conclude the discussions within a few months. “By autumn I hope we will have a proposal. Perhaps we need to go through the parliament with this,” he said. Norway is western Europe’s top producer of oil and natural gas, and has so far lagged Nordic neighbors Denmark and Sweden in wind power developments.

State-controlled PetroChina expects June loadings from Venezuela, mainly the Merey grade, to be half the normal rates, according to two Beijing-based oil officials briefed on the matter. Venezuela’s state firm PDVSA has promised the lost volume would be topped up in July loadings for arrival in August-September, they said. The plunge in supplies to Venezuela’s most important customer, creditor and political ally is the latest indicator of tough times for the cash-strapped country with the world’s largest oil reserves. Crude output fell to the lowest annual average in over three decades between January and April, while claims on assets by creditors have cut off PDVSA’s access to export terminals. The slide cuts both ways. China’s growing thirst for oil amid still-sturdy economic growth is increasing its reliance on imports, while Venezuela’s trouble exporting as its infrastructure crumbles means it’s missing out on crude oil prices that have risen to their highest in years. “One of the best things about Venezuelan oil was its stable volumes for all these years and competitive prices,” said one senior oil industry official with direct knowledge of the supply situation. “But now they seem in very bad shape, not having the money to upgrade port facilities, no money even to remove the high water content in crude oil.” The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorised to discuss the matter with media. Only one supertanker, the “New Pearl” carrying 2 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, is set to arrive in China’s eastern province of Shandong in July, down from this year’s monthly peak of 11 million barrels in March, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon trade flows data. That would be the lowest monthly import volume since late 2010, according to Chinese customs data C-IMP-VECN-MTH. PetroChina said it does not comment on market speculation. PDVSA did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Disruptions in Venezuelan crude supplies to China started in April, and from mid-May through early June PDVSA did not load any crude for PetroChina, said the senior oil official. The Chinese firm lifted an average of around 20 million tonnes a year - or 400,000 barrels a day - in 2016 and 2017 of Venezuelan crude oil under a government-to-government loan-for-oil programme. “Venezuela remains the biggest and most visible casualty of the (oil) market share war,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets led by Helima Croft said in a note on Thursday. “We see almost no prospect of a turnaround in the Venezuelan story this year, at least barring a change in government, and even if the country comes under new management, it will still take a considerable amount of time and international assistance to right the ship and restore production.” PDVSA has halted operations at units that convert extra-heavy oil into exportable crude. Early this month it asked customers to transfer oil at sea to clear a backlog of tankers waiting to load at its ports. The Venezuelan firm has notified PetroChina of the new ship-to-ship requirement and agreed also to bear the additional cost, according to another industry executive with knowledge of the matter. One trader with an independent Chinese refiner said he was still receiving offers of Venezuelan oil for August delivery at stable prices compared with a month ago, but added that the supply outlook is murky. “There isn’t a lot of cheap heavy crude (available) so some Chinese refineries might have to change diet a bit,” he said. Sengyick Tee, a Beijing-based consultant at SIA Energy, said Chinese independents have increased imports of other heavy crude grades such as Castilla from Colombia and fuel oil as replacement. Venezuela was the eighth-largest crude supplier to China last year, with 435,400 barrels per day (bpd), behind Brazil, according to China customs data. But it already dropped to the ninth position in the first quarter of this year with an average volume of 381,300 bpd as China ramped up imports from Iraq, Kuwait and Brazil. Venezuelan crude exports to India have also dropped 20 percent in the first five months to 323,600 bpd, according to data from shipping and industry sources. Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy, key Venezuelan crude buyers, have stepped up imports of similar-quality oil from Brazil, Mexico, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Chad for replacement, data showed.

2018-06-15,"LONDON, June 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With dusty desert sprawled across the region, Middle Eastern and north African nations must prepare better for drought as water shortages look set to worsen, the United Nations said on Friday. Over the past 40 years, droughts have become longer and more frequent in the region, where fresh water resources are among the world’s lowest, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). That will likely worsen due to climate change, it added. The region must move away from simply responding to the effects of drought, and instead, implement robust plans that prepare for the worst, it said. “We need to perceive and manage droughts differently, and shift from emergency response to more proactive policy and long-term planning to reduce risks and build greater resilience,” Rene Castro, deputy head at FAO’s climate office, said in a statement. The report recommended growing crops that need less water, using more water-efficient irrigation systems, or lowering the amount of livestock to prevent over-grazing. Some villages in southwest Morocco on the edge of the Sahara desert have also been using a fog collection project to turn mist into water to tackle water shortages. Swelling populations and food demands, combined with even scarcer water and land resources, could lead to a doubling of food prices and trigger civil unrest in some developing countries, the United Nations has said. Water scarcity already affects more than 40 percent of the world’s population, according to the U.N.’s 2018 World Water Development Report. That number is expected to rise due to global warming, with one in four people projected to face chronic or recurring shortages by 2050, it added.

Spreadbetters expected a slightly better tone in European equities, forecasting a higher open for Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC. U.S. President Donald Trump has made up his mind to impose “pretty significant” tariffs and will unveil a list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods on Friday, an administration official said. Beijing has warned that it was ready to respond. While it is not clear when Trump will activate the measures, rising Sino-U.S. trade tensions will put additional pressure on China’s economy, which is starting to show signs of cooling under the weight of a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending. Analysts said that although the expected announcement would likely not be a total surprise to markets - an initial list was released by Washington a few months ago - it would still make investors concerned that the window for averting a trade war may be closing. The Asia Pacific MSCI index ex-Japan edged down 0.3 percent and was set for more than a 1 percent weekly loss, with many regional markets shrugging off a strong close on Wall Street. China stocks led the losses, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite index plumbing a 20-month low, as investors worried about the negative economic impact arising from the trade tensions with the United State. Japan’s Nikkei average and Australian shares closed up 0.5 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. “The implementation of tariffs on China is one of several fronts that the U.S. is battling on the issue of trade,” said Tai Hui, chief APAC market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, referring to the Trump administration’s tough stance toward Canada and Europe. “This battleground could potentially expand into the auto sector given the U.S. investigation into auto imports. This is likely to weigh on market sentiment over the summer.” The euro was headed for its worst weekly loss in 19 months after the ECB signalled on Thursday it will keep interest rates at record lows into at least mid-2019, even as it pledged to end its massive bond purchase scheme by the end of this year. The common currency shed 1.9 percent to the dollar after the rate comments, in its sharpest daily fall in almost two years since Brexit vote shock in 2016. In late Asian trade on Friday, the euro eased 0.2 percent to $1.1546, its lowest level since May 30. The dollar index against a basket of six major peers rose 0.3 percent to 95.111, its highest level since November, after rallying more than 1 percent the previous day. The 10-year German bund yield also fell to 0.424 percent from around 0.50 percent before the ECB statement. “The ECB has made it clear that it does not want quick rate hikes, although it now considers progress towards the inflation target as ‘substantial’. Against the background of uncertainties in the world today – such as trade – this makes sense, as does the emphasis on data dependency,” said Stefan Kreuzkamp, chief investment officer at DWS. On Wall Street, two of the three main indexes closed higher, with technology stocks leading the charge on the benchmark S&P 500. Helping boost U.S. equities was a Commerce Department report showing retail sales rose more than expected in May, the latest indication of an acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter. While the Fed and the ECB provided much of the week’s central bank fireworks, the Bank of Japan produced no surprises at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Friday and looked set to continue its massive asset buying programme for some time. Markets are now tracking BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s post-meeting briefing, which began at 0630 GMT, for clues on how long the central bank could hold off on whittling down stimulus given stubbornly weak inflation. Oil prices were little changed as investors eyed a key OPEC meeting in Vienna. Saudi Arabia and Russia, architects of a producer deal to cut output, have indicated they want production to rise.

2018-06-15,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s independent oil refiners are suffering a drastic change of fortune as new tax rules, shrinking diesel demand and higher crude prices threaten their nearly three-year profit bonanza.  Industry executives and analysts said nearly 40 private refiners, often called “teapots” - which account for a fifth of  China’s almost 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in crude oil imports - are losing money and market share. Several have shut for maintenance to cut exposure to the market, and some teapots may have to shut for good if the conditions continue.  “The gains in retail prices at pumps in recent weeks have been completely wiped out by higher costs of crude and a hefty consumption tax,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.  “We expect much weaker margins in June and July as more orders booked at peak crude prices arrive,” Gao said.  Asian refining margins have thinned as crude prices LCOc1 surged amid output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Venezuela supply disruptions and looming U.S. sanctions against major exporter Iran.  But China’s independents have also been hit hard by new tax rules that cut even further into their profit. Last month, teapots lost 300 yuan ($46.80) per ton of crude oil processed, data provided by Zibo Longzong Information Group showed.  That is a stunning reversal from a profit of 900 yuan a ton in early 2016.  Beijing enacted new rules in March to enforce collection of a $38 per barrel gasoline consumption tax and a $29 per barrel tax on diesel, a response to the alleged use of illicit fuel invoices by many of the teapots to evade the taxes.  The teapots’ plight throws into sharp relief the performances of their state rivals, including top refiners PetroChina (601857.SS) and Sinopec (600028.SS), where 2018 profits so far are running at their best in two or more years.  State refiners have to pay the consumption tax as well, but  their massive local marketing networks and control of China’s fuel exports help to offset the domestic market pressures.  To view a graphic on China diesel & gasoline exports, click: reut.rs/2yc8UF2 The teapots’ influence and size has grown significantly since they began winning crude import licenses in 2015. Last year was a blockbuster, as they churned out record earnings, expanded into petrochemicals and beefed up trading teams.  This year, in contrast, has been one of deepening trouble, with several teapots shutting for maintenance to avoid losses. Jincheng Petrochemical Co launched a month of maintenance in May at its 5.9 million-tonne-per-year (118,000 bpd) refinery, after losing money on rising crude prices since late March, said a marketing manager with the refinery, declining to be named due to company policy.  At an oil trade show late last month in Dongying in Shandong province, home to many teapots, sales managers from more than 20 independents were jostling about trying to sell fuel to major trading firms, state refiners and other teapots.  Several, including Wudi Xinyue Fuel and Chemicals Co and Fuhai Group, plan to keep product inventories low, fearing that domestic oversupply could further dampen fuel prices, according to interviews with sales managers at the trade show.  “We barely keep any inventory for diesel and gasoline. There are more uncertainties in the market with more refineries coming online this year,” said an executive with a teapot in Dongying.  Others like the Haike Group were retreating from the northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, where last year’s strong sales were not repeating. Haike is instead focusing on areas around Shandong in the east, an executive with the group said.  To view a graphic on China's monthly gasoline and diesel demand, click: reut.rs/2JMKljc State refiners have access to a surging export market, and dominate China’s retail fuel market, making it easier for them to pass higher crude costs and tax burdens on to consumers.  Teapots, however, have to offer more competitive prices and their margins are much thinner.  Several independent refiners, including Shandong Zhonghai Fine Chemical Group, Guangrao Kelida Petrochemicals Technology and ChemChina’s Huaxing Petrochemical, said PetroChina and Sinopec were paying for products only at steep discounts to market values and were also reducing purchases.  A manager at Kelida, a major supplier of asphalt to PetroChina, said his firm was now struggling to break even compared with a 400 yuan a tonne profit last year.  “Wholesale prices offered by PetroChina are so cheap that we will be running at a loss,” the manager said, declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media.  Zhonghai Fine Chemical, with 2.3 million tonnes a year in crude processing capacity, said Sinopec was ordering far less fuel than last year.  “Sinopec has halted buying diesel from us this year. Last year the volume was at least 10,000 tonnes each month,” a manager said, also declining to be named.  Teapot managers said they are urging the government to give them leeway in paying the consumption taxes.  “We urged the government to reconsider the tax policies. Otherwise some of us are going to fail,” said a manager with ChemChina Huaxing refinery.  Sinopec declined to comment on its purchase plans, and PetroChina did not respond to inquiries.

2018-06-15,"* Some biomass, waste-to-energy plants ineligible for support * Finance ministry trying to resolve huge subsidy backlog * Grids can now pass renewable connection costs on to customers (Adds background) SHANGHAI, June 15 (Reuters) - Some Chinese biomass and waste-to-energy plants will no longer be eligible for renewable energy subsidies, the country’s finance ministry said on Friday, as it bids to resolve a huge payment backlog. The Ministry of Finance has been struggling to find the funds to pay a subsidy backlog now amounting to an estimated 120 billion yuan ($18.7 billion), following a rapid surge in solar and wind capacity. The ministry said in a notice that biomass and waste-to-energy plants, including “co-fired plants” that burn a mixture of coal, forest waste and household refuse, would no longer be entitled to financial support. The move follows a decision earlier this month to cut subsidies for new solar power plants this year and also restrict the number of new projects. China has sought to phase out subsidies for renewable projects, but it has promised to replace them with more direct policy support. It aims to give clean energy plants priority access to the grid, and will also introduce a mandatory renewable quota system later this year. Grid firms have been accused of failing to meet their legal obligation to buy all the renewable power available in their jurisdiction, preferring instead to source cheaper coal-fired power. The finance ministry also said on Friday that it would now allow grid companies to pass on some renewable energy connection costs to customers.

2018-06-15,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - After spending a decade and billions of dollars developing Australia’s vast gas reserves, U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp and local firm Woodside Petroleum are at odds over the pace and timing of the next leg of expansion. Shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have become one of Australia’s biggest exports and a key source of revenue for many energy majors, so any hurdles in the sector’s development could strike a substantial blow. The issue comes down to how quickly to build a shared infrastructure system that would include a major trunk pipeline for transporting gas from mammoth new offshore fields owned by various companies in northwest Australia.  Woodside (WPL.AX) wants to take the lead in such a project, pushing to build soon so it can go ahead with its $11 billion Scarborough development, the only new gas field in the region that is primed for a final investment decision by 2020. But Chevron (CVX.N) would prefer to spend more time planning and building such a system, which it says could be led by it or other companies. “I don’t think there are any showstoppers in changing ... to a more shared infrastructure model,” Chevron’s Asia Pacific exploration and production president, Stephen Green, said in a group interview. “It’s just getting the alignment of all the different parties that want to participate in that value chain and coming up with the structure that satisfies each party’s needs.” Firms with stakes in the region’s gas fields, including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), BP (BP.L) and BHP Billiton (BHP.AX)BLT.L, will need to decide which option to pursue within the next 18 months to ensure untapped reserves are available ahead of a supply shortfall that some industry analysts see emerging from around 2022. Putting pressure on his peers, Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said last month that any rival would need to negotiate with him by September to get their gas into an infrastructure system led by Woodside. “They really need to get to us in the third quarter and be very serious about what they’re doing, because that window will close,” he said at an investor briefing.    Chevron has not put a cost estimate on its infrastructure plan, saying it depends on how big any trunkline is and how many fields it connects to. Woodside has not given an exact estimate of costs for a shared project that it would lead. “Talk of collaboration is good rhetoric, but there are an awful lot of moving parts,” said Wood Mackenzie analyst Saul Kavonic. BHP and BP declined to comment. Shell declined to comment except to reiterate that its Australian head, Zoe Yujnovich, has called for “greater cooperation between ventures to reduce waste and duplication”. Chevron and Woodside are key in Australia’s LNG sector as they operate the four LNG plants in Western Australia, and between them have a total of more than 60 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of undeveloped gas resources in the region’s offshore Carnarvon and Browse basins. To view a map on Gas fields around Woodside's Pluto, Scarborough fields, click: reut.rs/2Jtq3iA Until now, all 10 of Australia’s LNG developments have been built as megaprojects, with the owners constructing pipelines and LNG plants dedicated to their own fields. Critics say that has wasted huge amounts of money as infrastructure has been duplicated, helping push total development costs to an eye-watering $200 billion. Burnt by a cost of $54 billion in developing its huge Gorgon project off Australia’s northwest coast, Chevron wants to change strategy. “It’s our view that that’s not the most cost efficient ... way to see resources developed across a large, prolific basin like the Carnarvon,” said Chevron’s Green. Cost control is key in a competitive industry in which Australia and Qatar vie for position as the world’s biggest producers and in which major new output is seen coming online in places such as the United States, Canada, East Africa and Southeast Asia. After years of sky-high LNG prices prior to 2014, when Asian spot cargoes sold for $20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), prices are languishing at half of that. And the fate of the biggest undeveloped gas resource off Western Australia, the Browse project, where Woodside is operator, will likely remain in limbo until a common infrastructure is built. But both Coleman and Green expect each other’s companies to come around eventually. “I absolutely am confident we’ll work things out,” Green said, noting that Chevron and Woodside have long been partners in energy projects. And the possibility of Chevron or Woodside buying out additional stakes in the region’s gas fields and LNG projects could help align interests better to speed up a resolution.    “M&A can play a key role in helping to create alignment across the joint ventures,” said Wood Mackenzie’s Kavonic.

2018-06-15,"MELBOURNE, June 15 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has started producing liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the second unit of its $34 billion Wheatstone development, marking the completion of its two megaprojects in Australia after cost-blowouts and delays. Wheatstone Train 2 is the last of five LNG production units built by Chevron in the state of Western Australia over the past decade at a combined cost of $88 billion. “With the Chevron-operated Wheatstone and Gorgon LNG facilities now operational, we are delivering a significant new source of energy for customers in the region,” Chevron Australia Managing Director Nigel Hearne said in a statement on Friday. Wheatstone LNG, with a total capacity of 8.9 million tonnes a year, is the eighth LNG project to be completed in Australia. That puts the nation on track to challenge Qatar as the world’s biggest LNG exporter when the two remaining ongoing projects - Inpex Corp’s Ichthys and Royal Dutch Shell’s Prelude floating LNG - are finished. At full capacity, Wheatstone is expected to make up about 6 percent of the Asia Pacific region’s LNG production, Chevron said. The first cargo from Wheatstone was shipped from Train 1 in October, 2017, a few months behind target, following hiccups in the start-up of Chevron’s $54 billion Gorgon project, which slowed work on Wheatstone. Its partners in Wheatstone are Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC), Australia’s Woodside Petroleum , Kyushu Electric Power Co, and a joint venture part-owned by the world’s top LNG buyer, Japan’s JERA . For Woodside, Wheatstone’s ramp up is key to achieving targeted annual production of around 100 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2020. Reporting by Sonali Paul

2018-06-15,"* ECB pledges to keep rates at least until mid-2019; euro dives * Trump to impose $50 bln tariffs on China; China vows to confront * BOJ stands pat as expected, Kuroda press conference coming up By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, June 15 (Reuters) - Asian shares wobbled on Friday as investors braced for U.S. tariffs against China, while the euro flirted with two-week lows after a cautious European Central Bank indicated it would not raise interest rates for some time. U.S. President Donald Trump has made up his mind to impose “pretty significant” tariffs and will unveil a list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods on Friday, an administration official said. Beijing has warned that it was ready to respond. While it is not clear when Trump will activate the measures, rising Sino-U.S. trade tensions will put additional pressure on China’s economy, which is starting to show signs of cooling under the weight of a multi-year crackdown on riskier lending. Analysts said that although the expected announcement would likely not be a total surprise to markets — an initial list was released by Washington a few months ago — it would still make investors concerned that the window for averting a trade war may be closing. The Asia Pacific MSCI index ex-Japan edged down 0.3 percent, with many regional markets shrugging off a strong close on Wall Street. But Japan’s Nikkei average and Australian shares advanced 0.3 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. “The implementation of tariffs on China is one of several fronts that the U.S. is battling on the issue of trade,” said Tai Hui, chief APAC market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, referring to the Trump administration’s tough stance toward Canada and Europe. “This battleground could potentially expand into the auto sector given the U.S. investigation into auto imports. This is likely to weigh on market sentiment over the summer.” The euro was headed for its worst weekly loss in 19 months after the ECB signalled on Thursday it will keep interest rates at record lows into at least mid-2019, even as it pledged to end its massive bond purchase scheme by the end of this year. The common currency shed 1.9 percent to the dollar after the rate comments, in its sharpest daily fall in almost two years since Brexit vote shock in 2016. In Asian trade on Friday, the euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.1555, its lowest level since May 30. The dollar index against a basket of six major peers gained about 0.2 percent to 94.996, its highest level in 2-1/2-weeks, after rallying more than 1 percent the previous day. The 10-year German bund yield also fell to 0.424 percent from around 0.50 percent before the ECB statement. “The ECB has made it clear that it does not want quick rate hikes, although it now considers progress towards the inflation target as ‘substantial’. Against the background of uncertainties in the world today – such as trade – this makes sense, as does the emphasis on data dependency,” said Stefan Kreuzkamp, chief investment officer at DWS. On Wall Street, two of the three main indexes closed higher, with technology stocks leading the charge on the benchmark S&P 500. Helping boost U.S. equities was a Commerce Department report showing retail sales rose more than expected in May, the latest indication of an acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter. While the Fed and the ECB provided much of the week’s central bank fireworks, the Bank of Japan produced no surprises at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Friday and looked set to continue its massive asset buying programme for some time. Markets are on the lookout for clues from BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s post-meeting briefing at 0630 GMT on how long the central bank could hold off on whittling down stimulus given stubbornly weak inflation. Oil prices were little changed as investors eyed a key OPEC meeting in Vienna. Saudi Arabia and Russia, architects of a producer deal to cut output, have indicated they want production to rise. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were up 0.1 percent at $66.93 per barrel, while Brent was down 0.1 percent at $75.87.

SoftBank and the Indian government are expected to reach a formal agreement soon after final arrangements are made, the report said without naming its sources. The company is expected to make the investment through a fund backed by Saudi Arabia’s government, NHK said. Saudi Arabia is the largest investor in SoftBank’s Vision Fund, which raised over $93 billion last year.  A SoftBank spokesman declined to comment.  In 2015 SoftBank pledged to invest $20 billion in Indian solar projects with a goal of generating 20 gigawatts (GW) of energy as the majority partner in a joint venture with India’s Bharti Enterprises and Taiwan’s Foxconn (2354.TW). Last month SoftBank secured 200 megawatts of solar capacity at an auction in the southwestern state of Karnataka. In April it teamed up with China’s GCL System Integration Technology Co Ltd 002506.SZ on a $930 million Indian solar energy venture. India has set a target to achieve an operational solar power capacity of 100 GW by 2022, five times current levels, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s renewable energy strategy.  SoftBank’s Vision Fund has exposure to solar energy through its investment in the world’s largest such project in Saudi Arabia announced in March.

2018-06-15,"(Repeats June 14 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Mo4xts By John Kemp LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - Growth in global oil consumption has accelerated significantly since prices slumped in 2014 – highlighting the critical role demand plays in balancing the market. Lower oil prices stimulated OECD consumption between 2015 and 2017 and played a big role in eliminating the global oil market surplus during the rebalancing phase of the cycle. With oil prices up 70 percent over the last 12 months, however, higher prices are set to moderate OECD consumption and thereby global demand growth in 2018/19. Economists often observe that the price-elasticity of oil demand is low, meaning a small change in prices does not have much impact on the amount consumed in the short term. But low impact does not mean no impact. In the case of a large and sustained change, such as occurred in 2014/15, consumption has proved significantly flexible and plays a key role in rebalancing the market. According to the latest estimates from BP, global consumption increased by almost 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2018). Consumption has risen by an average of 1.7 million bpd in the last three years since oil prices slumped (2015-2017) compared with an average of just 1.1 million bpd in the three previous years (2012-2014). Real crude oil prices averaged $51 per barrel between 2015 and 2017, down from $112 between 2012 and 2014, according to BP. Lower oil prices have helped stimulate faster consumption growth, especially in the industrialised countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (tmsnrt.rs/2Mo4xts). OECD consumption rose by an average of 580,000 bpd in 2015-2017 compared with an average decline of 280,000 bpd in 2012-2014. By contrast, growth in the non-OECD economies slowed slightly, to an average annual rate of 1.2 million bpd from 1.4 million bpd earlier. Faster growth in the OECD economies has accounted for all the acceleration in global fuel consumption since the slump. The BP data underscores the important role that oil price and consumption changes in the advanced economies play in balancing the market. Consumption in the rapidly developing non-OECD economies tends to be more strongly influenced by incomes and economic growth. In the more mature OECD economies, however, consumption is more strongly influenced by large and sustained price changes. Non-OECD economies now account for the majority of global oil consumption (51 million bpd) compared with the OECD countries (47 million bpd). Non-OECD economies also accounted for all consumption growth over the last ten years (+14 million bpd) while OECD consumption fell (-3 million bpd). Even in the most recent three-year period, non-OECD use rose much faster (+3.5 million bpd) than in the OECD (+1.7 million bpd). Non-OECD countries’ strongly rising oil demand linked to their economic development has been the principal driver of increasing oil consumption at global level. But on a year-to-year basis, consumption changes in the more price-sensitive OECD have played a critical role in stimulating or moderating the growth rate. In other words, the non-OECD economies are responsible for the overall rising trend in consumption but the non-OECD economies are significantly responsible for year-to-year variations in growth around that trend. OECD oil consumption may now account for a minority of global demand, and the annual changes may be relatively small, but they still play a critical role in market balancing. The impact is clear in consumption statistics at national level, especially for the United States, where low levels of taxation ensure changes in crude prices have a big impact on the final cost of fuels to consumers. U.S. gasoline consumption increased by an annual average of 133,000 bpd in 2015-2017 compared with an average of just 56,000 bpd in 2012-2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Consumption growth was especially pronounced in 2015 (+257,000 bpd) and 2016 (+139,000 bpd) when prices were low, compared with the much higher-priced 2011 (-240,000 bpd) and 2012 (-71,000 bpd). The EIA currently predicts U.S. gasoline consumption will increase by just 20,000 bpd in 2018 and 40,000 bpd in 2019 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, June 2018).

2018-06-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose more than a penny against a basket of major currencies as the euro cratered, and U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday, as the European Central Bank signaled interest rate hikes were a long way off. The bank’s unexpectedly dovish decision overshadowed its statement that it aimed to wrap up its crisis-era stimulus program at the end of this year. The ECB now plans to reduce monthly asset purchases between October and December to 15 billion euros until the end of 2018 and then conclude the program. Investors, though, seized on comments indicating that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019, and some analysts believed it may be longer, with ECB President Mario Draghi’s term due to expire at the end of October 2019.  The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday decided to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point, creating “a widening rate differential between the U.S. and Europe, and the dollar is the beneficiary,” said Ed Egilinsky, head of alternative investments at Direxion in New York. The euro EUR= marked its steepest one-day drop against the U.S. dollar since June 2016, and was down 1.75 percent at $1.1583.  The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against six other top currencies, rose 1.17 percent. Ten-year government bond yields in Germany, the euro zone benchmark, fell around 6 basis points to 0.422 percent compared with Wednesday’s close DE10YT=RR. Oil markets, pressured by the strengthening dollar and fears that OPEC countries could decide to increase output at a meeting next week, ended mixed.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 settled at $66.89 per barrel, up 0.38 percent, while Brent LCOc1  went the other way, settling down more than 1 percent at $75.94.  “The independent show of WTI strength is merely a catchup process to the higher priced products and Brent values,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Benefiting from the euro zone dovishness: stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Two of Wall Street’s three main indexes closed in the black, with technology stocks leading the charge on the benchmark S&P 500. Helping boost stateside equities was a Commerce Department report showing retail sales rose 0.8 percent last month, the biggest advance since November 2017. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 25.89 points, or 0.1 percent, to 25,175.31, but the S&P .SPX gained 6.86 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,782.49 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 65.34 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,761.04. The ECB decision sent the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 up 1.25 percent, buoyed by big gains in interest rate-sensitive sectors like autos and utilities. In U.S. Treasuries, benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 12/32 in price to yield 2.9351 percent, from 2.979 percent late on Wednesday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 30/32 in price to yield 3.0545 percent, from 3.102 percent on Wednesday.

2018-06-15,"(Adds detail, background) * May Iranian crude imports lowest since Jan 2016 at 758,903 T * Imports from Iran in May drop nearly 26 percent from year ago * Jan-May oil imports from Iran fall 33 pct to 5.45 mln T y/y * May total crude imports up 2.5 pct to 12.69 mln T on-year By Jane Chung SEOUL, June 15 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Iranian crude oil imports fell in May to their lowest since January 2016 as South Korean buyers sought to reduce purchases of Iranian oil amid new U.S. sanctions on Iran. In May, South Korea imported 758,903 tonnes of Iranian crude, or 179,444 barrels per day (bpd), versus 1.02 million tonnes last year, customs data showed on Friday. That was the lowest since January 2016 when South Korea imported 859,223 tonnes. South Korea, the world’s fifth biggest crude importer, mainly buys an ultra-light oil known as condensate from Iran, however its intake of Iranian oil has been on the decline in recent months with the start of a new condensate splitter in Iran and lower production. Against this backdrop, U.S. President Donald Trump said in early May that the United States would walk away from an international nuclear deal with Iran and impose renewed U.S. economic sanctions on Tehran, sparking concerns about buying Iranian oil. South Korea said it would seek exemptions from the United States following the U.S. move. South Korea had previously managed to get a waiver on U.S. sanctions by curtailing its oil imports from Iran For the first five months, South Korea’s oil imports from Iran fell 33 percent to 5.45 million tonnes, or 264,369 bpd, compared with 8.12 million tonnes in the same period last year, according to the customs data. Overall, South Korea’s total May crude imports were 12.69 million tonnes, or roughly 3 million bpd, up 2.5 percent from 12.38 million tonnes last year. Crude imports from Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top crude supplier, fell 23.6 percent to 3.23 million tonnes, or 763,620 bpd, year-on-year. On the other hand, South Korea’s imports of U.S. crude in May showed a nearly three-fold increase at 405,158 tonnes, or 95,800 bpd, from 141,162 tonnes a year ago. Oil shipments from Russia also jumped in May, up 78 percent to 922,664 tonnes, or 218,165 bpd, from last year. In the first five months of 2018, South Korea imported 60.97 million tonnes of crude, or 2.96 million bpd, up 0.7 percent from 60.56 million tonnes during the same period in 2017, according to the data. South Korea’s final May crude imports data will be released by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) later this month.

2018-06-15,"BENGHAZI, Libya/LONDON (Reuters) - The major Libyan oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider were closed and evacuated on Thursday after armed brigades opposed to the powerful eastern commander Khalifa Haftar stormed them, causing a production loss of 240,000 barrels per day (bpd).      At least one storage tank at Ras Lanuf terminal was set alight following the early morning attack, an engineer told Reuters. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) declared force majeure on loadings from both terminals. The clashes between forces loyal to Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) and rival armed groups continued throughout the day south of Ras Lanuf, where the LNA was targeting its opponents with air strikes, local sources said. Military sources said the LNA had withdrawn from both ports.  The LNA took control of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf along with other oil ports in Libya’s oil crescent in 2016, allowing them to reopen after a long blockade and significantly lifting Libya’s oil production. More than half the storage tanks at both terminals were badly damaged in previous fighting and have yet to be repaired, though there have been regular loadings from Es Sider. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said it had evacuated all staff from the two terminals “as a precautionary measure.” The immediate production loss was around 240,000 bpd and the entry of a tanker due at Es Sider on Thursday was postponed, it said. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said the output loss was expected to rise to 400,000 bpd if the shutdown continued, calling it a “national disaster” for oil-dependent Libya. A military source said the three-pronged attack was launched by the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB), a group that has previously tried to take the oil crescent and advance on Benghazi, which has been fully controlled by Haftar since late last year. The NOC blamed Ibrahim Jathran, who headed an armed group that blockaded oil crescent terminals for three years before being forced out by the LNA, and who appeared in a video posted on social media on Thursday announcing the start of a campaign. “We announce the preparation of our ground forces and supporting forces in the oil region, and our objective is to overturn the injustice for our people over the past two years,” he said, standing in a camouflage jacket in an unidentified desert area. “The past two years have been catastrophic for people in the oil crescent because of the presence of the system of injustice which is the other face of terrorism and extremism.” The NOC says Jathran’s previous blockades cost Libya tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue. He is sought by judicial authorities in Tripoli for the blockades and attempts to export oil independently. Repeated previous attempts by the LNA’s opponents to retake the oil crescent have failed, and it is unclear how much military and local, tribal support Jathran or BDB forces currently have. However, the LNA, which is the dominant force in eastern Libya and rejects an internationally recognised government in the capital, Tripoli, stirred some resentment with arrests when it moved into the oil crescent in 2016, and has recently been stretched thin. Since last month it has been waging a campaign to take control of Derna, the last city in the east to elude its control. France, which hosted an international summit last month to set a roadmap for elections in Libya, said it “condemned with the utmost firmness the offensive conducted today by extremist elements in the oil crescent”.      Thursday’s clashes were not affecting any oilfields, the military source said. The LNA had at least five men killed and around six wounded, he said.  A local resident said he had heard the sound of heavy clashes and air strikes at dawn and had seen a large fire at the Ras Lanuf tank farm. Crude exports from Ras Lanuf stood at 110,000 bpd in May, while exports from Es Sider were around 300,000 bpd, according to oil analytics company Vortexa. The Minerva Lisa oil tanker, which was due to arrive at Es Sider to load a crude cargo on Thursday, was advised to stay outside the port, a source familiar with the matter said.  The tanker, chartered by trader Petraco, was seen turning away from the port on Thursday morning without loading, according to Reuters ship tracking.  A second tanker, the Seascout, is expected to arrive at the port on June 18.     Libya’s oil production recovered last year to just over 1 million bpd and has been mostly stable, though it remains vulnerable to shutdowns and blockades at oil facilities.  National output is still well under the more than 1.6 million bpd Libya was producing before a 2011 uprising led to political fragmentation and armed conflict.
