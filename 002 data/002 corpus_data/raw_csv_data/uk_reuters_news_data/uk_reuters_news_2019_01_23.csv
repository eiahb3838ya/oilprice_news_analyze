2019-01-23,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - China’s economy can maintain sustainable rates of growth despite global uncertainties, Vice President Wang Qishan said on Wednesday, days after the world’s second-largest economy posted its weakest expansion in nearly three decades. In a remark apparently aimed at the United States, Wang also urged countries to uphold multilateralism and “respect the independent choices” of each other on technological innovation. “There will be a lot of uncertainties in 2019, but China’s economy will continue to achieve sustainable growth,” Wang told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Speed does matter. But what really matters is the quality and efficiency of our economic development,” he said. China does not see its economic expansionary cycle coming to an end, Wang added, seeking to dispel market concerns that faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs could spark a major slowdown ahead. Growing signs of weakness in China - which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years - have fuelled anxiety about risks to the world economy and overshadowed the gathering of business and political elites at the Alpine resort. “Now, we do face a lot of imbalances,” Wang said, urging  countries to take measures to combat them. “What we need to do is to make the pie bigger” instead of bickering over how to divide it, he said. His comments came after data on Monday showed China’s economy cooled in the fourth quarter, dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades and pressuring Beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown. With no quick end in sight to U.S.-China trade frictions, Chinese finance ministry officials said on Wednesday they would ramp up fiscal spending this year to spur growth. With a March 1 deadline approaching to reach an agreement or risk an escalation of U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the two sides are still far apart on key structural elements critical for a deal. The United States, for one, accuses China of stealing intellectual property and forcing U.S. companies to share technology when they do business in the country. In an apparent retort to such accusations, Wang said it was “imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony, interfering in other countries’ domestic affairs, and conducting, shielding or protecting technology-enabled activities that undermine other countries’ national security”. But, in more conciliatory comments, he said the two economies had become “indispensable” for each other and that confrontation would harm both sides. “We need to uphold multilateralism, engage in extensive dialogue and cooperation based on mutual respect and mutual trust, and jointly build a system of rules for technology,” Wang said. Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China’s Securities Regulatory Commission, told a separate seminar he was hopeful Beijing and Washington would reach a deal on trade. “I think there will be deal. (U.S. President Donald) Trump measures success of his measures by the rise and fall of the Dow Jones average,” Fang said. “Whenever you have difficulties in trade cognations, Wall Street stocks fall,” he said. “That indication is so strong, I believe it’s in the (U.S.) administration’s interest to have a deal.” Additional reporting by Meg Shen in Hong Kong and Lee Chyen Yee in Singapore; Editing by Mark Bendeich, Gareth Jones and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/davos-meeting-china/davos-china-says-it-can-achieve-sustainable-economic-growth-idUKL3N1ZN4JF,23 Jan 2019,"* Calls on countries to uphold multilateralism

2019-01-23,"ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen’s warring parties are expected to agree the terms of a prisoner swap in about 10 days, a representative of the internationally recognised government said on Wednesday, as part of efforts to build confidence in slow-moving peace talks. The United Nations is pushing for the exchange and a peace deal in the main port city of Hodeidah to pave the way for a second round of discussions to end a nearly four-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands of people. The prisoner swap was discussed by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in technical meetings in Jordan last week. Both parties need to agree on lists of prisoners to be swapped. “We expect that in 10 days time the final signing will have happened,” the head of the government delegation to the prisoner-exchange talks, Hadi Haig, told Reuters by telephone. The United Nations has struggled to implement a troop withdrawal from Hodeidah as the warring parties disagree over who should control the city. While a truce in Hodeidah has largely held, fighting has escalated in other parts of the country, including the Houthi-held capital Sanaa. Coalition warplanes targeted a Houthi military training camp south of Sanaa late on Wednesday, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported, the latest air strikes on sites near and in the capital following a Houthi drone attack on a government military parade earlier this month. The prisoner swap was one of the least contentious confidence-building measures at December’s U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, held amid Western pressure to end the conflict. The fighting has killed tens of thousands and brought 10 million people to the brink of famine. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday that it hopes to see “progress in the coming days” and urged the warring parties not to let the opportunity slip away. The ICRC said in a statement that it was preparing for the swap by increasing staff numbers and arranging medical support. It was also preparing two planes to carry detainees between Sanaa and Sayoun, a town under the control of the government. Rights groups have accused both sides of abuses against detainees in their custody. U.S. diplomat Jason Mack on Wednesday told the U.N. Human Rights Council during a review of Yemen’s record in Geneva that detention centres should be placed “under unified national government control, prevent abuse of detainees and allow investigation and prosecution of allegations of abuse”. The war pits the Houthis against other Yemeni forces backed by a Sunni Muslim coalition trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Hadi was ousted from power in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sanaa. The conflict began after pro-democracy unrest forced the former president, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh, to step down in 2012. Hadi was elected to a two-year term to head a transitional government, but the Houthis drove him into exile, prompting the coalition to intervene in Yemen in 2015. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis deny receiving help from Iran and say their revolution is against corruption.

The U.S. dollar and oil prices also declined. U.S. Treasury yields climbed but analysts expect the $15.6 trillion market to be confined within a tight trading range due to a dearth of incentives from fresh economic data amid the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown. The U.S. dollar failed to maintain small gains from earlier in the session as uncertainties kept investors on the sidelines and the yen fell after the Bank of Japan kept its stimulus program in place. “The trade conflicts and tensions, the (U.S. government) shutdown and certainly more chatter about global growth in 2019, those are the factors that need to be hashed out before we get a clear direction,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. After falling more than 1 percent a day ago, Wall Street’s three major equity indexes erased earlier gains to turn negative. Strong quarterly reports from Procter & Gamble, Comcast Corp and International Business Machines offered some support. But U.S. political uncertainty weighed heavily on investors. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in a CNN interview the United States could see zero growth in the first three months if the partial government shutdown is extended for the whole quarter. “It’s another kick in the shins for investors to be concerned about,” said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.9 points, or 0.31 percent, to 24,329.58, the S&P 500 lost 18.54 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,614.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 62.11 points, or 0.88 percent, to 6,958.24. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.21 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.06 percent. shed 0.42 Some weak results from European companies, including luxury goods brand Burberry and Ingenico, damped confidence about the fourth quarter in Europe. “If earnings come in reasonably around expectations, the reality is equities are attractively valued across global regions,” said James Bateman, chief investment officer of multi asset at Fidelity International. “If they disappoint consistently there is going to be a real reappraisal of fair value.” Investors kept a close eye on China on hopes more stimulus measures to shore up its economy would ease worries over slow progress in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would not soften his position that Beijing must make real structural reforms, including how it handles intellectual property, to reach a trade deal, advisers said. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major peers, fell 0.25 percent, with the euro up 0.27 percent to $1.1389. The Japanese yen weakened 0.07 percent versus the greenback to 109.46 per dollar. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.7391 percent, from 2.732 percent late on Tuesday. Oil prices sank, following U.S. stocks down, on concerns about global economic weakness, forecasts for record U.S. shale production and lower U.S. gasoline prices. U.S. crude fell 1.79 percent to $52.06 per barrel.

2019-01-23,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) has rejected the most recent bid by an EIG Global Energy Partners-backed firm to purchase a pair of shallow-water oil clusters, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, potentially derailing a major divestment late in the process. Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, a Brazilian energy firm backed by sector-focused private equity firm EIG entered exclusive talks in July with Petrobras, as the state-run oil firm is known, to purchase its Pampo and Enchova clusters. At the time, the fields, located in the Campos Basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, were seen fetching around $1 billion.     Petrobras is cutting stakes in shallow-water fields to focus on Brazil’s larger deepwater play. That is creating an opportunity for smaller oil companies and private equity firms eager to extract value from relatively mature assets. But the process has been rocky at times.     For Petrobras, the collapse or delay of the Pampo and Enchova deal could hurt its bid to meet an ambitious divestment target of $26.9 billion over five years. With combined oil production of about 39,000 barrels per day, Pampo and Enchova is the largest mature production asset currently in Petrobras’ divestment portfolio. In December, Petrobras reopened bidding for the clusters, as Brazil’s federal audit court, known as the TCU, requires for most Petrobras divestitures. Under the final rebidding round, investors can submit bids of varying values, so long as they have the same contractual terms as the winning bid in the original round. Ouro Preto took advantage of the rebidding process to cut its offer, due in part to a drop in oil prices, Reuters reported in December. [nL1N1YJ1P0]  However, Petrobras, unhappy with Ouro Preto’s price cut, has rejected the consortium’s updated bid, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters.  EIG and Ouro Preto declined to comment. Petrobras did not respond to a request for comment. The setback underlines the slow, at times convoluted process surrounding Petrobras’ divestments, which have often frustrated potential buyers. The next steps in the Pampo and Enchova divestiture are unclear. One of the sources said the Ouro Preto consortium may try to come back to the table to resume bilateral negotiations with Petrobras. Should Petrobras re-open the process to other potential buyers or open a fresh bidding round, it could create an opportunity for firms like Trident Energy, backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which had submitted an offer for Pampo and Enchova during the original bidding round in mid-2018. Trident did not respond to a request for comment.

2019-01-23,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - General Electric (GE.N), which bought Alstom’s energy business in 2015, aims to slash close to 470 jobs across the division in France in the face of falling orders worldwide, unions said on Wednesday. GE has opened negotiations to trim its staff in France under a “collective mutually agreed termination” agreement, a measure introduced in France in September 2017. An early retirement plan is also on the table, union officials said. “In a particularly difficult time for the power sector, GE is currently reviewing its businesses to ensure they are best fitted to market reality and ensure their success,” the company said. Some 229 jobs could be cut at Alstom Power Systems (APS), including 146 at GE Energy’s European headquarters in Belfort, eastern France, unions said. Another 149 jobs could go at GE Energy Power Conversion France and 90 at GE Grid, they said. GE employs 16,000 people in France, including 6,000 in the power branch. When it bought Alstom’s energy business, GE had committed to maintain jobs for at least three years in France and create 1,000 net new jobs by the end of 2018. The French government brandished the threat of fines in June 2018 after former GE Chief Executive John Flannery told Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire that the company would fail to create as many jobs as promised. A meeting on that issue is expected to take place at the finance ministry in coming weeks, a GE spokesman said.

2019-01-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Norway, Germany’s third biggest gas supplier after Russia and the Netherlands, could make further inroads into the German market as the country phases out coal, a top executive at Norwegian oil and gas firm Equinor (EQNR.OL) said on Wednesday. “I’m sensing that there is going to be an increasing demand for gas (in Germany),” said Irene Rummelhoff, member of Equinor’s executive committee. “I think it could be an increasing market for us going forward,” she told Reuters at a German industry event. A commission comprising politicians, researchers and lobbyists has been tasked with setting out a shut-down schedule for German coal mining and power generation on Friday, or by Feb. 1 at the latest. This comes amid a push by Germany to cut climate-harming emissions. In 2018, coal had an 38 percent share in German power generation versus just 7.4 percent for gas. The commission is likely to propose the closure of half the nation’s 43 gigawatts (GW) hard coal and lignite fleet by 2030. “The quicker the phase-out (of coal), the stronger the demand for gas as I see it because there is no other viable alternative,” Rummelhoff said. She said Germany could not run on renewables alone, and it is also phasing out nuclear power by 2022, while gas offered steady supply at half the emissions of coal. Rummelhoff also saw more room for the use of gas in home heating, where it currently accounts for around 50 percent of all units but is due to take market share from more polluting heating oil, and in transport. “The heat segment is very dependent on gas and we see interesting movement in the transport sector, such as in public sector buses,” she said. Germany’s gas strategy is important for Norway’s export success. Out of Norway’s pipeline gas exports of 114 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2018, 47 bcm went to Germany, figures from grid company Gassco showed. Rummelhoff also said she was a little puzzled by Germany’s plans, under pressure from would-be supplier the United States, for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal. Existing terminals around Europe’s coasts are under-utilised because LNG is more expensive than pipeline gas. But traders and customers at the conference support the new terminal as a way of opening up more shipment options and boosting liquidity. “I guess the rationale would be to have more diversification rather than more capacity,” Rummelhoff said.

2019-01-23,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU negotiator Michel Barnier warned British lawmakers on Wednesday that their disparate efforts to amend, delay or thwart Brexit will see Britain crash out of the EU in March if they cannot rally behind one alternative. Referring to parliament’s rejection of a negotiated withdrawal treaty and raging cross-party debate about preventing a March 29 departure without a deal to cushion businesses and people, Barnier said the House of Commons faced a choice: “There are two possible ways to leave the EU,” he told a gathering of business and labour leaders in Brussels. “Number one — an orderly withdrawal based on the agreement that we have built step-by-step with the UK over the last 18 months. “Number two — a disorderly withdrawal.  “Leaving the EU without a deal is the default scenario and there appears to be a majority in the House of Commons to oppose a no-deal. But opposing no-deal will not stop no-deal from happening at the end of March. To stop no-deal, another majority will have to emerge,” said the former French minister, speaking in English to drive home his message to British politicians. Referring to the need to build a majority behind an alternative to a no deal, he added: “This is the objective of the political consultations that Theresa May has started and we hope, sincerely we hope, that this process will be successful.” Prime Minister May has said she will seek amendments to the existing deal to try to overcome massive resistance even within her own party, but some of her own Conservatives in parliament are working with Labour opponents to pass legislation that seeks to force May to seek a delay in leaving rather than exit without a deal. Asked by several people from the floor of the conference of the European Economic and Social Committee, including several representatives of British and Irish businesses, if the Brexit deadline of March 29 could be put back, Barnier was cautious. He noted that a request for extension to the deadline under Article 50 of the EU treaty would have to come from the British government, which has not done so yet. It would then have to be approved unanimously by the other 27 national leaders. “If this question is presented, they will have questions for  the British government: What is it for, what is the purpose? For how long?” Barnier said. Referring to elections to the European Parliament in late May, he also said any extension to Britain’s membership of the EU should not “disrupt the democratic functioning of European institutions”. Some EU officials say Britain might have to hold its own EU legislative election if it is not leaving by July. Barnier restated his readiness to swiftly revise plans linked to the withdrawal treaty for a future trade pact with Britain if London changed its “red lines”. May rules out staying in a customs union with the EU, while Labour favours that.  A customs union could ease problems with guarantees on the Irish border that anger many British lawmakers, though Barnier again stressed that, while it did not expect those guarantees to be used, the EU would not ease its support for Ireland.

2019-01-23,"WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Lawyers for Fiat Chrysler diesel owners have asked a U.S. judge to approve up to $106.5 million in legal fees and out-of-pocket costs for a settlement over excess vehicle emissions. The attorneys said in a filing late Tuesday they had reviewed more than 4 million pages of documents and were involved in almost 100 depositions as they seek up to $99.5 million in legal fees and $7 million in costs. The Italian-American automaker on Jan. 10 announced it settled civil claims with the U.S. Justice Department, the state of California and diesel owners that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests. Fiat Chrysler estimated the value of the settlements at about $800 million, a figure that could potentially rise to more than $900 million with the legal fees. A court hearing on the settlement is scheduled for later on Wednesday in San Francisco. The settlement includes $311 million in total civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, up to $280 million to resolve claims from diesel owners, and extended warranties worth $105 million. German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH, which provided the emissions control software for the Fiat Chrysler vehicles, also agreed to pay $27.5 million to resolve claims from diesel owners. Under the settlement, the $307.5 million from Fiat Chrysler and Bosch will give owners an average of $2,800 to get diesel software updates. The settlement covers 104,000 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels from the model years 2014 to 2016, said the U.S. Justice Department, which is also conducting a criminal probe. The settlement also includes $72.5 million for state civil penalties, and $33.5 million in payments to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims. The hefty penalty was the latest fallout from the U.S. government’s stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen AG admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules. Fiat Chrysler will be required to work with vendors of aftermarket catalytic converters to improve the efficiency of 200,000 converters in the 47 states that do not already require the use of the California-mandated high efficiency gasoline vehicle catalysts. Justice Department officials have estimated that effort will cost $50 million to $70 million. Regulators said Fiat Chrysler used “defeat devices” to cheat emissions tests in real-world driving, Fiat Chrysler did not admit liability.

2019-01-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government will fund a research facility to offer firms in Germany know-how to develop battery cells for electric vehicles (EVs), the science minister said on Wednesday, seeking to compete with Asian producers which dominate the industry. Anja Karliczek said her ministry would invest 500 million euros ($568 million) to support research into both existing and next-generation EV battery cell technology. “The German car industry shouldn’t depend on Asian suppliers,” Karliczek told a business conference in Berlin. “This is not only a question of independence, but also a question of keeping the German economy competitive.” The new facility aims to transfer known-how from Germany’s Fraunhofer science institute to private firms, helping reduce the risk for companies ready to start EV battery production. She did not give a timeline for investing the funds or say if some cash would be offered directly to German firms, support allowed in certain conditions under European Union rules on developing new technology in areas of strategic importance. The science ministry funds come on top of 1 billion euros earmarked by Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to support company alliances that are ready to invest in a large-scale production of electric car battery cells in Germany. Europe’s biggest economy wants to protect carmakers as vehicles shift away from using combustion engines. The government would decide by mid-year where the research facility would be built, Karliczek said. German firms BMZ group, Liacon Batteries, Customcells, EAS Batteries and TerraE would be involved in setting up the facility, the minister said. Switzerland-based battery maker Leclanche, which has most of its production in Germany, would also take part. EV battery production is dominated by Japan’s Panasonic Corp, South Korean makers Samsung SDI Co and LG Chem, and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL). CATL aims to start production in 2021 from its German plant at Erfurt, its first in Europe, CATL’s regional president Matthias Zentgraf said, adding that the firm targeted annual cell production of 60 gigawatt hours (GWh) from 2026.  Zentgraf said CATL, which expects to supply BMW and other manufacturers with lithium-ion batteries, would consider joining efforts to set up a research facility. The European Commission launched its own European Battery Alliance (EBA) in 2017 in an effort to support EU production. So far, Sweden’s Northvolt has been the only serious European contender to emerge. Germany wants to lay the groundwork for large-scale battery production in Europe. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier expects investment decisions by two consortiums in the first quarter of 2019. Among companies involved in talks with Altmaier about building German battery cell alliances are Varta, chemical giant BASF and Ford’s German subsidiary Ford-Werke GmbH, sources have told Reuters.

2019-01-23,"LUND, Sweden (Reuters) - Might tree roots, twigs and branches one day be used to power cars? That’s what a Swedish researcher is hoping after developing a pulp byproduct that - on a modest scale - does just that. Chemical engineering scientist Christian Hulteberg, from Lund University, has used the black liquor residue from pulp and paper manufacturing to create a polymer called lignin. After purification and filtration, that is then turned into a gasoline mixture. “We’re actually using the stuff of the wood that they don’t use when they make paper and pulp... It adds value to low-value components of the tree,” he told Reuters. In environmental terms, he says that gives it an advantage over other biofuels such as ethanol. “A lot of the controversy with ethanol production has been the use of feedstock that you can actually eat,” he said. Hulteberg has a pilot plant in operation and hopes the forest fuel will be available in service stations by 2021. Though it will only serve a fraction of the demands of Swedish motorists, he is hopeful that, along with other renewable products under development, it could help wean us off our addiction to fossil fuels.

2019-01-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Crude oil markets in Europe and West Africa have made a strong start to 2019 as Libyan supply losses and strong demand in Asia offset rising U.S. exports. Nigeria’s biggest crude grade, Qua Iboe, was being offered this week at a $2 a barrel premium to benchmark dated Brent, a 10-month high. In the North Sea, Forties crude reached its highest since October on Monday.  The strength comes as global oil producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are embarking on supply curbs to boost prices, and due to other involuntary supply losses such as Libyan outages and U.S. sanctions on Iran. “We would expect some more support to be coming through for physical crude right now,” said David Reid, an analyst at JBC Energy in Vienna. “This is because we see a deficit in the crude balance from a trading perspective, which is quite pronounced this month.” In other signs of strength, Russian Urals crude in the Baltic has risen to its highest in five years, predominantly driven by a shortage of similar distillate-rich medium sour crudes. The rally was not expected by some in the market.  “I am quite surprised,” said a trader focusing on North Sea crude. “I thought there would be more pressure on the market given the extra U.S. barrels that are coming over. But there is huge demand in the Far East and outages in Libya.” The United States - not part of the OPEC-led supply-cutting pact - is sending more oil abroad and in late November exported more crude and fuel than it imported, for the first time on record. Nonetheless, unrest-related losses of crude from Libya’s largest oilfield - similar in quality to Nigerian and North Sea grades - have offset this. El Sharara, which produces 315,000 barrels per day, was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards, and traders say it remains shut. Libya is not the only place where supply is falling short. Lower supply of Algerian Saharan Blend, as well as a smaller export schedule for Kazakhstan’s CPC Blend, has drawn a number of Nigerian cargoes to northwest Europe. There, as well as the gains seen in Forties and the other four crudes that underpin dated Brent, traders say the less visible North Sea crudes are already sold out for next month, reflecting a tighter market. Indicating the same, Brent crude futures for immediate delivery are trading at a premium to the second month, as are the short-term Brent swaps called contracts for differences (CFDs) used to price dated Brent, the benchmark used around the world for physical oil trades. This structure, called backwardation, is a sign of tight supply boosting the value of oil for delivery soon. But the rest of the Brent futures curve to mid-2019 is in the opposite structure, contango, suggesting ample supply.  Some traders do not expect the strength to last, saying supply in the West African market is not tight. Not all West African crude differentials have risen - those for heavier Angolan grades are down, JBC’s Reid said, adding that poor refinery profit margins in a number of regions were a downside risk. In addition, this kind of market structure in the CFDs can act as a double-edged sword, traders say. Having oil sitting idle on a tanker for the journey from West Africa or from the North Sea to the heart of the Chinese teapot industry in Shandong becomes expensive when the market is in backwardation. “The irony is with backwardation now creeping into the CFDs, my guess is we won’t see any further price rises,” another trader said. “It takes value out of delivered-based pricing shorts.” Even so, sellers are enjoying the moment. Qua Iboe is being offered as high as dated Brent plus $2.50 by some cargo owners. A trade at that level would be the highest since 2014, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. “Sellers are very bullish,” a third trader said. “I’m a bit flummoxed as the fundamentals don’t support it.”  Graphics and additional reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-markets/graphic-opec-cuts-outages-give-physical-crude-a-new-year-lift-idUKL8N1ZN3A1,23 Jan 2019,"* Some North Sea, Nigerian differentials at multi-month

2019-01-23,"HARARE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has promised action in response to a crackdown by security forces on anti-government protesters following a hike in the price of fuel. Lawyers and activists say police and soldiers have killed at least a dozen people, wounded scores and arrested hundreds over the demonstrations. Zimbabwe’s Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) accused security forces of systematic torture. Critics say the country is reverting to the authoritarian rule that characterised the 37-year regime of former leader Robert Mugabe, who was forced from power after a coup in November 2017. The crisis will not be easy to fix. There is a severe shortage of dollars, fuel and medicines, while inflation hit 42 percent in December, the highest in a decade. Foreign investors are, by and large, staying away. Everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals. In the past two months, the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods, including medicines, food and fuel. Motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations, where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line. On Jan. 12, Mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to $3.31 per litre from $1.32 from midnight, but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash U.S. dollars. It was the final straw for some Zimbabweans, and violent protests broke out two days after his announcement. Some residents say that while calm has returned, soldiers have continued to beat up civilians. Many people blame Mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his pre-election promises to kick-start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong-arm rule of his predecessor. The country abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before. In its place, the government adopted the U.S. dollar and other currencies including sterling and the South African rand. People hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless. But over time, supply of the U.S. and South African currencies dried up, so in November 2016 authorities in Harare launched a surrogate currency - paper ‘bond notes’ designed to ease acute hard currency shortages. The notes, which now have a total face value of $400 million, are backed by a $500 million loan from the African Export and Import Bank, the central bank has said. They are used like cash. Officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1:1, on the street $1 fetches up to 3 bond notes, reflecting the ongoing shortage of U.S. dollars and people’s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency. A dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as $30 in bond notes. Companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits. When the bond note was introduced, dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value. Government borrowing via Treasury Bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold. It is these electronic dollars, theoretically worth $10 billion and nicknamed “zollars” by economists, that are raising fears that Zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade. Zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash, prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments. Zollars remain officially pegged at 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, but on the black market $1 is now worth $4 zollars. That has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments. Zimbabwe’s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks’ cover for imports, central bank data show. The government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves. But Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said Zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months. Companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment, forcing them to buy dollars on the black market. Civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country. Only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies, charities, or large international corporations are paid in U.S. dollars. Last October, the central bank ordered banks to create separate U.S. dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas, which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar. The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch. The group said its members had a backlog of $480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers. Cooking oil and soap maker Olivine Industries said on Saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers $11 million. Zimbabwe’s largest brewing company Delta Beverages, part-owned by Anheuser-Busch Inbev, said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened. Mnangagwa, a former spy chief installed after Mugabe’s removal in a coup in November 2017, was elected in July amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for Zimbabwe, and has said his nation is “open for business”. But critics say the man nicknamed “The Crocodile” is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms, including repealing Mugabe-era laws that restrict the media. Mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of U.S. sanctions against officials from the ZANU-PF ruling party, top military figures and some government-owned firms, which were imposed during Mugabe’s rule for what Washington called violations of human rights and democracy. The IMF has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country’s reform programme unless its $2 billion arrears with the World Bank, African Development Bank and European Investment Bank are paid. Harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a programme allowing the IMF to monitor its economic reforms, although it does not entail funding from the lender. Analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now, but more clashes were expected unless Mnangagwa’s administration could find a solution to the cash shortages.

2019-01-23,"(Adds comments on suspending parliament) LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal could be reformed to make it acceptable to “Leave” lawmakers in her party who object to proposals on the Irish border, prominent eurosceptic lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Wednesday. Rees-Mogg, who chairs the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), was among Conservative lawmakers who voted against May’s deal when it was overwhelmingly defeated last week, But he said he was more optimistic that changes might be made to the deal that could see it approved by parliament. “I think at last, things are going our way ... I think there is good news for us to hope that a reformation of this deal could be achieved that could make it acceptable,” he added at a think-tank event. “But ... it is not there yet and until it is, people like me will vote against the deal.” Rees-Mogg said changes to the deal would have to have equal legal status to the deal itself, and that the backstop must be somehow removed or nullified to win his vote - something the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to consider. If May is able to achieve that and win the support of the ERG head, it could be enough to persuade large numbers of other eurosceptics to vote for May’s amended deal and unlock the stymied Brexit process. Rees-Mogg said attempts under way in parliament to take the exit process out of May’s hands and delay leaving the EU were a threat to the British constitution and urged the government to do what ever it took to block them - including suspending parliament if necessary. “If the House of Commons undermines our basic constitutional conventions, then the executive is entitled to use other vestigial constitutional means to stop it – by which I basically mean prorogation,” he said, referring to the formal closure of parliament.

2019-01-23,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. oil producers sought on Wednesday to soothe OPEC’s worries about losing market share, telling the group that investors in the U.S. firms wanted a reduction in growth and higher payouts. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies such as Russia have cut output since 2017 to support oil prices, while watching producers in the United States, which is not party to the cuts, drive up production. The United States has overtaken Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s biggest crude producer. Output is approaching 12 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC’s forecasts and even U.S. government predictions have repeatedly underestimated U.S. output growth. The bosses of U.S. firms Occidental Petroleum and Hess Corp, attending a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said that growth of U.S. shale oil output would slow. The session was a rare occasion when U.S. producers and an OPEC representative, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo, sat on the same panel. “I believe not as much money will be pouring into the Permian basin this time. I believe investors will hold companies accountable for returns and a lot of this didn’t happen previously,” Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said. Echoing her comments, Hess Corp founder and Chief Executive John Hess said shale production now accounted for about 6 percent of global production. “It will probably go up to 10 percent by mid-decade but then it flattens out,” he said. But he added that U.S. resources would start to degrade. “Shale is not the next Saudi Arabia. It is an important short-cycle component,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised OPEC for manipulating prices and demanded several times last year that the group bring them down. He has also praised OPEC, and its de facto leader Saudi Arabia, when prices have fallen. Oil prices surged above $86 a barrel in October, but have since slipped back. On Wednesday, Brent was about $62. LCOc1 Barkindo said OPEC aimed to balance supply and demand and had helped the United States by rescuing its oil industry from ultra-low oil prices. “The oil industry is under siege globally,” Barkindo said, adding that OPEC wanted to talk more regularly to U.S. producers to understand their industry better even if they could not participate in any OPEC-led production cuts. In response, Hess said: “OPEC plays a very important role in stabilising the market and those efforts need to be recognised.”   Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, which represents industrialised nations, said most forecasts were still underestimating U.S. oil production growth. “There is a huge potential in the U.S.,” Birol told Reuters, adding that the United States could raise output by another 10 million bpd in the next decade.

2019-01-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Shares in RWE (RWEG.DE), Germany’s largest power producer, rose almost 5 percent on Wednesday at the prospect of higher compensation should coal-fired power stations be shut down early. A draft paper by Germany’s government-appointed coal commission, which is tasked with organising the exit from coal, showed operators of coal-fired power stations should receive compensation for early closure but did not specify the size of payments. A shut down date is due to be settled on Friday. The 133-page draft document, seen by Reuters, said a mutual agreement between the government and the plant operators, including RWE and Uniper (UN01.DE), was the preferred option. “The Commission assumes that in the negotiations with the operators of lignite-fired power plants the entire planning period up to 2030 will be settled by mutual agreement,” the draft said. If such an agreement cannot be reached by June 30, 2020, the commission will recommend a “regulatory” solution including compensation payments based on legal requirements, it said. While no figures are mentioned, the commission suggests that the compensation for operators should be based on payments made for similar cases in the past. Utilities have already received around 600 million euros ($682 million) per gigawatt to idle plants and put them into a strategic reserve. “If true, this would imply much more meaningful compensation for RWE than we currently assume,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a note following the Reuters report. Shares in RWE were the highest gainer on Germany’s blue-chip index. Shares in Uniper gained only 0.4 percent, however.  The commission consisting of politicians, researchers and lobbyists is expected to adopt a more detailed version of the paper on Friday.  According to the draft, fees for the use of electricity grids should be reduced for both industry and private consumers and operators of coal-fired power stations should receive compensation for early closure. “The necessary funds must be made available by the state to finance the recommended measures. There will be no surcharge on electricity prices,” the paper says.  The entire phase-out is to be reviewed again in 2023, 2026 and 2029 with a view to security of supply, prices, climate protection and structural change.

2019-01-23,"(Reuters) - Potential U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s crude oil exports would cut off the nation from Gulf Coast refiners that are among its biggest customers, likely forcing it to send more crude to China, India or other Asian countries, traders said on Wednesday. U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela’s heavy crude would have even more trouble securing supplies as Canadian and Mexican crudes are often not as discounted and are limited in availability. The United States is considering moves to cripple Venezuela’s oil shipments, which account for nearly all of the country’s exports, in response to the reelection of President Nicolas Maduro that was widely viewed as a sham. Washington has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s president as protests against Maduro erupted across the country. It is also considering sanctions on oil deliveries, a move it has until now resisted, energy company sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Venezuela, on average, exported about 500,000 barrels of crude a day to the United States in 2018, according to U.S. Energy Department data. Those shipments fell in November to an estimated 358,000 barrels per day, however, according to a report by Caracas-based consultancy Gas Energy Latin America seen by Reuters.  The U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years with more shipments going to Russia and China. [GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to the United States: tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB] Those deliveries are being made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures as output from state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, has slumped to near 70-year lows in a nationwide economic crisis. Venezuela’s output has been cut in half since 2016 to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources.  Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments, according to a Barclays research note published last week. In the wake of sanctions, the country could seek additional deals with Turkey, India or other Asian nations, one trader of Venezuelan crude said. Gas Energy’s report said India was the second-largest importer of Venezuelan crude in November. “It will be costly for Venezuela but eventually they’ll be able to sell that oil to Asia at a discount. There will be a period in the middle in which they have difficulty selling those barrels,” said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. [GRAPHIC: Top U.S. importers of Venezuelan crude: tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E] Though the United States produces nearly 12 million barrels of oil a day, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply sub in light crude. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude have risen as buyers scramble for supply. Mars traded at a $6.90 premium to U.S. crude on Wednesday, a five-year high, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, as bidders came into the market to secure supplies through the second quarter, traders said. “It would make a tight market even tighter. If it happens, it would be an unambiguous headwind for refiners already struggling to find supplies,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy in Bethesda, Maryland. [GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to U.S. refiners: tmsnrt.rs/2S42EI5.] Traders said the United States may need to sell oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cover supply shortfalls as additional shipments are secured via Canada or Mexico.  Sanctions could also include U.S. exports of petroleum products to Venezuela, used for blending with Venezuelan heavy crude.

2019-01-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Wednesday as the European Union seeks to circumvent U.S. trade sanctions against Iran, and on weaker U.S. gasoline prices. Brent LCOc1 futures fell 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $61.14 a barrel, while the most active U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLv1 contract for March fell 39 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $52.62. France’s foreign minister said he expected a European-backed system to facilitate non-dollar trade with Iran and bypass fresh U.S. curbs imposed after Washington quit a landmark nuclear deal, would be established in coming days. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York said that EU announcement “knocked the wind out of oil prices.” Analysts also said falling U.S. gasoline prices and rising crude output in the United States were also pressuring the crude market. “We are paying particular attention to weakening NYMEX crack spreads where an increasingly heavy gasoline market is providing a limiter on near term WTI gains,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Chicago, said in a report. The crack, or spread, between U.S. gasoline futures and WTI crude RBc1-CLc1 fell to $5.97 a barrel, its lowest since 2013. Both U.S. crude and product futures extended their losses in post-settlement trade after an industry report showed that U.S. crude stockpiles rose sharply last week, while gasoline and distillate inventories built. [API/S] Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude inventories increased 6.6 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 42,000 barrels. Gasoline stocks rose by 3.6 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.7 million-barrel gain. Distillate fuels stockpiles gained by 2.6 million barrels, compared with expectations for a 229,000-barrel drop, the API data showed. If the weekly product builds are confirmed by government data on Thursday at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT), it would be the eighth rise in a row for gasoline, and the fifth straight build for both distillates and gasoline.  GRAPHIC: U.S. oil production growth - tmsnrt.rs/2AZSnDc The Trump administration ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday, announcing U.S. recognition of the country’s opposition leader as interim president and signaling potential new sanctions against its vital oil sector.

However, the U.S. dollar and oil prices declined. U.S. Treasury yields climbed but analysts expect the $15.6 trillion market to be confined within a tight trading range due to a dearth of fresh economic data amid the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown. The U.S. dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies as uncertainty over trade and the global economy clouded the greenback’s near-term outlook and restricted it to tight trading ranges against other major currencies. “The trade conflicts and tensions, the (U.S. government) shutdown and certainly more chatter about global growth in 2019, those are the factors that need to be hashed out before we get a clear direction,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. After falling more than 1 percent in the previous day’s session, Wall Street indexes zig-zagged. Strong quarterly reports from Procter & Gamble, Comcast Corp and International Business Machines helped the Dow show the biggest gains of the day. But U.S. political uncertainty weighed heavily on investors. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in a CNN interview the United States could see zero growth in the first three months if the partial government shutdown is extended for the whole quarter. “What we’re seeing here is a very indecisive market and a market that’s very sensitive to headline news on trade and the shutdown,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York referring to Hassett’s comment. And, according to Cardillo, it didn’t help investor mood that U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued publicly over whether Trump can deliver the annual State of the Union address in the House chamber during the shutdown. “The longer the bickering goes on the longer the shutdown goes on and everyone gets affected if the economy slows,” he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 171.14 points, or 0.7 percent, to 24,575.62, the S&P 500 gained 5.8 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,638.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.41 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,025.77. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.1 percent, after the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.06 percent. Investors also kept a close eye on China on hopes more economic stimulus measures would ease worries over slow progress in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the United States was doing well in trade talks and that China “very much wants to make a deal.” The day before his advisers had said he would not soften his position that Beijing must make real structural reforms, including how it handles intellectual property, to reach a trade deal. “The market is shadow-boxing with speculation about trade,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies & Co. in New York. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 96.127. The index has risen nearly 1 percent over the last two weeks. The greenback was up 0.22 percent against the yen after the Bank of Japan on Wednesday kept its stimulus program in place.

2019-01-23,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers representing owners of Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles told a U.S. judge they are seeking up to $106.5 million in legal fees and out-of-pocket costs in connection with a settlement over excess vehicle emissions, but they are in talks to finalize the  amount, officials said Wednesday. The attorneys said in a filing late on Tuesday they had reviewed more than 4 million pages of documents and were involved in almost 100 depositions. They seek up to $99.5 million in legal fees and $7 million in costs. Ken Feinberg, a court-appointed mediator, said at a hearing  on Wednesday there has been no agreement over the amount of the legal fees, but talks have been ongoing between Fiat Chrysler, German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] and lawyers for 104,000 vehicle owners. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said he hoped an agreement could be reached by early February. The Italian-American automaker on Jan. 10 announced it settled with the U.S. Justice Department, the state of California and diesel owners over civil claims that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests.  Fiat Chrysler estimated the value of the settlements at about $800 million, a figure that could potentially rise to more than $900 million with the legal fees. Bosch, which provided emissions control software for the Fiat Chrysler vehicles, also agreed to pay $27.5 million to resolve claims from diesel owners. Under the settlement, Fiat Chrysler and Bosch will give owners $307.5 million or about $2,800 per vehicle for diesel software updates.  Fiat Chrysler and Bosch agreed to pay the owners’ legal bills on top of the $307.5 million to resolve consumer claims. Fiat Chrysler will pay $311 million in total civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, up to $280 million to resolve claims from diesel owners and extended warranties worth $105 million. The settlement covers 104,000 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels from the model years 2014 to 2016, said the U.S. Justice Department, which is also conducting a criminal probe. In addition, Fiat Chrysler will pay $72.5 million for state civil penalties and $33.5 million in payments to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims. The hefty penalty was the latest fallout from the U.S. government’s stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules.    Fiat Chrysler will be required to work with vendors of aftermarket catalytic converters to improve the efficiency of 200,000 converters in the 47 states that do not already require the use of the California-mandated high efficiency gasoline vehicle catalysts. Justice Department officials have estimated that effort will cost $50 million to $70 million. Regulators said Fiat Chrysler used “defeat devices” to cheat emissions tests in real-world driving. Fiat Chrysler did not admit liability.

The U.S. dollar and oil prices also declined. U.S. Treasury yields climbed but analysts expect the $15.6 trillion market to be confined within a tight trading range due to a dearth of incentives from fresh economic data amid the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown. The U.S. dollar failed to maintain small gains from earlier in the session as uncertainties kept investors on the sidelines and the yen fell after the Bank of Japan kept its stimulus program in place. “The trade conflicts and tensions, the (U.S. government) shutdown and certainly more chatter about global growth in 2019, those are the factors that need to be hashed out before we get a clear direction,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. After falling more than 1 percent a day ago, the S&P 500 zig-zagged, while Nasdaq was in the red. Strong quarterly reports from Procter & Gamble, Comcast Corp and International Business Machines helped the Dow show gains for much of the day.

2019-01-23,"Jan 23 (Reuters) - Potential U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s crude oil exports would cut off the nation from Gulf Coast refiners that are among its biggest customers, likely forcing it to send more crude to China, India or other Asian countries, traders said on Wednesday. U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela’s heavy crude would have even more trouble securing supplies as Canadian and Mexican crudes are often not as discounted and are limited in availability. The United States is considering moves to cripple Venezuela’s oil shipments, which account for nearly all of the country’s exports, in response to the reelection of President Nicolas Maduro that was widely viewed as a sham. Washington has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s president as protests against Maduro erupt across the country. It is also considering sanctions on oil deliveries, a move it has until now resisted, energy company sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Venezuela has, on average, exported about 500,000 barrels of crude a day to the United States in 2018, according to U.S. Energy Department data. The U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years with more shipments going to Russia and China. [GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to the United States: tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB ] Those deliveries are being made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures as output from state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, has slumped to near 70-year lows in a nationwide economic crisis. Venezuela’s output has been cut in half since 2016 to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources. In the wake of sanctions the country could seek additional deals with Turkey, India or other Asian nations, one trader of Venezuelan crude said. “It will be costly for Venezuela but eventually they’ll be able to sell that oil to Asia at a discount. There will be a period in the middle in which they have difficulty selling those barrels,” said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. [GRAPHIC: Top U.S. importers of Venezuelan crude: tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E ] Though the United States produces nearly 12 million barrels of oil a day, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply sub in light crude. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour WTC-MRS, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude WTC-HLS, have risen as buyers scramble for supply. Mars traded at a $6.25 premium to U.S. crude on Tuesday, a five-year high, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. “It would make a tight market even tighter. If it happens, it would be an unambiguous headwind for refiners already struggling to find supplies,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy in Bethesda, Maryland. [GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to U.S. refiners: tmsnrt.rs/2S42EI5. ] Traders said the United States may need to sell oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cover supply shortfalls as additional shipments are secured via Canada or Mexico. Sanctions could also include U.S. exports of petroleum products to Venezuela, used for blending with Venezuelan heavy crude. Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar, Collin Eaton and Stephanie

2019-01-23,"TORONTO/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - When the final numbers were tallied late last Wednesday for Husky Energy’s hostile bid for rival Canadian oil producer MEG Energy, Husky’s top executives learned they had the support of nearly 60 percent of MEG shareholders, people familiar with the situation told Reuters.  That meant they easily surpassed the 50 percent threshold usually needed to extend their offer and reach the two-thirds mark necessary to win the deal.  On Thursday morning, however, Husky walked away, saying it had “insufficient” support. The move shocked investors, analysts and MEG itself.  It is usually a given that a company securing such significant backing would extend its bid, buying extra time to drum up remaining support. However, Husky in a statement on Thursday noted two negative developments since it made the offer in September - a lack of progress expanding pipelines in western Canada, and the province of Alberta’s decision to order production cuts to drain a glut of oil in storage. The company has nothing further to add, spokesman Mel Duvall said on Tuesday. In fact, the deal began losing its financial appeal shortly after Husky made the offer, people close to Husky said. By last Wednesday, it seemed to one of the people as if Husky was hoping the bid would fail.   “The economics of the transaction changed very materially since they launched the bid. It was an extremely shrewd move by Husky to launch the hostile (offer) and just as smart to let it go,” said an energy M&A lawyer, who declined to be identified because of his ties to both companies. U.S. crude prices have dropped some 28 percent since Husky launched its bid. Worse for Canadian oil producers, discounts on their crude reached record-large levels less than two weeks later as pipeline congestion worsened.  Husky, whose majority investor is Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, was largely immune, because it owns refineries that can handle all of its own crude. But the industry’s low-price crisis pressured Alberta Premier Rachel Notley to order mandatory production cuts in early December, over opposition from Husky and a couple of other producers. Husky displayed doubts as far back as November. That month, according to MEG, it did not take up MEG’s offer of signing a confidentiality agreement to take a closer look at the target. Curtailments quickly changed the economics, boosting Canadian prices and diluting a major advantage for Husky. Husky’s upgrader and refineries previously insulated it nicely from deep price discounts and cheap crude fattened its margins downstream.  Husky’s refining capacity exceeds its own heavy oil production, and so in an over-supplied market, it bought cheap barrels from competitors with nowhere to move them, driving up Husky’s margins, said Steve Kallir, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. But such trades became less profitable as Canadian prices rose, and the appeal of buying MEG’s oil production may have also diminished, he said. Early this month, as the oil industry’s ground shifted with Alberta’s curtailments, Husky Chief Executive Rob Peabody did not accept an invitation from MEG CEO Derek Evans to negotiate a friendly agreement, according to MEG. But Husky’s change of heart on shifting price dynamics does not satisfy everyone. MEG’s assets will endure for decades, making short-term thinking less relevant, said Eric Nuttall, senior portfolio manager of Ninepoint Partners, a MEG shareholder.

2019-01-23,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - China’s economy can maintain sustainable rates of growth despite global uncertainties, Vice President Wang Qishan said on Wednesday, days after the world’s second-largest economy posted its weakest expansion in nearly three decades. In a remark apparently aimed at the United States, Wang also urged countries to uphold multilateralism and “respect the independent choices” of each other on technological innovation. “There will be a lot of uncertainties in 2019, but China’s economy will continue to achieve sustainable growth,” Wang told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Speed does matter. But what really matters is the quality and efficiency of our economic development,” he said. China does not see its economic expansionary cycle coming to an end, Wang added, seeking to dispel market concerns that faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs could spark a major slowdown ahead. Growing signs of weakness in China - which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years - have fuelled anxiety about risks to the world economy and overshadowed the gathering of business and political elites at the Alpine resort. “Now, we do face a lot of imbalances,” Wang said, urging  countries to take measures to combat them. “What we need to do is to make the pie bigger” instead of bickering over how to divide it, he said. His comments came after data on Monday showed China’s economy cooled in the fourth quarter, dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades and pressuring Beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown. With no quick end in sight to U.S.-China trade frictions, Chinese finance ministry officials said on Wednesday they would ramp up fiscal spending this year to spur growth. With a March 1 deadline approaching to reach an agreement or risk an escalation of U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the two sides are still far apart on key structural elements critical for a deal. The United States, for one, accuses China of stealing intellectual property and forcing U.S. companies to share technology when they do business in the country. In an apparent retort to such accusations, Wang said it was “imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony, interfering in other countries’ domestic affairs, and conducting, shielding or protecting technology-enabled activities that undermine other countries’ national security”. But, in more conciliatory comments, he said the two economies had become “indispensable” for each other and that confrontation would harm both sides. “We need to uphold multilateralism, engage in extensive dialogue and cooperation based on mutual respect and mutual trust, and jointly build a system of rules for technology,” Wang said. Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China’s Securities Regulatory Commission, told a separate seminar he was hopeful Beijing and Washington would reach a deal on trade. “I think there will be deal. (U.S. President Donald) Trump measures success of his measures by the rise and fall of the Dow Jones average,” Fang said. “Whenever you have difficulties in trade cognations, Wall Street stocks fall,” he said. “That indication is so strong, I believe it’s in the (U.S.) administration’s interest to have a deal.” Additional reporting by Meg Shen in Hong Kong and Lee Chyen Yee in Singapore; Editing by Mark Bendeich, Gareth Jones and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/davos-meeting-china/davos-china-says-it-can-achieve-sustainable-economic-growth-idUKL3N1ZN4JF,23 Jan 2019,"* Calls on countries to uphold multilateralism

2019-01-23,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia will consider laws to restrict imports of French products if Paris does not withdraw plans to curb the use of palm oil in biofuels, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron.  French lawmakers last month voted to remove palm oil from the country’s biofuel scheme as of 2020, following longstanding concerns about the environmental impact of the crop that is mainly produced in Indonesia and Malaysia. Palm oil is used as feedstock for the making of biodiesel, as well as in everything from cookies and soap to lipstick. Environmental groups say the palm oil industry causes deforestation, as well as the displacement of wildlife and indigenous communities. Palm oil is a key source of revenue for Malaysia, which is the second biggest exporter of the vegetable oil.  In the letter to Macron dated Jan. 8, Mahathir called on the French leader to reject the proposed ban on palm oil in biofuels, adding the trade relationship between the two countries depended on mutual respect for each other’s commodities. “Failing in that mutual respect will force Malaysia to look at actions, including, but not limited to, suspension of EU-Malaysia free trade talks and the imposition of like-minded legislation against French exports,” Mahathir said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters on Wednesday. France’s move could lead to “regrettable economic and trade consequences” for Malaysian exporters of palm oil and French exporters, Mahathir said. A spokesman for Mahathir’s office confirmed the veracity of the letter and said the letter was sent via diplomatic channels.  Primary industries minister Teresa Kok also confirmed the authenticity of the letter.  An official at the French presidency said it was looking into the matter. Bilateral trade between the two countries totaled 3.87 billion euros ($4.4 billion )in 2017, Mahathir said in the letter.  Mahathir, who was elected to power in May last year, said the French move to limit palm oil use was discriminatory and that the vegetable oil was not responsible for deforestation.  France’s plan to limit palm oil use followed a move by European lawmakers last year to back measures to limit the use of palm oil in biofuels, ahead of an eventual ban in 2030.  Indonesia and Malaysia jointly produce 90 percent of the world’s palm oil.

Speaking to France’s BFM Business TV on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Pouyanne said there were many factors weighing on oil prices, yet a key one was related to the situation in the United States. One of the main reasons as to why prices were expected to be weak was because in the United States - a major oil producer - a good part of its production was not being exported because of bottlenecks at the pipelines.  “These are being constructed, and when it will be done at the end of the year, there will be an influx of U.S. crude in the market and this will drag prices lower towards the end of the year,” Pouyanne said.

Last week, majority state-owned Orsted said it would halt the sale after it became clear there was no longer political support in Denmark for the move. “This does not have any bearing on our 200 billion Danish crowns ($30.4 billion) capital expenditure plan to 2025 and our renewable expansion target for 30 gigawatts (GW) to 2030,” Martin Neubert told Reuters. “The business is generally still for sale. There are better owners for this, that much remains clear,” he said on the sidelines of the annual Handelsblatt energy conference in Berlin. Denmark’s Social Democrats want critical infrastructure to remain in state-controlled hands. Orsted is the world’s largest offshore wind developer, with 12 GW currently in operation and under construction. Neubert said that while two major wind farm projects it was pursuing in Taiwan were on hold for now, the country remained committed to offshore wind. “We will hear more about this within the next eight weeks,” he said. Taiwanese authorities have not issued permits for power purchase agreements (PPA) for the two wind farms that Orsted hopes will open doors to more work in Asia. Neubert was also optimistic about prospects in Japan after Orsted last week signed a memorandum with the country’s power market leader Tepco to work jointly on offshore projects, including Choshi near Tokyo. “We will work out over the next few months how we can jointly handle planning, construction, operations and financing,” Neubert said. In November, Japan decided on a 10 GW target for offshore wind. Tepco, with 30 million customers and more than 50 percent of the country’s installed power plant capacity, is seeking to build in a 1.7 GW offshore zone, and views Orsted as a strong external partner, Neubert said. As for Germany, he said there should be a consensus soon for how to expand offshore wind after 2025. “We are falling behind comparable European markets such as Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands,” said Neubert, a German national. Meanwhile, the company was on the lookout for finance partners, customers and distributors for the 1.14 GW of approved capacity it will build in Germany up to 2024/2025. $1 = 6.5730 Danish crowns

2019-01-23,"* Japan determined to preserve open international order * G20 role could help Tokyo resist U.S. pressure * Abe says intellectual property rights also priority By Leika Kihara DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday he will seek to use his chairmanship of the Group of 20 leading economies to rebuild trust in the global trade system. His speech to the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps was significant at a time when a bitter Sino-U.S. trade dispute is one of several factors threatening to bring about a sharp slowdown in global growth. “Japan is determined to preserve and committed to enhancing the free, open, and rules-based international order,” he told delegates. “I call on all of you ... to rebuild trust toward the system for international trade. That should be a system that is fair, transparent, and effective in protecting intellectual property rights and also in such areas as e-commerce and government procurement.” With the French, British and U.S. leaders cancelling their visits because of more pressing concerns at home, Abe is one of only three Group of Seven leaders attending the annual event in Davos, where business executives are worried about the damage that populism and trade protectionism are inflicting on the global economy. Abe said Japan, as chair of this year’s gathering of the Group of 20 (G20), will also seek to spearhead discussions on climate change and ways to facilitate use of digital data while protecting intellectual property. The comments underscore Japan’s hope to rally support from some of its G20 counterparts in pushing for a multilateral approach in solving trade frictions. That could help Tokyo fend off pressure from Washington to open up its politically sensitive agriculture market and take other steps to fix bilateral trade imbalances, analysts say. Japan has to be consistent on the need to promote free trade “and shouldn’t change this stance even if the United States is always talking about doing a bilateral deal,” said Takeshi Niinami, head of brewer Suntory Holdings Ltd and an economic adviser to Abe. Australia, Singapore and other Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries could help Japan make free trade a key topic of debate at the G20, he told Reuters. At his previous Davos visit in 2014, Abe pledged to pull the economy out of stagnation with his “Abenomics” mix of fiscal spending, ultra-easy monetary policy and steps to boost Japan’s potential growth via labour market reform and deregulation. Five years later, the boost to growth from Abenomics is fading, inflation remains far below the Bank of Japan’s target and critics point to a lack of progress on deregulation. Abe sought to counter such criticism, saying that through job-creating policies he had demolished “a wall of despair and pessimism on Japan” that had existed five years ago. He said Japan hoped to build a G20 consensus on the need to reduce plastic waste flowing into the oceans, and coordinate on global usage of digital data without infringing on personal privacy and intellectual property. “I must say that spending money for a green earth and a blue ocean, once deemed costly, is now a growth generator,” he said. “Decarbonisation and profit making can happen in tandem. We policy makers must be held responsible to make it happen, as I will be stressing in Osaka this year.” People close to the premier have said Abe is keen to use the G20 summit in Osaka, western Japan, in June to boost his poll ratings ahead of an upper house election looming mid-year.

2019-01-23,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s state-owned offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK) said it is confident of achieving its spending target this year, the highest since 2014, as its responds to a call to build up the nation’s petroleum output and reserves.  The company plans to spend 70 billion (7.95 billion pounds) to 80 billion yuan on exploration and production, CNOOC said in a press release on Wednesday, compared with an expected 63 billion yuan in capital spending for 2018.  Beijing has called on the state oil giants to increase domestic exploration to help meet strong crude demand and counter falling output from maturing fields. This came after President Xi Jinping urged oil companies in August to improve national security by boosting domestic production and reserves.  In response to the government’s call, CNOOC pledged last week to double its exploration activities and proven oil and gas reserves in China over the next seven years. The company is allocating more spending this year on domestic exploration and production, which will make up 62 percent of total expenditures versus last year’s 51 percent.  “Our main focus will be exploring for large- to medium-sized oil and gas fields ... and will speed up exploration of natural gas,” the company said in a presentation of its plans published on its website.  Domestic exploratory drilling will take up 12 billion yuan, or 76 percent of total exploration spending, while overseas work will account for the remaining 24 percent.  The 12 billion yuan compares with 10 billion yuan estimated in 2018 and is nearly double to that of 2016.  (Graphic: CNOOC offshore China operating regions link: tmsnrt.rs/2Hsle8M) In global exploration, CNOOC will speed up spending on the  Stabroek block offshore Guyana, where an Exxon Mobil-led (XOM.N) consortium that includes the Chinese company has tapped recoverable reserves of 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent.  CNOOC expect to bring six new projects, including the Egina oilfield in Nigeria and the Huizhou 32-5 oilfield in the South China Sea, on stream in 2019, the company said.  It also expects to drill 173 exploration wells this year, it said.  The company said its total oil and gas production will reach  480 million to 490 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2019, up from 475 million barrels in 2018.  It will further reduce its cost of producing a barrel of oil in 2019, said company Chief Executive Officer Yuan Guangyu at a presser, without giving a specific figure.  CNOOC’s domestic production will account for 63 percent of its total production in 2019, compared with 65 percent last year, the company said.

2019-01-23,"ADEN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Yemen’s warring parties are expected to agree on the terms of a prisoner exchange in around 10 days, a representative of the internationally recognised Yemeni government said on Wednesday. Talks between the two sides took place in Jordan last week. Both parties need to agree on lists of prisoners to be swapped. “We expect that in 10 days time the final signing will have happened,” the head of the government delegation to the prisoner-exchange talks, Hadi Haig, told Reuters by telephone. The United Nations is pushing for the exchange and a peace deal in Yemen’s main port, Hodeidah. That could open the way for more talks between the Iran-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed government on ending the country’s civil war. The swap was one of the least contentious confidence-building measures at December’s U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, held amid Western pressure to end the conflict. The fighting has lasted nearly four years, killed tens of thousands and brought 10 million people to the brink of famine. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday that it hopes to see “progress in the coming days” and urged the warring parties not to let the opportunity slip away. “This is a crucial moment for the people of Yemen,” Red Cross regional director Fabrizio Carboni said in a statement issued at a press conference in the Houthi-held capital, Sana’a. The ICRC said it was preparing for the swap by increasing staff numbers and arranging medical support. It was also preparing two planes to carry detainees between Sana’a and Sayoun, a town under the control of the Hadi government. The conflict pits the Houthis against Yemeni forces backed by a Sunni Muslim coalition, which are trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Hadi was ousted from power in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sana’a. The conflict began after pro-democracy unrest forced the former president, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh, to step down in 2012. Hadi was elected to a two-year term to head a transitional government, but the Houthis drove him into exile, prompting the coalition to intervene in Yemen in 2015. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis deny receiving help from Iran and say their revolution is against corruption.

Trading was choppy overnight as hopes of more stimulus measures from China to shore up economic growth clashed with worries over progress between Washington and Beijing to resolve a trade spat between the world’s top two economies. MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent. “The main culprit for the risk-off tone this morning is the change in sentiment around U.S.-China trade talks .... That seeped into Asia overnight and Europe this morning,” said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks MacDonald. The mood soured overnight after a report in the Financial Times that the Trump administration had rejected an offer from China for preparatory trade talks this week ahead of high-level negotiations scheduled for next week. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow denied the report, helping U.S. equities pare some losses though the fresh concerns about U.S.-China relations kept share prices in check. The report dented hopes for a thawing in U.S.-China trade tensions that have fuelled a rally in stocks through much of January, also supported by a more dovish-sounding Federal Reserve. A fresh batch of disappointing corporate updates from European companies further knocked confidence about fourth-quarter earnings, pushing European stocks lower for a third session. The pan European index was down 0.5 percent, with bourses all across Europe losing ground as a profit warning by Ingenico sent the French payment group down over 12 percent and hit the whole European tech sector. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.2 percent, stalling after climbing to a seven-week high on Monday. Australian stocks lost 0.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.1 percent. U.S. futures,, pointed to a positive start for Wall Street. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow all posted their biggest one-day percentage drops since Jan. 3 on Tuesday. In another sign of risk aversion, most euro-zone bond yields fell after the Bank of Japan set the tone for further easing by warning of rising risks to its economy ahead of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting. Markets expect the bank to acknowledge growing threats to the euro-zone economy. Justin Onuekwusi, a fund manager at Legal & General said central banks’ stimulus unwinding, China’s slowdown, the broader impact of trade wars and populist rhetoric from politicians were all keeping markets on edge. “All these issues have an impact on markets. Every time you have an increase in rhetoric, markets react. It feels like there is a greater political risk premium.” “The biggest near-term risk is that as you see markets fall, confidence drops and you get people not spending which becomes self-perpetuating. The near-term probability of that has increased.” Recent data all pointed to a rough year ahead for the world economy. U.S. home sales tumbled 6.4 percent in December, falling short of the weakest forecast, to their lowest in three years. Compared with a year earlier, they were down more than 10 percent for the first time since 2011. House price increases slowed sharply, adding to evidence of a further loss of momentum in the housing market. Canadian factory sales and wholesale trade both slumped more than expected in November, while in Germany a survey by the ZEW research institute showed morale among German investors improved slightly in January, but their assessment of the economy’s current condition deteriorated to a four-year low. Japan’s exports and imports also fell short of market expectations, with exports posting their biggest fall in more than two years. The U.S. dollar held near a three-week high after the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged as expected, boosting risk appetite and sending the yen lower. Against a basket of other currencies, the dollar was trading at 96.32, near the 96.484 hit in the previous session. The euro was a shade lower at $1.1358 but remained in close reach of a three-week low of $1.1336 set on Tuesday, weighed by recent weakness in the euro zone economy and worries about fallout from Brexit. In commodities, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures was up slightly $53.01 per barrel after shedding 1.9 percent the previous day.

2019-01-23,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom, is studying the possibility of its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) production in the Arctic as it tries to monetise its vast natural gas reserves. The discussions follow the successful launch of the Arctic-based Yamal LNG plant, controlled by Novatek, in December 2017. Russia wants to boost its global LNG market share in the next decade to around a fifth, from about 5 percent now. Russia has only two large LNG plants in operation - Yamal LNG with capacity of 16.5 million tonnes per year and Sakhalin Energy, at more than 10 million tonnes, on the eastern island of Sakhalin. Gazprom Neft announced a tender late last year for a study on how best to use its gas reserves in the Yamal region. The tender was first revealed by Interfax news agency on Tuesday. The company is seeking an analysis of oil and gas markets and ways to process its gas including in LNG form. The project is in its initial stages, a Gazprom Neft spokesman said.  The company is also considering whether to build a gas pipeline on the Arctic seabed that would connect its Novoport field to the existing Gazprom network.

2019-01-23,"LUND, Sweden (Reuters) - Might tree roots, twigs and branches one day be used to power cars? That’s what a Swedish researcher is hoping after developing a pulp byproduct that - on a modest scale - does just that. Chemical engineering scientist Christian Hulteberg, from Lund University, has used the black liquor residue from pulp and paper manufacturing to create a polymer called lignin. After purification and filtration, that is then turned into a gasoline mixture. “We’re actually using the stuff of the wood that they don’t use when they make paper and pulp... It adds value to low-value components of the tree,” he told Reuters. In environmental terms, he says that gives it an advantage over other biofuels such as ethanol. “A lot of the controversy with ethanol production has been the use of feedstock that you can actually eat,” he said. Hulteberg has a pilot plant in operation and hopes the forest fuel will be available in service stations by 2021. Though it will only serve a fraction of the demands of Swedish motorists, he is hopeful that, along with other renewable products under development, it could help wean us off our addiction to fossil fuels.

2019-01-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Crude oil markets in Europe and West Africa have made a strong start to 2019 as Libyan supply losses and strong demand in Asia offset rising U.S. exports. Nigeria’s biggest crude grade, Qua Iboe, was being offered this week at a $2 a barrel premium to benchmark dated Brent, a 10-month high. In the North Sea, Forties crude reached its highest since October on Monday.  The strength comes as global oil producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are embarking on supply curbs to boost prices, and due to other involuntary supply losses such as Libyan outages and U.S. sanctions on Iran. “We would expect some more support to be coming through for physical crude right now,” said David Reid, an analyst at JBC Energy in Vienna. “This is because we see a deficit in the crude balance from a trading perspective, which is quite pronounced this month.” In other signs of strength, Russian Urals crude in the Baltic has risen to its highest in five years, predominantly driven by a shortage of similar distillate-rich medium sour crudes. The rally was not expected by some in the market.  “I am quite surprised,” said a trader focusing on North Sea crude. “I thought there would be more pressure on the market given the extra U.S. barrels that are coming over. But there is huge demand in the Far East and outages in Libya.” The United States - not part of the OPEC-led supply-cutting pact - is sending more oil abroad and in late November exported more crude and fuel than it imported, for the first time on record. Nonetheless, unrest-related losses of crude from Libya’s largest oilfield - similar in quality to Nigerian and North Sea grades - have offset this. El Sharara, which produces 315,000 barrels per day, was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards, and traders say it remains shut. Libya is not the only place where supply is falling short. Lower supply of Algerian Saharan Blend, as well as a smaller export schedule for Kazakhstan’s CPC Blend, has drawn a number of Nigerian cargoes to northwest Europe. There, as well as the gains seen in Forties and the other four crudes that underpin dated Brent, traders say the less visible North Sea crudes are already sold out for next month, reflecting a tighter market. Indicating the same, Brent crude futures for immediate delivery are trading at a premium to the second month, as are the short-term Brent swaps called contracts for differences (CFDs) used to price dated Brent, the benchmark used around the world for physical oil trades. This structure, called backwardation, is a sign of tight supply boosting the value of oil for delivery soon. But the rest of the Brent futures curve to mid-2019 is in the opposite structure, contango, suggesting ample supply.  Some traders do not expect the strength to last, saying supply in the West African market is not tight. Not all West African crude differentials have risen - those for heavier Angolan grades are down, JBC’s Reid said, adding that poor refinery profit margins in a number of regions were a downside risk. In addition, this kind of market structure in the CFDs can act as a double-edged sword, traders say. Having oil sitting idle on a tanker for the journey from West Africa or from the North Sea to the heart of the Chinese teapot industry in Shandong becomes expensive when the market is in backwardation. “The irony is with backwardation now creeping into the CFDs, my guess is we won’t see any further price rises,” another trader said. “It takes value out of delivered-based pricing shorts.” Even so, sellers are enjoying the moment. Qua Iboe is being offered as high as dated Brent plus $2.50 by some cargo owners. A trade at that level would be the highest since 2014, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. “Sellers are very bullish,” a third trader said. “I’m a bit flummoxed as the fundamentals don’t support it.”  Graphics and additional reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-markets/graphic-opec-cuts-outages-give-physical-crude-a-new-year-lift-idUKL8N1ZN3A1,23 Jan 2019,"* Some North Sea, Nigerian differentials at multi-month

2019-01-23,"HARARE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has promised action in response to a crackdown by security forces on anti-government protesters following a hike in the price of fuel. Lawyers and activists say police and soldiers have killed at least a dozen people, wounded scores and arrested hundreds over the demonstrations. Zimbabwe’s Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) accused security forces of systematic torture. Critics say the country is reverting to the authoritarian rule that characterised the 37-year regime of former leader Robert Mugabe, who was forced from power after a coup in November 2017. The crisis will not be easy to fix. There is a severe shortage of dollars, fuel and medicines, while inflation hit 42 percent in December, the highest in a decade. Foreign investors are, by and large, staying away. Everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals. In the past two months, the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods, including medicines, food and fuel. Motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations, where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line. On Jan. 12, Mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to $3.31 per litre from $1.32 from midnight, but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash U.S. dollars. It was the final straw for some Zimbabweans, and violent protests broke out two days after his announcement. Some residents say that while calm has returned, soldiers have continued to beat up civilians. Many people blame Mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his pre-election promises to kick-start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong-arm rule of his predecessor. The country abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before. In its place, the government adopted the U.S. dollar and other currencies including sterling and the South African rand. People hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless. But over time, supply of the U.S. and South African currencies dried up, so in November 2016 authorities in Harare launched a surrogate currency - paper ‘bond notes’ designed to ease acute hard currency shortages. The notes, which now have a total face value of $400 million, are backed by a $500 million loan from the African Export and Import Bank, the central bank has said. They are used like cash. Officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1:1, on the street $1 fetches up to 3 bond notes, reflecting the ongoing shortage of U.S. dollars and people’s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency. A dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as $30 in bond notes. Companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits. When the bond note was introduced, dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value. Government borrowing via Treasury Bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold. It is these electronic dollars, theoretically worth $10 billion and nicknamed “zollars” by economists, that are raising fears that Zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade. Zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash, prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments. Zollars remain officially pegged at 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, but on the black market $1 is now worth $4 zollars. That has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments. Zimbabwe’s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks’ cover for imports, central bank data show. The government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves. But Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said Zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months. Companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment, forcing them to buy dollars on the black market. Civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country. Only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies, charities, or large international corporations are paid in U.S. dollars. Last October, the central bank ordered banks to create separate U.S. dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas, which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar. The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch. The group said its members had a backlog of $480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers. Cooking oil and soap maker Olivine Industries said on Saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers $11 million. Zimbabwe’s largest brewing company Delta Beverages, part-owned by Anheuser-Busch Inbev, said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened. Mnangagwa, a former spy chief installed after Mugabe’s removal in a coup in November 2017, was elected in July amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for Zimbabwe, and has said his nation is “open for business”. But critics say the man nicknamed “The Crocodile” is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms, including repealing Mugabe-era laws that restrict the media. Mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of U.S. sanctions against officials from the ZANU-PF ruling party, top military figures and some government-owned firms, which were imposed during Mugabe’s rule for what Washington called violations of human rights and democracy. The IMF has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country’s reform programme unless its $2 billion arrears with the World Bank, African Development Bank and European Investment Bank are paid. Harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a programme allowing the IMF to monitor its economic reforms, although it does not entail funding from the lender. Analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now, but more clashes were expected unless Mnangagwa’s administration could find a solution to the cash shortages.

2019-01-23,"(Adds comments on suspending parliament) LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal could be reformed to make it acceptable to “Leave” lawmakers in her party who object to proposals on the Irish border, prominent eurosceptic lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Wednesday. Rees-Mogg, who chairs the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), was among Conservative lawmakers who voted against May’s deal when it was overwhelmingly defeated last week, But he said he was more optimistic that changes might be made to the deal that could see it approved by parliament. “I think at last, things are going our way ... I think there is good news for us to hope that a reformation of this deal could be achieved that could make it acceptable,” he added at a think-tank event. “But ... it is not there yet and until it is, people like me will vote against the deal.” Rees-Mogg said changes to the deal would have to have equal legal status to the deal itself, and that the backstop must be somehow removed or nullified to win his vote - something the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to consider. If May is able to achieve that and win the support of the ERG head, it could be enough to persuade large numbers of other eurosceptics to vote for May’s amended deal and unlock the stymied Brexit process. Rees-Mogg said attempts under way in parliament to take the exit process out of May’s hands and delay leaving the EU were a threat to the British constitution and urged the government to do what ever it took to block them - including suspending parliament if necessary. “If the House of Commons undermines our basic constitutional conventions, then the executive is entitled to use other vestigial constitutional means to stop it – by which I basically mean prorogation,” he said, referring to the formal closure of parliament.

2019-01-23,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. oil producers sought on Wednesday to soothe OPEC’s worries about losing market share, telling the group that investors in the U.S. firms wanted a reduction in growth and higher payouts. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies such as Russia have cut output since 2017 to support oil prices, while watching producers in the United States, which is not party to the cuts, drive up production. The United States has overtaken Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s biggest crude producer. Output is approaching 12 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC’s forecasts and even U.S. government predictions have repeatedly underestimated U.S. output growth. The bosses of U.S. firms Occidental Petroleum and Hess Corp, attending a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said that growth of U.S. shale oil output would slow. The session was a rare occasion when U.S. producers and an OPEC representative, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo, sat on the same panel. “I believe not as much money will be pouring into the Permian basin this time. I believe investors will hold companies accountable for returns and a lot of this didn’t happen previously,” Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said. Echoing her comments, Hess Corp founder and Chief Executive John Hess said shale production now accounted for about 6 percent of global production. “It will probably go up to 10 percent by mid-decade but then it flattens out,” he said. But he added that U.S. resources would start to degrade. “Shale is not the next Saudi Arabia. It is an important short-cycle component,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised OPEC for manipulating prices and demanded several times last year that the group bring them down. He has also praised OPEC, and its de facto leader Saudi Arabia, when prices have fallen. Oil prices surged above $86 a barrel in October, but have since slipped back. On Wednesday, Brent was about $62. LCOc1 Barkindo said OPEC aimed to balance supply and demand and had helped the United States by rescuing its oil industry from ultra-low oil prices. “The oil industry is under siege globally,” Barkindo said, adding that OPEC wanted to talk more regularly to U.S. producers to understand their industry better even if they could not participate in any OPEC-led production cuts. In response, Hess said: “OPEC plays a very important role in stabilising the market and those efforts need to be recognised.”   Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, which represents industrialised nations, said most forecasts were still underestimating U.S. oil production growth. “There is a huge potential in the U.S.,” Birol told Reuters, adding that the United States could raise output by another 10 million bpd in the next decade.

2019-01-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Shares in RWE (RWEG.DE), Germany’s largest power producer, rose almost 5 percent on Wednesday at the prospect of higher compensation should coal-fired power stations be shut down early. A draft paper by Germany’s government-appointed coal commission, which is tasked with organising the exit from coal, showed operators of coal-fired power stations should receive compensation for early closure but did not specify the size of payments. A shut down date is due to be settled on Friday. The 133-page draft document, seen by Reuters, said a mutual agreement between the government and the plant operators, including RWE and Uniper (UN01.DE), was the preferred option. “The Commission assumes that in the negotiations with the operators of lignite-fired power plants the entire planning period up to 2030 will be settled by mutual agreement,” the draft said. If such an agreement cannot be reached by June 30, 2020, the commission will recommend a “regulatory” solution including compensation payments based on legal requirements, it said. While no figures are mentioned, the commission suggests that the compensation for operators should be based on payments made for similar cases in the past. Utilities have already received around 600 million euros ($682 million) per gigawatt to idle plants and put them into a strategic reserve. “If true, this would imply much more meaningful compensation for RWE than we currently assume,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a note following the Reuters report. Shares in RWE were the highest gainer on Germany’s blue-chip index. Shares in Uniper gained only 0.4 percent, however.  The commission consisting of politicians, researchers and lobbyists is expected to adopt a more detailed version of the paper on Friday.  According to the draft, fees for the use of electricity grids should be reduced for both industry and private consumers and operators of coal-fired power stations should receive compensation for early closure. “The necessary funds must be made available by the state to finance the recommended measures. There will be no surcharge on electricity prices,” the paper says.  The entire phase-out is to be reviewed again in 2023, 2026 and 2029 with a view to security of supply, prices, climate protection and structural change.

2019-01-23,"BRUSSELS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - European Union’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday that no-deal Brexit was the default scenario and the fact that majority of the House of Commons was against it would not prevent it from happening. “Preparing for a no-deal scenario is more important now than ever, even though I still hope that we can avoid this scenario,” Barnier told a gathering of employers and labour organisations in Brussels. “Today, there are two possible ways to leave the EU: number one, an orderly withdrawal based on the agreement that we have built step by step with the UK over the last 18 months; “Number two, a disorderly withdrawal, leaving the EU without a deal, is a default scenario and there appears to be a majority in the House of Commons to oppose a no-deal. “But opposing no-deal will not stop no-deal from happening,” he said, adding it would be necessary for the British to find a majority in favour of another solution to a disorderly exit.

2019-01-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government will fund a research facility to offer firms in Germany know-how to develop battery cells for electric vehicles (EVs), the science minister said on Wednesday, seeking to compete with Asian producers which dominate the industry. Anja Karliczek said her ministry would invest 500 million euros ($568 million) to support research into both existing and next-generation EV battery cell technology. “The German car industry shouldn’t depend on Asian suppliers,” Karliczek told a business conference in Berlin. “This is not only a question of independence, but also a question of keeping the German economy competitive.” The new facility aims to transfer known-how from Germany’s Fraunhofer science institute to private firms, helping reduce the risk for companies ready to start EV battery production. She did not give a timeline for investing the funds or say if some cash would be offered directly to German firms, support allowed in certain conditions under European Union rules on developing new technology in areas of strategic importance. The science ministry funds come on top of 1 billion euros earmarked by Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to support company alliances that are ready to invest in a large-scale production of electric car battery cells in Germany. Europe’s biggest economy wants to protect its carmaking industry and secure jobs as vehicles shift away from using combustion engines. The government would decide by mid-year where the research facility would be built and would proceed with construction swiftly after that, Karliczek said. German firms BMZ group, Liacon Batteries, Customcells, EAS Batteries and TerraE would be involved in setting up the facility, the minister said. Switzerland-based battery maker Leclanche, which has most of its production sites in Germany, would also take part. The global EV battery production is dominated by Japan’s Panasonic Corp (6752.T), South Korean makers Samsung SDI Co (006400.KS) and LG Chem (051910.KS), and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) 300750.SZ. CATL said in July it would build its first European production site in Germany and the plant would supply carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) with lithium-ion batteries. The European Commission launched its own European Battery Alliance (EBA) in 2017 in an effort to support EU production. So far, Sweden’s Northvolt has been the only serious European contender to emerge. Germany wants to lay the groundwork in the months ahead for large-scale battery production in Europe. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has said he expects investment decisions by two consortiums in the first quarter of 2019. Among companies involved in talks with Altmaier about building Germany battery cell alliances are Varta (VAR1.DE), chemical giant BASF (BASFn.DE) and Ford’s (F.N) German subsidiary Ford-Werke GmbH, sources have told Reuters.

2019-01-23,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Wednesday he hoped the French people would not choose President Emmanuel Macron’s party in European parliament elections later this year, drawing a sharp response from officials in Paris. Relations between Italy and France, generally close allies, have worsened since the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement formed a coalition government in Italy last year and took aim at pro-European Union Macron’s En Marche (On the Move) party. France has already summoned Italy’s ambassador this week after Salvini’s fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, accused Paris of creating poverty in Africa and generating mass migration to Europe. “Macron may no longer be our interlocutor (in the future),” Salvini said in an interview with Italian state-owned radio RAI. “His support is less than 20 percent. I hope the French people can shortly make different choices,” he said, referring to May’s European elections. Salvini’s comment triggered an angry reaction from France’s foreign ministry. “These unfounded statements should be read in the context of domestic Italian politics. They are unacceptable,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a daily online briefing. Italy’s ambassador had been reminded of the “boundaries” that should be observed for Franco-Italian relations to remain friendly and cooperative, the spokeswoman added. On Tuesday, Salvini said France was not interested in stabilising war-torn Libya, a staging point for smugglers who send migrants towards Europe on unsafe boats, because French energy interests there clash with Italy’s. Salvini, who is the leader of the League party, also said he is not concerned about the effect the dispute will have on the government’s effort to save troubled airline Alitalia. Italian newspapers have reported that the French-Dutch airline Air France-KLM is in talks with Rome to take a stake in the carrier. “There are other (players) in a position to take a share of Alitalia’s capital,” Salvini said.

2019-01-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar is preparing to issue a tender for energy firms seeking a stake in its gas expansion project, drawing interest from long-standing partners as well as newcomers Chevron, Norway’s Equinor and Italy’s Eni, industry sources said. Plans to expand Qatar’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, already the world’s largest, by more than a third in the next five years are considered one of the most lucrative investments in the rapidly growing global gas market. Competition is expected to be fierce. The huge interest underscores how successfully the small Gulf country positioned itself in the face of a boycott imposed in 2017 by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, which accuse Doha of supporting terrorism and their enemy Iran. Qatar denies the charge. Qatar’s state-run oil and gas company has in recent weeks held talks with several foreign energy firms that want to help build the new LNG facilities, four sources close to the discussions said. Qatar Petroleum (QP) is preparing to issue a tender seeking partners to invest in the construction of a fourth LNG train, or production line, that will see its capacity grow to 110 million tonnes a year (mtpa) from the current 78 mtpa.     The four companies that hold stakes in Qatar’s existing LNG facilities - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), France’s Total (TOTF.PA) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) - are widely expected to bid, according to the sources. Exxon, Shell, Total and Conoco declined to comment. Total and Conoco have said in the past that they hope to play a role in the expansion. A number of newcomers are also set to join the race. Officials from Chevron (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, have held talks in Doha in recent weeks and are considering bidding for a stake in the expansion, the sources said. A Chevron spokeswoman declined to comment. Norway’s national oil company Equinor (EQNR.OL) is considering submitting an offer as it seeks to expand its global LNG operations, which have lagged those of rivals, sources close to the company said. An Equinor spokesman said: “We continue to assess business development opportunities globally, but we don’t have any comments on specific regions.” Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) plans to play a role in the project, Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi recently said. Eni and QP bolstered ties in recent years after QP acquired from Eni stakes in three offshore blocks in Mexico. One Chinese state-owned company is also in the process, the sources said. Brazilian oil and gas company Petrobras considered bidding but in recent weeks decided against it, the sources said. Petrobras did not respond to a request for comment. (Graphic: LNG supply and demand - tmsnrt.rs/2mQuxSY) “Qatar’s planned LNG expansion is one of the global standout opportunities in 2019,” consultancy WoodMackenzie said. “Partner selection is ongoing, and we expect awards to be made in advance of FID (final investment decision) in 2020 ... The upstream segment alone is a world-class asset and operators will struggle to find other low-cost opportunities of this scale,” it added. “QP is unlikely to sole risk the development and will seek partners. However, suitors will need to prove they can add value to win a stake. We expect to see all the incumbents, primarily the majors, jostling for position.”  Additional reporting by Stephen Jewkes in Milan, Bate Felix in Paris, Nerijus Adomaitis in Oslo, Gram Slattery in Sao Paulo; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/qatar-lng/newcomers-pile-into-race-for-qatar-lng-idUKL8N1ZL3JV,23 Jan 2019,"* Newcomers Chevron, Equinor and Eni also eyeing role -

2019-01-23,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday he will seek to use his chairmanship of the Group of 20 leading economies to rebuild trust in the global trade system and foster  consensus on ways to address climate change. His speech to the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps was significant at a time when a bitter Sino-U.S. trade dispute is one of several factors threatening to bring about a sharp slowdown in global growth. “Japan is determined to preserve and committed to enhancing the free, open, and rules-based international order,” he told delegates. “I call on all of you ... to rebuild trust toward the system for international trade. That should be a system that is fair, transparent, and effective in protecting intellectual property rights and also in such areas as e-commerce and government procurement.” Abe said Japan hoped to work with the United States and Europe to reform World Trade Organization (WTO) rules so they adopt to a rapidly changing environment for global trade. “We have to make the WTO a more credible presence. We have to make reforms to make it more credible. Japan would like to play a leading role in WTO reforms,” he said. The WTO has been paralyzed as the United States, unhappy with what it says is the WTO’s failure to hold Beijing to account for not opening up its economy, has blocked new appointments to the world’s top trade court. Rapidly running out of judges, some analysts say the WTO will be unable to issue binding rulings in trade disputes. With the French, British and U.S. leaders cancelling their visits because of more pressing concerns at home, Abe is one of only three Group of Seven leaders attending the annual event in Davos, where business executives are worried about the damage that populism and trade protectionism are inflicting on the global economy. Abe said Japan, as chair of this year’s gathering of the Group of 20 (G20), will also seek to spearhead discussions on climate change and ways to facilitate use of digital data while protecting intellectual property. The comments underscore Japan’s hope to rally support from some of its G20 counterparts in pushing for a multilateral approach in solving trade frictions. That could help Tokyo fend off pressure from Washington to open up its politically sensitive agriculture market and take other steps to fix bilateral trade imbalances, analysts say. Japan has to be consistent on the need to promote free trade “and shouldn’t change this stance even if the United States is always talking about doing a bilateral deal,” said Takeshi Niinami, head of brewer Suntory Holdings Ltd [SUNTH.UL] and an economic adviser to Abe. Australia, Singapore and other Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries could help Japan make free trade a key topic of debate at the G20, he told Reuters. At his previous Davos visit in 2014, Abe pledged to pull the economy out of stagnation with his “Abenomics” mix of fiscal spending, ultra-easy monetary policy and steps to boost Japan’s potential growth via labor market reform and deregulation. Five years later, the boost to growth from Abenomics is fading, inflation remains far below the Bank of Japan’s target and critics point to a lack of progress on deregulation. Abe sought to counter such criticism, saying that Japan’s economic fundamentals were “very solid and robust.” He also reiterated his resolve to proceed with a scheduled rise in the rate of consumption tax in October. Aside from trade, Abe said Japan hoped to build a G20 consensus on the need to reduce plastic waste flowing into the oceans, and coordinate on global usage of digital data without infringing on personal privacy and intellectual property. “Decarbonisation and profit making can happen in tandem. We policy makers must be held responsible to make it happen, as I will be stressing in Osaka this year,” he said. People close to the premier have said Abe is keen to use the G20 summit in Osaka, western Japan, in June to boost his poll ratings ahead of an upper house election looming mid-year.

2019-01-23,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Russia should not unleash an oil price war against the United States but rather stick with output cuts even at the cost of losing market share in the medium term, one of the main Russian architects of a production pact with OPEC said. Since 2017, Russia and OPEC have cut oil production jointly for the first time in an effort to boost the price of crude. Following their supply pact, oil has traded between roughly $60 and $85 per barrel, from below $30 before the deal took effect. “For U.S. shale production to go down, you need oil prices at $40 per barrel and below. That is not healthy for the Russian economy,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of the state-backed Russian Direct Investment Fund, said on Wednesday. “We should not take competitive action to destroy U.S. shale production,” said Dmitriev, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Three years ago in Davos, Dmitriev became the first Russian official to mention publicly the possibility of a supply pact with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. At that time, oil prices had collapsed after OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia raised output to hurt higher-cost U.S. producers.     The rise in prices thanks to output cuts has brought roughly an additional $110 billion in revenues to Russia, Dmitriev said. However, higher oil prices have also helped the United States, which is not participating in output cuts. The country’s production has rocketed, overtaking that of Russia and Saudi Arabia and making it the world’s largest oil liquids producer.  U.S. production is expected to reach new highs this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Saudi Arabia later in 2019 to strengthen cooperation further, Dmitriev said. Azerbaijan, one of the largest former Soviet oil producers and a participant in the production deal with OPEC, believes the pact should be extended to the end of this year, President Ilham Aliyev said this week.  Such a move should keep oil prices in the $60 to $70 range, Aliyev said.

2019-01-23,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia will consider laws to restrict imports of French products if Paris does not withdraw plans to curb the use of palm oil in biofuels, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron.  French lawmakers last month voted to remove palm oil from the country’s biofuel scheme as of 2020, following longstanding concerns about the environmental impact of the crop that is mainly produced in Indonesia and Malaysia. Palm oil is used as feedstock for the making of biodiesel, as well as in everything from cookies and soap to lipstick. Environmental groups say the palm oil industry causes deforestation, as well as the displacement of wildlife and indigenous communities. Palm oil is a key source of revenue for Malaysia, which is the second biggest exporter of the vegetable oil.  In the letter to Macron dated Jan. 8, Mahathir called on the French leader to reject the proposed ban on palm oil in biofuels, adding the trade relationship between the two countries depended on mutual respect for each other’s commodities. “Failing in that mutual respect will force Malaysia to look at actions, including, but not limited to, suspension of EU-Malaysia free trade talks and the imposition of like-minded legislation against French exports,” Mahathir said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters on Wednesday. France’s move could lead to “regrettable economic and trade consequences” for Malaysian exporters of palm oil and French exporters, Mahathir said. A spokesman for Mahathir’s office confirmed the veracity of the letter and said the letter was sent via diplomatic channels.  Primary industries minister Teresa Kok also confirmed the authenticity of the letter.  An official at the French presidency said it was looking into the matter. Bilateral trade between the two countries totaled 3.87 billion euros ($4.4 billion )in 2017, Mahathir said in the letter.  Mahathir, who was elected to power in May last year, said the French move to limit palm oil use was discriminatory and that the vegetable oil was not responsible for deforestation.  France’s plan to limit palm oil use followed a move by European lawmakers last year to back measures to limit the use of palm oil in biofuels, ahead of an eventual ban in 2030.  Indonesia and Malaysia jointly produce 90 percent of the world’s palm oil.

2019-01-23,"PARIS (Reuters) - An expected increase in U.S. oil exports could weigh on oil prices towards the end of the year, the chief executive of French energy company Total (TOTF.PA) said on Wednesday. Speaking to France’s BFM Business TV on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Pouyanne said there were many factors weighing on oil prices, yet a key one was related to the situation in the United States. One of the main reasons as to why prices were expected to be weak was because in the United States - a major oil producer - a good part of its production was not being exported because of bottlenecks at the pipelines.  “These are being constructed, and when it will be done at the end of the year, there will be an influx of U.S. crude in the market and this will drag prices lower towards the end of the year,” Pouyanne said.

Last week, majority state-owned Orsted said it would halt the sale after it became clear there was no longer political support in Denmark for the move. “This does not have any bearing on our 200 billion Danish crowns ($30.4 billion) capital expenditure plan to 2025 and our renewable expansion target for 30 gigawatts (GW) to 2030,” Martin Neubert told Reuters. “The business is generally still for sale. There are better owners for this, that much remains clear,” he said on the sidelines of the annual Handelsblatt energy conference in Berlin. Denmark’s Social Democrats want critical infrastructure to remain in state-controlled hands. Orsted is the world’s largest offshore wind developer, with 12 GW currently in operation and under construction. Neubert said that while two major wind farm projects it was pursuing in Taiwan were on hold for now, the country remained committed to offshore wind. “We will hear more about this within the next eight weeks,” he said. Taiwanese authorities have not issued permits for power purchase agreements (PPA) for the two wind farms that Orsted hopes will open doors to more work in Asia. Neubert was also optimistic about prospects in Japan after Orsted last week signed a memorandum with the country’s power market leader Tepco to work jointly on offshore projects, including Choshi near Tokyo. “We will work out over the next few months how we can jointly handle planning, construction, operations and financing,” Neubert said. In November, Japan decided on a 10 GW target for offshore wind. Tepco, with 30 million customers and more than 50 percent of the country’s installed power plant capacity, is seeking to build in a 1.7 GW offshore zone, and views Orsted as a strong external partner, Neubert said. As for Germany, he said there should be a consensus soon for how to expand offshore wind after 2025. “We are falling behind comparable European markets such as Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands,” said Neubert, a German national. Meanwhile, the company was on the lookout for finance partners, customers and distributors for the 1.14 GW of approved capacity it will build in Germany up to 2024/2025. $1 = 6.5730 Danish crowns

2019-01-23,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s state-owned offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK) said it is confident of achieving its spending target this year, the highest since 2014, as its responds to a call to build up the nation’s petroleum output and reserves.  The company plans to spend 70 billion (7.95 billion pounds) to 80 billion yuan on exploration and production, CNOOC said in a press release on Wednesday, compared with an expected 63 billion yuan in capital spending for 2018.  Beijing has called on the state oil giants to increase domestic exploration to help meet strong crude demand and counter falling output from maturing fields. This came after President Xi Jinping urged oil companies in August to improve national security by boosting domestic production and reserves.  In response to the government’s call, CNOOC pledged last week to double its exploration activities and proven oil and gas reserves in China over the next seven years. The company is allocating more spending this year on domestic exploration and production, which will make up 62 percent of total expenditures versus last year’s 51 percent.  “Our main focus will be exploring for large- to medium-sized oil and gas fields ... and will speed up exploration of natural gas,” the company said in a presentation of its plans published on its website.  Domestic exploratory drilling will take up 12 billion yuan, or 76 percent of total exploration spending, while overseas work will account for the remaining 24 percent.  The 12 billion yuan compares with 10 billion yuan estimated in 2018 and is nearly double to that of 2016.  (Graphic: CNOOC offshore China operating regions link: tmsnrt.rs/2Hsle8M) In global exploration, CNOOC will speed up spending on the  Stabroek block offshore Guyana, where an Exxon Mobil-led (XOM.N) consortium that includes the Chinese company has tapped recoverable reserves of 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent.  CNOOC expect to bring six new projects, including the Egina oilfield in Nigeria and the Huizhou 32-5 oilfield in the South China Sea, on stream in 2019, the company said.  It also expects to drill 173 exploration wells this year, it said.  The company said its total oil and gas production will reach  480 million to 490 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2019, up from 475 million barrels in 2018.  It will further reduce its cost of producing a barrel of oil in 2019, said company Chief Executive Officer Yuan Guangyu at a presser, without giving a specific figure.  CNOOC’s domestic production will account for 63 percent of its total production in 2019, compared with 65 percent last year, the company said.

2019-01-23,"ADEN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Yemen’s warring parties are expected to agree on the terms of a prisoner exchange in around 10 days, a representative of the internationally recognised Yemeni government said on Wednesday. Talks between the two sides took place in Jordan last week. Both parties need to agree on lists of prisoners to be swapped. “We expect that in 10 days time the final signing will have happened,” the head of the government delegation to the prisoner-exchange talks, Hadi Haig, told Reuters by telephone. The United Nations is pushing for the exchange and a peace deal in Yemen’s main port, Hodeidah. That could open the way for more talks between the Iran-aligned Houthi movement and the Saudi-backed government on ending the country’s civil war. The swap was one of the least contentious confidence-building measures at December’s U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden, held amid Western pressure to end the conflict. The fighting has lasted nearly four years, killed tens of thousands and brought 10 million people to the brink of famine. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday that it hopes to see “progress in the coming days” and urged the warring parties not to let the opportunity slip away. “This is a crucial moment for the people of Yemen,” Red Cross regional director Fabrizio Carboni said in a statement issued at a press conference in the Houthi-held capital, Sana’a. The ICRC said it was preparing for the swap by increasing staff numbers and arranging medical support. It was also preparing two planes to carry detainees between Sana’a and Sayoun, a town under the control of the Hadi government. The conflict pits the Houthis against Yemeni forces backed by a Sunni Muslim coalition, which are trying to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Hadi was ousted from power in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sana’a. The conflict began after pro-democracy unrest forced the former president, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh, to step down in 2012. Hadi was elected to a two-year term to head a transitional government, but the Houthis drove him into exile, prompting the coalition to intervene in Yemen in 2015. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis deny receiving help from Iran and say their revolution is against corruption.

Trading was choppy overnight as hopes of more stimulus measures from China to shore up economic growth clashed with worries over progress between Washington and Beijing to resolve a trade spat between the world’s top two economies. MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent. “The main culprit for the risk-off tone this morning is the change in sentiment around U.S.-China trade talks .... That seeped into Asia overnight and Europe this morning,” said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks MacDonald. The mood soured overnight after a report in the Financial Times that the Trump administration had rejected an offer from China for preparatory trade talks this week ahead of high-level negotiations scheduled for next week. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow denied the report, helping U.S. equities pare some losses though the fresh concerns about U.S.-China relations kept share prices in check. The report dented hopes for a thawing in U.S.-China trade tensions that have fuelled a rally in stocks through much of January, also supported by a more dovish-sounding Federal Reserve. A fresh batch of disappointing corporate updates from European companies further knocked confidence about fourth-quarter earnings, pushing European stocks lower for a third session. The pan European index was down 0.5 percent, with bourses all across Europe losing ground as a profit warning by Ingenico sent the French payment group down over 12 percent and hit the whole European tech sector. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.2 percent, stalling after climbing to a seven-week high on Monday. Australian stocks lost 0.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.1 percent. U.S. futures,, pointed to a positive start for Wall Street. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow all posted their biggest one-day percentage drops since Jan. 3 on Tuesday. In another sign of risk aversion, most euro-zone bond yields fell after the Bank of Japan set the tone for further easing by warning of rising risks to its economy ahead of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting. Markets expect the bank to acknowledge growing threats to the euro-zone economy. Justin Onuekwusi, a fund manager at Legal & General said central banks’ stimulus unwinding, China’s slowdown, the broader impact of trade wars and populist rhetoric from politicians were all keeping markets on edge. “All these issues have an impact on markets. Every time you have an increase in rhetoric, markets react. It feels like there is a greater political risk premium.” “The biggest near-term risk is that as you see markets fall, confidence drops and you get people not spending which becomes self-perpetuating. The near-term probability of that has increased.” Recent data all pointed to a rough year ahead for the world economy. U.S. home sales tumbled 6.4 percent in December, falling short of the weakest forecast, to their lowest in three years. Compared with a year earlier, they were down more than 10 percent for the first time since 2011. House price increases slowed sharply, adding to evidence of a further loss of momentum in the housing market. Canadian factory sales and wholesale trade both slumped more than expected in November, while in Germany a survey by the ZEW research institute showed morale among German investors improved slightly in January, but their assessment of the economy’s current condition deteriorated to a four-year low. Japan’s exports and imports also fell short of market expectations, with exports posting their biggest fall in more than two years. The U.S. dollar held near a three-week high after the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged as expected, boosting risk appetite and sending the yen lower. Against a basket of other currencies, the dollar was trading at 96.32, near the 96.484 hit in the previous session. The euro was a shade lower at $1.1358 but remained in close reach of a three-week low of $1.1336 set on Tuesday, weighed by recent weakness in the euro zone economy and worries about fallout from Brexit. In commodities, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures was up slightly $53.01 per barrel after shedding 1.9 percent the previous day.

2019-01-23,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom, is studying the possibility of its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) production in the Arctic as it tries to monetise its vast natural gas reserves. The discussions follow the successful launch of the Arctic-based Yamal LNG plant, controlled by Novatek, in December 2017. Russia wants to boost its global LNG market share in the next decade to around a fifth, from about 5 percent now. Russia has only two large LNG plants in operation - Yamal LNG with capacity of 16.5 million tonnes per year and Sakhalin Energy, at more than 10 million tonnes, on the eastern island of Sakhalin. Gazprom Neft announced a tender late last year for a study on how best to use its gas reserves in the Yamal region. The tender was first revealed by Interfax news agency on Tuesday. The company is seeking an analysis of oil and gas markets and ways to process its gas including in LNG form. The project is in its initial stages, a Gazprom Neft spokesman said.  The company is also considering whether to build a gas pipeline on the Arctic seabed that would connect its Novoport field to the existing Gazprom network.

2019-01-23,"PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The French government said it has opened bids for a 300 megawatt solar power project as part of the conversion programme for its Fessenheim nuclear power plant that is due to be decommissioned by 2022. The energy ministry said on Wednesday that it had notified the European Commission of its plans to launch the 250 million euros ($284 million) project and that the EU executive arm, which must clear all state aid, had approved it on Jan. 18. “The launch of the tender shows the commitment of the government on the conversion of Fessenheim. It will help develop local electricity production from renewable energies,” French energy minister François de Rugy said in a statement. The project would be carried out in three phases and the first bids are expected in six months. Two hundred mega watts would be ground-based solar plants, 75 MW would be rooftop solar installations, while 25 MW will be smaller installations. The Fessenheim nuclear power plant, France’s oldest, operates two 900-megawatt (MW) reactors. Those reactors are due to close as part of the government’s plan to reduce France’s dependence on nuclear power, and increase the development of renewable energies. $1 = 0.8800 euros

2019-01-23,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China’s state-owned offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd set its highest capital expenditure target since 2014, responding to the government’s call for oil companies to build up the nation’s petroleum output and reserves. The company plans to spend 70 billion to 80 billion yuan ($10.3 billion to $11.8 billion) on exploration and production, CNOOC said in a press release on Wednesday, compared with an expected 63 billion yuan in capital spending for 2018. Beijing has called on the state oil giants to increase domestic exploration to help meet strong crude demand and counter falling output from maturing fields. This came after President Xi Jinping urged oil companies in August to improve national security by boosting domestic production and reserves. In response to the government’s call, CNOOC pledged last week to double its exploration activities and proven oil and gas reserves in China over the next seven years. Six new projects, including the Egina oilfield in Nigeria and the Huizhou 32-5 oilfield in the South China Sea, are expected to come on stream in 2019, the company said. CNOOC expects to drill 173 exploration wells this year, it also said. The company said its total oil and gas production will reach 480 million to 490 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2019, up from 475 million barrels in 2018. CNOOC’s domestic production will account for 63 percent of its total production in 2019, compared with 65 percent last year, the company said.

The previous record of 5.99 million tonnes was set in November. For the whole of 2018, imports grew 41 percent from 2017 to a record 53.78 million tonnes, according to the data from the General Administration of Customs. That saw China retain its position as the world’s second-buyer buyer of the super-chilled fuel after Japan, having leapfrogged South Korea in 2017. The 2018 surge came after gas shortages last winter prompted Chinese companies to buy supplies ahead of this winter, with Beijing continuing to push millions of households to shift to gas from coal for heating. But analysts at IHS Markit and Wood Mackenzie are forecasting slower growth this year, at 15-20 percent, as the government move to a more moderate stance in its coal-to-gas push. “For domestic demand, the focus (this year) of air pollution campaign has changed to clean coal rather than coal-to-gas switching,” said Lu Xiao, Beijing-based gas analyst with IHS, speaking before the customs data was released. Meantime this winter, temperatures have been higher than normal, leaving suppliers with hefty inventories. Dealers said there had been backlogs at some receiving terminals as deliveries were particularly strong in the first few weeks of the winter heating season. “Because the supplies this time somehow outpaced demand, the pressure was on how to remove the surplus,” an official from a state oil and gas importer said, speaking before the customs data was issued. However, the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media, said that oversupply had been gradually easing. State-run CNOOC, the country’s largest LNG importer, had to resell a cargo of LNG at a leased floating tanker meant for emergency demand cover, industry sources said this week. Growth in appetite for LNG has also been curbed as industrial users including some steel mills and ceramics plants had to restrict production over winter to meet China’s anti-pollution targets. Meanwhile, China’s gasoline and diesel exports last year both hit record as state refiners won more quotas to ship surplus fuel. For the whole of 2018, gasoline exports were up 23 percent from 2017 at 12.88 million tonnes, and diesel rose 7.8 percent to 18.53 million tonnes, according to the data. Diesel exports in December stood at 1.57 million tonnes and gasoline exports were 1.28 million tonnes, the data showed. Total refined fuel exports rose 12 percent last year to a record 58.64 million tonnes, customs said earlier this month. Reporting by Chen Aizhu in Singapore and Meng Meng in Beijing

2019-01-23,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates has become the latest major port to ban a type of fuel exhaust cleaning system to comply with a coming tightening in rules regarding global sulfur emissions, mirroring similar moves in Singapore and China.  Under International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules that come into effect from 2020, ships will have to reduce the sulfur content in their fuel to less than 0.5 percent, compared with 3.5 percent now, forcing huge changes upon global shippers and also oil refiners. Fujairah’s harbor master said in a faxed document seen by Reuters that the port “has decided to ban the use of open-loop scrubbers in its waters ... (and) ships will have to use compliant fuel once the IMO 2020 sulfur cap comes into force.” This follows top marine fuelling port of Singapore announcing a similar move in November, while China banned the use of open-loop scrubbers from Jan. 1, 2019. Singapore, China and Fujairah marine sales volumes represent a quarter of global ship refueling, also known as bunkering. To comply with IMO 2020 rules, shippers can switch to burning cleaner but more expensive oil, invest in exhaust cleaning systems known as scrubbers that may allow them to still use cheaper high-sulfur fuels, or redesign vessels to run on alternatives like liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Scrubbers use water to clean up fuel emissions, preventing them from being released into the atmosphere.  Open-loop scrubbers are the cheapest option, but they have come under criticism as they wash heavy metals and sulfur from the waste water into seas instead of storing it for a controlled discharge in ports, as closed-loop scrubbers do.  Of the more than 2,000 ships that have so far opted to invest in scrubbers, around three-quarters have installed the cheaper, open-loop type, shipping sources estimated.  Closed-loop scrubbers, which store wash water for later  discharge, are still accepted in most ports.  Despite the spreading bans of open-loop scrubbers, Douglas Raitt of ship classifier Lloyd’s Register said vessels can still benefit from such systems as they can pump out the waste water in open seas, outside a port’s jurisdiction.  “The benefits of open-loop scrubbers are largely realized in open water during transit from one port to the next,” he said. Ashok Sharma, managing director of shipbroker BRS Baxi in Singapore, said “the bigger ships with larger fuel consumption on long haul voyages will still realize substantial savings” from open-loop scrubbers that can pump the waste water into the ocean.       Lloyd’s Raitt said shippers should also consider alternative measures to prepare for IMO 2020, considering that when the new rules come into force refueling infrastructure will be mostly geared toward compliant low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) rather than high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO).  “Prevailing wisdom would be for operators opting for scrubbers to have a meaningful dialogue with their supplier base to secure HSFO post-2020 in ports of call,” Raitt said. In a sign of how the industry is preparing for the IMO change, Sinopec’s (600028.SS) Shanghai refinery has produced its first batch of low-sulfur bunker fuel totaling 6,000 tonnes, the company said on Wednesday. Sinopec, which is Asia’s biggest oil refiner, said the Shanghai refinery was the first in China to produce low sulfur fuel oil to meet new IMO rules.

2019-01-23,"BERLIN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Germany is planning to protect consumers and manufacturers from the impact of abandoning cheap coal-fired power, which Berlin is looking to ditch for environmental reasons, according to a government body’s draft paper. The Coal Commission, which is tasked with organising the exit from coal, said in a 133-page draft document seen by Reuters that companies and private households should be spared from heavy price increases. The commission consisting of politicians, researchers and lobbyists is expected to adopt the paper on Friday, when it will also decide on the shut down date for the last coal-fired power plant Germany. According to the draft, fees for the use of electricity grids should be reduced for both industry and private consumers and operators of coal-fired power stations should receive compensation for early closure. “The Commission assumes that in the negotiations with the operators of lignite-fired power plants the entire planning period up to 2030 will be settled by mutual agreement.” While no figures are mentioned, the commission suggests that the compensation for operators should be based on payments made for similar cases in the past. Utilities have already received around 600 million euros  ($682.02 million) per gigawatt to idle plants and put them into a strategic reserve. “The necessary funds must be made available by the state to finance the recommended measures. There will be no surcharge on electricity prices,” the paper says.

2019-01-23,"NEW YORK, (Reuters) - The MSCI global stock index ended Wednesday’s choppy trading session with a small gain as worries over U.S. politics, global economic growth and trade tensions were countered by a boost from quarterly earnings reports. However, the U.S. dollar and oil prices declined. U.S. Treasury yields climbed but analysts expect the $15.6 trillion (£11.9 trillion) market to be confined within a tight trading range due to a dearth of fresh economic data amid the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown. The U.S. dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies as uncertainty over trade and the global economy clouded the greenback’s near-term outlook and restricted it to tight trading ranges against other major currencies. “The trade conflicts and tensions, the (U.S. government) shutdown and certainly more chatter about global growth in 2019, those are the factors that need to be hashed out before we get a clear direction,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. After falling more than 1 percent in the previous day’s session, Wall Street indexes zig-zagged. Strong quarterly reports from Procter & Gamble PG.N, Comcast Corp CMCSA.O and International Business Machines IBM.N helped the Dow show the biggest gains of the day. But U.S. political uncertainty weighed heavily on investors. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in a CNN interview the United States could see zero growth in the first three months if the partial government shutdown is extended for the whole quarter. “What we’re seeing here is a very indecisive market and a market that’s very sensitive to headline news on trade and the shutdown,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York referring to Hassett’s comment. And, according to Cardillo, it didn’t help investor mood that U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued publicly over whether Trump can deliver the annual State of the Union address in the House chamber during the shutdown. “The longer the bickering goes on the longer the shutdown goes on and everyone gets affected if the economy slows,” he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 171.14 points, or 0.7 percent, to 24,575.62, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 5.8 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,638.7 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 5.41 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,025.77. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.1 percent, after the pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX lost 0.06 percent. Investors also kept a close eye on China on hopes more economic stimulus measures would ease worries over slow progress in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the United States was doing well in trade talks and that China “very much wants to make a deal.” The day before his advisers had said he would not soften his position that Beijing must make real structural reforms, including how it handles intellectual property, to reach a trade deal. “The market is shadow-boxing with speculation about trade,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies & Co. in New York. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 96.127. The index has risen nearly 1 percent over the last two weeks. The greenback was up 0.22 percent against the yen after the Bank of Japan on Wednesday kept its stimulus programme in place. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7462 percent, from 2.732 percent late on Tuesday. Oil prices slipped as the European Union sought to circumvent U.S. trade sanctions against Iran and on weaker U.S. gasoline prices. O/R U.S. crude CLcv1 settled down 0.74 percent or 39 cents at $52.62 per barrel. Brent crude futures settled at $61.14 per barrel, down 36 cents, or 0.59 percent.

2019-01-23,"PISANG BATU RIVER, Indonesia (Reuters) - Boys played and chatted on a rickety wooden ramp under a baking sun in West Java, while just below their feet flowed one of Indonesia’s most horribly polluted rivers, clogged with hundreds of tonnes of smelly trash. Authorities in the nation of 260 million are battling a lack of recycling culture or environmental awareness to achieve an ambitious target of a 70 percent cut in marine plastic debris by 2025, despite having devoted $1 billion a year to the task.   “Every time it rains and floods, the whole village goes down to help with the trash and clean the river,” said Marzuki, a resident of Tarumajaya, on the banks of the Pisang Batu river that carries along waste from villages upstream. “We never get tired of it, but the trash never stops coming.” Yet the river is just one of many thickly carpeted with trash formed mostly of plastic waste, of which Indonesia churns out about 3.2 million tonnes each year, with nearly half ending up in the sea, a 2015 study in the journal Science showed. The archipelago of more than 17,000 islands is estimated to be the world’s second-largest contributor of plastic pollutants in the oceans after China, the study added.   “Even though we’ve brought an armada of 25 garbage trucks that take three turns every day, the reality is...we haven’t cleared even half of it,” said Suseno, the village security chief in Tarumajaya. As Java struggles with its rivers, the resort island of Bali this year banned the use of plastic bags by large supermarkets and grocery stores, a measure it aims to widen to smaller shops. Yet that caused its own backlash. “I’ve seen people protest because they didn’t get plastic bags after they shop,” said one supermarket shopper, Thomas Wibowo, while adding that he understood the need to cut back.  “But if we are suddenly forbidden from using plastic, as Indonesians, we’d be shocked.” The risks to marine life were graphically highlighted last November, when a dead sperm whale on a beach was found to have 6 kg (13lb) of plastic waste in its stomach. “I think this is also a global issue, not just a national problem,” said Ida Bagus Rai Dharmawijaya Mantra, the mayor of Bali’s capital of Denpasar. “I’ve seen that a lot of citizens are accepting and helping of this movement, including tourists. They too want to help replace plastic bags.” Reporting by Yuddy Cahya at Pisang Batu River and Sultan Anshori and Wayan Sukarda in Denpasar; Writing by Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/indonesia-environment-plastics/the-trash-never-stops-indonesia-battles-to-clean-up-rivers-idUKL3N1ZN20V,23 Jan 2019,"Boys played

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was mostly unchanged, stalling after climbing to a seven-week high on Monday. The Shanghai Composite Index was last up 0.1 percent, having flitted in and out of the red. Australian stocks were a shade lower and Japan’s Nikkei nudged up 0.2 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow all posted their biggest one-day percentage drops since Jan. 3 on Tuesday. Following a sharp drop in December, U.S. shares gained through much of January, supported in part by expectations for a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions and a more dovish-sounding Federal Reserve. That also prompted global investors to plow into riskier assets. But putting a dent on sentiment again was a report by the Financial Times that the Trump administration had rejected an offer from China for preparatory trade talks this week ahead of high-level negotiations scheduled for next week. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow denied the report, helping U.S. equities pare some losses though the fresh concerns about U.S.-China relations kept share prices in check. Data published over the last 24 hours all pointed to a rough year ahead for the world economy. U.S. home sales tumbled 6.4 percent in December, falling short of the weakest forecast, to their lowest in three years. Compared with a year earlier, they were down more than 10 percent for the first time since 2011. House price increases slowed sharply, adding to evidence of a further loss of momentum in the housing market. Canadian factory sales and wholesale trade both slumped more than expected in November, while in Germany a survey by the ZEW research institute showed morale among German investors improved slightly in January, but their assessment of the economy’s current condition deteriorated to a four-year low. Japan’s exports and imports also fell short of market expectations, with exports posting their biggest fall in more than two years. As expected the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy easy and trimmed its inflation forecast on Wednesday with the domestic economy facing headwinds. The latest weak indicators came after the IMF trimmed its global growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 on Monday, in its second downgrade in three months, just after China reported its 2018 growth slipped to the worst level in nearly three decades. “Risk asset prices have been essentially supported just by easing of U.S. rate hike expectations,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro-economics strategy at HSBC Securities. “Economic data has been weak and the U.S. government shutdown should be hurting economic sentiment, but even that has been considered as positive for risk assets, on the grounds that they make it difficult for the Fed to raise rates.” U.S. bond prices rebounded, with the benchmark 10-year yield slipping to 2.741 percent from Friday’s peak of 2.799 percent, the highest since Dec. 27, with money market futures  pricing out any chance of a Fed rate hike this year. The euro weakened against the dollar under the weight of recent weakness in the euro zone economy and worries about fallout from Brexit. The common currency traded at $1.1365, having hit a three-week low of $1.1336 on Tuesday. The dollar rose 0.35 percent to 109.73 yen, recovering the previous day’s losses. In commodities, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dipped 0.02 percent to $52.99 per barrel after shedding 1.9 percent the previous day.

2019-01-23,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Singapore’s Golden Investments said on Wednesday that it will seek a board position at Australia’s Stanmore Coal Ltd (SMR.AX) as its biggest shareholder, despite the failure of a A$240 million ($171 million) takeover bid. Golden Investments, which bought a 19.9 percent stake in Stanmore Coal in November and launched a full takeover bid at A$0.95 a share, said it held 25.5 percent of the Australian firm following the closure of its bid on Tuesday.  The company, majority owned by Golden Energy and Resources (GOLD.SI), was attracted by Stanmore’s Australian jurisdiction, high grade coking coal deposits and existing infrastructure, but its bid fell well short of an independent expert’s valuation. “Their offer was just too low,” said Matthew Keane of broker Argonaut Securities in Perth. Stanmore Coal operates the Isaac Plains complex, which produces semi-soft coking coal and thermal coal. It has several extension projects with higher quality coal, as well as a portfolio of other greenfield coking and thermal coal assets.  The independent expert valued the company at A$1.48 to A$1.90 a share. The shares were trading at A$0.96 on Wednesday afternoon. “We look forward to meeting soon with the Chairman and Board of Stanmore Coal and will seek board representation,” Golden Investments director Mark Zhou said in a statement. Golden Investments, which had lined up financial backing from Credit Suisse, is 51 per cent owned by resources investor Golden Energy and Resources, which is in turn majority owned by Indonesia’s Sinar Mas Group.

2019-01-23,"* Repeats Jan. 22 column with no changes. * John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Ho3ICn By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production will continue to grow through 2019 and 2020, but at a much slower pace than in 2018, according to the latest forecasts from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. U.S. crude and condensates production is estimated to have risen by almost 1.6 million barrels per day last year, according to the agency, the largest annual increase in history. But the agency forecasts growth will slow to just over 1.1 million barrels per day in 2019 and less than 0.8 million bpd in 2020 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, Jan. 15). Growth from the Lower 48 states excluding federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to slow even more sharply from almost 1.6 million bpd in 2018 to 0.95 million bpd in 2019 and 0.5 million bpd in 2020. Surging U.S. production, mostly from onshore shale plays, contributed to the oversupply which emerged in the oil market during 2018 and the consequent fall in prices during the fourth quarter. Slower growth from the shale plays will therefore have to play an important role in rebalancing the market during 2019 and 2020, even if the global economy avoids a recession (tmsnrt.rs/2Ho3ICn). “The dramatic fall in oil prices in the fourth quarter was largely driven by shale production surprising to the upside as a result of the surge in activity earlier in the year”, oilfield services firm Schlumberger told investors last week. The shale surge, combined with generous waivers from U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports and the sharp fall in global equity markets, “created a near perfect storm to close out 2018”, according to Schlumberger. But the company sees a more balanced market ahead as sanctions waivers are not renewed, the United States and China resolve their trade differences, and lower drilling activity in the second half of 2018 impacts production growth (“Schlumberger announces full-year and fourth-quarter 2018 results”, Schlumberger, Jan. 18). Benchmark U.S. crude futures peaked at around $75 per barrel in early October and are now trading at less than $55, the largest decline since the slump in 2014/15. U.S. crude futures have fallen to a substantial discount to Brent, and many shale producers are receiving even less, highlighting the extent of the local oversupply. Lower U.S. crude prices are already helping readjust the market by tempering the onshore drilling and fracking frenzy compared with earlier last year (“Drilling productivity report”, EIA, Dec. 17). Well completions steadied between March and November 2018, after strong growth since mid-2016, as some producers postponed fracking and completing wells owing to disappointing wellhead prices. More recently, the rising number of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) has prompted producers to scale back drilling programmes to avoid an even bigger increase in inventory. The number of drilling rigs targeting predominantly oil-bearing formations has fallen in each of the first three weeks of 2019. Active oil-targeting rigs have fallen by from a cyclical high of 888 in mid-November to just 852 in the third week of January. Last week, the active rig count fell by 21, the largest one-week decline since February 2016, when oil prices were still close to the last cyclical trough. Oil prices usually have a lagged effect on production owing to the time taken to contract rigs, move them to the site and rig them up, bore the well, contract a completion crew, frack, install surface gear and hook the well up to gathering pipelines. Experience suggests changes in oil prices tend to filter through to changes in reported production with an overall delay of 9-12 months. Recent production trends confirm this lag. There is a delay of roughly 3-4 months from changes in prices to changes in drilling and another 6-9 months to completion and initial flows. Changes in prices tend to filter through to changes in the rig count with an average delay of 15-20 weeks; last week’s sudden drop came 15 weeks after oil prices peaked in early October. Rapid output growth during 2018 was mostly the delayed impact of the sharp rise in prices in 2017 and the first nine months of 2018. Output is expected to continue growing during the first six months of 2019, as wells planned during the period of high prices and drilled in the final months of 2018 are completed and put into production. But the recent decline in prices and drilling, if sustained, will likely start to slow production growth during the second half of 2019.

2019-01-23,"SINGAPORE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices extended falls from the previous session on Wednesday, as concerns of an economic slowdown weighed on markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.74 per barrel at 0024 GMT, down 27 cents, or 0.5 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. The decline followed a 2 percent fall in crude oil futures and a slump in global financial markets on Tuesday as concerns over global growth spooked investors into looking for safe-haven assets like government bonds or gold. A global economic downturn is widely expected to also dent fuel demand growth, weighing on energy prices. Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Denmark’s Saxo Bank, said in a first quarter 2019 outlook that “the global economy is suffering” but added that China’s government will do all it can for stability. A key support would be for the United States and China to find a solution to their bitter trade dispute, Jakobsen said, but to prevent a sharp economic slowdown, a solution needs to show itself before Feb. 5, the Chinese New Year. Should a deal be reached by then, “we will see powerful support for the Chinese economy”, he said, as well as the launch of strong stimulus programmes to keep the economy growing. Despite this, Jakobsen warned that stimulus programmes could not keep the economy going forever, and there was a large risk of another downturn in 2020.

2019-01-23,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The number of people who died in a gasoline pipeline explosion in central Mexico late last week has risen to 96, government officials said on Tuesday, from 91 reported a day earlier. The explosion last Friday occurred after hundreds of people  crowded in to collect gasoline gushing from a pipeline that had been ruptured by suspected fuel thieves near to the town of Tlahuelilpan in the state of Hidalgo. Hidalgo’s government said in a statement that 96 people had been confirmed dead from the explosion, the worst to affect Mexico’s troubled oil infrastructure in several years. Another 48 people were receiving treatment for their injuries, it added. Central Mexico had been hard-hit by gasoline shortages since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador launched a crackdown on fuel theft nearly a month ago, ordering pipelines closed in an effort to stamp out criminal activity.
