2018-10-03,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated a proponent of his administration’s plan to subsidize aging coal and nuclear plants to a federal agency that regulates power transmission, a move criticized by environmental groups who questioned his independence on the issue. Trump nominated Bernard McNamee to the vacant seat of the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent office of the Department of Energy, for a term expiring June 30, 2020. McNamee, a Republican, is now the head of the policy office at the department. McNamee helped to roll out last year a plan by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize aging coal and nuclear plants. The coal industry is suffering because of an abundance of cheap natural gas and an expansion of wind and solar power.  Coal and nuclear plants are integral to making the power grid reliable and resilient, or able to bounce back quickly from storms, hacking or physical attacks, the Energy Department has said.  An unusual coalition of natural gas drillers, renewable power groups, power grid operators and consumer advocates opposed Perry’s plan. FERC rejected it in January in a setback for Trump. Environmentalists decried McNamee’s nomination. The Sierra Club’s Mary Anne Hitt said the Trump administration is “trying to use FERC to manipulate America’s electricity markets to bail out dirty and expensive coal plants ... while locking in a fossil fuel future for communities across the country.”  Neither the White House, nor the Department of Energy immediately responded to requests for comment about criticism that McNamee could not be independent in any commission votes on plant bailout plans. In June, Trump ordered Perry to take emergency measures to slow down the closure of coal and nuclear plants, arguing those facilities boost U.S. energy security because they can store months of fuel on site.  Perry told reporters last week that he was waiting for the executive branch to respond to his agency’s ideas on the emergency measures, saying they were still being “bandied about” at the White House. Coal mining and mining and industrial communities form part of Republican Trump’s base and he has returned the favor of their support by overturning Obama-era regulations. His administration axed a moratorium on coal mining on federal lands, proposed a weaker plan to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, and announced its intent to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement on curbing greenhouse gases. McNamee needs to be confirmed by the Senate. He would replace Robert Powelson, a Republican, who resigned. The Commission currently has two Democrats and two Republicans.

2018-10-03,"* Firms give in to opposition from Norway * Purchase price still subject to negotiation * Gazprom was keen on North Sea know-how (Adds details, background, quotes) By Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Austrian energy group OMV said it had agreed to buy Siberian gas assets from Gazprom instead of swapping them for some of its own assets, giving in to opposition from Norway to the initial plans. OMV agreed in 2016 to swap 38.5 percent of its Norwegian assets for 24.98 percent of the Russian company’s Achimov IV and V phase development in the Urengoy gas fields. It had hoped to seal the deal by the end of this year. However, sources told Reuters in May that the Austrian group might buy the assets outright after Norway criticised the plan to give Russia’s largest natural gas producer access to its continental shelf. “The ‘basic sale agreement’ replaces the ‘basic agreement’ concluded between OMV and Gazprom on December 14, 2016,” OMV said in a statement. The purchase price will be “negotiated in good faith”, it said. Of the 10 billion euros ($12 billion) set aside for acquisitions to 2025, OMV has so far spent 2 billion. It is also negotiating the price for its planned purchase of a 50 percent stake in Malaysian Sapura Energy Bhd’s upstream business. Last year, OMV paid 1.75 billion euros for a stake in the Yuzhno Russkoye field, one of Russia’s largest gas fields, which added 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day to its production. In 2016, OMV said that the Siberian Achimov assets would add more than 80,000 boe per day by 2025. For OMV, production in the area is cheap and pipelines to Austria are available. The Austrian group is one of Gazprom’s partners in building the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is planned to double Russia’s capacity to pipe gas across the Baltic Sea to Europe. The original swap deal would have allowed Gazprom access to technological know-how in Norway. However, OMV managers have said that Gazprom will benefit just as much from OMV’s technological expertise in developing the fields in Russia. Once a purchase price has been agreed, the deal will be subject to regulatory and corporate approvals. The signing of the final transaction documents is expected early next year.

2018-10-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world were up slightly on Wednesday amid signs that Italy would cut its budget deficits in coming years, but U.S. Treasuries yields hit multi-year highs after strong U.S. jobs data, while oil prices saw 4-year highs ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran exports.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to a record high helped by U.S. data showing private sector payrolls saw the biggest monthly gain since February. Financial stocks gained from a rebound in European markets and rising Treasury yields.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 54.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 26,828.39, the S&P 500 gained 2.08 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,925.51 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.54 points, or 0.32 percent, to 8,025.09. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.02 percent. U.S. Treasury yields reached multi-year peaks, with the 10-year note’s yield at its highest since 2014 and maturities at the short end of the curve at decade highs, after economic data bolstered the case for the Fed to raise interest rates in December. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 30/32 in price to yield 3.1662 percent.  The 30-year bond last fell 67/32 in price to yield 3.3206 percent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was on track for its largest daily jump since the U.S. presidential election in November 2016 as U.S. service sector activity hit a 21-year high and the ADP private payrolls data for September came in stronger than expected. “Just the recognition of the Fed saying the economy is good, that means they are not going to slow down any time soon the rate of rate increases,” said Mike Baele at managing director at U.S. Bank Private Client Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon. The U.S. dollar also gained after the release of the ADP data, which comes ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday. Stock markets around the world initially rose after a report  said Italy’s deficit would fall to 2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2.0 percent in 2021 from the 2.4 percent earlier outlined, easing concerns that Italian budget deficits could deepen its debt problems and stoke conflict with the European Union. Italian 10-year borrowing costs eased off 4-1/2-year highs, after jumping 50 basis points since budget details emerged last Thursday. Two-year yields fell 10 bps. The improved mood toward Italy also reduced the premium investors demand for holding Italian risk relative to that of safer Germany to around 290 bps, down from a five-year high over 300 bps on Tuesday, and sapped demand for safe-haven assets such as German bonds and Swiss franc. “Today, so far, has been better-than-expected performance out of Europe,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.  The pan-European equity index rose 0.5 percent, while the Milan bourse jumped more than one percent. The moves were led by an initial 3.1 percent bounce in Italian banks.  Lingering concerns about Italy’s budget negotiations continued to weigh on the euro, which was down 0.3 percent to $1.1517. The single currency hit a six-week trough of $1.1506 on Tuesday after an Italian lawmaker said his country might be better off with its “own currency.” In oil, Brent crude rose nearly 2.0 percent after hitting a four-year high as the market focused on upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran while shrugging off the year’s largest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles and reports of higher Saudi Arabian and Russian production. [O/R] Brent crude rose $1.49, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $86.29 a barrel, after hitting $86.74, its highest since Oct. 30, 2014.

2018-10-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude rose nearly 2 percent after hitting a four-year high on Wednesday as the market focused on upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran while shrugging off the year’s largest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles and reports of higher Saudi Arabian and Russian production. “Nothing matters between here and Nov. 4,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York, referring to the date when U.S. sanctions take full effect. “You just had the biggest build this year, and the market rallied right through it.” U.S. crude inventories jumped 8 million barrels last week, quadruple analysts’ expectations and the biggest build since March 2017, the Energy Information Administration said. [EIA/S]      Brent crude LCOc1 rose $1.49, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $86.29 a barrel, after hitting $86.74, its highest since Oct. 30, 2014. U.S. crude CLc1 settled $1.18, or 1.6 percent, higher at $76.41 a barrel, after touching a session high of $76.90.  Both benchmarks dipped briefly after the U.S. government released inventory figures, then resumed their climb. “The speculative community took an opportunity to buy on the dip,” Yawger said.   Earlier in the session, crude had been pushed lower as Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom had raised output to 10.7 million barrels per day in October and would pump more in November. The record high for Saudi output is 10.72 million bpd in November 2016. Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the United States before a meeting in Algiers with other producers, four sources familiar with the plan told Reuters. Iran, however, accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of breaking OPEC’s agreement on output cuts by producing more crude, adding that the two countries would not be able to produce enough oil to make up for a reduction in Iranian exports. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have been limiting supply since 2017 to get rid of a glut. They partially relaxed the cut in June, under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to cool prices.  One analyst said the Saudi plan to pump more would not change much. “Saudi is still very timid, the market wants to see something more proactive,” said Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob. “That’s why the market is not reacting very much to the different headlines.” Additional reporting by Alex Lawler and Henning Gloystein; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-12-brent-hits-new-four-year-high-on-iran-supply-worries-idUKL4N1WJ0DT,03 Oct 2018,"* Saudi Arabia, Russia agreed in Sept to lift oil output

2018-10-03,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he and U.S. President Donald Trump spoke by telephone on Wednesday about boosting economic development in Mexico and Central America in order to stem illegal migration. The phone call came after Mexico, the United States and Canada agreed on a new trilateral trade deal late Sunday, which Lopez Obrador hailed as a “good accord” that would create economic certainty and encourage investment. The two leaders also discussed “a next step,” agreeing on investment among Mexico, Canada and the United States to aid development in Central America and Mexico to tackle “the migration phenomenon,” said Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1. “He looks favorably on it,” the leftist Lopez Obrador told reporters at the Mexico City airport, referring to Trump. The Mexican president-elect added that representatives of his incoming government would travel to the United States in the next few days, including the foreign minister-designate, Marcelo Ebrard. It was a “great call,” Trump tweeted, with Lopez Obrador, adding that “we will work well together!” The White House said in a statement that Trump and Lopez Obrador discussed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and “expressed their pleasure with the agreement and noted it would make the region stronger and more competitive.” Lopez Obrador said a plan was being put together for development projects across the country. They ranged from a new oil refinery to a train connecting parts of southern and eastern Mexico that his team has discussed. The projects belonged to a “general development plan” that would require more than $30 billion in total investments, he said. It was not clear how much would be divided between public and private investors, or between countries. Before the July election, Lopez Obrador said he wanted to reach a deal with Trump to prioritize development in Mexico’s poorer south and in Central America to stem illegal immigration, which has caused tensions between Washington and Mexico. Trump provoked widespread outrage in Mexico when he described Mexican migrants as rapists and drug-runners during his own election campaign. He also pledged to build a southern border wall to stop migrants, saying Mexico would pay for it. Lopez Obrador has shied away from addressing the wall to avoid clashing with Trump. He said in the run-up to the Mexican election, however, that U.S. money would be better spent on aiding development south of the border than on a wall. Lopez Obrador said U.S. Vice President Mike Pence would attend his inauguration, not Trump.

2018-10-03,"MOSCOW/DUBAI (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the United States before a meeting in Algiers with other producers, four sources familiar with the plan said. U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for high crude prices and called on it to boost output to bring down fuel costs before the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6. The deal underlines how Russia and Saudi Arabia are increasingly deciding oil output policies bilaterally, before consulting with the rest of OPEC. The sources said Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak agreed during a series of meetings to lift output from September through December as crude headed toward $80 a barrel. It is now over $85. “The Russians and the Saudis agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on Trump’s order to pump more,” one source said.  “The Saudi minister told (U.S. Energy Secretary Rick) Perry that Saudi Arabia will raise output if its customers asked for more oil,” another source said.     Originally, the two countries had hoped to announce an overall increase of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Saudi-led OPEC and non-OPEC Russia at a gathering of oil ministers in Algiers at the end of September. But with opposition from some in OPEC, including Iran which is subject to U.S. sanctions, they decided to defer any formal decision until a full OPEC meeting in December. “Saudi is trying to thread a needle with a rope by satisfying customer concerns about higher oil prices, but also wanting to keep prices from falling and sending the wrong price signal to industry which absolutely needs to continue to invest to prevent a supply crunch,” Yasser Elguindi, energy market strategist at consultancy Energy said. Executives at the world’s biggest oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to loosen the purse strings to replenish reserves and halt declines in crude production after years of austerity. Since the meeting in Algiers, Reuters has reported that Riyadh planned to lift output by some 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd from September to help fill the gap left by lower Iranian output due to the sanctions. Russian output rose 150,000 bpd in September. Iran accused Saudi Arabia and Russia on Wednesday of breaking OPEC’s agreement on output cuts by producing more crude, adding that the two countries would not be able to produce enough oil to make up for a reduction in Iranian exports. A source at a major Russian oil company told Reuters: “I would expect Russia’s oil production will hover at around 11.4 to 11.6 million bpd until the end of 2018 and may increase further to 11.8 million bpd later on in 2019.”  Russian produced 11.36 million bpd in September, up from 11.21 million bpd in August, Energy Ministry data showed. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday it could raise production by 200,000 to 300,000 bpd to tackle possible fuel shortages while Falih said Saudi Arabia will increase output further in November from 10.7 million bpd. Perry was made aware of the Saudi-Russia plan to lift output before the Algiers gathering, meeting with Falih three times in September and Novak once. The three did not meet together.     Perry’s spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes did not comment on details of the talks but said the energy secretary, “continues to be engaged with leaders from other major oil producing nations and remains confident in their ability to boost output if needed”. She said Perry had in recent meetings “impressed upon his counterparts that keeping supply up is important for the global economy”. Oil prices rose to $85 a barrel this week as buyers of Iranian crude wound down their purchases to meet the terms of U.S. sanctions on Tehran.       Sources said Riyadh would help fill that shortfall because buyers needed replacement supplies. Saudi Arabia has spare capacity to produce oil at a higher rate and holds a large volume of crude in storage.  At the same time, Saudi Arabia is keen to maintain unity among the so-called OPEC+ alliance, a group comprising OPEC states, Russia and several other producers that has agreed on output curbs. That’s because it may need to change course and seek the collaboration of OPEC+ for any future production cuts. “Iranian crude exports are considerably lower and market participants are concerned of a wide market deficit this quarter,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at Swiss bank UBS. “To cover those losses, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other Gulf countries are increasing production, but this will bring  down the global spare capacity to a 10-year low.” In the run up to the private deal with Russia, Falih flew to the United States during the second week of September where he and fellow Texas A&M University alumnus Perry attended a football game in College Station, Texas. Falih then held official talks with Perry in Washington on Sept. 10, the U.S. Energy Department has said. Perry flew to Moscow two days later to meet Novak, while Falih also met Novak in Moscow a day later. Perry told Reuters during his Moscow visit that Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia had enough capacity between them to compensate for the loss of Iranian supply over the next 18 months. After Moscow, Falih and Perry met again in Vienna where they attended an event in the Austrian capital, sources said. “Perry was aware that Russia is going to ramp up oil output,” a third source familiar with talks said. It was at this point that Falih and Novak discussed announcing a 500,000-bpd increase at the Sept. 23 Algiers meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The plan did not materialize, with any formal decision deferred until a regular OPEC meeting in Vienna on Dec. 6. “Saudi Arabia is not going to flood the market and risk a price crash. Saudi Arabia has to work with other producers and see what are they doing, who is raising exports and to which market,” another source said.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the United States before a meeting in Algiers with other producers. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s petroleum sector are set to take effect next month after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May. Washington wants to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero by November, and is encouraging producers such as Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia to pump more to meet the shortfall. “If Iran is under sanctions, the price of oil would rise and Russia and Saudi Arabia cannot do anything to supply additional oil to the market,” Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili was quoted as saying by SHANA, the oil ministry’s news agency. Kazempour Ardebili, Iran’s representative on OPEC’s board of governors, said that U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil were “impossible”, and called on Trump to return to the nuclear deal with Tehran. “Mr Trump is very angry with some countries for not being able to replace the Iranian oil and has expressed this anger in his remarks to the Saudi king and to OPEC for not increasing output,” he said. “If we look at the two countries’ rise of production in comparison to their commitments in the Declaration of Cooperation, we see Saudi Arabia and Russia have had respectively a 346,000 and 250,000 BPD output rise, and this production rise is a violation to the (OPEC) agreement on output cut,” Kazempour Ardebili said. Since the meeting in Algiers, Reuters has reported that Riyadh planned to lift output by some 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd from September to help fill the gap left by lower Iranian output due to the sanctions. Russian output rose 150,000 bpd in September.

The price of aluminium, the product made from alumina, climbed 5.5 percent to its highest since June. The decision also triggered a shutdown of Hydro’s Paragominas bauxite mine, which supplies Alunorte, and will lead to the imminent closure of the nearby Albras aluminium smelter, Chief Executive Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said. “Thousands of people will be without jobs,” Hydro Chief Executive Svein Richard Brandtzaeg told a conference call, adding that about 3,000 of those were employees and contractors at Alunorte and 1,700 were workers at Paragominas. He did not give a number for how many could be laid off at the Albras smelter. The closures will have “significant operational and financial consequences” Hydro said in a statement. Alunorte made 6.4 million tonnes of alumina in 2017, about 10 percent of global production outside China and enough to make some 3 million tonnes of aluminium. Its partial shutdown earlier this year drove up market prices for alumina and aluminium. The original output cut occurred after the company admitted making unlicensed emissions of untreated water during heavy rains, but while Hydro said its problems have been fixed, it has yet to convince authorities to allow a restart. The decision to halt all production was taken as the refinery’s waste deposit area is close to full capacity and the ongoing dispute is preventing Hydro from using a newly created residue facility, it said. The company declared force majeure earlier this year on some alumina deliveries from Brazil, and now plans to expand this declaration, Brandtzaeg said. “We will continue to work constructively with the authorities to lift the embargo and to resume operations in order to re-establish Alunorte as the world’s leading alumina refinery,” Hydro added. Shares of Alcoa, a major producer of both alumina and aluminium, rose more than 9 percent in early U.S. trading, while Century Aluminium, which outsources alumina production, initially fell by 17 percent.

2018-10-03,"HAWASSA, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told members of his ruling coalition that “an attack on one is an attack on all” on Wednesday as he pushed for unity after months of ethnic violence.  Abiy has presided over a series of jolting political and economic changes since coming to office in April - making peace with arch-foe Eritrea, freeing political prisoners, pledging to open up the state-controlled economy and promising to overhaul the security services. But the reforms have not stopped ethnically-charged violence that has escalated since he was named premier - including in his own native Oromiya region where protesters first took to the streets in 2015 over perceived marginalisation by the state. “If we are see a developed Ethiopia, we should not commit violence on the basis of ethnicity or religion,” he told about 1,000 delegates at the congress of Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in the southern city of Hawassa. “An attack on one is an attack on all. The displaced of one is the displacement of all. The death of one is the death of all,” he added. Abiy has promised to push for reconciliation and allowed the leadership of the separatist Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) - previously outlawed as a terrorist organisation - as well as the opposition group Patriotic Ginbot 7 to return from exile. But the fighting has continued. Clashes about 150 km (90 miles) from Hawassa between two ethnic groups, the Oromos and Gedeos, have forced nearly a million people to flee their homes since Abiy took power.     Last week, more than 70,000 people - mostly ethnic Oromos - were targeted by members of other groups in the western state of Benishangul-Gumuz, regional officials said. Abiy, the first leader from the Oromo ethnic group in Ethiopia’s modern history, used his speech to praise past leaders as he sought to reassure the coalition after his changes. “A country develops through transitions and a handover of leadership. The new generation should not blame the old  generation but be grateful for their achievements and sacrifice,” he said. “It is not about wiping out history - a history that has brought us here,” Abiy told the audience, many of them wearing T-shirts and hats emblazoned with the logos of the four ethnic groupings in the EPRDF. There was scattered applause through his remarks in a large conference hall. The 42-year-old former army officer who speaks three Ethiopian languages has delighted many in the country and among its Western backers by ending the military standoff with Eritrea. But there were signs the rapid changes had caused misgivings in some quarters. Two people were killed and scores wounded in a grenade attack on a rally attended by Abiy in June. The Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, an ethnic Tigrayan movement that had dominated the EPRDF until Abiy’s rise and led the fight against Mengistu, initially warned against making concessions to Eritrea. Abiy took over after street protests forced the resignation of the last prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, in February. Wednesday’s congress was the party’s first since the unrest started to spread in 2015.

2018-10-03,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Global energy bosses assembled in Moscow on Wednesday said the world needed Russian gas to keep the lights on, in a clear message to U.S. President Donald Trump who has warned he may impose sanctions on Russian gas export projects. Trump’s administration, citing what it calls Russia’s failure to act as a good global citizen, has said it may take steps to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which will increase the volumes Russia can export to northern Europe. The U.S. position has prompted a backlash from the Kremlin, and from business groups in Germany, and on Wednesday leading figures in the global energy industry attending a forum in the Russian capital joined the chorus. While not explicitly singling out Trump’s policies for criticism, they said Russian gas was a vital part of the energy mix and that liquefied natural gas, touted by Washington as a viable alternative, was too expensive. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) CEO Ben van Beurden said if the U.S. imposes sanctions on export projects, his company will have no choice but to abide by those restrictions. But he added: “It’s clear that Europe will need more imports, indigenous production in Europe is in decline, we will need to import in Europe from multiplicity of sources.” “Russia has been a very reliable supplier of gas for many decades ... The cost of supply of Russian gas is probably one of the most competitive,” he said at the forum. Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive of French oil major Total (TOTF.PA), said LNG produced at Russia’s Yamal project was highly competitive, with more competitive projects still to come. “I think it’s just only (the) start of the story and this will be one of the largest provinces for natural gas in the world.” Both Shell and Total have a vested interest in keeping Russian gas flowing to world markets. Shell is an investor with Russia’s Gazprom in the Sakhalin-2 LNG project off Russia’s Pacific coast, while Total is an investor in the Yamal project. Saudi Arabia is Russia’s rival on the global oil market, but Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who was also at the energy forum, said the world needed Russian gas.  He said national energy firm Saudi Aramco wanted to be involved in delivering Russian LNG to world markets, including to Saudi Arabia. “There are great resources, great conditions (in Russia) and the market forces here in Russia are very conducive to globalisation and to allowing this competitive healthy process of bringing the cheapest resources to the markets,” he said. The Trump administration has sought to sanction Russian export pipelines before, but stayed its hand after intense lobbying from the European Union (EU) and business groups. But the issue has returned to Washington’s agenda this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin told the forum that Russian gas exports to the EU would this year reach a record level of 200 billion cubic meters. He said that LNG imports from the United States were 30 percent more expensive than Russian gas, and that the German economy would be rendered uncompetitive if it had to rely on the U.S. imports. Referring to the U.S. President’s warnings of sanctions, Putin said: “I understand Donald, he’s fighting for his country’s interests, for his industry, and he’s right to do that.” “But in this case American LNG on the European market is more expensive, not by a bit but by 30 percent. That’s way too much.” Additional reporting by Oksana Kobzeva, Olesya Astakhova and Vladimir Soldatkin; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-usa-gas/global-energy-bosses-send-trump-a-message-world-needs-russian-gas-idUKL8N1WJ4V8,03 Oct 2018,"Global energy bosses assembled in

2018-10-03,"LAGOS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The governor of Nigeria’s commercial hub Lagos, a prominent ruling party figure, lost his bid on Wednesday to seek a second term following a primary selection process that exposed internal divisions in a crucial state months ahead of polls next year. Lagos state, with a city of some 23 million inhabitants, is the driving force in one of Africa’s biggest economies and a key election battleground in the southwest. The region’s support for President Muhammadu Buhari and his ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party proved to be crucial in the 2015 presidential and gubernatorial races that swept the leader to power. But there have been signs of waning support for Buhari and his party in the southwest, most recently in the APC’s narrow win last week in the governorship election in Osun state. And the Lagos primary race exposed rifts within the party. Akinwunmi Ambode, who took office in 2015, was defeated by Babajide Sanwo-Olu in the APC’s primaries for gubernatorial elections to be held in March 2019, just weeks after February’s presidential election in which Buhari will seek a second term. “I ... declare Babajide Sanwo-Olu the winner,” said Clement Ebri, chairman of the APC Lagos governorship primary committee, at a briefing broadcast on national television. The hard fought contest in Lagos was at times rancorous and prompted Ambode to call for unity in the wake of his defeat. In a televised address he urged APC members to “unite behind the candidate of the party so that we can continue to move this state forward”. The governor of Lagos is a powerful figure who controls a budget bigger than many African countries. Ambode’s defeat follows weeks of reports in local media that he had lost the support of Bola Tinubu, himself a former Lagos state governor and a political godfather in the region. Tinubu’s backing for Buhari in the predominantly Christian southwest played a pivotal role in the northern Muslim securing his first term, delivering much needed support beyond the president’s core northern base.

2018-10-03,"(Adds details) By Sanjeev Miglani and Nidhi Verma Oct 3 (Reuters) - India said on Wednesday it will allow state oil marketing firms to raise $10 billion in overseas loans to help them deal with a sharp rise in crude oil prices and a falling rupee currency. The Reserve Bank of India said it will relax the external commercial borrowings (ECB) policy to allow the oil companies to raise external debt for working capital purposes and lifted the individual borrowing limit which was set at $750 million. India, the world’s third biggest oil importer, depends on overseas markets to meet 80 percent of its oil needs. Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said the moves will help the oil companies to raise as much as $10 billion for maturity periods of three to five years. The rupee has lost as much as 13 percent to the dollar since the beginning of the year, adding to the nation’s oil import bill at a time when crude is hovering at around $85 a barrel. State oil marketing companies have been tapping local markets to raise short-term funds to meet their working capital needs, mainly to pay for oil imports billed in dollars. This in turn has pushed up demand for dollars in the local market, piling the pressure on falling rupee. India also waived a requirement for the companies to hedge dollars while raising funds from the overseas markets. “We have a working capital needs on a permanent basis. This is a welcome and a positive move by RBI  and will definitely bring down the import cost,” A.K. Sharma, head of finance at Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, said. Earlier, the government allowed state refiners to buy 35 percent of their oil imports on a delivered basis to cut the imported cost. State refiners are also looking at drawing from inventory to temporarily delay oil purchases.

2018-10-03,"* Riyadh, Moscow act to contain oil price surge * U.S. Perry told of plans before Algiers talks * Putin, Falih both say could raise output further (Adds comments from Putin, Falih and analysts) By Olesya Astakhova and Rania El Gamal MOSCOW/DUBAI, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the United States before a meeting in Algiers with other producers, four sources familiar with the plan said. U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for high crude prices and called on it to boost output to bring down fuel costs before the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6. The deal underlines how Russia and Saudi Arabia are increasingly deciding oil output policies bilaterally, before consulting with the rest of OPEC. The sources said Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak agreed during a series of meetings to lift output from September through December as crude headed towards $80 a barrel. It is now over $85. “The Russians and the Saudis agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on Trump’s order to pump more,” one source said. “The Saudi minister told (U.S. Energy Secretary Rick) Perry that Saudi Arabia will raise output if its customers asked for more oil,” another source said. Originally, the two countries had hoped to announce an overall increase of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Saudi-led OPEC and non-OPEC Russia at a gathering of oil ministers in Algiers at the end of September. But with opposition from some in OPEC, including Iran which is subject to U.S. sanctions, they decided to defer any formal decision until a full OPEC meeting in December. ""Saudi is trying to thread a needle with a rope by satisfying customer concerns about higher oil prices, but also wanting to keep prices from falling and sending the wrong price signal to industry which absolutely needs to continue to invest to prevent a supply crunch,"" Yasser Elguindi, energy market strategist at consultancy Energy Aspects www.energyaspects.com said. Executives at the world’s biggest oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to loosen the purse strings to replenish reserves and halt declines in crude production after years of austerity. Since the meeting in Algiers, Reuters has reported that Riyadh planned to lift output by some 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd from September to help fill the gap left by lower Iranian output due to the sanctions. Russian output rose 150,000 bpd in September. “I would expect Russia’s oil production will hover at around 11.4 to 11.6 million bpd until the end of 2018 and may increase further to 11.8 million bpd later on in 2019,” a source at a major Russian oil company said. Russian produced 11.36 million bpd in September, up from 11.21 million bpd in August, Energy Ministry data showed. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday it could raise production by 200,000 to 300,000 bpd to tackle possible fuel shortages while Falih said Saudi Arabia will increase output further in November from 10.7 million bpd. Perry was made aware of the Saudi-Russia plan to lift output before the Algiers gathering, meeting with Falih three times in September and Novak once. The three did not meet together. Perry’s spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes did not comment on details of the talks but said the energy secretary, “continues to be engaged with leaders from other major oil producing nations and remains confident in their ability to boost output if needed”. She said Perry had in recent meetings “impressed upon his counterparts that keeping supply up is important for the global economy”. Oil prices rose to $85 a barrel this week as buyers of Iranian crude wound down their purchases to meet the terms of U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Sources said Riyadh would help fill that shortfall because buyers needed replacement supplies. Saudi Arabia has spare capacity to produce oil at a higher rate and holds a large volume of crude in storage. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is keen to maintain unity among the so-called OPEC+ alliance, a group comprising OPEC states, Russia and several other producers that has agreed on output curbs. That’s because it may need to change course and seek the collaboration of OPEC+ for any future production cuts. “Iranian crude exports are considerably lower and market participants are concerned of a wide market deficit this quarter,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at Swiss bank UBS. “To cover those losses, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other Gulf countries are increasing production, but this will bring down the global spare capacity to a 10-year low.” In the run up to the private deal with Russia, Falih flew to the United States during the second week of September where he and fellow Texas A&M University alumnus Perry attended a football game in College Station, Texas. Falih then held official talks with Perry in Washington on Sept. 10, the U.S. Energy Department has said. Perry flew to Moscow two days later to meet Novak, while Falih also met Novak in Moscow a day later. Perry told Reuters during his Moscow visit that Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia had enough capacity between them to compensate for the loss of Iranian supply over the next 18 months. After Moscow, Falih and Perry met again in Vienna where they attended an event in the Austrian capital, sources said. “Perry was aware that Russia is going to ramp up oil output,” a third source familiar with talks said. It was at this point that Falih and Novak discussed announcing a 500,000-bpd increase at the Sept. 23 Algiers meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The plan did not materialise, with any formal decision deferred until a regular OPEC meeting in Vienna on Dec. 6. “Saudi Arabia is not going to flood the market and risk a price crash. Saudi Arabia has to work with other producers and see what are they doing, who is raising exports and to which market,” another source said. Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington and

2018-10-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world rose and Italian bonds rallied on Wednesday after signs that Rome would cut budget deficits and decrease its debt in the coming years, while new U.S. jobs data supporting a strong U.S. economy boosted the dollar.  U.S. stocks rose at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening at a record high, as financial stocks gained from a rebound in European markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 156.86 points, or 0.59 percent, to 26,930.8, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 12.19 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,935.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 28.33 points, or 0.35 percent, to 8,027.87. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.22 percent. “Today, so far, has been better-than-expected performance out of Europe,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Markets lifted after a report in the Corriere della Serra newspaper - later confirmed to Reuters by a government source - said Italy’s deficit would fall to 2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent in 2021 from the 2.4 percent earlier outlined. That relieves some concerns that Italian budget deficits could deepen its debt problems and stoke conflict with the European Union. Italian 10-year borrowing costs eased off 4-1/2-year highs IT10YT=RR, after jumping 50 basis points since budget details emerged last Thursday. Two-year yields fell 10 bps. IT2YT=RR The improved mood towards Italy also reduced the premium investors demand for holding Italian risk relative to that of safer Germany to around 290 bps, down from a five-year high over 300 bps on Tuesday IT10DE10=RR, and sapped demand for safe-haven assets such as German bonds and Swiss franc. The pan-European equity index rose 0.6 percent , while the Milan bourse jumped more than one percent .FTMIB. The moves were led by an initial 3.1 percent bounce in Italian banks .FTIT8300. The banks' large government debt holdings make them particularly vulnerable to bond selloffs and have pressured Italian stock markets for months. The U.S. dollar gained after the release of ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday that showed private employers added 230,000 jobs in September, the most since February. That was more than economists’ expectations of 185,000 jobs.  The stronger-than-expected data comes ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.06 percent.  Lingering concerns about Italy’s budget negotiations continued to weigh on the euro EUR=, which was down 0.07 percent to $1.1538. The single currency hit a six-week trough of $1.1506 on Tuesday after an Italian lawmaker said his country might be better off with its ""own currency."" Uncertainty about Italy has continued to weigh on broader market sentiment, as have worries that a U.S.-China tariff dispute will escalate once Chinese markets reopen after a week-long holiday. While U.S. President Donald Trump agreed a new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, a disputed clause in the trilateral agreement, forbidding similar deals with “non-market” countries, was seen as raising risks for Sino-U.S. talks.   MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS slipped 0.2 percent and Japan's Nikkei .N225 closed 0.7 percent lower.  China’s financial markets will resume trade on Oct. 8, the day Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend G-20 meetings, meaning news could emerge on the trade front.

2018-10-03,"(Adds details, comments, prices) By David Gaffen Oct 3 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose by their most in a week since March 2017, driven in part by a build at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub and a drop in exports, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories jumped by 8 million barrels in the week to Sept. 28, four times analysts’ expectations. The surprise surge offsets what has been a steady drawdown in U.S. crude inventories in recent months. Before this week, stocks were at their lowest since February of 2015; they now stand at 404 million barrels, not including the U.S. strategic reserve. “I think we need to see weeks of these numbers to really wipe out worries about how tight supplies are,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 1.1 million barrels per day as exports fell 913,000 bpd. Over the past four weeks, crude oil imports averaged about 7.8 million bpd, 10.2 percent more than the same four-week period last year, the EIA said. Stocks at the Cushing delivery hub for U.S. crude futures rose by 1.7 million barrels, EIA said. Crude prices dropped notably on the news before rebounding a bit. U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell 28 cents to $74.95 a barrel, while Brent lost 9 cents to $84.74 a barrel as of 10:40 a.m. EST (1440 GMT). Oil prices have been rising as the United States is set to re-establish sanctions against Iran that have already reduced exports from OPEC’s No. 3 producer. Both crude benchmarks have been trading near four-year highs. Refining activity held steady nationwide last week with crude runs inching up 77,000 bpd and utilization rates remained unchanged at 90/4 percent of total capacity. However, Midwest refinery utilization rates dropped to 78.9 percent, to their lowest since Oct. 2015, according to the data. Gasoline stocks fell by 459,000 barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.3 million-barrel gain. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 1.8 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.3 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2018-10-03,"(Recasts, adds quotes, details, reaction from environmental group) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Canada will not appeal a court ruling that overturned its approval of an oil pipeline expansion project, opting instead for more consultations with aboriginal groups unhappy about the plan, a top official said on Wednesday. The problem-plagued bid to almost treble the capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline is becoming one of the biggest political challenges for the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the run-up to an election in 2019. In August, the Federal Court of Appeal said Ottawa had failed to adequately consider aboriginal concerns before giving the green light to the expansion. That same month, amid increasing protests by aboriginal and environmental activists, Ottawa bought the pipeline from Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd. “The government will not appeal the court’s decision ... we are going to do things differently this time,” Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi told a news conference. Instead, Ottawa will reinitiate consultations with all 117 indigenous groups who would be affected by plans to pump more oil from Alberta to the Pacific province of British Columbia. Trudeau, who has said the pipeline is intended to help diversify exports away from the United States, told reporters on Wednesday that appealing the court ruling could have taken years. The official opposition Conservatives accuse Trudeau of botching the pipeline effort and say he is opposed to energy development. Canada has the world’s third-largest proven oil reserves. Last month Sohi directed the National Energy Board regulator to conduct a new review of the application. Canada’s oil producers say the expanded pipeline will help resolve bottlenecks that have resulted in steeply discounted prices for their crude. The British Columbia government, environmental groups and some municipalities and aboriginal communities oppose the idea, citing the impact of spills and expanding oil production. Sohi said on Wednesday that he would not impose a time limit on the consultations but added that “we are not starting from scratch”, given the government already had plenty of information from earlier discussions. He also reiterated that there would be no aboriginal veto over the project. Indigenous communities insist they have the final say over projects which would cross their land.

2018-10-03,"TRIPOLI, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Libya’s state oil company National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Wednesday it had postponed a conference in the eastern city of Benghazi for 15 days following an attack on its Tripoli headquarters last month. The three-day conference, to be held in Libya’s second-largest city, is aimed at allowing local and foreign oil and gas companies to discuss the sector’s development. “The date was changed because of the circumstances that the (NOC) was exposed to recently, which caused the delay in the completion of some important preparations and equipment related to the event,” NOC said in a statement. The conference will be held from Oct. 24 to 26, two weeks later than planned, NOC said. In September, NOC headquarters were attacked by gunmen claiming to be Islamic State militants, killing two people and wounding 25. NOC has in recent years rarely held conferences inside Libya, especially in Benghazi, which was a battle zone until the expulsion of Islamist fighters last year.

2018-10-03,"(Recasts with Putin’s comments, adds detail) MOSCOW, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Russia could raise oil production by 200,000-300,000 barrels per day, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, to tackle possible shortages of the fuel. Oil prices have reached four-year highs to over $85 per barrel due to production declines in some countries, such as Venezuela, and amid fears that U.S. sanctions against Iran will further reduce oil supplies to the markets. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed in June to ease production curbs imposed earlier. “We have already raised (output) by 400,000 (bpd) as we had agreed with partners. We may increase it by a further 200,000-300,000 bpd if needed,” Putin said. Speaking at a conference in Moscow, attended by leading oil and CEOs and global energy officials including Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, Putin also said that his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump was right that the current oil price was too high. Russia would be happy with the oil price at $65-$75 per barrel, Putin added. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak later said that Russia can boost production by up to 300,000 bpd within months. Oil output in Russia hit a 30-year high in September of 11.36 million bpd. (Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Denis Pinchuk, Oksana Kobzeva and Olesya Astakhova.

2018-10-03,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene told a judicial corruption inquiry on Wednesday that he was fired by former president Jacob Zuma for refusing to approve a $100 billion nuclear power deal with Russia in 2015. Nene is the highest profile figure to give evidence at a probe into alleged influence-peddling by the Gupta family, friends of Zuma, who are accused of using their relationship with the former leader to unduly win state contracts. Zuma has repeatedly denied accusations by his opponents that he pushed for a deal with President Vladimir Putin at a BRICS summit for Russia to build a fleet of nuclear power stations. Opposition politicians and local investigative journalists say the proposed deal - which would have been the biggest state contract in South Africa’s history - would have included huge kickbacks for Zuma and the Gupta family. The Indian-born brothers - Ajay, Atul and Rajesh - have been accused of using their ties with Zuma to siphon off billions of rand in state funds and of inappropriately influencing cabinet appointments.      They left South Africa earlier this year around the time Zuma resigned under pressure from his own party and the authorities are seeking their return to face prosecution. Nene, in the first public account of the nuclear negotiations, said Zuma became hostile towards him at a meeting at the summit when he refused to sign a guarantee letter Zuma wanted to present to Putin while in Russia. “It was a very tense meeting that ended with us just being instructed by the president to go and find a solution, which we didn’t find,” Nene told the inquiry. “I told the president in the meeting that I could not sign the letter without having first interrogated the financial and fiscal implications” A spokesman for Zuma did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to  a request for comment.   Allegations of corruption have been swirling around Zuma and the Gupta brothers for years, but the current inquiry is for the first time allowing senior government officials to give their accounts to the public. “Nene’s testimony is extraordinarily important. This is the person who was CEO when it comes to the public purse,” political analyst Ralph Mathekga said. “Before this evidence it was difficult to connect the dots to Zuma. But this is a smoking gun which shows Zuma was a protagonist in this affair.”  Zuma fired Nene in December 2015 and replaced him with largely unknown lawmaker Des van Rooyen, sending markets into a tailspin before Zuma appointed investor-friendly Pravin Gordhan as his third finance minister in the space of four days. Zuma’s successor as president Cyril Ramaphosa re-appointed Nene finance minister in February this year.        Nene told the inquiry he lost his job for not approving contracts that would benefit the Gupta family, particularly the Russian nuclear deal. His decision to reject a proposed national airline route to Sudan on grounds that it was not commercially viable also contributed to his sacking.  “I do believe I was removed as minister of finance for my refusal to toe the line in relation to certain projects,” he said. Nene’s supporters have portrayed him as a principled official who sought to defend the country’s strained public finances against corrupt attacks from Zuma and his allies. However, his detractors, including the radical opposition Economic Freedom Fighters, say he was involved in corrupt deals with the Guptas when he was deputy finance minister and head of the state pension fund from 2008-2014. Nene told the inquiry he met the Gupta brothers several times, including four visits to their family home in Johannesburg between 2010-2013, but said it was normal practise to meet business leaders as a deputy finance minister.

2018-10-03,"* Low-carbon focus to prevent near-term nuclear closures * No closures seen beyond Fessenheim during Macron term By Benjamin Mallet PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - France will adopt a go-slow approach to reducing its reliance on nuclear energy, with a focus on cutting carbon emissions, in its new long-term energy plan this month, industrial sources said. “This scenario has been put forward in order to maintain a high share of nuclear and to protect the interests of the state as (power utility) EDF shareholder,” an energy industry executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters. France’s long-awaited energy plan (PPE) for 2019-2023 and 2024-2028 is set to lay out how and by when it will cut the share of nuclear in its overall power generation to 50 percent from 75 percent and to detail how many of EDF’s 58 nuclear plants will have to close to achieve that target. Several sources involved with drafting the plan said that it will be framed by the energy ministry’s 2050 low-carbon strategy and will attempt to preserve EDF’s nuclear fleet. An EDF source said that the low-carbon strategy is set to protect 83.7 percent state-owned EDF from nuclear closures through a focus on phasing out fossil-fueled stations. The EDF source said it was unlikely the plan would require any closures before the end of President Emmanuel Macron’s term in 2022 apart from the already scheduled shutdown of the two Fessenheim reactors, unless regulator ASN ordered any. Macron is a staunch defender of the nuclear industry, but is under pressure from the left wing of his centrist movement following the resignation of his popular environment minister Nicolas Hulot and ahead of European elections next year. Hulot resigned in frustration over sluggish progress on climate goals and nuclear energy policy. The PPE could possibly buy more time by delaying a decision on which reactors will have to be closed until ASN has given a generic ruling on the feasibility of lifespan extension, which is not expected before 2020. EDF has repeatedly said it wants to extend the lifespan of its nuclear plants from 40 to 50 and even 60 years and does not plan any reactor closures before 2029 other than Fessenheim. French daily Les Echos reported on Wednesday that EDF proposes closing 7 to 12 reactors between 2029 and 2035, while grid-operator RTE considers six of EDF’s oldest reactors could be closed between 2024 and 2028. The PPE is also expected to advise on EDF’s long-standing request to build a new nuclear plant once it completes the long-delayed Flamanville reactor. New environment minister François de Rugy has said it first needs to prove the viability of Flamanville.

Khalid al-Falih told a conference in Moscow attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin that the kingdom was in weekly communication with Russia to stabilise global oil markets, which touched a four-year high above $85 a barrel this week. Oil producers have added a total of about 1 million bpd output in “recent weeks and months” and the global market was well supplied, the Saudi minister said, adding that Saudi Arabia had raised its oil output to 10.7 million bpd in October. Asked about surging oil prices, Falih said the current price “was not based on fiscal flows of supply and demand”. “This is created in financial markets,” he said. Benchmark Brent crude fell 12 cents to $84.68 a barrel at 1125 GMT, reversing an earlier gain. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters before the conference that the global oil market had more or less stabilised but uncertainties remained that could push up prices, including factors such as U.S. sanctions on Iran. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Falih and Novak had agreed at a series of meetings, held when crude prices were heading towards $80, to lift output from September through December. The two oil producers struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool prices and had informed the United States, which has been pushing for action by OPEC and other producers, four sources familiar with the plan told Reuters. The private pact was reached before a meeting of oil producers in Algeria. U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for high crude prices and demanded that the group boost output to bring down fuel costs before U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6. Riyadh planned to lift output by some 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd from September until the end of 2018 to help fill the gap left by lower Iranian output due to the sanctions, Reuters reported. Russian oil output reached a post-Soviet record high of 11.36 million bpd last month.

2018-10-03,"* Euro, Italian bonds rebound on budget deficit cut report * European shares rise led by Italian banks; U.S. to open firmer * Indian, Indonesian, Turkish currencies hit by oil, inflation pressure * Oil hovers near four-year highs * Wall Street set to open higher * (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - European shares rose and Italian bonds rallied on Wednesday as some of the worries that have rippled across markets this week were soothed by signs Rome was amenable to cutting budget deficits and debt in coming years. While the euro ceded some earlier gains against the dollar to trade flat on the day, the positive sentiment rippled across the Atlantic where Wall Street looks set for a stronger session. Markets were lifted on Wednesday by a report in the Milan daily Corriere della Serra - later confirmed to Reuters by an Italian government source - that said the deficit would fall to 2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent in 2021, from the 2.4 percent earlier outlined. That relieves some fears that Italy’s decision to expand budget deficits well beyond what was agreed by a previous government would deepen its debt problems and stoke conflict with the European Union. “It’s all about Italy today. The news about a possible reduction in budget deficits has been positively taken by all markets,” said Bernd Berg, global macro and FX strategist at Woodman Asset Management in Zurich. Italian 10-year borrowing costs eased off 4-1/2-year highs , after jumping 50 basis points since budget details emerged last Thursday. Two-year yields fell 10 bps. The improved mood towards Italy also reduced the premium investors demand for holding Italian risk relative to that of safer Germany to around 290 bps, down from a five-year high over 300 bps on Tuesday, and sapped demand for safe-haven assets such as German bonds and Swiss franc. The pan-European equity index rose 0.6 percent, while the Milan bourse jumped more than one percent. The moves were led by an initial 3.1 percent bounce in Italian banks. The banks’ huge government debt holdings make them particularly vulnerable to bond selloffs and have pressured Italian stock markets for months. Futures for the U.S. S&P 500 and the Dow were up around 0.3-0.4 percent. The euro firmed 0.3 percent before yielding gains and trading flat around $1.1543, as the dollar cut earlier losses. The single currency hit a six-week trough of $1.1506 on Tuesday after an Italian lawmaker said his country might be better off with its “own currency”. However the euro held onto gains against the Swiss franc and yen, rising around 0.4 percent . “That the Italian government is trying to appease its EU partners can be seen as a step in the right direction and therefore justifies some euro-positive reaction,” Thu Lan Nguyen, a FX strategist at Commerzbank, said. But, she added, “the devil is in the details. The euro’s recovery will only continue if the new fiscal plans are also feasible.” Broader world market sentiment remains jittery, partly because of the bellicose rhetoric still emerging from the populist coalition government in Rome, but also due to fears that a Sino-U.S. tariff dispute will escalate once China reopens after a week-long holiday. While U.S. President Donald Trump agreed a new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, a disputed clause in the trilateral agreement, forbidding similar deals with “non-market” countries, was seen as raising risks for Sino-U.S. talks. Volatility in U.S. tech shares is also making investors wary, with Facebook down almost 6 percent in the past three sessions after disclosing its worst security breach ever. World shares were flat near two-week lows while MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.7 percent lower. China’s financial markets are closed and will resume trade on Oct. 8. That’s the day Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend G-20 meetings, meaning news could emerge on the trade front. The dollar index, measuring the greenback against a basket of major currencies, inched higher but is off Tuesday’s six-week high of 95.744. That gave some relief to emerging currencies but the Indian rupee hit a new record low and the Indonesian rupiah touched a more than 20-year low as oil prices near four-year highs weighed. Turkey’s lira also weakened 1.3 percent as the country, another oil importer, posted data showing inflation surpassing 25 percent. That increases pressure for another interest rate rise after a 625 bps move in August. Woodman Asset Management’s Berg said, however, that the worst looked to be over for Turkey. “The currency has appreciated and the central bank has hiked rates aggressively so...towards the end of the year, inflation numbers should stabilise and, to me, the worst of the currency crisis is over.” Brent crude inched up to $84.89 per barrel, close to four-year highs of $85.45 touched earlier this week.

2018-10-03,"ISLAMABAD, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Emerging markets currency turmoil and higher oil prices are putting increasing pressure on Pakistan’s central bank to devalue the rupee for a fifth time in a year, analysts said on Wednesday. The rupee is down 20 percent since December as dwindling foreign currency reserves paired with a widening current account deficit prompted successive devaluations by the State Bank of Pakistan. On Wednesday, the rupee closed at 124.2 per U.S. dollar in the official interbank rate and 127.50 on the open market. Any significant difference between the rates encourages transactions outside the formal banking system. The central bank aggressively hiked its policy interest rates by 100 basis points to 8.5 percent last week, but that won’t be enough to prevent another depreciation, research agency Fitch Solutions said in an investors note. “We remain bearish on the Pakistani rupee as the currency is likely to remain under depreciatory pressures with weaker external finances,” it said. Pakistan’s economy has been wobbly for months, triggering speculation that Prime Minister Imran Khan’s new government may request the country’s 13th International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout since late 1980s, though the administration calls that a last resort. The state bank’s foreign reserves were down to $9 billion in the week ending Sept. 19, only about two months’ worth of imports and down some $300 million from the previous week, according to official statistics. Now, rising oil prices are draining foreign reserves in emerging markets dependent on imported petroleum. Pakistan’s neighbour India saw its currency fall to a record low of 73.40 rupees per dollar this week. The external pressure has ramped up pressure on Pakistan’s thinly traded rupee, widely considered to be under a managed float. It’s unlikely the central bank can defend the rupee at current levels for much longer, said Saad Hashemey, research director for Pakistani brokerage Topline Securities. “Given the foreign exchange reserves in the state bank, I don’t think the state bank has the fire power to bring the rate down,” he said. He added he expects “a slight devaluation at this point, and then eventually a 135-140 level in the next eight to 12 months”. Khan’s new government has been seeking alternatives to going back to the IMF, but so far visits by Chinese and Saudi delegations have not yielded any new bridge loans or deferred-payment deals on oil. Before Khan’s election, China had given several billion dollars in emergency loans.

2018-10-03,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The first major liquefied natural gas (LNG) project to be approved globally in five years will be built in Canada, but its underlying philosophy appears to be more closely allied to the Australian concept of “she’ll be right, mate.” The LNG Canada project was given the green light on Tuesday by Royal Dutch Shell, which is leading the $31 billion venture along with partners Petronas, Mitsubishi , PetroChina and Korea Gas. What makes the first export plant on Canada’s west coast different to the last wave of LNG projects is that it isn’t underpinned by long-term sales contracts. These agreements had been necessary in the past to provide a level of certainty to the oil and gas companies, and their financiers, that buyers existed for the output and revenues could be guaranteed. Instead, Shell said in a statement that each of the partners in LNG Canada would be responsible for providing their share of the natural gas to be liquefied, and would also be in charge of marketing the output of the super-chilled fuel. In the Australian lexicon, this amounts to taking a bet that everything will work out just fine, even though you currently can’t really be certain of that. There is perhaps a touch of irony in the fact that Canada’s foray into LNG is taking a chance that none of the developers of the eight new LNG projects built in Australia in the past few years were able to do. These ventures, including Shell’s floating LNG project, were secured by long-term deals for much of their output, and although pricing terms remain confidential, it was usual for these agreements to be linked to the price of crude oil. What the approval of LNG Canada shows is that the market dynamics surrounding LNG have changed dramatically since Australia, and to a lesser extent the United States, embarked on the last round of mega-projects. Buyers have demanded an end to long-term, oil-linked contracts with restrictive destination clauses, and instead want shorter-term and spot deals that allow them to diversify sources of supply. The rise of China to become the world’s second-largest LNG importer behind Japan has also boosted this shift, as the Chinese tend to be active in the spot market at times of peak demand, most usually the northern hemisphere winter. Other emerging buyers of LNG in Asia, such as India, are also keen on more flexible arrangements, and LNG producers have had to embrace the new dynamics, with those in the United States leading the way by offering cargoes priced against the U.S. domestic benchmark. What the step-change in LNG did make more difficult was financing new LNG projects, which typically cost billions of dollars, take at least five years to build and have long payback periods for investors. As LNG Canada shows, the element of risk is higher now than was the case previously. Much of commentary surrounding LNG has been about the huge amounts of the fuel needed in the next decade to meet the energy needs of Asia, with typical forecasts for an increase in demand from the current 300 million tonnes a year to around 450 million by 2025. Under this scenario, LNG Canada’s initial 14 million tonnes looks certain to find willing buyers, indeed, nowhere near enough new projects have been approved to meet the forecast demand. Qatar, which will lose its place as the world’s top exporter to Australia next year, will likely get the crown back by boosting its production by 23 million tonnes to 100 million tonnes by early next decade. Russia’s Novotek also appears close to taking a final investment decision on its almost 20-million-tonne-a-year Arctic 2 project, and there are also two ventures in east Africa that may be approved in the not too distant future. There are also other projects in Canada, the United States and Australia that could be approved, should their backers believe the optimistic scenario for LNG. Herein lies the real risk as the industry doesn’t have a great track record of calling future demand correctly. An expected shortage by the end of this decade prompted the massive wave of investment in Australia and the United States in the past few years, but the market view then swung 180 degrees and a surplus was expected by the early 2020s. Now that surplus has evaporated on the back of Chinese demand growth, and once again the pundits are forecasting a significant deficit by the middle of next decade. But as has been shown by the rise of shale gas in the United States, the death of coal in much of Europe and the ongoing declines in the cost of renewables, much can happen in the energy space in a relatively short space of time. LNG Canada’s partners are probably betting that LNG demand will grow substantially, and even if its doesn’t, they will be fine because they have first-mover advantage in what may be another wave of new projects.

2018-10-03,"BIERE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Cows burp and fart more than they need to, says a Swiss firm that has developed a feed that cuts methane emissions from livestock - helping to combat global warming into the bargain. A single cow produces the equivalent of about three tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, says Agolin, based in Biere near Lausanne. Co-founder and managing director Kurt Schaller told Reuters its specialist feed can reduce that by 10 percent.     “We sell our mixture for around 1 million cows per year... There are 25-28 million cows in the European Union, so it is a big percentage,” he said. “That represents 300,000 tonnes of CO2 reduction today.” The United Nations says livestock farming alone is responsible for up to 18 percent of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.  Nearly a quarter of that comes from bovine flatulence.  “The burps for the cows - it is more burps than farts - contribute about ... 4 percent of (all) greenhouse gas emissions,” said Anne Mottet, livestock development officer at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.  Agolin says field trials have shown its product also helps increase milk yield and feed efficiency, which are benefits that farmers can more easily measure.  “A farmer does not get a cent if he reduces his methane production,” said technical director Beatrice Zweifel. “That is starting to change a little bit, however, for example in California, where farmers must reduce their methane production by 40 percent.” Reporting by Cecile Mantovani, additional reporting by Fabiano Franchitti in Rome, writing by Tom Miles; editing by John Stonestreet",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-swiss-cows/swiss-cow-feed-causes-fewer-farts-and-puts-the-squeeze-on-global-warming-idUKL8N1WI5PK,03 Oct 2018,"Cows burp and fart

2018-10-03,"KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Economic losses caused by drought in China will rocket to tens of billions of dollars per year if global warming breaches the limits set by governments in a 2015 agreement to tackle climate change, scientists said. Under the Paris climate pact, almost 200 nations agreed to limit global temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5C (2.7F). The planet has already heated up by about 1C. An international team of researchers analysed drought-related losses in 31 Chinese provinces and cities over the last 30 years, and looked at the potential social and economic impacts should global temperatures exceed the Paris limits. In China, annual economic losses due to drought were an average $7 billion per year between 1984 and 2017, but global warming of 1.5C could see that figure rise to $47 billion annually, said the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal. A global temperature increase of 2C could see China’s drought losses jump to about $84 billion each year, it added. Su Buda, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, said the new research differed from previous studies on droughts because it was based on projections of China’s future economic growth. This week, the world’s climate scientists are meeting with governments in South Korea to finalise a key U.N. report that will determine if and how global warming can be limited to 1.5C. Last month, the United Nations’ climate chief said governments were not on track to cap temperatures below 2C, and both the public and private sector needed to act with urgency to avoid “catastrophic effects”. The new study found that drought affected about a sixth of China’s arable land from 1949 to 2017, with corn and wheat among the worst-hit crops. Areas that suffered most from drought over the last three decades were located in a southwest to northeast belt, including Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Yunnan, Hubei, Jilin, Anhui, Sichuan, Liaoning, Guizhou and Shandong. Should temperatures rise further, these provinces are likely to experience more intense droughts more often, scientists said. “In this dry zone, there is a lot of poverty,” said Jiang Tong, a co-author of the study and researcher at the National Climate Center of the China Meteorological Administration. Stepping up efforts to reduce carbon emissions - including cutting down on fossil-fuel use - is important to ensure temperature rise stays below 1.5C, Jiang told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Achieving that could reduce China’s annual drought losses by several tens of billions of dollars, he added. To ease the impacts of drought, authorities can introduce early warning systems, help farmers grow drought-resistant crops and fodder, and improve irrigation systems, he added. Overall, extreme weather such as floods, droughts, heatwaves and tropical cyclones cost China about $47 billion in 2017, or 0.35 percent of its annual economic growth, researchers said.

2018-10-03,"* Saudi, Russia act to contain oil price surge * U.S. Perry told of plans before Algiers talks By Olesya Astakhova and Rania El Gamal MOSCOW/DUBAI, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the United States before a meeting in Algiers with other producers, four sources familiar with the plan said. U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for high crude prices and called on it to boost output to bring down fuel costs before the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6. The sources said Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak agreed during a series of meetings to lift output from September through December as crude headed towards $80 a barrel. It is now over $85. “The Russians and the Saudis agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on Trump’s order to pump more,” one source said. “The Saudi minister told (U.S. Energy Secretary Rick) Perry that Saudi Arabia will raise output if its customers asked for more oil,” another source said.

2018-10-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Marathon Oil (MRO.N) has launched the sale of its British North Sea oil and gas fields, a document seen by Reuters showed, the latest U.S. firm to retreat from the basin to focus on onshore shale production at home. The sale includes stakes in the BP-operated (BP.L) Foinaven fields in the west of Shetland area as well as interests in the Brae complex northeast of Aberdeen, according to a sales document seen by Reuters. The process, launched this week, is being run by Jefferies and bids are due by December. The assets could fetch up to $200 million, according to two banking sources. Marathon Oil joins several companies including Chevron (CVX.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and EOG Resources (EOG.N) that have sought to pull out of the North Sea in recent years as they focus operations on rapidly expanding shale production. Marathon Oil spokeswoman Lee Warren declined to comment directly on the sale but said “portfolio management is an ongoing and integral element of our successful business model as we continue to simplify and concentrate our portfolio to our highest return opportunities with a focus on our differentiated position in the U.S. resource plays.”  The company, which produced around 419,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, will invest over 90 percent of its 2018 capital in U.S. shale production, according to its website. The North Sea, one of the oldest offshore basins that started production in the 1970s, has undergone a broad change of guard in recent years as veteran producers have been replaced by smaller, often privately-owned companies, which say they can squeeze more oil and gas out of the fields. According to the sales document, Marathon’s North Sea assets have a total production of 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a resource of 31 million barrels and are expected to produce $85 million of cash flow in 2019. Marathon holds a 40 percent stake in the Brae Area complex, one of the oldest in the basin, as well as stakes in pipelines. One of the complex’s platforms, Brae Bravo, is being dismantled after production ceased in recent years in what is known as decommissioning. The Foinaven area comprises of two producing fields, Foinaven and Foinaven East, in which Marathon holds 28 percent and 47 percent interests respectively, the document said. Marathon agreed to sell its Libyan assets to France’s Total earlier this year for $450 million.

2018-10-03,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Ben Lecomte has crossed the 1,000 nautical mile (1,852 km) mark of his epic bid to become the first man to swim across the Pacific Ocean. The 51-year-old Frenchman set off from Japan on June 5, aiming to swim roughly eight hours a day on his 9,100-km odyssey to San Francisco. He is currently around 20 percent of the way across the world’s largest expanse of water. Lecomte, who swam 3,229 nautical miles (5,980 km) across the Atlantic in 1998, had planned to make the trip in a little more than six months but was forced to turn back in late July due to a string of fierce typhoons that tore through the Pacific. He and his support team spent 20 days at their Yokohama base before the Frenchman resumed his journey at the precise point where he was forced to temporarily postpone the crossing. “If you take good care of yourself, you can push your body pretty far and swimming about eight hours a day for days in and day out proves it,” Lecomte said in a video released by seeker.com, the scientific publisher behind the epic swim. “So 51 is maybe the new 20 for me, or the new 30.” More than 27 scientific organisations, some medical and others oceanographic, will benefit from the data gathered during the expedition. Much of the research will focus on pollution in the Pacific, specifically the build-up of ‘plastic smog’ caused by billions of pieces of microplastics. “Every time, every day that I am in the water and swimming, its an opportunity for me to get the attention on the marine plastic pollution and hopefully inspire people to change their habits,” said Lecomte, whose team has found more than 1,300 pieces of floating plastic debris. “Now, everywhere we go we find plastic on the beach but also in the middle of the ocean, a thousand miles away from land. That is very troubling to think that is what I am going to pass on to my kids.” Lecomte's progress can be tracked on the Seeker.com www.seeker.com/theswim website.

2018-10-03,"* ASN orders analysis of dysfunctions at EDF, suppliers * Says EDF failed to properly oversee Flamanville site * EDF must review quality of Flmanville materials (Adds ASN comments about oversight failures) PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Faulty weldings at the nuclear plant that French utility EDF is building in Flamanville, Normandy, may require more repairs than originally estimated and EDF will have to review materials on the site, the ASN nuclear regulator said in a statement. In July, problems with the weldings forced EDF again to delay the start-up date for the troubled Flamanville 3 nuclear reactor to the second quarter of 2020. It also pushed its cost estimate up to three times the original budget. EDF said then that a total of 53 weldings on Flamanville’s secondary circuit would have to be redone, while for another 10 it was confident it could convince the ASN that they were fit for service. Another 85 needed no repairs, it said. The ASN said on Wednesday that a programme of major tests would be necessary to verify whether eight weldings were indeed fit for service, as EDF has argued. “To the extent that it is not certain that this will be the case, ASN invites EDF to start preparing for possible repair work on the weldings,” the regulator said. The regulator said it would start an investigation of EDF’s proposals and it was sharply critical about the way EDF has handled the problems with the weldings. “The ASN considers that the problems with the weldings show that EDF has failed to properly oversee certain activities on the Flamanville reactor construction site,” the regulator said. It added that it was demanding that EDF will broaden the quality review of materials installed on the reactor. It also said that, given the fact that the first problems had been identified in July 2015, the management of the situation by EDF had been inadequate. “Therefore ASN demands that EDF proceed to a thorough analysis of the dysfunctions at EDF and its suppliers,” it said. EDF will also have to explain why it informed the ASN so late, at the start of the 2017. EDF was not immediately available for comment. EDF is building two similar EPR reactor models at Hinkley Point, Britain. Three other models under construction in China and Finland have also suffered long delays and budget overruns.

2018-10-03,"(Updates throughout, changes byline, dateline) * Euro, Italian bonds rebound on budget deficit cut report * European shares rise, led by Italian banks; U.S, to open firmer * Indian, Indonesian, Turkish currencies hit by oil and inflation pressure * Oil holds near four-year highs By Sujata Rao LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The euro bounced off six-week lows on Wednesday, European shares rose and Italian bonds rallied as some of the worries that have rippled across markets this week were soothed by signs Rome was amenable to cutting budget deficits and debt in coming years. A report in the Corriere della Serra newspaper — later confirmed to Reuters by a government source — said the deficit would fall to 2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent in 2021 from the 2.4 percent earlier outlined. That brought relief to markets which had fretted that Italy’s decision to expand budget deficits well beyond what was agreed by a previous government would deepen its debt problems while stoking conflict with the European Union, whose officials have already expressed concerns. The euro, which had hit a six-week trough of $1.1506 after suffering five straight days of losses, firmed 0.3 percent while Italian borrowing costs eased off 4-1/2-year highs, after jumping 50 basis points since budget details emerged last Thursday. Two-year yields fell 15 bps. “It’s all about Italy today. The news about a possible reduction in budget deficits has been positively taken by all markets, and the euro is back up too — that’s the main risk parameter for euro crisis concerns,” said Bernd Berg, global macro and FX strategist at Woodman Asset Management in Zurich. A pan-European equity index opened a quarter percent higher , while the Milan bourse jumped more than one percent . The moves were led by an initial 3.1 percent bounce in Italian banks. The banks’ huge government debt holdings make them particularly vulnerable to bond selloffs and has pressured Italian stock markets for months. The moves pushed down the premium investors demand for holding Italian risk relative to that of safer Germany to around 290 bps, down from a five-year high over 300 bps on Tuesday and sapped some demand for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the dollar and Swiss franc. The euro jumped half a percent to the franc and 0.4 percent to the yen . Analysts noted however that other southern European markets, Spain and Portugal, which were caught up in Greece’s 2010-2011 crisis, had been resilient to spillover from Italy this year. “Contagion has been far more subdued than in the past and that’s an important signal. I expect policymakers to latch on to that as proof (Italy’s crisis) is self-imposed and not a reflection of what’s happening as a whole in the weaker (euro zone) countries,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier in London. He added that Italy’s high yields — two-year bonds there pay 1.3 percent versus zero in Portugal — were also enticing some investors. Wall Street too appeared set for a firmer open, with futures for the S&P 500 the Dow up around 0.2 percent. Broader world market sentiment remains jittery though, partly because of the bellicose rhetoric still emerging from the coalition government in Rome, but also due to fears that a Sino-U.S. tariff row would escalate once China reopens after a week-long holiday. While U.S. President Donald Trump agreed a new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, a controversial clause in the trilateral agreement, forbidding similar deals with “non-market” countries, was seen as raising risks for Sino-U.S. talks. Volatility in U.S. tech shares is also making investors wary, with Facebook down almost 6 percent in the past three sessions after disclosing its worst security breach ever. World shares were flat near two-week lows while MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.7 percent lower. China’s financial markets are closed and will resume trade on Oct. 8. That’s the day Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend G-20 meetings, meaning news could emerge on the trade front. The dollar index, measuring the greenback against a basket of major currencies, pulled back from six-week highs of 95.744. Emerging currencies derived some relief from the weaker dollar but the Indian rupee hit a new record low and the Indonesian rupiah touched a more than 20-year low, as oil prices near four-year highs weighed on importing nations’ finances. Indonesian authorities stepped in to support the currency and India is expected to raise interest rates this Friday. Turkey’s lira also weakened one percent to the dollar as the country, another oil importer, posted data showing inflation at more than 25 percent. That increases pressure on the central bank to raise rates again after a whopping 625 bps move in August. Woodman Asset Management’s Berg said however the worst looked to be over for Turkey, adding: “the currency has appreciated and the central bank has hiked rates aggressively so...towards the end of the year, inflation numbers should stabilise and to me, the worst of the currency crisis is over.” Brent crude inched up to $84.89 per barrel, close to four-year highs of $85.45 touched earlier this week.

2018-10-03,"* Novak says Europe buying record volumes despite U.S. calls * Sees gas pipeline and LNG exports booming for next decade * Novatek aims to rival Qatar as top LNG exporter (Updates with quotes, figures) By Dmitry Zhdannikov, Olesya Astakhova and Oksana Kobzeva MOSCOW, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Russia is setting records in gas pipeline exports despite U.S. pressure on Europe to reduce imports, and aims to become the world’s leading liquefied gas exporter in the next decade thanks to technology it is developing at home. Russian government officials and executives told an industry conference on Wednesday they expect Russia export a record amount of gas this year, potentially exceeding 200 billion cubic metres (bcm) and beating last year’s all-time high of 194 bcm. The development comes despite repeated calls by the United States on Europe to diversify its gas imports away from the Kremlin’s pipeline monopoly Gazprom, which Washington says is using energy as a tool of intimidation. Gazprom controls 35 percent of the gas market in Europe, larger than any other supplier, and aims to increase its share to 40 percent due to declining European production and the lower cost of extracting gas in Russia. “We have been hearing about the reduction in Russian supplies for many years now,” Russian energy minister Alexander Novak told the conference. “But in spite of this, Europe keeps increasing Russian gas imports.” Novak said Russia could double gas exports by 2030 to meet soaring global demand. That would require Gazprom to build new pipelines to China and Europe, adding some 163 bcm to its exports, while Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports could reach 80-115 million tonnes. That would put Russia on a par with Qatar, the world’s largest LNG producer, which plans to expand its capacity to 110 million tonnes by 2024 from 77 million tonnes now. Russia is a fairly modest LNG producer. Its output comes from a Gazprom-led project on Sakhalin island off Russia’s Pacific coast, and a project led by private producer Novatek in the Arctic Yamal peninsula. “Despite the fact that the United States is reluctant to see Russian gas, some cargoes of LNG from Yamal have reached the United States itself this year,” Novak said. Novatek’s chief executive, Leonid Mikhelson, said his company had the resources to boost output far above current targets. The company has said it could quadruple output to as much as 80 million tonnes of LNG. “We are seeing the birth of a new industry in Russia,” said Mikhelson, adding that Novatek has developed technology to liquefy gas. Russia has up to now relied on companies such as French oil major Total to build new plants and provide technology. U.S. and European sanctions on Moscow over its actions in Ukraine have made exports of technology to Russia and the funding of projects, such as Novatek’s Yamal, challenging. The United States also aims to become a large LNG exporter through its booming shale gas industry, but Mikhelson and Gazprom’s deputy chief executive Alexander Medvedev said Russian gas would still be cheaper in Europe. “As the Russian saying goes - they try to scare us but we are not afraid,” Medvedev told the conference. He added Europe may need as much as 100 bcm of new gas imports by 2030 because its own production is falling.

2018-10-03,"LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Analysts have sharply raised their forecasts for carbon prices in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to 2021 after the market surged more than 40 percent over the past three months, but warned a correction may be on the horizon in the short term. EU Allowances (EUAs) are expected to average 23.01 euros/tonne in 2019 and 26.96 euros/tonne in 2020, according to a survey of eight analysts polled by Reuters. The forecasts were up 24 percent and 30 percent, respectively, from prices given in July, when the projections were for 18.59 euros in 2019 and 20.76 euros in 2020. Analysts increased their forecasts for 2021 to an average of 26.11 euros/tonne, up 19 percent. The ETS charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit. Prices have more than doubled this year, with utilities ramping up hedging ahead of supply cuts coming into effect from 2019 and as more speculative traders entered the market. “With the market being driven upwards by speculative capital, and with no obvious trigger to arrest the bull run, we expect it will largely continue,” Energy Aspects analyst Trevor Sikorski said. The ETS has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis, but this will be addressed by new measures starting next year such as the Market Stability Reserve, which will remove some surplus allowances from the market. In the shorter term, several analysts warned that current prices, around 21.50 euros/tonne, could undergo a correction. “Just looking at the number of options ‘in the money’ you get the idea that if there’s a bubble in the market it may burst out soon,” said Matteo Mazzoni, analyst at Nomisma Energia in Italy. Mazzoni and analysts at Refinitiv said there were nearly 170 million tonnes of open interest, in-the-money call options, with a December expiry date. “This is a main bearish risk factor for the Q4 price. We might even see the sell-off take place before December since a sell-off after option expiry is widely expected,” Refinitiv senior analyst Ingvild Sorhus said.

Spreadbetters pointed to a firm start for the European markets amid hopes Rome could stave off a debt blow-out. E-Minis for the S&P 500 and the Dow were up 0.1 percent, while E-Stoxx 50 added 0.2 percent. The euro was boosted by a report published by the Corriere Della Sera newspaper, saying Italy would reduce its budget deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2021. The report came after the coalition government said last week that it planned to run a deficit of 2.4 percent over the next three years, in a move that tripled the previous target and worried investors in both Italy and the European Union. “The big market mover in the last 24 hours has been Italy and the concerns around its debt so the latest news is being considered a much better outcome than was priced into the market,” said Kyle Roda, Melbourne-based analyst at IG. “The news has prompted some buying, we’re seeing a bit of a relief rally.” The euro jumped 0.3 percent on the news to $1.1585, snapping five straight days of losses that had pushed it to a six-week trough of $1.1506.

2018-10-03,"LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The launch of a massive liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Canada could fire the starting gun on a wave of other approvals around the world, potentially curbing a supply crunch expected after 2020. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) on Tuesday said it would export LNG from the west of Canada by 2025 after approving a C$40 billion (£24 billion) project capable of initially producing 14 million tonnes a year.     That comes just weeks after Qatar, the world’s top LNG exporter, said it would expand its already huge annual output of 77 million tonnes to 110 million tonnes in the coming years. The Canada and Qatar developments will significantly boost the around 300 million tonnes of LNG traded per year, helping ease a supply shortage expected in the next decade amid surging appetite for cleaner fuels from places such as China and wider Asia. The projects are seen as just the start, with a host of other approvals - known as final investment decisions (FIDs) - expected to follow after waiting in company drawers while LNG prices LNG-AS recovered from a three-year slump. “LNG Canada’s FID ... (signals) the appetite to invest in LNG is back,” said Saul Kavonic, an energy researcher at Credit Suisse.  With prices almost tripling from 2016 lows to over $11 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) as demand gathers steam, the industry has regained confidence and is preparing to invest in new projects again.  Another 175 million tonnes per year of capacity is expected to be approved by the end of 2019. “We believe 2019 could be the busiest year of LNG FIDs ever,” said Wood Mackenzie’s director of North America gas, Dulles Wang. Forecasts vary, but LNG demand is expected to jump to about 360 million tonnes by 2023, the International Energy Agency has said, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects 450 tonnes a year. As well as China, appetite is also expected to grow strongly in South Asia, where India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are all driving ahead on LNG import developments.     “If you look at the demand curve and the supply coming on stream, there are simply not enough (supply) projects that are being sanctioned or under development to meet demand by 2023-24,” Shell’s chief financial officer, Jessica Uhl, said on Tuesday. The firm is the world’s biggest single LNG supplier. But the wave of projects in the pipeline will go some way to crimping any shortage. Projects with a total of another 50 million tonnes per year of production capacity in the United States have already been approved and are expected to start operations by the end of 2021. A host of other U.S. companies are also looking to approvals, including for Tellurian’s (TELL.O) 27.6 million tonnes Driftwood project. Other large project approvals on the horizon include Novatek’s (NVTK.MM) Arctic LNG-2 project with 19.8 million tonnes capacity, after the Russian gas company’s Yamal export facility started operations smoothly and quickly at the end of last year. Several projects are also planned in Africa, including two in Mozambique, one led by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and the other by Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N). In Asia, Exxon expects to expand its large-scale operations in Papua New Guinea, and there are also plans to extend Australia’s huge facilities. Even with strong demand growth, many analysts warn that not all LNG projects vying for FID will make it, especially as renewable energy is becoming increasingly cost-competitive. Consultancy Deloitte warned during September’s Gastech industry gathering that projects that failed to lower costs to compete with solar plus storage would likely fail. Similarly, RBC Capital Markets said “the test for Canada LNG will be whether Shell can deliver the project on the stated budget, without cost increases and on time”. RBC said it estimated Canada LNG’s “cost breakeven was around $8 per mmBtu”. That’s below the long-term average spot LNG price of around $10.5 per mmBtu since 2010, but only on a par with its 5-year average.

2018-10-03,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The first major liquefied natural gas (LNG) project to be approved globally in five years will be built in Canada, but its underlying philosophy appears to be more closely allied to the Australian concept of “she’ll be right, mate.” The LNG Canada project was given the green light on Tuesday by Royal Dutch Shell, which is leading the $31 billion venture along with partners Petronas, Mitsubishi, PetroChina and Korea Gas. What makes the first export plant on Canada’s west coast different to the last wave of LNG projects is that it isn’t underpinned by long-term sales contracts. These agreements had been necessary in the past to provide a level of certainty to the oil and gas companies, and their financiers, that buyers existed for the output and revenues could be guaranteed. Instead, Shell said in a statement that each of the partners in LNG Canada would be responsible for providing their share of the natural gas to be liquefied, and would also be in charge of marketing the output of the super-chilled fuel. In the Australian lexicon, this amounts to taking a bet that everything will work out just fine, even though you currently can’t really be certain of that. There is perhaps a touch of irony in the fact that Canada’s foray into LNG is taking a chance that none of the developers of the eight new LNG projects built in Australia in the past few years were able to do. These ventures, including Shell’s floating LNG project, were secured by long-term deals for much of their output, and although pricing terms remain confidential, it was usual for these agreements to be linked to the price of crude oil. What the approval of LNG Canada shows is that the market dynamics surrounding LNG have changed dramatically since Australia, and to a lesser extent the United States, embarked on the last round of mega-projects. Buyers have demanded an end to long-term, oil-linked contracts with restrictive destination clauses, and instead want shorter-term and spot deals that allow them to diversify sources of supply. The rise of China to become the world’s second-largest LNG importer behind Japan has also boosted this shift, as the Chinese tend to be active in the spot market at times of peak demand, most usually the northern hemisphere winter. Other emerging buyers of LNG in Asia, such as India, are also keen on more flexible arrangements, and LNG producers have had to embrace the new dynamics, with those in the United States leading the way by offering cargoes priced against the U.S. domestic benchmark. What the step-change in LNG did make more difficult was financing new LNG projects, which typically cost billions of dollars, take at least five years to build and have long payback periods for investors. As LNG Canada shows, the element of risk is higher now than was the case previously. Much of commentary surrounding LNG has been about the huge amounts of the fuel needed in the next decade to meet the energy needs of Asia, with typical forecasts for an increase in demand from the current 300 million tonnes a year to around 450 million by 2025. Under this scenario, LNG Canada’s initial 14 million tonnes looks certain to find willing buyers, indeed, nowhere near enough new projects have been approved to meet the forecast demand. Qatar, which will lose its place as the world’s top exporter to Australia next year, will likely get the crown back by boosting its production by 23 million tonnes to 100 million tonnes by early next decade. Russia’s Novotek also appears close to taking a final investment decision on its almost 20-million-tonne-a-year Arctic 2 project, and there are also two ventures in east Africa that may be approved in the not too distant future. There are also other projects in Canada, the United States and Australia that could be approved, should their backers believe the optimistic scenario for LNG. Herein lies the real risk as the industry doesn’t have a great track record of calling future demand correctly. An expected shortage by the end of this decade prompted the massive wave of investment in Australia and the United States in the past few years, but the market view then swung 180 degrees and a surplus was expected by the early 2020s. Now that surplus has evaporated on the back of Chinese demand growth, and once again the pundits are forecasting a significant deficit by the middle of next decade. But as has been shown by the rise of shale gas in the United States, the death of coal in much of Europe and the ongoing declines in the cost of renewables, much can happen in the energy space in a relatively short space of time. LNG Canada’s partners are probably betting that LNG demand will grow substantially, and even if its doesn’t, they will be fine because they have first-mover advantage in what may be another wave of new projects.

2018-10-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Executives at the world’s biggest oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to loosen the purse strings to replenish reserves, halt output declines and take advantage of a crude price rally after years of austerity. With oil at a four-year high of $85 a barrel, exploration departments are urging company boards to drill more, wages are creeping higher, service companies say rates will have to rise and some investors say Big Oil must start growing again soon. For the heads of companies such as BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) who have pledged to stick to lower spending after slashing budgets by as much as 50 percent since 2014, the pressure may become hard to resist. As in previous oil price cycles, there are concerns about the strength and duration of the business cycle, now in its 10th year of growth after the 2008 financial crisis. Unlike previous oil price cycles, there is the prospect, eventually, of an end to growth in oil demand as the world shifts to cleaner energy. But there are already signs some cost cuts implemented after oil slumped from $115 a barrel in 2014 to $26 in 2016 are being rolled back. Shell, for example, said last month its teams in the UK North Sea will switch to a less tiring rota of two weeks offshore then three weeks onshore. During the austerity years, teams spent three weeks offshore then four onshore. More frequent rotations mean more ships and helicopters will need to be chartered. Shell says the change will increase costs slightly but is convinced it will make its North Sea operations more cost effective and productive. More generally, salaries across the oil and gas sector have edged up about 6 percent so far in 2018 after declining in the previous three years, according to a survey published by Rigzone. At one major firm, senior managers who had been meeting by video conference for several years are now getting flights approved for face-to-face gatherings, according to an executive at the company. The boards of large oil firms are facing more internal requests to invest in new projects and acquisitions, and to beef up staff, according to senior executives present at such discussions. “There is lots of pressure from all the units to get more money,” said an executive at a large European oil company. (For a graphic showing spending by major oil companies: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CqZfMP) LONG-CYCLE INVESTMENTS New project approvals are picking up. Shell and its partners this week gave the green light to LNG Canada, one of the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in recent years. “Shell’s motivations for the project are clear: without this project, the company’s upstream, LNG contract portfolio and LNG production was set to go into decline early next decade,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Dulles Wang said. Typically, after a period of lower capital spending, or capex, and low prices comes an era of rapid investment as oil recovers and supplies tighten. During the lean years, companies cut back sharply. Now, they generate as much cash as in 2014 and are vowing to remain thrifty to focus on higher dividends, buying back shares and reducing debt. But in an industry where reserves and production decline naturally as oil is pumped from fields, continued investment is considered critical. “We are likely in need of more long-cycle investments given the persistent and accelerating base declines observed in global conventional and offshore projects,” said a source at in investment firm with large stakes in big oil companies. Although some companies such as BP (BP.L) were able to stem production declines thanks to technology and lower costs, a drop in new production has taken a toll on the longer-term outlook for many companies. Oilfield decline rates doubled from 3 percent in 2014 to 6 percent in 2016. For the big oil firms, rates went from 1.5 percent to just over 2 percent during the same period, according to Morgan Stanley. “I expect capex rises due to a significant drop in reservoir life. Some capex will be used to reinvigorate existing wells,” said Darren Sissons, partner at Campbell Lee & Ross Investment Management, adding that increases would be cautious initially. (For a graphic showing reserve life for major oil companies reserve life: https://tmsnrt.rs/2wPUtmd) Spending by the world’s top seven oil companies is expected to rise to a combined $136 billion by 2020 from $105 billion in 2017, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Jefferies (JEF.N). Starting from the middle of next year, boards will change their tone to prepare shareholders for higher spending from 2020, Morgan Stanley analyst Martijn Rats said. “New project awards will likely already accelerate in 2019, but for major developments, capex in the first year tends to be limited. From 2020 onwards, capex is likely to go higher.” Boards are not blind to the pressure. Many companies have defined a range for spending, while committing to the lower end. Shell, for example, has a “soft floor” and a “hard ceiling” for spending of $25 billion to $30 billion per year. For some companies such as Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), which is developing major gas projects in Egypt and Mozambique, boosting costs may be unavoidable. “(Oil companies) proved themselves in a low oil price environment, but at some point they do need to start respending on new projects to keep getting oil out of the ground,” said David Smith, fund manager of the Henderson High Income Trust. Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive of French oil company Total (TOTF.PA), conceded this week that while it aimed to stick to its spending range of $15 billion to $17 billion a year beyond 2020, capex could rise to $20 billion. “Our view is that the majors’ capex is probably 5 to 10 percent or so too low if they are to maintain their current reserve lives,” said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of Guinness Asset Management’s global energy fund. (For a graphic showing upstream investment by oil and gas companies: reut.rs/2NZjaI5)  The pressure to increase spending also comes at a time oil services companies are slowly increasing rates, saying their sacrifices to help Big Oil weather the slump should now be rewarded as crude prices rise. “Current investment levels, particularly in the international market, are clearly not sustainable to meet either medium-term demand or long-term reserves replacement needs,” Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer of Schlumberger (SLB.N), the world’s largest oil services provider, told a conference last month. He said the international production base needed double-digit growth in investment for the foreseeable future just to keep production at current levels. But investors and executives say reserve life - which was at its lowest in at least two decades in 2017 - is no longer the gold standard for measuring the health of oil companies. A spending splurge could also eat into profits and revive fears oil companies are returning to the wasteful practices of the first half of the decade when crude prices soared. ""Historically, excess free cash flow above dividend cost has seen capex rise in the industry but the sector is trying to shake off the capital indiscipline tag and I believe they will stick to that,"" said Rohan Murphy, analyst at Allianz Global Investors www.allianzgi.com.

2018-10-03,"SOUTHAVEN, Miss. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made an undiplomatic remark about close ally Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, saying he warned Saudi Arabia’s King Salman he would not last in power “for two weeks” without the backing of the U.S. military. “We protect Saudi Arabia. Would you say they’re rich. And I love the King, King Salman. But I said ‘King - we’re protecting you - you might not be there for two weeks without us - you have to pay for your military,’” Trump said to cheers at a rally in Southaven, Mississippi. Trump did not say when he made those remarks to the Saudi monarch. Despite the harsh words, the Trump administration has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, which it views as a bulwark against Iran’s ambitions in the region. Trump made Saudi Arabia his first stop on his maiden international trip as president last year.   Trump called King Salman on Saturday and they discussed efforts being made to maintain supplies to ensure oil market stability and global economic growth, according to Saudi state news agency SPA. Saudi Arabia is the world’s top oil exporter and the de facto leader of OPEC, which has been criticized by Trump for high oil prices. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month, Trump said OPEC members were “as usual ripping off the rest of the world.” “We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good. We want them to stop raising prices, we want them to start lowering prices,” Trump said. He has also pressed other U.S. allies, such as Japan, South Korea and Germany, to take more of the financial burden of their defence.

The deficit blowout revived fears of the eurozone debt crisis and put pressure on the euro. “Budget details are still unavailable but the real anxiety surrounds the medium-term path of spending and debt. There is no evidence to suggest the sell-off has run its course,” ANZ analysts said in a note to clients. The euro paused at $1.1553 after falling for five days in a row to $1.1506, the lowest since Aug.21. Sentiment was also hampered as investors turned their focus to the Sino-U.S. trade war. China’s hopes of negotiating a free trade pact with Canada or Mexico were dealt a sharp setback by a provision deep in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that aims to forbid such deals with “non-market” countries. The clause, which has stirred controversy in Canada, fits in with U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to isolate China economically and prevent Chinese companies from using Canada or Mexico as a “back door” to ship products tariff-free to the United States. The dollar’s index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 95.46, pulling back from six-week highs of 95.744 set on Tuesday. Gold traded near its highest level in more than a week as investors sought refuge in the safe haven after equity markets weakened. Spot gold was last at 1,206.04 after adding 1.3 percent to $1,208.23 an ounce overnight. Oil prices held close to four-year highs on supply worries due to Washington’s sanctions on Iran. [O Brent added 8 cents to $84.88 per barrel, not far from a four-year high of $85.45 touched earlier in the week.

Despite this, prices remain near four-year highs reached earlier this week ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports that kick in next month. Brent crude oil futures were trading at $84.73 per barrel at 0103 GMT, down 7 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 10 cents at $75.13 a barrel. U.S. commercial crude inventories rose by 907,000 barrels in the week to Sept. 28 to 400.9 million, the private American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday. Refinery crude runs fell by 158,000 barrels per day (bpd), API data showed. Official weekly government data is due from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. Traders said the rising stocks were partly due to a relentless increase in U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by a third since mid-2016 to a record 11.1 million bpd. “We expect U.S. crude production to exit the year at 11.3 million bpd,” Barclays bank said in a note on Tuesday. That would make the United States the world’s biggest crude oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. Despite the rising U.S. supply, traders said global oil markets remained tense because of the looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports that are scheduled to start from Nov. 4. Brent and WTI earlier this week both reached levels last seen in November 2014, and the two contracts have risen by around 20 and 17 percent respectively since mid-August.

2018-10-03,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OyHccI By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - OPEC and oil traders are now in fundamental disagreement about the market outlook and the standoff is fuelling a sharp rise in prices that could spell trouble for the global economy over the next 18 months. The overall balance between supply and demand is “healthy” according to a statement from the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers last month. The committee expressed its satisfaction regarding the current oil market outlook, according to a press statement released afterwards (“JMMC meets in Algiers to monitor developments in the oil market”, OPEC, Sept. 23). But where the committee sees a balanced market and warned about downside risks to demand in 2019, traders see a market that is increasingly tight and are worried about the adequacy of future supply. Front-month Brent crude futures have jumped by almost $14 per barrel (20 percent) since the middle of August, including an increase of nearly $6 (7 percent) since the JMMC meeting, to their highest in almost four years. Brent’s six-month calendar spread, which has been a good proxy for the global supply-demand balance in the last 25 years, has risen by $2.50 per barrel and swung from a small contango into a pronounced backwardation. The recent intense backwardation in Brent futures close to delivery and the surge in Oman crude prices to a rare premium over Brent are all consistent with a market that fears physical shortages in the next few months. Hedge funds and other money managers have boosted their bullish position in Brent by 172 million barrels since late August, an increase of more than 50 percent, including 50 million barrels in the aftermath of the JMMC. Nearly all hedge fund managers expect oil prices to rise rather than fall in the short to medium term, according to exchange data (tmsnrt.rs/2OyHccI). Fund managers hold bearish short positions in Brent amounting to just 27 million barrels, the second-lowest level in the last five years. Across the entire petroleum complex, including crude and refined fuels, hedge fund short positions have fallen the lowest level since at least 2013. Where OPEC is worried about the potential for a slowdown in oil consumption growth as a result of rising prices and a possible downturn in the global economy, traders are more worried about the impact of sanctions on Iran. The standoff between the JMMC, in reality Saudi Arabia, its most powerful member, and oil traders about the state of the oil market is reminiscent of earlier periods of rising prices. OPEC and traders fundamentally disagreed for almost the entire run up in oil prices in 2007/8, with OPEC insisting the market was well-supplied while traders continued to bid up prices amid concerns about shortages. Experience suggests prices will continue rising until: (a) evidence of demand destruction becomes clear, or (b) the increase in prices forces a reaction from OPEC and its allies. OPEC tends to react to price changes rather than lead them (which is why its influence over the oil market is usually overstated by many commentators). In this instance, prices will continue rising until there is clear evidence of a slowdown in oil consumption growth, or an adjustment in production and sanctions policy from Saudi Arabia, Russia or the White House. Traders are hunting for the price threshold that forces one of those developments. In the meantime, the blame game is heating up, with the White House and OPEC each trying to claim the rise in prices is not their fault. U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed OPEC for rising prices in a message on Twitter on Sept. 20 and in a high-profile speech to the United Nations on Sept. 25. Trump has also reportedly discussed oil supplies and prices in a phone call with the king of Saudi Arabia on Sept. 29 (“Trump calls Saudi’s King to discuss oil supplies”, Reuters, Sept. 29). Despite close coordination between the United States and Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran sanctions, neither wants to be blamed for the escalation in fuel costs. The recent rise in oil prices confirms closely to the traditional boom-bust pattern. Oil prices are not inherently self-stabilising and display strongly non-linear and cyclical behaviour. The oil market cycles between periods of over- and under-supply. The market is rarely balanced or in equilibrium except by accident and not usually for very long. Experience strongly suggests oil prices will continue on a rising trajectory until softening consumption growth or an acceleration in production knocks them onto a new course. Position-building by hedge funds and other traders will accelerate and exaggerate the price movement in the short term but is not the underlying cause of volatility. If the past is any guide, and it usually is, OPEC and its allies will resist changing production, citing concerns about consumption and the growth in alternative supplies, until the political pressure on them becomes overwhelming. By that point, prices will already be close to peaking, extra OPEC and non-OPEC supplies will come too late, with consumption already slowing, and add to the subsequent slump.

2018-10-03,"(Adds statement from DCP Midstream) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Oil and gas companies and their supporters have poured $20.3 million since August into a campaign to defeat a Colorado ballot initiative that would limit new drilling in populated areas, according to state financial filings released on Tuesday. Colorado, the sixth largest and one of the fastest growing U.S. oil-producing states, votes on Nov. 6 on a citizens’ petition that would require new wells be at least 2,500 feet (762 m) from homes, schools and parks. The initiative, which received 172,834 signatures to get a spot on the ballot, was aided in part by the deaths of two men last year in an explosion caused by gas leaking from an abandoned well near a home in Firestone, Colorado. The state’s oil production rose 26 percent in the 12 months through July as companies used higher prices to expand in the state’s Denver-Julesberg basin. Oil and gas companies with operations in the state, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp, DCP Midstream LP and Noble Energy Inc, have donated more than $1 million each to Protect Colorado, a group fighting the citizens’ initiative. Anadarko did not respond to a request for comment, and Noble was immediately available to discuss contributions. DCP Midstream referred questions to Protect Colorado. The group still has more than $10.2 million in financial and service contributions available to fight the measure with just weeks to go before the vote, according to state filings. A Protect Colorado spokeswoman said the financing - more than 100 times that raised by initiative backers - is no guarantee of victory. “It’s really going to depend on voter turnout,” said Karen Crummy, a spokeswoman for the group. “Most people assume this November will have a high turnout, no matter where you are.” Colorado Rising, which led the signature-gathering effort to get the measure on the ballot, currently has about $100,000 and has recruited about 2,000 volunteers to conduct pro-initiative phone calls and text messages, and to canvas neighborhoods, according to Anne Lee Foster, a spokeswoman for the group. “We’ve seen many times where the industry has outspent communities and we’ve still won at the ballot box,” Foster said. Americans for Prosperity, a political advocacy group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, also has joined the opposition. Its Colorado chapter is planning a digital campaign to communicate directly with voters, state director Jesse Mallory said in an interview. Opponents say the set-back restrictions would curtail some 85 percent of new oil and gas development and harm the state’s economy. Colorado mayors and other elected officials have called for a “no” vote. “There are better ways to protect the health and safety of our communities while keeping our state’s economy strong,” said Denver Mayor Michael Hancock.

2018-10-03,"VANCOUVER/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The approval on Tuesday of a massive liquefied natural gas export (LNG) terminal in Canada is being touted as the return of the mega-project, ending a lean period where low energy prices and oversupply concerns kept investors from taking big risks. The C$40 billion ($31 billion) LNG Canada project led by Royal Dutch Shell was given the go-ahead by the Anglo-Dutch giant and its partners, making it the fuel’s first major new project to win approval in recent years. Construction will start immediately, with first shipments of the super-chilled fuel expected before 2025, aiming to feed surging demand from Asian buyers, primarily China. “It seems that mega-projects are back,” said Dulles Wang, director, North America gas at Wood Mackenzie, in an email note, adding that LNG Canada is the biggest greenfield project to be approved globally since Russia’s Yamal LNG in 2013. LNG from the project will reach Asia in about half the time it takes from the U.S. Gulf Coast, LNG Canada said. Global LNG demand is expected to double by 2035, with much of that growth coming from Asia where gas is displacing coal, it said. At the same time, output from older projects is set to decline in coming years, just as soaring demand from China, India and Southeast Asia is devouring a supply glut previously expected to last for years, fanning fears that an LNG shortage may be looming. “LNG Canada’s FID would signal the appetite to invest in LNG is back,” said Saul Kavonic, director for Asia Pacific markets and head of energy research at Credit Suisse in Australia. LNG Canada, to be built in the northern community of Kitimat, British Columbia, also marks the largest private-sector investment project in Canadian history, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a Vancouver news conference. The announcement provides a much-needed boost for Trudeau’s ruling Liberals, who have struggled with an exodus of global energy firms from Alberta’s oil sands as well as setbacks in building a crude pipeline expansion to Canada’s Pacific Coast. “We can’t build energy projects like we did in the old days where the environment and the economy were seen as opposing forces,” Trudeau said. “They must go together.” The project was approved by all its stakeholders - Shell, Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) [PETR.UL], PetroChina Co Ltd, Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) and Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp. “Getting an LNG project to a final investment decision is like a moon landing,” Maarten Wetselaar, Shell’s integrated gas and new energies director, said in Vancouver. “It is very, very difficult to do, and requires teamwork.” MEGA-PRICE The project’s C$40 billion price tag includes the export terminal, the associated pipeline, pre-construction and site work, contingency and upstream carrying costs. Within that broader number, the cost of building the terminal has been pegged at $14 billion, with the Coastal GasLink pipeline running C$6.2 billion. Pipeline operator TransCanada Corp said it expects to start construction on the pipeline in early 2019, which will carry natural gas from the Montney gas-producing region of British Columbia and Alberta to the LNG Canada facility. The project owners will provide their own natural gas supply and will individually market their share of LNG.  LNG Canada’s initial output will be 14 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) from two trains, or processing units, with the option to add two more trains to expand to 28 Mtpa.  Canada has committed C$275 million to infrastructure and environmental performance measures related to LNG Canada, which will have the lowest carbon intensity of any large LNG facility in the world, Trudeau said.  The project will boost Canada’s oilpatch, which has struggled to attract investment amid pipeline constraints and investor malaise over a recent court decision overturning the approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Natural gas producers such as Encana Corp and Tourmaline Oil Corp stand to gain as Canada’s depressed gas prices rise, Raymond James analysts said. Smaller pipeline companies including Pembina Pipeline Corp will also benefit, said RBC analyst Robert Kwan. The construction decision comes amid a U.S.-China trade dispute that has led to tariffs being imposed by China on LNG shipments from the United States, threatening U.S. President Donald Trump’s energy dominance plan. China is the fastest-growing major buyer of LNG and in 2017 overtook South Korea to become the world’s No. 2 importer, behind Japan. Energy consultancy Wood MacKenzie said it appeared project partners had pushed hard to reach an investment decision, with rival projects progressing in Qatar, Russia, Mozambique and the United States. “I don’t see it as a case of replacing U.S. cargoes, more about meeting projected demand growth,” said Wood Mackenzie analyst Nicholas Browne.
