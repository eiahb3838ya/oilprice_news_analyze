2019-02-18,"MIAMI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday warned members of Venezuela’s military who are helping President Nicolas Maduro to stay in power that they are risking their future and their lives and urged them to allow humanitarian aid into the country. Speaking to a cheering crowd mostly of Venezuelan and Cuban immigrants, Trump said if the Venezuelan military continues supporting Maduro, “you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You’ll lose everything.” He said he wanted a peaceful transition of power in Venezuela but that all options remained open.

2019-02-18,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will describe Brexit as a wake-up call in a speech in coming weeks in which he will outline how Europe must be more assertive in the face of rival world powers, sources close to Macron said. His words are intended as a “warning shot” for a continent unable to project power and defend itself, said aides who described the speech as Macron’s most important since he spoke at the Sorbonne University in Paris in September 2017 urging fundamental reform of the European Union. “This is a critical time,” a source close to Macron told Reuters. “If we Europeans don’t want to have other Brexits and become trapped in a naive defence of status quo, we have to wake up.” Macron’s speech coincides with rising tensions in the West, which has been shaken by U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policies and Britain’s departure from the EU. A more assertive China and Russia also pose major challenges. Although Macron will use Britain’s planned departure from the EU on March 29 as the main impetus for his speech, the aim is not to offer an initiative to unblock the negotiating stalemate between London and Brussels, the source said. Macron’s office said on Monday the speech will be at end of February or early March, although the exact date and location had not yet been fixed. “He won’t comment on the negotiation, or offer some kind of ‘Macron plan’ to fix the problem. The idea is to draw the lessons from Brexit,” the source said. In Macron’s view, Brexit is part of the same phenomenon that brought Trump to power and sparked the “yellow vest” movement in France: a fear of losing out from globalisation, territorial inequalities and rising contempt for the establishment. The French leader will focus on championing a “Europe that protects” in the May 26 European election and seek to convince voters with plans aimed at reforming Europe’s trade, competition, digital and climate policies. The speech will also seek to convince his European counterparts, who have watered down many of his Sorbonne proposals since 2017, to start thinking of the EU as a tougher geopolitical player in a ruthless world. “The EU has done the internal regulation rather well, built a nice, peaceful area, with benign trade and regulated competition. But Europe hasn’t understood how to carry itself in a brutal world,” the source said.

2019-02-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose for a fifth day on Monday, on track for its strongest first quarter in eight years, thanks to a growing belief among investors that OPEC’s supply cuts will prevent a build-up in unused fuel, though concern over China’s economy tempered gains.  Brent futures were last up 16 cents at $66.41 a barrel by 1850 GMT, having touched a 2019 high of $66.83 earlier in the day, while U.S. futures rose 47 cents to $56.04 a barrel. Oil has risen nearly 25 percent so far this year and is on course for its strongest first-quarter performance since 2011, thanks largely to a commitment by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to cut output. “Our numbers ... do tell us that we are looking at the tightest H1 crude balance in many years and, as such, a certain degree of price support does simply make sense for the time being,” consultancy JBC Energy said in a note. Refiners around the world are also having to pay more to secure supplies of the medium, or heavy, sour crudes produced by Iran and Venezuela, both of which are under U.S. sanctions. The broader financial markets eased a little after data showing a drop in Chinese car sales in January raised concerns about the world’s second-largest economy.  Some of this weakness rubbed off on the oil market, but analysts said the overall trend in crude prices remained convincingly upwards for now. “There are lots of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ that could have a profound impact on oil prices; just think of the unpredictable Donald Trump, Brexit, trade talks or an eventual pick-up in Libyan and/or Venezuelan production,” said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga. “Latest available data, however, point in the direction of a tightening market. It is not recommended to swim against the current and presently the ‘oil’ river is flowing north.”  Some analysts said the continued rise in U.S. oil production could act as a drag on the current rally. U.S. energy companies last week increased the number of oil rigs looking for new supply by three to a total of 857, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in a report last Friday. “We view the current price rise as exaggerated and see growing correction potential,” Commerzbank said in a note. “The fact that oil production in the U.S. is currently rising significantly more sharply than previously expected is being completely ignored at present.” Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by David Goodman and David Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-8-oil-gains-as-investors-grow-optimistic-over-opec-output-deal-idUKL3N20D143,18 Feb 2019,"* Brent, WTI crude futures prices mark highest since

2019-02-18,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal SA, the world’s biggest steelmaker, has bid 48 billion rupees (520.67 million pounds) to acquire Essar’s 1200 megawatt power plant in central India, one of the most prized assets in the debt-ridden group’s power portfolio. The bid for the power plant once again pits ArcelorMittal chief Lakshmi Mittal against the Ruia family, who are already fighting to prevent their flagship steel asset from falling into the hands of the global steel giant. Essar’s creditors are selling many of the group’s assets to recover billions of dollars of loans, leaving Essar Group with little say over who buys the assets. Government-owned Power Finance Corp Ltd (PFC) is the lead creditor of the power plant and PFC’s Chairman Rajeev Sharma disclosed ArcelorMittal’s bid on Monday. He said that the Essar family had also made a 35 billion rupee bid for the power plant, but ArcelorMittal’s bid was 37 percent higher.  “Now we have received an offer from ArcelorMittal at 4 crore per megawatt, so 4,800 crore rupees (48 billion rupees),” Sharma told a press conference. Sharma said PFC has yet to decide on either offer for the asset, known as the Mahan power plant, which has debt worth 74 billion rupees. ArcelorMittal declined to comment on the matter and Essar was not immediately available for comment. If the steel giant manages to clinch the deal for the Mahan plant, it would be yet another blow to the Ruia family’s attempt to renegotiate debt settlements and retain control of their assets. ArcelorMittal has already been picked as the preferred bidder for Essar Group’s flagship 10 million tonne steel plant in the western Indian state of Gujarat and is also the sole bidder for Essar’s infrastructure arm EPC Constructions, formerly called Essar Projects. The Ruias and ArcelorMittal are still locked in a legal wrangle over the fate of the steel asset. A final court decision in that matter is expected soon. Essar Power, a subsidiary of the Essar Group, spent 80 billion rupees to build the plant, which began operation early last year and currently accounts for 50 percent of Essar Group’s power generation.

2019-02-18,"MUMBAI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Opposition from farmers has prompted India’s western state of Maharashtra to move the location for what would be the country’s biggest oil refinery, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said. Stare-run oil companies and Saudi Aramco have teamed up to build the $44 billion refinery, which is aimed at giving India steady fuel supplies while meeting Saudi Arabia’s need to secure regular buyers for its oil. But thousands of farmers are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood. After their protests, land acquisition has been stopped for the refinery at the proposed site at Nanar, a village in Ratnagiri district, some 400 km (250 miles) south of Mumbai, Fadnavis said on Monday. The refinery will be built at a place where local population won’t oppose the project, he said in a press conference, without identifying a new location. Fadnavis, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made the announcement after forging an alliance with regional party Shiv Sena for the upcoming general election. The location of refinery was one of the contentious issues between the parties, with Shiv Sena opposing the refinery. The announcement comes as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to arrive in India on Tuesday and is expected to announce investments in energy and infrastructure during the visit. The Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), which is running the project, says the 1.2 million barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing. RRPCL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, has said suggestions the refinery would damage the environment were baseless. “The company is hopeful that the state government will provide sufficient land for the project on the western coast,” Anil Nagwekar, a spokesman for the RRPCL, told Reuters. Land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural India, where a majority of the population depends on farming for its livelihood. In 2008, for example, India’s Tata Motors had to shelve plans for a car factory in an eastern state after facing widespread protests from farmers.

2019-02-18,"JOHANNESBURG, Feb 18 (Reuters) - South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe said on Monday that he would not buy any assets which struggling state power firm Eskom puts up for sale, in response to speculation that he was eyeing an Eskom financial subsidiary. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is Motsepe’s brother-in-law, this month unveiled a plan to split Eskom into three units to boost efficiency, which some analysts see as a path to privatising the utility. “I have never supported the privatisation of Eskom or the sale of any of its entities or assets,” Motsepe said at a news conference. “African Rainbow Energy & Power (AREP) or any company that I am associated with will not be part of any sale of any entities or assets of Eskom.” Motsepe’s African Rainbow Capital was reportedly eyeing some or all of Eskom Finance Company, an Eskom subsidiary which lends to employees and which the government put up for sale as part of efforts to shore up the company’s balance sheet. Eskom this month implemented some of the worst power cuts in several years. Motsepe, the country’s richest black businessman, who is also the brother-in-law of Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, said: “Having relatives in very high positions in government justifiably raises perceptions of favouritism.” Motsepe, who also has a large stake in mining company African Rainbow Minerals, also denied on Monday that he had unduly profited from his investments in renewable energy. AREP’s stakes in various renewables projects, valued at around 800 million rand ($56 million), were bought from private companies, not directly from the government as part of auctions organised the energy ministry, Motsepe said.

2019-02-18,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are asking E.ON’s rivals whether the German utility’s takeover of Innogy’s businesses in an asset deal swap with RWE will harm competition or jack up prices in the German retail market. The European Commission, which is examining the deal, recently sent out lengthy questionnaires with more than 200 questions to competitors and customers of E.ON and Innogy. The deal has triggered criticism from numerous municipalities and small energy providers. The deal would see E.ON acquire Innogy’s prized regulated energy networks and customer operations, while RWE would take on the renewables businesses of both E.ON and Innogy to become Europe’s No.3 renewables player. EU regulators want to know whether E.ON and Innogy compete closely with each other and if there are other credible alternatives for customers, according to the questionnaire seen by Reuters. Respondents were also asked for their views on E.ON and Innogy’s commercial and pricing strategy and whether they have been able to attract customers from the two companies. Regulators also asked if rivals were able to compete with the two companies in concession tenders and as a supplier of smart meters. Complainants say E.ON may be able to offer such metering services 50 percent cheaper than the next competitor. The questionnaire looked into the impact of the deal on electric vehicle charging stations and if E.ON and Innogy have a competitive advantage. The Commission’s preliminary review of the deal ends on March 7. It can either clear the merger with or without concessions or open a four-month investigation if it has serious concerns.

2019-02-18,"* Improved global sentiment, rand hedges lift stocks * Rand 0.43 pct weaker (Updates prices, adds stocks) JOHANNESBURG, Feb 18 (Reuters) - South Africa’s rand weakened in late afternoon trade on Monday as investors awaited Wednesday’s budget, when the finance minister is expected to unveil plans to shore up state-owned power utility Eskom. Stocks rallied, with the Johannesburg All-share index and Top-40 index touching 3-1/2-month and 4-1/2-month highs respectively, with investors growing hopeful the United States and China will agree a deal to end their trade war. At 1530 GMT, the rand was down 0.43 percent at 14.1300 per dollar compared with Friday’s close of 14.0700 in New York. Since the resumption of nationwide rolling power cuts by Eskom on Feb. 10, the rand has lost nearly 4 percent, breaching the psychological 14.00 mark as the crisis at the cash-strapped utility put a possible credit downgrade to junk back on the radar. Although Eskom paused the blackouts on Friday for the first time in five days, it warned its creaking infrastructure could buckle at any time. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is expected to unveil a rescue package for Eskom in the annual budget on Wednesday. “The size and structure of the provision of support for Eskom will be a critical consideration,” RMB analysts Mpho Tsebe and Elena Ilkova said in a note. “Eskom remains a significant fiscal risk and providing it with financial support might be credit-neutral for the sovereign, only if this is accompanied by broader measures to stabilise the power utility,” they added. Government bonds firmed, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 down 2.5 basis points to close at 8.855 percent. On the bourse, the Johannesburg All-Share index ended the session up 1.16 percent at 55,259 points, a level last seen on Nov. 2, while the Top-40 index climbed 1.18 percent to 49,019 points, a level it last touched on Oct. 4. “A little bit more confidence coming back into the market, that the U.S. and China can do a trade deal, so optimism is back again,” Cratos Capital equities trader Greg Davies said. U.S. and Chinese officials will continue negotiations in Washington this week after both sides reported progress at talks in Beijing last week. Davies added that weaker rand was also helping the market “because the rand hedges and all the resources are climbing.” Rand-hedged shares make the bulk of their revenue outside South Africa and tend to rise as the currency weakens. Royal Bafokeng Platinum topped the gainers, climbing 10 percent to 33 rand, while market heavyweight Naspers rose 1.93 percent to 3,115 rand and MediClinic gained 1.64 percent to 58.09 percent.

2019-02-18,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s cabinet on Monday issued guidelines for developing a “Greater Bay Area” around the Pearl River Delta, in a bid to spur growth in Guangdong province and the cities of Hong Kong and Macau. The area is home to some 68 million people and has a combined gross domestic product of about $1.5 trillion, roughly equivalent to that of Australia or South Korea. The development plans will “further enhance and support a leading role of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area in national economic development and opening up”, the State Council, or cabinet, said in the guidelines. The overall plan, which includes long-term goals through 2035, is to turn the Greater Bay Area into a global technology innovation centre and build advanced manufacturing and modern services industries, the cabinet said. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam welcomed the plan. “It can help identify new areas of growth for Hong Kong and foster the diversified development of its economy and industries,” the Hong Kong government said. The area, which covers nine cities in Guangdong, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, will also promote “coordinated development and create a model for high quality development”, China’s cabinet said. Authorities will expand and upgrade airports in the four core cities of Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and accelerate construction of large-scale oil reserve bases in the Pearl River Delta area, it said. Financial institutions in the Greater Bay Area will be allowed to conduct spot and forward yuan trading and yuan derivatives transactions as well as cross-border yuan lending, it said. Companies in the Greater Bay Area would be allowed to issue yuan-denominated bonds within the area, it said. Peter Wong, deputy chairman and chief executive of HSBC’s Asia Pacific operations, said the latest plan will help leverage the strengths of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau in the technology, financial and tourism industries.  “With the direction given by this policy, cities and regions in the Greater Bay Area can develop plans to leverage those complementary strengths more effectively,” Wong said.

2019-02-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Brinkmanship has been one of the defining characteristics of the Trump administration, as the White House ramps up pressure to create a sense of crisis and force negotiating partners to make concessions. The administration has employed the same tactics in trade negotiations with Canada, Mexico, South Korea and the European Union, as well as with the U.S. Congress for border security funding, with varied results. In China’s case, however, the administration may have missed its moment of maximum leverage back in September-October 2018, and as a result may have to settle for a less ambitious deal. Leverage is always relative and at the end of the third quarter China’s economy was showing signs of strain while the U.S. economy and markets were at the top of a growth cycle. Since then, China’s economy has remained under pressure, but the U.S. economy and financial markets have also started to show signs of slackening momentum. Global trade flows and manufacturing activity have shown even clearer indications that the rate of growth decelerated in the fourth quarter and early 2019. Back in September-October, the administration could have risked imposing punitive tariffs on China and hoped to weather the economic fallout while waiting for China to capitulate. But the economic and financial market situation is now much more fragile and punitive tariffs would threaten to tip the domestic and international economies into a recession. Concern about the consequences of failing to reach a deal by the deadline of March 1 set by the U.S. president appears to be making both sides more eager for some form of accord, even if it is an incomplete or interim one. News reports based on leaks from inside the talks process suggest the two sides have been inching towards an interim understanding, despite remaining far apart on some of the most contentious issues. The talks may have to settle for a partial agreement, in which the two sides reach agreements on farm and energy trade, goods and services, but leave tougher issues on intellectual property, technology transfers, subsidies and state-owned enterprises to be settled later. Hardliners in the United States have been upping the pressure on the administration not to settle for anything less than a comprehensive deal that transforms China’s economy and ensures fair trade. For maximalists, the risk of short-term cyclical damage in the form of a recession is worth taking to ensure longer-term structural gains and entrench U.S. technology and economic leadership. For the White House, however, structural objectives must be balanced against recession risk and an inexorable political cycle that has presidential and congressional elections less than 21 months away (and primaries less than 12 months away). The administration is likely to put the economy at the centre of its re-election campaign in 2020 and a cyclical downturn would complicate that narrative. A broad range of U.S. economic and financial indicators show the rate of expansion peaking at the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth, before slowing significantly: The slowdown has been even more marked outside the United States, with global manufacturers reporting export orders falling since September, and the decline is accelerating. Air freight through Hong Kong is falling at the fastest rate for seven years, according to data from the Special Administrative Region’s Civil Aviation Department. Container trade volumes through major cargo hubs including Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach all show a sharp slowdown in the second half of 2018 and into 2019. The rebound in U.S. equity markets and steadying of consumer and business sentiment over the last month have been largely attributed to hopes that the trade negotiators will reach a deal or at least postpone tariff increases. Top policymakers, including the U.S. president, have fuelled financial market optimism by describing positive progress made in the talks, and the hopeful sentiment has spilled over into commodities such as oil. Markets are banking on a deal (even a limited, incomplete one, or a talks extension) to keep the U.S. and global economies growing and avoid a slide into recession. As a result, the economic outlook has become deeply entwined with the fate of the trade negotiations, which has reduced the leverage of U.S. negotiators. China would undoubtedly take a severe economic hit if the talks fail and punitive tariffs go into effect, but the United States might be hit even harder in relative if not absolute terms. China’s currency hit a low against the U.S. dollar at the end of October and has since appreciated significantly, in a measure of shifting relative economic performance. The administration cannot be sure tariffs would not push the economy into a recession for which it would likely be blamed, which makes brinkmanship very risky. The administration has a mixed track record on brinkmanship, securing some gains, but also miscalculating the determination and resilience of its opponents in some cases. No one can be certain that the White House will not choose to risk recession by refusing anything less than an ambitious deal. Uncertainty is the essence of brinkmanship. But both the United States and China, and specifically their top leaders, have a lot to lose if the talks fail, which is the main reason they are likely to succeed, even if the price is deferring some of the harder issues until later.

Gains were capped by auto makers, who were hit by data showing Chinese car sales fell 16 percent in January, their seventh straight month of decline. The autos index, a bellwether for Europe’s economy, fell 0.4 percent. The industry was also weighed down by fears that a U.S. Commerce Department report would lead to tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. German shares slipped 0.1 percent lower. “The optimism on trade has been strong, but the underlying economic data has been a lot of weaker - so you have some push and pull factors,” said David Vickers, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments. Much focus was now on flash PMI data due out this week, he said.  “As the bounce-back from the December lows fades ... the fundamentals now reassert (themselves),” Vickers added.  Bad economic data has fuelled expectations that the world’s most powerful central banks would deliver reflationary policies and provide support for markets.  The need for stimulus was highlighted by data showing a slide in Singapore exports and a big drop in foreign orders for Japanese machinery goods.

2019-02-18,"JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) - South African utility Eskom imposed the worst power cuts in several years on homes and businesses last week, conjuring up memories of the 2008 crisis when the grid nearly collapsed and cost the mining industry billions in lost output.  Although Eskom - which supplies around 90 percent of power in Africa’s most industrialized economy - paused the blackouts on Friday for the first time in five days, it warned that its creaking infrastructure could buckle at any time. A decade ago, the state utility ordered mining houses to evacuate all underground staff and cease mining operations for five days as it cut electricity supply to minimum levels.  It is not clear how much the industry, which consumes about 15 percent of Eskom’s annual output, lost in production but the crisis sent prices of both gold and platinum to record levels and pummelled the rand.  But mining companies now appear to be better prepared to cope with the scheduled blackouts thanks largely to an agreement struck in 2010 between Eskom and the industry that allows it to continue operating on reduced power.   “The South African mines are probably a little bit better prepared for electricity cuts than they were 10 years ago,” said Peter Major, an analyst and director of mining at Mergence Corporate Solutions.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd (Amplats), the world’s top producer of the metal, said it lost 14,000 ounces or less than 1 percent of annual output - based on 2018 production - last week. Diversified miners Exxaro and Anglo American said their operations were affected to varying degrees while AngloGold Ashanti said safety and production were untouched. An industry group, the Mineral Council, did not give specific details about the impact of last week’s power cuts on production but said the effect on output for the sector had been minimal.     Miners including Impala Platinum, Harmony and Sibanye-Stillwater have also been working on reducing their reliance on Eskom by setting up their own power generators. However, it has been difficult to get that off the ground because of red tape and prohibitive costs, they say. South Africa is home to the world’s biggest platinum group metals deposits, accounting for just over 90 percent of global production. Any disruption in output could directly affect prices of the white metal. The mining industry directly contributes more than 7 percent to the economy which has been struggling with anaemic growth over the last 10 years. Miners, among the biggest consumers of electricity in the country, are already grappling with weak profits that could be exacerbated by the potential loss of output if Eskom imposes deeper power cuts.   (Graphic: Miners cut power usage but Eskom revenues from industry soars - tmsnrt.rs/2Ed7qva) The potential impact on jobs is also a concern in a country with a jobless rate of more than 27 percent and has prompted fierce opposition from the country’s powerful trade unions to President Cyril Ramaphohsa’s plan to split the utility. “With all these power cuts through Eskom there will be consequences ... People will lose their work for less time put in for work and we are very, very concerned about this,” said Stanford Mazhindu, spokesperson of trade union UASA. The 2010 agreement between Eskom and the mining industry has partly shielded miners from the massive disruption caused by the 2008 power cuts, when the sector was forced to shut for five days to allow the grid to recover.    Under the scheme, Eskom gives the industry notice to reduce their power consumption by between 15 and 20 percent when the national grid is at its tightest and unable to meet demand. “If it’s a 15 or 20 percent reduction in demand and it goes on for an extended period, it can have quite a big impact,” said Sibanye spokesman James Wellsted. For instance, concentrators are switched off and water pumps that would prevent underground dams from flooding are only turned on during low usage hours at night, he said.  Impala Platinum reduces its usage of power-intensive equipment, including furnaces, during national peak usage times when residential consumers are just waking up or have just returned from work, spokesman Johan Theron said. Despite these measures, business leaders and the Mineral Council are still concerned about the risks Eskom poses to the industry.  Impala’s Theron said shifting energy-intensive work to an off-peak demand period in the middle of the night to catch up on lost production “is not ideal or sustainable, as it will  impact the business over time in that wear on furnaces are accelerated under these operating conditions”.  While the industry was coping, extended rolling blackouts would have affected the commercial viability of mines, particularly deep-level mining and platinum mines, Mineral Council spokeswoman Charmane Russell said.  Attempts by miners to produce their own power are expensive, as Eskom requires them to connect to the grid for a fee.  The variety of legal codes found at the energy regulator and energy ministry are additional hurdles to independent power generation, they say.  The volume of electricity consumed by the industry is also too much to rely solely on self-generation.     “We need to fix Eskom, to think that underground gold mining can survive without Eskom is going to be difficult,” said Peter Steenkamp, the chief executive of gold miner Harmony.  However, a few companies have succeeded in cutting dependency on the grid. Petrochemicals firm Sasol produces 70 percent of its electricity needs to power its sprawling plants. Power generation, from steam turbines commissioned in 2010 and contracted with Eskom via a medium-term power purchase programme, helped to alleviate Eskom’s shortages at the time, Sasol said.  But companies such as Sibanye are struggling to do the same. The precious metals producer has pushed back plans, unveiled in 2014, to build a solar plant because of difficulty in getting finance for the project and bureaucracy related to connecting to the national power grid.  Harmony Gold has also been trying to build a 30 megawatt solar plant.   Amplats said it was also considering building a 100 megawatt solar power plant at the group’s Mogalakwena mine.

2019-02-18,"PARIS (Reuters) - French energy major Total is partnering with Denmark’s Orsted and renewable energy producer Elicio to submit a joint bid for the 600 megawatt capacity Dunkirk offshore wind project in France, the company said on Monday.  The bid is the oil and gas major’s first serious foray into offshore wind in decades as it expands its presence in the renewable energy value chain. Until recently, Total’s major investments in renewables have been chiefly in the solar segment, with its $1.3 billion (£1.01 billion) acquisition of SunPower and purchase of a 23 percent stake in solar and wind energy producer Total Eren. Meanwhile European peers such as Equinor and Shell have been increasing investments in offshore wind developments.    Total’s executives have said the company was keenly watching the wind segment and would invest if a suitable business case emerged.  “Total’s participation in this offshore wind bid is in line with our strategy to develop our low-carbon electricity business in Europe,” Philippe Sauquet, president of gas, renewables and power at Total, said in a statement. The company plans to invest $1.5-$2 billion annually in low-carbon electricity with a target of around 10 GW of installed capacity by 2022. Orsted manages more than a quarter of the world’s installed wind capacity, while Elicio is particularly active in wind power in France and Belgium. A number of international firms are vying for the Dunkirk tender. “We think that offshore wind offers the materiality and returns that the majors are looking for and have expected Total to follow its major peers in the offshore wind sector,” said Valentina Kretzschmar, Wood Mackenzie’s director of corporate analysis. Kretzschmar said Total’s partnership with experienced offshore wind players such as Orsted and Elicio will help it rise along the learning curve with the new technology, while its partners will benefit from its financial strength and project execution expertise.

2019-02-18,"* Customs clearance typically takes five to 20 days * Authorities notified traders about possible delays * No reason cited for longer Australian clearing times * Beijing-Canberra tensions have risen recently BEIJING, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Chinese coal traders are halting purchases of Australian coal and coking coal as clearing times through China’s customs have at least doubled to 40 days or more, four traders at major buyers told Reuters on Monday. The traders said only cargoes from Australia, the biggest supplier of the fuel to the world’s top consumer, were affected. “We have stopped ordering coal from Australia because it is unknown how long the restriction will last,” said a manager at a Shanghai-based trading company who usually buys around 400,000 tonnes of Australian coal every month. Customs clearance typically takes five to 20 days. Now it can be as much as 45 days, said the manager, asking not to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media. It was not clear why China had stepped up checks on Australian imports but tension between Beijing and Canberra has grown in recent months over issues of cyber security and China’s influence in Pacific island nations. China’s General Administration of Customs did not respond to a request for comment. There was no immediate response from the Foreign Ministry to a faxed request for comment. Authorities at some ports notified importers verbally this month that Australian thermal coal and coking coal would take longer than usual to clear, the Shanghai-based manager said. A Beijing-based coal trader and a purchasing manager at a coke plant received similar notifications. None of the buyers were aware of the reason. China has curbed coal imports in the past to support domestic coal miners and reduce consumption to tackle air pollution. It restricted Indonesian coal imports in 2017, citing high impurities and low energy efficiency. The Beijing trader said the restrictions on Australian imports were “the first time for Beijing to curb coal imports from a specific country but without a reason.” Reuters reported in January that dozens of ships carrying coal and iron ore were waiting to unload outside ports due to possible customs delays. The most-active thermal coal futures on China’s Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange hit 594 yuan ($87.79) a tonne on Monday, just shy of the three-month peak of 595.6 yuan, although the contract closed down 1 percent 583.8 yuan a tonne. Benchmark Newcastle high energy thermal coal prices have dropped to $88 a tonne, the lowest level in 19 months, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said. The Shanghai trader said he had stopped buying from Australia and would purchase more from Indonesia and Russia. The Beijing trader said she would reduce Australian imports. A coal broker at state-backed mining group Minmetals said he had asked clients to put Australian imports on hold. Refinitiv ship tracking data showed coal shipments departing from Australia’s Newcastle port to China fell 30 percent last month compared with December to 18.19 million tonnes. As of Monday, shipments scheduled to leave in February were 12.78 million tonnes. $1 = 6.7663 Chinese yuan renminbi

2019-02-18,"KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Almost a decade after Norway signed a $1-billion deal with Indonesia to help protect its tropical forests, the first payment for reduced emissions will be made after deforestation rates fell, environmentalists and government officials said. Indonesia imposed a moratorium on forest-clearing under the 2010 climate deal, with payments linked to the Southeast Asian nation’s progress on lowering planet-warming emissions from felling trees, which release carbon when they rot or are burned. Indonesian Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar and Norwegian Climate and Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen agreed the first payments would be made after deforestation rates dropped in 2017, according to a statement issued on Saturday by the Norwegian embassy in Jakarta. No details were provided on the payment amount, although green groups estimate the figure to be about $20 million. “It is a big deal because it reflects the fact that Indonesia has turned (a corner), and that is great news for all of us,” said Oyvind Eggen, director of the Oslo-based Rainforest Foundation Norway. “We want to see from Indonesia that this is a trend and not a one-year event,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Home to the world’s third-largest tropical forests, Indonesia is also the biggest producer of palm oil. Environmentalists blame much of the forest destruction on land clearance for oil-palm plantations. Deforestation and forest fires continue to blight many parts of the country, while revisions to the forest-cutting moratorium have lacked transparency, environmental campaigners say. By November 2016, Indonesia’s forest moratorium covered an area of more than 66 million hectares (163 million acres). In an attempt to tackle its annual haze from fires on deforested land, Indonesia switched its focus from containment to prevention after a particularly bad outbreak in 2015 that cost the country $16 billion and left more than 500,000 people suffering respiratory ailments. “The fires in 2015 were one of the key reasons we are moving now,” said forest expert Eggen on the climate deal’s progress. There had been a shift in political will and greater transparency from Indonesia over the last four years, he noted. Indonesia confirmed on Saturday that carbon emissions from deforestation declined in 2017. Once independently verified, payments for about 4.8 million tonnes of avoided emissions will be made, the Norwegian embassy statement said. New measures introduced by the Indonesian government, including a ban on destroying primary forests and peatlands, and limiting palm oil expansion were critical, said Norwegian minister Elvestuen. Future pay-outs under the $1 billion deal would be made when further deforestation progress was proven, Eggen said. He urged Jakarta to strengthen and extend its moratorium to include secondary forests - areas that have been cleared but where woody vegetation has again taken over. Re-evaluation of forestry concessions with a high deforestation risk, a more transparent approach, and protecting the interests of indigenous people were also key, Eggen said.

2019-02-18,"NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, has signed its first annual deal to buy U.S. oil, paying about $1.5 billion for 60,000 barrels a day in the year to March 2020 to diversify its crude sources, its chairman said on Monday. IOC is the first Indian state refiner to buy U.S. oil under an annual contract, in a deal that will also help boost trade between New Delhi and Washington. The company has previously purchased U.S. oil from spot markets and signed a mini-term deal in August to buy 6 million barrels of U.S. oil between November and January. IOC chairman Sanjiv Singh said the annual contract will begin from April. He declined to give the name of the seller or pricing details, citing confidentiality. A trade source, who is not authorized to speak to media, said IOC signed the deal with Norwegian oil company Equinor which will supply a variety of U.S. crude grades.  Equinor, which has set up an office in New Delhi to support oil marketing and trading, declined to comment. Indian Oil buys about 75 percent of its oil needs through long-term deals, mostly with OPEC nations. The term deal will help cut IOC’s dependence on OPEC crude, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of east of Suez oil for consultants FGE in Singapore. “Lots of geopolitical issues are going around. We expect lots of volume going away from Venezuela, west Africa and Iran, so it makes sense to have guaranteed term supplies from the U.S., where crude production is increasing,” she said. “There is a push for diversification everywhere. South Korea is giving a freight rebate for non-Middle East crude imports,” she added. India and the United States, which have developed close political and security ties, are also looking to develop bilateral trade, which stood at $126 billion in 2017 but is widely seen to be performing well below its potential. The two countries have set up seven groups of chief executives with top U.S. and Indian firms to boost bilateral trade in areas including energy.  Last week India’s top gas importer Petronet LNG signed an initial deal to invest and buy LNG from Tellurian Inc’s proposed Driftwood project in Louisiana in the United States.

2019-02-18,"* Secures 250 mln euro loan, to repay half of bond early * Company has been hit by slump in sugar prices (Adds quotes, background) PARIS, Feb 18 (Reuters) - French sugar group Tereos, which has been hit by a slump in the sugar market, said on Monday it had secured a loan that would give the co-operative a financial reprieve as it hopes for a rebound in prices. In December, Tereos - which last season became the world’s second largest sugar maker - plunged to a first-half loss of almost 100 million euros ($113 million) and said it expected to be in the red across its full financial year for the second year running. Raw sugar futures ended 2018 at their lowest in 10 years, pressured by heavy global oversupply. The European Union liberalised its sugar market in September 2017, ending a system of guaranteed minimum prices and protected production quotas. This gave producers more freedom to expand and export, but a worst-case scenario emerged, with EU makers exposed to the slump world prices. Tereos said it had secured a 250 million euro loan expiring in 2022, and would repay half of its 500 million euros March 2020 bond a year in advance. The loan is being provided by BNP Paribas, Natixis and Rabobank, Tereos said in a statement. “This allows us to gain time to see how things evolve on the sugar market,” a Tereos spokesman said. “In such a violent sugar crisis it is responsible management. We cut by half the reimbursement we would need to have done next year.” Tereos said the new loan would have a slightly lower interest rate than the 4.25 percent committed in the bond expiring in 2020 but declined to disclose it. The company unveiled plans last summer to open its business to investors as it seeks to expand, a move it has since said could happen in around 2-3 years. But it has also been facing an internal crisis with dissidents accusing Tereos of hiding financial difficulties, something the cooperative group has always denied. Tereos said it maintained at group level a financial security of 1 billion euros as of Dec. 31, 2018, including a still undrawn 225 million euros back-up facility. Rival Suedzucker said last month it planned to cut capacity and close sugar production plants to save about 100 million euros a year following the slump in sugar prices. That plan includes two sugar facilities in France at its branch Saint Louis Sucre. $1 = 0.8843 euros

2019-02-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors bought crude oil futures and options at the fastest rate for almost six months in the week to Feb. 12. Hedge fund managers are becoming steadily more bullish on the outlook for oil prices as Saudi Arabia makes deep cuts in production, sanctions hit Venezuela and Iran, and the U.S. and China inch towards a trade deal. Hedge funds and other money managers were net buyers of 32 million barrels of Brent crude futures and options in the week to Feb. 22, according to position records published by ICE Futures Europe. Portfolio managers have been net buyers of Brent in nine out of the last 10 weeks, boosting their net position by a total of 130 million barrels since Dec. 4. Last week saw the largest purchases so far. Earlier in the current cycle most position-building came from closing previous bearish short positions, but the balance shifted in the most recent week with most accumulation from initiating new bullish long positions. Fund managers opened 29 million barrels of new long positions while cutting short positions by 3 million barrels in the week to Feb. 12. Funds now hold a net long position of 266 million barrels in Brent, up from 136 million at the start of December, though still far below the almost 500-million-barrel position at the end of September. Similar position-building is evident in European gasoil, where funds were net buyers of 11 million barrels of futures and options in the week to Feb. 12. Portfolio managers have been net buyers of gasoil for six consecutive weeks, with total purchases amounting to 38 million barrels. Like Brent, last week’s purchases of gasoil contracts were the largest so far, and the balance has shifted from short covering to initiating new long positions. Saudi Arabia has eased concerns about oversupply by acting as swing producer, cutting output promptly despite poor compliance from other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+. U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have also removed significant volumes of oil from the market, especially heavy gasoil-rich crudes, adding to the sudden tightening of the supply side. At the same time, traders have become more optimistic trade negotiations between the United States and China will avoid the imposition of new tariffs on March 2 and avert a global recession, shoring up demand. While oil consumption growth may not accelerate, avoiding tariffs and a recession would ensure it does not slow any further, easing fears about an oversupplied oil market in 2019. Record hedge fund sales forced an abrupt change in strategy by OPEC+ in the fourth quarter as the global economy and oil consumption outlook deteriorated. But now the producer group has shifted course, hedge fund buying has accelerated the recent rise in Brent prices, providing Saudi Arabia with an early payoff for production cuts, and validating OPEC+ strategy. And because hedge fund positions tend to be concentrated in contracts nearest to maturity, which offer the best liquidity, buying has also accelerated the shift in the calendar spreads from contango to backwardation. Provided the United States and China can avoid another round of tariffs, and the global economy skirts recession, the balance of price risks is likely to remain tilted towards the upside.

2019-02-18,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States is lobbying Gulf states to hold off restoring ties with Syria, including the UAE which has moved closer to Damascus to counter the influence of its rival Iran, five sources told Reuters. The opposing approaches are an early test of whether Syrian President Bashar al-Assad can gain political and diplomatic credibility after a nearly eight-year civil war turned him into an international pariah. Many countries cut links with Syria at the start of the war. Several Gulf states shut or downgraded their embassies, Syria was suspended from the Arab League, flights stopped and border crossings were closed. The United States and other countries imposed economic sanctions. Washington, backed by Gulf countries Saudi Arabia and Qatar, does not want Syria welcomed back into the international community until a political process to end the war is agreed. “The Saudis are quite helpful in pressing the others. Qatar also is doing the right thing,” said a U.S. official, when asked about the diplomatic pressure. The official said that the United States was pleased that “some Gulf states are putting the brakes on”. The U.S. position suggests that Assad is still a long way from being accepted, even after his forces reclaimed most of Syria through victories over Sunni rebels, thanks largely to help from Iran and Russia.  The lack of support from Washington and regional heavyweight Riyadh to end Syria’s isolation will make it harder for the devastated country to attract investment needed to rebuild it. While the UAE believes Sunni Muslim states must embrace Syria swiftly in order to move Assad out of Shi’ite Iran’s orbit, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the U.S. approach. The UAE sees Assad as the “only option”, according to one Gulf source, and believes that stemming Iranian influence in Syria could help prevent the kind of hold it now has in Iraq. During the war, the UAE did support armed groups opposed to Assad. But its role was less prominent than that of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and its support was mostly to do with ensuring that Islamist forces did not dominate the uprising. U.S. and Saudi officials have spoken to representatives of other Gulf countries, urging them not to restore ties with Syria, three Gulf political sources, a U.S. official and a senior Western diplomat said. They particularly want to ensure that those countries do not back Syria’s return to regional organisation the Arab League, and that embassies are kept closed or operating with only junior staffing. With Assad strengthening his position militarily, relations with some countries have started to thaw. The UAE reopened its Damascus embassy in December.  This was a major boost for Assad, and the United States “gave the Emiratis flak”, said the U.S. official. A UAE official did not respond to a request for comment.  “In the last seven years there has been absolutely zero Arab influence in Syria. Zero Arab influence has been a disaster,” UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told reporters in a recent briefing in Washington. He said Abu Dhabi re-established diplomatic ties with Damascus to “be closer to the reality on the ground”. Gargash said more Arab states need to engage “to crowd the space” taken by Russia and Iran, who support Assad, and Turkey, which backs the rebels. The next step for Syria’s international rehabilitation could be reinstatement to the Arab League, which would be largely symbolic but something Assad’s government would likely use to show its return from the diplomatic wilderness. The League said last Monday that there was not yet the necessary consensus for this to happen, and the United States is pushing hard to ensure it does not, according to the sources. “Washington is lobbying against it and Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to slow down the readmittance of Syria in the Arab League,” said the senior Western diplomat. Government media offices in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman’s foreign ministry did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment. A Kuwaiti foreign ministry official declined to comment on whether Kuwait had been asked by Washington or Riyadh to hold off on normalising ties and reiterated the country’s stance that “any possible return of relations with it can only be through the Arab League”. Not all Arab League nations severed ties with Syria after the outbreak of the war in 2011. Oman maintained diplomatic ties with Damascus. A day after the UAE reopened its embassy, Bahrain said its embassy in Damascus and the Syrian diplomatic mission in Manama had been operating “without interruption”. Kuwait’s deputy foreign minister said in December it would reopen its embassy in Damascus once the Arab League allowed it.  Saudi Arabia has no plans now to normalise ties, said one Gulf official, adding “everything is suspended” until Syrians agree a transition from Assad’s rule. Rival Qatar has said it sees no “encouraging” signs for restoring normal relations, its foreign minister said in January. But Abu Dhabi hopes it can eventually sway Syria towards the business-friendly UAE model, and Dubai can play a role as a hub for trade with Syria. Abu Dhabi last month hosted a Syrian delegation led by prominent businessman Mohammad Hamsho to discuss potential cooperation in trade, infrastructure, agriculture, tourism, logistics and renewable energy, state media reported. Gargash acknowledged, however, that real investment would not happen without a political process.  A second senior Western diplomat said that without a U.N.-led political process it would be difficult for sanctions to be removed which would clear the way for investment. “I don’t think this is the end of the war and time for reconstruction,” that diplomat said.

MSCI’s All-Country World Index rose 0.3 percent after Japan’s Nikkei closed up 1.8 percent at its highest level of the year and MSCI’s index of Asian equities rose almost one percent. Shanghai blue chips surged 2.7 percent to their highest finish in more than six months. Trade negotiations between the United States and China will resume this week, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying he may extend a March 1 deadline for a deal. Both sides reported progress at last week’s talks in Beijing. But the mood was more subdued in Europe, where a pan-European equity index inched to new four-month high but gains were capped by the auto sector, which was hit by data showing Chinese car sales fell 16 percent in January, their seventh straight month of decline. The autos index, a bellwether for Europe’s economy, fell 0.9 percent, also pressured by fears that a U.S. Commerce Department report to President Trump could unleash steep tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. German shares fell 0.3 percent . Trump has 90 days to decide whether to act upon the recommendations. “The optimism on trade has been strong, but the underlying economic data has been a lot of weaker - so you have some push and pull factors,” said David Vickers, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments, adding much focus was now on flash PMI data due out later in the week. “As the bounce back from the December lows fades...the fundamentals now reassert itself,” Vickers added. Recent runs of soft economic data has fuelled expectations that the world’s most powerful central banks could deliver on reflationary policies and provide support for markets. The need for stimulus was highlighted by data showing a sharp slide in Singapore exports and a big drop in foreign orders for Japanese machinery goods. Beijing is already taking action with China’s banks making the most new loans on record in January in an attempt to jumpstart sluggish investment. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were flat as trade was thinned by a holiday in U.S. markets. The Dow and the Nasdaq had boasted their eighth consecutive weekly gains on wagers the U.S. and China would hammer out an agreement resolving their protracted trade war. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting are due on Wednesday and should provide more guidance on the likelihood of rate hikes this year. There is also talk the bank will keep a much larger balance sheet than previously planned. “Given the range of speakers since the January meeting who support “patience,” the Fed minutes should reiterate a dovish message overall,” analysts at TD Securities said in a note. The dollar was steady on the yen at 110.57, having backed away from a two-month top of 111.12. Sterling drifted higher after registering three consecutive weeks of losses as investors waited for the outcome of Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May plans to speak to every EU leader and the European Commission chief to seek changes to her EU withdrawal agreement, after another defeat from her own lawmakers last week. All of which left the dollar a shade lower at 96.835 on a basket of currencies and away from last week’s top of 97.368. On commodity markets, oil prices reached their highest for the year, buoyed by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Brent crude futures rose a quarter percent to $66.30.

2019-02-18,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s two presidential candidates pledged to achieve energy self-sufficiency by boosting the use of bioenergy, particularly fuelled by palm oil, to cut costly oil imports by Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.  Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, has been pushing for all diesel fuel used in the country to contain biodiesel to boost palm consumption, slash fuel imports, and narrow a yawning current account gap. In a televised election debate, President Joko Widodo said if he won a second term the government planned to implement a B100 programme, referring to fuel made entirely from palm oil,  after last year making it mandatory to use biodiesel containing 20 percent bio-content (B20).  “We hope 30 percent of total palm production will go to biofuel. The plan is clear, so we will not rely on imported oil,” Widodo said, adding that Indonesia’s crude palm oil production had reached 46 million tonnes a year. Agreeing on the importance of bioenergy for self-sufficiency, his opponent Prabowo Subianto said if elected he would also “boost the use of palm oil, palm sugar, cassava and ethanol from sugar (cane)”. The challenger did not elaborate on his bioenergy plan, but his campaign team has proposed using millions of hectares of degraded land to cultivate palm sugar to produce energy. Widodo’s government has previously said it would offer incentives for developers of B100, which the net oil importer hopes can replace fuel imports within three years. Oil imports have contributed to Indonesia’s widening current account deficit and the volatility of the rupiah currency. The government claimed that its biodiesel programme would save billions of dollars in diesel fuel imports. Although retired general Prabowo agreed with Widodo on several points during the debate, he said Indonesia’s “land and water, and the resources within” must be controlled by the government. “We are of the view that the government must be present in detail, thoroughly, firmly and actively to correct inequalities in wealth,” he said. The challenger said the proportion of small farmers’ holdings in the country’s palm plantations should also be larger. Smallholders currently account for roughly 40 percent of Indonesia’s 12 million hectares of palm oil plantations. Farmers currently do not require larger plots of land, but instead, they need a programme to boost yield from their current farm, Mansuetus Darto of Palm Farmers Union said. He added that farmers wanted more clarity on Widodo’s B100 programme and have asked to ensure that small holders play a greater role in the biodiesel supply chain. “This is an important task for Jokowi on how to prevent big palm companies to be the only main suppliers and not farmers,” Darto said, referring to the president’s nickname. Meanwhile, environmental group Greenpeace criticised both candidates for failing to ensure that the biofuel programmes they promised will not cause further erosion of forests, peatlands and mangrove, due to potentially higher demand for palm oil that is mixed with the fuel. By 2030, the global demand for biofuels would reach 67 million tonnes from the current 10.7 million tonnes, which could potentially result in 4.5 million hectares of deforestation and 2.9 million hectares of mangrove disappearance, Greenpeace said.        Both candidates expressed support for greater control of Indonesian natural resources.  President Widodo highlighted Pertamina’s takeover of stewardship of major oil and gas blocks from foreign operators, and an agreement for a state company to purchase a 51 percent stake in the giant Grasberg copper mine from Freeport McMoRan.

2019-02-18,"(Repeats Feb. 15 story, text unchanged) By Ekaterina Kravtsova LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Changing gas price dynamics caused by an influx of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe have played into Russian producer Gazprom’s hands and enabled it to increase pipeline flows to the continent so far this year. Gazprom is moving determinedly with spot gas sales in Europe due to a near-fivefold spike in U.S. LNG sales to the continent in October to January compared with a year earlier. But sales within Gazprom long-term contracts are also rising. In January, Gazprom gas flows to Europe totalled 17.6 billion cubic metres (bcm), an almost 0.5 bcm rise from the same month a year earlier, Gazprom data shows. One reason for the rise is a change in time spreads on European wholesale gas contracts, which is enabling some traders to increase purchases in long-term deals with Gazprom or through spot auctions by the company. This trend shows how LNG, which has flooded Europe since October, is reshaping gas prices and flows in the continent, with traders still adjusting to the new market environment. “LNG has really changed the situation,” a gas trader said. “We have to write new textbooks.” A jump in LNG supplies contributed significantly to oversupply in the European gas market, leading to high storage levels and pushing down price spreads. Day-ahead gas prices in most European countries are almost on par with summer contract prices, which makes it more profitable to buy gas on the prompt market rather than withdraw it from storage sites. “When you look at storages, due to the day-ahead pricing (being) flattish (compared) to the summer, it makes sense not to withdraw as you can’t cover the withdrawal fees with the spread between the day-ahead and summer,” a London-based trader said. This week, the day-ahead price on the Dutch hub has traded slightly below the summer 2019 contract price. A year ago it was trading almost 10 percent above the summer contract. “At the current day-ahead to summer spread it makes sense to reduce withdrawal and keep (the long-term contract with Gazprom) running,” a trader in continental Europe said. Gas traders have a bearish outlook for both contracts, meaning Gazprom’s flows could remain high until the end of March, with Europe entering the summer season with multi-year-high storage levels. Gazprom’s trading arm, Gazprom Marketing and Trading, has also been more active on European hubs selling gas, traders said. In the spot market, Gazprom has been selling gas in auctions it launched in September. In February, the majority of gas in auction has been sold for prompt delivery so far, while in January traders bought more February contracts, expecting cold weather. Traders said the price in auctions is usually very close to that on European hubs, showing Gazprom is becoming more flexible with its price strategy to win buyers on the continent. Refinitiv analysts expect storage in northwest Europe, excluding Britain, to close the winter season at around 190 terrawatt hours (TWh), against 50 TWh at the end of March 2018. This would be the highest stock level since 2016 and pressure summer gas contracts further. The Dutch summer price is 8 percent cheaper this week than a year ago and is showing the biggest discount to the next winter contract in seven years. Summer contracts in Europe are widely forecast to be very weak this year, a trader said. “(But) what everyone expects is not usually what happens as it’s priced in well.” Reporting by Ekaterina Kravtsova; Additional reporting by

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9 percent, largely recovering from a sharp fall last Friday. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 1.8 percent to its highest level of the year so far, while Shanghai blue chips rallied 2.1 percent.

The two sides will resume negotiations this week, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying he may extend a March 1 deadline for a deal. Both reported progress in five days of talks in Beijing last week. “That does not rule out a setback or two between now and the start of March,” said analysts at CBA in a note. “Even so, we still think that both sides have good reasons to want to get to an agreement. And, so motivated, it makes an agreement more likely than not.” There are also growing expectations of more reflationary policies from some of the world’s more powerful central banks. The need for stimulus was highlighted on Monday by data showing a sharp slide in Singapore exports and a big drop in foreign orders for Japanese machinery goods. Beijing is already taking action with China’s banks making the most new loans on record in January in an attempt to jumpstart sluggish investment. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting are due on Wednesday and should provide more guidance on the likelihood or not for rate hikes this year. There is also talk the bank will keep a much larger balance sheet than previously planned. “Given the range of speakers since the January meeting who support “patience,” the Fed minutes should reiterate a dovish message overall,” said analysts at TD Securities in a note. A roll call of Fed officials are speaking at various events this week including a round table on Friday covering the future of its balance sheet. The European Central Bank’s Olli Rehn told a German newspaper on Sunday that recent data point to a weakening euro zone economy and interest rates would remain at the current level until monetary policy goals have been met. That came amid much speculation the ECB would launch another round of Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) to support bank lending. The risk of an easy ECB saw the euro touch a three-month low on Friday before then bouncing on dovish comments from Fed officials. The single currency edged up 0.2 percent on Monday to $1.1312, though that was still well within the $1.1213/1.1570 trading range that has held since mid-October. The dollar was steady on the yen at 110.53, having backed away from a two-month top of 111.12. Sterling was a shade firmer at $1.2913 ahead of Brexit talks between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week. All of which left the dollar down at 96.765 on a basket of currencies and away from last week’s top of 97.368. In commodity markets, the drift in the dollar helped spot gold firm 0.2 percent to $1,323.56 per ounce.

2019-02-18,"(Repeats without change) By Sudarshan Varadhan NEW DELHI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - India has proposed incentives worth 885 billion rupees ($12.4 billion) to encourage power plants to install equipment to curb emissions and to develop infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs), a government statement said on Friday. The bulk of the money, 835 billion rupees, would be aimed at curbing sulphur emissions from power plants, with the rest devoted to development of EV infrastructure in 70 cities over five years ending 2025, the statement said. The proposal by India’s power ministry to its finance commission is in addition to an existing proposal that envisages installation costs for emission-cutting equipment to be passed on to consumers. The ministry’s plans come against the backdrop of a utilities sector under financial stress, with loans from mostly state-run lenders turning sour or requiring restructuring, according to an Assocham-Grant Thorton report this month. The Association of power producers, an industry group that represents private companies such as Reliance Power and Adani Power as well as state-run NTPC, had been lobbying for incentives for the past two years. India has already extended a December 2017 deadline for utilities to meet emissions standards by up to six years as power producers struggle to comply with stringent rules set out by the environment ministry in 2015 to cut emissions that cause lung diseases, acid rain and smog. Thermal power companies account for 80 percent of all industrial emissions of particulate matter, sulfur and nitrous oxides in India. The EV incentives, meanwhile, are part of India’s efforts to encourage higher sales of electric vehicles, having said it hopes to electrify all new vehicles by 2030.

2019-02-18,"SINGAPORE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to their highest levels in 2019 on Monday, lifted by OPEC-led supply cuts and by U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures hit $56 per barrel for the first time this year, before edging back to $55.89 per barrel by 0051 GMT. That was still 0.5-percent above their last settlement. International Brent crude futures hit a 2019-high of $66.61 per barrel early on Monday before easing to $66.47 per barrel, still up 0.3 percent from their last close. For both benchmarks, those were their highest levels since November 2018. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as well as some non-affiliated producers like Russia, agreed late last year to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to prevent a large supply overhang from swelling more. Further pushing up crude prices have been U.S. sanctions against oil exporters and OPEC-members Iran and Venezuela. At least partly offsetting these supply falls has been a surge in U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA by more than 2 million bpd in 2018, to a record 11.9 million bpd. And there are signs that U.S. output will rise further. U.S. energy firms last week increased the number of oil rigs looking for new production by three, to a total of 857, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in a weekly report last Friday. RIG-OL-USA- That means the U.S. rig count is higher than a year ago when under 800 rigs were active. “The U.S. shale industry continues to show signs of resilience. It increased drilling activity for the third time in four weeks last week,” ANZ bank said.
