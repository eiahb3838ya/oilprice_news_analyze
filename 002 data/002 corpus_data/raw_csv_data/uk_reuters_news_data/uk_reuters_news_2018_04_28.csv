2018-04-28,"KONJIC, April 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Plans to build about 3,000 hydropower plants in the Balkans in the next few years endanger Europe’s last wild rivers and some of the most important biodiversity hotspots on the continent, campaigers said on Saturday. Stretching from Slovenia to Albania, critics say the hydropower boom threatens animal life, including endemic species of fish, and people’s access to water used for drinking, fishing and farming. “There is a tsunami of hydropower dam constructions happening here and nobody really knows about it,” said Britton Caillouette, director of “Blue Heart”, a documentary that focuses on efforts to halt the hydropower plans. “Blue Heart”, which had its world premiere on Saturday in a screening at the Idbar dam near Konjik, focuses on local people’s and campaigners’ efforts to halt the plans. Investment in renewable energy projects is growing around the world as countries rush to meet clean energy goals under the Paris Agreement on climate change. The EU aims to source at least 27 percent of the bloc’s energy from renewables by 2030. Western Balkan countries, including Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia, plan to invest billions of euros in building new coal-fired plants to meet rising demand for electricity as old plants are being phased out. Hydropower is already widely used across the region but environmentalists fear the investment in coal could backfire as governments may be forced to invest hundreds of millions of euros more to upgrade plants to meet European Union environmental standards as the countries progress toward membership of the bloc. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is funding some hydropower projects in the Balkans and has agreed to foster a transition towards sustainable, low-carbon economies int the region. Ulrich Eichelmann, head of campaign group RiverWatch, said clean energy such as hydropower, could have negative effects on the environment. “Just because it doesn’t emit CO2 it doesn’t mean it’s good,” Eichelmann told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The small-scale nature of most of the projects in the Balkans is particularly damaging  because water is diverted through pipelines, leaving empty channels where rivers used to be and causing loss of fauna and erosion, a 2017 report by consultancy Fluvius said. The report said more than a third of the planned dams are to be built in protected areas, including some in national parks. “With the deluge of proposed hydropower dams and diversions in the Balkan peninsula we are looking at what could be irreversible environmental destruction, but there is very little awareness of this issue in Europe or globally,” said Ryan Gellert, general manager, EMEA, of outdoor clothing company Patagonia, which backed the film financially. The U.S. company has been backing environmental causes for a long time and recently joined a lawsuit challenging plans by the Trump administration to alter national monuments, federal land that is protected from development.

2018-04-28,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia’s ruling party will not put up a candidate for prime minister, it said on Saturday, in a bid to ease tensions after more than two weeks of street protests against the ruling elite. Demonstrations against the party and official corruption forced Serzh Sarksyanm, a former president, to resign as prime minister last Monday and parliament is due to pick a new one on May 1. While its majority in parliament means it should be able to choose who that is, the Republican Party has decided not to put forward its own candidate. “By not putting forward a candidate, we will avoid confrontation and an increase in security risks,” party spokesman Eduard Sharmazanov told reporters. “We are not putting anyone forward in the state’s interest.”  Protest leader Nikol Pashinyan, a member of parliament who describes himself as “the people’s choice”, has said parliament should elect him prime minister next week. He then wants snap parliamentary polls under a new election law. On Saturday he called on supporters to continue protests and to organise big, non-violent demonstrations in the capital Yerevan on May 1. “All protest actions, actions of civil disobedience, should be renewed with new force. The victory of the people must be recognised,” Pashinyan, 42, told a rally in the town of Ijevan. With the Republican Party’s 58 seats in the 105-seat parliament, Pashinyan is unlikely to be elected without their support. However, the second biggest party in parliament, Prosperous Armenia, hinted it might support him. “My team and I will vote for a people’s candidate, whether it’s Nikol Pashinyan or anyone else nominated by the people,” party leader Gagik Tsarukyan told Kentron TV. A junior coalition member, the Dashnaktsutyun Party, said this week it was quitting the government and favoured an early election, but it was unclear whether it would vote for Pashinyan who has a history of political activism and opposition. Although the demonstrations have been peaceful, the upheaval has threatened to destabilise Armenia, an ally of Russia, in a volatile region riven by Armenia’s decades-long, low-level conflict with neighbouring Azerbaijan. The next parliamentary elections are not due until 2022. But if parliament fails twice to elect a new prime minister with majority support, early elections must be held.

2018-04-28,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania has approached the African Development Bank (AfDB) to finance a 2,100-megawatt (MW) hydroelectric plant in a World Heritage site renowned for its animal population, despite concerns from conservationists. The East African nation considers the project at Stiegler’s Gorge in the UNESCO-designated Selous Game Reserve to be vital in its bid to diversify its energy mix and end chronic electricity shortages. The project would more than double the country’s power generation capacity.  But critics say securing financing for it could prove difficult because construction of a dam on a major river that runs through the Selous Game Reserve could affect wildlife and their habitats downstream. Tanzania’s finance ministry said in a statement on Saturday that President John Magufuli, who is personally pushing the long-delayed project, made the financing request to AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina during talks in Tanzania’s administrative capital Dodoma over the weekend.  The AfDB confirmed that it was reviewing Magufuli’s request  but did not say how much the project would cost.  “President Magufuli is very committed to ensure that the country industrializes, but you cannot industrialize unless you have access to electricity,” Adesina told journalists on Saturday after his talks with the president.  “The president is very keen to talk to us about the Stiegler’s Gorge project ... he mentioned that to us and we are going to be looking at that with him and the government, but we are also very keen to look at other alternative sources of energy.” Adesina said the AfDB plans to work with the Tanzanian government to develop integrated power projects with the private sector. Tanzania’s Finance and Planning Minister Philip Mpango said on Saturday that East Africa’s third-biggest economy was also seeking a $200 million loan from the AfDB to build a new airport in Dodoma, and additional financing for the construction of roads.  The government invited bids in August for the Stiegler’s Gorge project and hopes construction work will begin as early as July.  Covering 50,000 sq km, the Selous Game Reserve is one of the largest protected areas in Africa, according to UNESCO. It is known for its elephants, black rhinos and giraffes, among many other species.

2018-04-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German business leaders voiced disappointment on Saturday over the outcome of talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump, saying they feared he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The United States imposed import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in March, but it provided a temporary exemption until May 1 for the European Union. Trump will decide then whether to make the exemption permanent. “I regret the fact that the chancellor’s visit to Washington produced no palpable progress on the contentious issues between Germany and the United States,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI industry body. Merkel and Trump aired differences over trade and NATO on Friday at a White House meeting where they tried to put on a show of warmth and friendship. During a joint news conference, Trump lamented his country’s trade deficit with the EU. Merkel said any decision on whether to exempt the bloc from tariffs permanently was now in the president’s hand. “The threatened tariffs remain a major burden on transatlantic relations,” added Kempf. French President Emmanuel Macron also pressed Trump on trade during a three-day state visit in the same week as Merkel’s quick trip. Neither leader appeared to have made progress convincing Trump to make the exemptions permanent. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the EU will be exempted from the unfair U.S. tariffs,” said Volker Treier of the DIHK industry and commerce chambers.

2018-04-28,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Saturday a  mounting trade spat between the United States and China was one of the most pressing worries for Southeast Asian nations as their leaders echoed the concern over rising protectionism.  Lee flagged his concerns in remarks made as he opened a summit of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), for many of which the United States and China are the top two trading partners. “In particular, the recent trade tensions between the U.S. and China are worrying concerns,” he said. Singapore occupies the group’s rotating chair for this year.  “We are deeply concerned over the rising tide of protectionism and anti-globalisation sentiments,” said a statement issued on behalf of the ASEAN chair at the end of summit talks. The U.S. Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing has vowed retaliation against American exports. On Saturday Lee said the open and rules-based multilateral trading system, which has backed the growth of ASEAN, has come under pressure as the political mood in many countries has shifted against free trade. There was little progress on the push to resolve the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, despite a fresh plea by ASEAN leaders for Myanmar to implement the recommendations of an international panel. The situation in Myanmar’s western state of Rakhine, where hundreds of thousands of minority Rohingya Muslims have fled for neighbouring Bangladesh after a military crackdown, is one of the biggest challenges facing the ASEAN group. Lee said negotiations for a code of conduct in the South China Sea had started last month between ASEAN and China, and there was hope for an early conclusion. Four ASEAN member states have claims to the disputed South China Sea, one of the world’s most volatile hotspots and one of its busiest waterways.  “We emphasised the importance of non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities by claimants and all other states...that could further complicate the situation and escalate tensions in the South China Sea,” the chair’s statement said. ASEAN, formed more than half a century ago, has struggled with challenges facing the region because it works by consensus and is reluctant to get involved in matters considered internal to its members. Singapore is this year’s chair of the bloc, which includes Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam. The group is working on initiatives to jointly tackle the threat of extremism and cyber attacks, as well as to promote trade and cross-border e-payment systems. Meanwhile ASEAN welcomed Friday’s summit meeting of the two Koreas and their pledge to work for peace and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, as well as the plans for U.S. President Donald Trump to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Lee said Singapore has not had any request to host the Kim-Trump meeting, despite reports that the island state is on a short-list of potential venues for the talks expected in June.

2018-04-28,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Saturday it had scrambled military jets to intercept a Chinese aircraft that had entered the South’s air defence territory, less that two months after Seoul officially lodged a complaint over another incursion. The Chinese aircraft was believed to be a military reconnaissance plane and spent nearly four hours in the Korea Air Defence Identification Zone, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. It would be at least the third such incident this year. South Korea summoned the Chinese ambassador in February to formally complain. China’s Defence Ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Saturday, the start of a long holiday weekend. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said in February the flights were completely in line with international law and practice and that “air defence identification zones are not territorial air space”. China’s air force is increasingly active far from the country’s shores, including flying missions into the Western Pacific that often pass through a southern Japanese island chain and around self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own. China generally says that it has no hostile intent.  However the government has said drills near Taiwan are aimed at sending the democratic island the message that there will be consequences if it tries to push for formal independence.
